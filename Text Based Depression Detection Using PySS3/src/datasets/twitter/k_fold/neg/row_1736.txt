Don't really have a need or want to continue onI don't have a reason to stick around.
Ending it all seems like the best idea but why can't I follow through with it. I know exactly how I want to end it.
Is that sad it wrong?
I've forever felt like and alien here I don't fit in anywhere. After all these years of 
"self-improvement" the only thing I learned is I wish I would have stayed ignorant to the world around me. Everything sucks, work sucks, relationship suck. Maybe it's my hobbies or is my attitude that shit that everything avoids me.

If I end my life yea people will be sad for a little but not for long. Then everyone will continue on like nothing happened and that's ok.

I'm sorry I failed at life. Sorry for that family I won't  have sorry current family for not living up expectations sorry society for not fitting your rules and falling in line like everyone else. 

Maybe would have went to college or talked to that one girl my life would have been different or maybe I'm wrong maybe I'd have 90k in student debt working a dead end job or end up in a shitty relationship.
Is it adhd and depression I don't know. Therapy was useless waste of time and money. 

Edit: I'm being proven again that I'm a waste of space. I think I'll quit my job next week and get that ball rolling.
