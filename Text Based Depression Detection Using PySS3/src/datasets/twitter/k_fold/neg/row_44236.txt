I think tomorrows my dayI dont even feel alive already i feel empty in pain broken walking feels like im a puppet being walked im constanly blanking out losing all thought my smiles are fake my laughs are fake i lost the most importsnt part of my life, my girl she was...and still is everything in this world my perfect fucking match 2 fucking yesrs and now shes gone...like i cant live with that pain she left me because i wasnt being right to her cause of my depression, i lost it all man my mom is emotionally abusive my dad is a hardass who makes me think every little thing i do is a fuck-up. After she left i started smoking pot everyday, j even have a possession charge now,  im popping pills and shit like i dont think i can do it anymore...sorry guys but i think tomorrow my day.
