I'm just tired of trying and facing the same shitI'm doing my best and i really try not to over think about everything but it seems i can't control my mind. I experience panic attacks like every 2 days and it's getting hard to control the pain. I'm not suicidal at all and that's why I'm always trying, but sometimes i just feel lost. I just feel confused and i don't know what to do. And the thought of ending everything kinda satisfy me.
