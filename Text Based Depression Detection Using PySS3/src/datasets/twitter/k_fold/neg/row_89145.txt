The. ButterflyBesides two sharp objects we're impailed to my core of Spain leaving me with the consequences that the lack of energy and enthusiasm and mind would bit by bit make me break apart cuz I no longer had control over life after being impailed and I'm sure there was a cosmic will under it saying you must diminish from existence ...in the worst way 
Let's not forget the two broken knees by chance again that they also created a different reality for me it's all written on the spirit and the energy body how a critical damage takes everything from you even a alternative reality of hell is waiting for you that you don't know 
And hey 
The butterfly s fly forever now not just these two they were made by other butterfly's from family 
So overall 
Everyone else had a choice but after studying the flaws inside my will caused by surgery the will to act then it was too late , I wish I was never borned , and I didn't wanted to I'm sure I would never want something like this if I were to see things in my early life before I come here I'm sure I wouldn't
So it wasn't my choice 
Life was just a sick joke
