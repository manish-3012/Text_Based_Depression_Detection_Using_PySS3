What should I do if I feel more surely every day that gender dysphoria is driving me towards suicide?I'm a twenty-something male, but I'm trans or whatever inside. I usually go for weeks at a time without looking at my own reflection. Its less that I feel like I won't, and more because I feel like I can't. Seeing my reflection makes me so depressed that I break down completely. I brush my teeth in the dark. I feel like this is pretty pathetic and weak, given my level of privilege and opportunity in this world. I wish i could just face the world and myself, knowing that we're all just here, that we have to make do with what we have, and that I should be happy for just being able to be alive, but I know I'll never be able to. I know it's just going to get worse, too, as I age. I've become a shut-in. 

Everytime time I walk across a bridge I think about jumping off it. Deep down, I've already forseen my eventual suicide. I guess the worst thing is not having anyone to ever talk about it with. Anyone I've ever tried to come clean about it to always just seems to kinda cut off contact after some period of awkwardness. I've been desperate for a long time to just have any friends that are girls that can see through me, and don't mind hanging out with me. I feel like I'm perceived as some weird barfly that's trying to get laid every time i try and make platonic friends.

I can't transition. Maybe I'm a coward and weak for this, too, but its simply that my life is such that its not possible. I don't really know why I'm here right now, trying to drown in vanity and my first world problems, maybe. I saw my reflection today in a window on my way home and lost my shit for awhile. Came home crying and lied in the fetal position for awhile. I think I'm desperate to die and I can't even talk about it with anyone in my life. Wtf should I do? Thank you.
