Restricted Area SuicideDepression is all to familiar and I just want to talk about how I  think about killing myself. I used to want to use a shot gun, quick and easy, messy as all hell though, then I went into fantasy realm by thinking I could hire a hitman to kill me with a long distance sniper shot right in my brain stem. Not possible, but the next that came to mind, is driving a motorcycle right into Area 51 restricited zone where they shoot on site, seems like a sound plan, but I dont know if they really would kill me or just shoot me off the bike. Idk i just needed to type this awful shit thays stuck in my head, thank you for reading my bullshit.
