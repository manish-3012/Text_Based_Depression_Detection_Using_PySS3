This is it. I can't procrastinate anymore. Tonight I'm clocking out for good.No reason to try anymore. I've seen enough of the world to know it's not worth it to stay another 60/70 years. Not to mention I can't pay my car bill so that's gone, and since my car's gone, so is my job. And with my job gone a whole other mess of problems. My parents are furious at me because of it to add shit to the pile. I guess I might as well enjoy my final commute to my final shift on my final day of living. Thank you all for your support over the many years I have struggled with chronic suicidality.
