My 12 year old sister is a ticking time bombI live in a very privileged family, my sister gets everything she's ever asked for so I'm unsure how a 12 year old could be so incredibly unhappy.

She makes up fake personas for herself usually abused boys and acts as them online.

She is constantly lying about the smallest things and no matter who asks her in any sort of manner, doctors, family, therapists, etc.. She will never come forth with the truth.

On top of not knowing how she's feeling because of this,  she acts completely normal at home. She acts like the regular happy go lucky 12 year old, except maybe a bit too sensitive.

She's actually way too sensitive, she will explode and break down and cry or shut down over the smallest thing.

She was in the hospital for suicidal thoughts a few weeks ago, and now she is back again.

If they can't change her mindset I don't know what will happen, no amount of reassurance from us her family, no amount of money, no amount of support we give her she's too stubborn to change and she's too youngto realize that 

Life is very beautiful and precious, this might be the wrong subreddit to say that on but it's what I feel and believe

She doesn't listen to anything, she takes medication for depression, it's all just spiraling downward.

With her impulsive/irradiate and over emotional behavior I feel like she would take her life if she were triggered enough.

She's in the mental hospital again today for mentioning suicide to someone at her middle school...

I feel hopeless and that maybe it's best to start mourning her now, nothing we do works.

Maybe it is best for her to stay in the hospital but they didn't seem to help her last time.

Sorry for the rant /r/suicidewatch, I needed to get it off my mind and maybe someone here has been through something similar.

Why would a 12 year old want to take her life so badly...
