I've decided this is my last week.I've had enough. I'm making sure my animals are looked after and then I'm ending it. 

I'm sick of my horrible, toxic family. I'm sick of the gaslighting and backstabbing. 

I'm sick of being stuck at home with no money and no one to love me.

I'm sick of being a 35 year old failure who is trapped and has no options. 

Nothing good will ever come of me and I just want to the pain to stop.
