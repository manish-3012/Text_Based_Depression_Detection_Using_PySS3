Maybe it's possible to fix my life, but not for me.I'm too tired to even do basic things. There is no way that I can accomplish everything I need to in order to get back on the right track. Everyone says that you shouldn't kill yourself because there's always hope, and maybe there would be if they were in my position, but I didn't get here by being a functioning human being.
