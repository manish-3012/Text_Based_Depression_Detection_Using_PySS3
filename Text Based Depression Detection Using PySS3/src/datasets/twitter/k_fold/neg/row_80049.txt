Never had a day in my life in which I didnâ€™t consider deathI donâ€™t know if thereâ€™s a day in my life in which I didnâ€™t consider killing myself and/or dying. Iâ€™ve contemplated killing myself or generally fantasized dying for what seems like every single day ever since whatever working memory Iâ€™ve had developed.

I donâ€™t recall a single day where I thought I could deal with being alive. I have no desire to go on yet I donâ€™t know how to actually finish the deed and actually off myself.

Iâ€™m so sad and lonely and I know no one actually benefits from my existence. I am a drain on the world and my environment and on everyone around me.
