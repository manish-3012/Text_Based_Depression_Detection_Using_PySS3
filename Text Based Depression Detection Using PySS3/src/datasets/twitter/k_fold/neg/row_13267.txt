God dammit. I really thought I could be strong enough.My wife left me and threw me out, essentially on the street.  At the last minute, my parents reluctantly allowed me to come stay for a while. So I grabbed a bag with a couple changes of clothes, showed up at their pig sty, cleaned it up, and now I'm being treated like a burden because their dog doesn't like me. 

I don't even have any friends I could turn to.  I lost them all during my marriage, drifting apart as I gave everything I had to a family I lost. There are no shelters in this bumfuck county.  I have no transportation. The only couple family members I have left live several states away.  And I can't afford my own place. Not on the spot like this. 

So, I quit.  I've come back from the teetering edge of suicide too many times to reject its inevitability anymore.  There's no one within a hundred miles I could turn to and I'm tired of fighting it.  I'm just too tired. 

I've been too numb, too dead inside to eat lately.  I figure it wouldn't be terribly hard to slip into a drunken coma. And if that won't work, my hypoglycemia will eventually kill me.  

I thought I would be more scared, or depressed.  Nope.  I feel like I'm finally being let out of prison. I'm finally free.
