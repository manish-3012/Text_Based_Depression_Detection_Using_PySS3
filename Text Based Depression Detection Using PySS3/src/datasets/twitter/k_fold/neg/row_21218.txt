If I lose my job tomorrow I will feel suicidalI'm being honest. I have a performance review tomorrow which I'm totally stressed out about. If I do lose my job tomorrow I'm going to have those suicidal feelings all over again. I literally had them a year ago when i felt I had mucked my career up. I told myself that I had to get this new job and it had to work. I'm now feeling that it won't and that I'll have a reoccurrence of how I felt last year and I will want to kill myself.
