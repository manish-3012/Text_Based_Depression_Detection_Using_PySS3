Nobody Caresi could tell everyone i was going to swallow a bottle of pills and no one would believe me. i could tell them i was jumping off of a bridge and they wouldnâ€™t believe a word i say. everyone just thinks iâ€™m some kind of happy go lucky jokester who has it all figured out but iâ€™m not. iâ€™m a fucking mess and nobody cares. everytime i cry out for help iâ€™m met with silence. iâ€™m done living like this.
