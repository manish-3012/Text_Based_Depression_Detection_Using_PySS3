I keep wishing there was a suicide button on my desk that could kill me as soon as i pressed it.You may wonder why I would want such a thing.

In school there are 2 kinds of people, the good and the bad. I am one of the good ones, however due to my thoughts I have been suffering greatly.

Not only am I being laughed at all the time, but I made the worst mistake of having feelings for another boy in my year group, and it is painful for me to know that I will never be with him and that he is too cute for a boy like me. It hurts and I want it all to stop.

Sure you may say "don't you have friends to talk to" and while I do, one of them is in the same boat as me and has even tried slitting her wrists and failed, my other friend is acting strangely towards me as of recent and that's possibly my fault too.
