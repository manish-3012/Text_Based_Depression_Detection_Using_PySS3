2 daysI have 2 days to find $400 to pay my roommateâ€™s part of the rent or weâ€™re evicted... if that happens, iâ€™m not gonna see sunday. 

Things were looking good... just started a new job tuesday... first job since november... iâ€™ve been selling my things for my part of the rent (with my brother covering me every now and then while i job hunt.) i have no more important worldly posessions... if we get evicted iâ€™ll miss work and get fired... this is it for me... 

Important facts:
I have way low credit (417 i think)
Nothing to sell
No wifi for working at home
Barely any gas money for work
Iâ€™m a Paranoid Schizophrenic
