The reliefIâ€™ve finally decided to stop fighting. Everyone talks about how strong and resilient I am but they never check in on me, they never help me even when they can see how much I have to cope with. They all just coo and tell me how brave I am. Iâ€™m not brave. 

I just canâ€™t wait to let go of all my responsibilities, all the people Iâ€™m responsible for, Iâ€™ve been left to deal with everything, now itâ€™s someone elseâ€™s turn. 

I feel free. I know how much each Suicide costs our economy so I see it as my final act of rebellion. Life is a trap, free yourself
