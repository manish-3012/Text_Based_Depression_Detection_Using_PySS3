Should I talk about it to friends, if I'm going to commit suicide?Should I talk about it to friends, even if I'm certain I'm going to commit suicide?


I have serious psycological issues. Right now things aren't **that** bad emotionally speaking because my issues have gotten so bad, my brain has subconsciously gone into mode where I'm emotionally numb. I don't feel sad, down and in despair anymore.

Regardless I am going to commit suicide.

Even though my biggest 'life goal' is committing suicide, I feel like talking to someone IRL so badly, but I am extremely against talking to most people, like:

* Family
* Doctors/Therapist, even suicide hotlines

* Male friends (because it's emasculating to cry about my problems to guys and none of my M friends are the supportive type at all)
* Or to any adults really (Although I am 20yo student!)

I want to talk to someone about all this, but here are my two issues:

1. Most importantly, I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings. Opening up to friends about my issues puts a lot of pressure on them to help and support me.

 And on top of that I'm still pretty hell-bent on committing suicide. I don't want to have someone else through all this, and then still go through the grief of my suicide if I do commit.

 I am not sure I should dump my issues on other people.

1. I'm not sure who to dump my issues on. All my closest friends are guys. I tried talking to some, but all I got back is a "that sounds bad, good luck" and the conversation just moved on.



 There are a few friends in one of my social circles I think I can talk to. But the thing is, between my memory loss and unsociableness and other issues, I have kept a bit of a distance, so I'm not close friends with them at all. Just ordinary friends.

So, what should I do?

Any and all opinions welcome!
