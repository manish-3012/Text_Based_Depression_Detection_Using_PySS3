I've fallen so far and I'm about to give up on trying to get outWall of text coming, but I gotta get this out.

Growing up feels like it was all a bad dream. Between multiple divorces between both of my birth parents. Seeing both sets constantly fight with each other and their new spouses, I've had bad memories engrained since childhood. I guess the first one I've personally experienced was with my dad and his 2nd spouse. One weekend I was at my mom's house on visitation (my dad has custody of me), everything was normal. She brought me back to my dad's house, only, instead of my dad and stepmom at the door to greet me, it was my dad. I asked where she went. My dad said she left. To the store, I had asked, completely ignorant to the fighting that would happen between the two when I wasn't around. My dad said no, she's not coming back. She took my baby (half-)brother and left. I was only like 7 or 8 at the time, in 3rd grade. I legit cried for 2 hours straight, and broke down around the time of state mandated testing (i had a classmate whom the teacher was her mom, and when she called her mom, I broke down in class). Time went on and I continued strong in school, all A's all the time, through advanced and honors classes, with occasional slip ups when I would lose motivation, remembering the past.

At some point during high school, my mom and her spouse (whom she cheated on my dad with when I was still 1 year old, but have been together since. Her spouse was like a dad to me when I was over at her place) got into a loud argument that had me, and my half brother and half sister from her side rush into their bedroom. I saw that they started arguing, and my sister had previously told me that they had been arguing a lot lately and she overheard them talking about getting a divorce. I had sorta ignored those claims in disbelief.  Seeing the two of them fighting brought up the memory of the day when my stepmom left, and I immediately just broke down in a crying rage in the middle of the room. The two of them immediately stopped arguing, seeing me, the most calm and best behaved child of the family, suddenly just burst out, threw them off. I don't really remember much more from that.  Eventually, they got the divorce and my mom moved out into an apartment with my brother and sister. I'll get back to this later.

About half a year to a year after my dad and stepmom broke up, my dad met his current spouse in the same complex his job at the time was located. She had 3 kids of her own, a son with autism about a week and a half younger than me, a daughter only 5 months younger than my sister, and a son only a month younger than my half brother from my dad's side. Growing up was hell, cause she overprotected her kids and highly showed favortism towards them, often with me getting in trouble for things they did. Eventually she mellowed out and saw things for what they were and got them in line and behaving (with my dad's help). Anyways, a while after my mom and her spouse got their divorce, my dad and his current spouse started getting into heated arguments, which resulted in my dad and I moving out and back in TWICE in the span of a year or two. I pretty much at that point was a complete wreck, somehow still managing to keep up grades in school. The two of them eventually came to terms and  everything is fine and stable between them now.

Back to my mom and siblings in the apartment. Over time the relationship between my mom and sister got pretty bad. My sister had hit her teenage years and was getting pretty rebellious and, with my mom not being exactly mentally stable, it didn't help. We found out the reason she and her spouse had broken up was because she was basically cheating on him with another lady (mind you, at the time, both sides of my family were VERY closed minded about this sort of thing). My mom was constantly going out, leaving my sister and I (when I was there on visitation) basically running the apartment while she was gone. At some point, it was either valentine's day or my sister's birthday, can't remember which and I was on visitation with my mom. My sister locked herself up in her room at our grandparent's place, being in a bad mood about the divorce and other things. My mom was sorta being really naggy at my sister that day and I tried to stand up to her, only to have her snap at me and threaten me. On the way back to her apartment, more of the old bad memories came up and I broke down in the car. My mom pulled over and took us to the park set in the apartment complex to try to talk to us. She sat us all seperately and started talking to each of us in turn. While she was talking to my brother or sister, my crying turned into a focused anger towards my mom, with me coming to the realization that a lot of the sadness that had happened in my life was because of her. I got up and started walking through the complex back to the apartment. My mom saw and came and grabbed me by the shoulder. Now, I've never been the one to fight or cause problems, I was always the quiet one, never really doing anything besides reading or playing video games, so I've never been in a fight. But at that moment, when she grabbed me, I just instinctively twisted her arm and we got into a small fight, nothing crazy, just a grapple fest. I was so pissed. Growing up, I've pretty much always bottled my emotions, mostly cause my dad was the kind of person who thought showing emotion was weak and not a "manly" thing to do. But at that point, I couldn't bottle anyting else up, and I just blew my top. At that point, my sister stepped in and seperated us. My brother and mom went back in the car and drove around the complex back to the apartment. My sister and I, on the other hand, walked back in an attempt to calm me down. I was shaking so hard I couldn't even unlock my phone at the time to call my dad and stepdad to let them know what happened. It was saturday, so my dad was at my grandparents place (from his side), having a domino night. My dad was pretty shaken by hearing what my sister and I said on the call, cause after the fact my family over there even noticed my dad was not right. He was about to rush over to my mom's apartment to pick me up, but I told him no, at that point I was just thinking about watching over my siblings.

Over all these years, probably since high school, I would get into highs and lows, but the lows would always be lower than the last, and and the higher the highs, the harder the crash into the lows. I graduated high school with AB-honor roll (placed 36 out of like 300 gradutates,including AP and dual enrollment students) and got accepted into UCF with the Bright Futures scholarship (covering 80-90%, Pell grand covering the rest, and excess into my new bank account). Throughout all that time though, especially during the lows, I always had the thought of just ending it. Tying a rope, slitting a vein/artery, jumping headfirst off  the roof of the house, never had the guts to do it, which just adds to my self loathing and bitterness. Finished my first semester at college pretty well. The second semester was when issues started. My laptop (which was, at the time 7+ years old) was pretty much dying, and I was doing everyting I can to keep it working (replacing parts, installing Linux cause windows got corrupted, etc). Eventually my dad forced me to get a job, mostly because his spouse kept bitching at him at how I was an adult and not working and just relaxing at home during the weekends. So eventually I got a job at waffle house for Friday-Sunday, to try to get some money to replace my laptop, only one caveat, I had to give about $200 a month to them to help out with bills and groceries (with me keeping maybe like, $100 at the end of the month to myself after food and stuff). I eventually replaced the laptop, but between working and school, my grades slipped just enough (to just 0.01 under the gpa requirement) for financial aid and I got cut off from both Pell and bright futures. At that point I didn't know what to do. I couldnt tell my dad and his spouse, they were basically religious about grades, and I was placed on a pedestal by my family all my life for being so "smart" and being the first one to actually go to college and graduate (my dad dropped out, his sibilngs never went to college). Anyways, I couldn't tell them that I lost financial aid. At the same time, at one point, my 2nd stepmom basically guilted me into keeping on working, we were talking in the car about something, and she was saying that basically that I was helping a bunch, but if work was getting too much, that then thats fine but my dad would have to work even harder and do even more overtime to keep up with bills and such. Me, being a people pleaser and the kind of person who can't help resisting ones in need, basically just kept working. I ended up to keep working at waffle house, and eventually went from door choir to waiter to try to earn more money. I ended up taking a student loan to try to keep going to class to try to get my degree. But my grades kept slipping. Especially in math, which used to be one of my best subjects, now I won't go into detail, but for lower level math courses, the university basically has you slave in what could be a prison in which you do nothing but math for 3 hours straight a week as a requirement. I can't do that. With math, I basically flip back and forth between it and other things to keep from being overwhelmed and to keep calm. So I pretty much couldn't focus at all during that time and eventually gave up going at all, even though it was a requirement. I kept working and my grades kept on slipping semester after semester, with lack of sleep and time to try to study and do homework being the main culprits, but I had to keep working to support the household.  Eventually I went on probation because my grades got too low, and flunked out the following semester. No one knows this, not my best friends, my closests friends, and family. This is the first time I've talked about it. I've been going for a year and a half, amost 2 now, pretending to still be going to college, because I'm afraid to tell anyone. I'm afraid, I don't trust anyone. I ended up defaulting on my loans, and have collectors on my ass, again no one knows. I've gotten so good at lying to my parent's face, that they can't even tell I'm lying. They believe I'm currently taking online classes, albeit little by little part time, continuing my studies, but I'm not. Just today and yesterday, I got ad letters in the mail from different attourney offices, both mentioning that apparently my collectors have filed a lawsuit on me. And now I'm at wits end. I don't know what to do now, I don't doubt the letters, I've given up on paying the loans because a good chunk of my money now (about 2/3rds of what I make, currently working at home depot) goes to the house, incuding paying the whole electricity bill and groceries. The last third goes to paying my phone bill and personal needs like food and such.

Earlier this year, I got hit by a car while crossing the crosswalk, walking to work. Ended up with a torn ligament in my shoulder, a lump on my head, and very light damage to the occipital lobe of my brain, even after being tosssed 15+ feet from the collision. My dad was out of town at the time, picking up my 2nd stepmom up from the airport after she dropped her dad off back in her home country. I called him, called out of work, and called 911. Went to the hospital and was given painkillers and  stuff, was told I would be fine with some rest. I ended up making a claim on the guy who hit me's insurance with help from an attourney, and got the treatment I needed. Sometimes, though, especially now, I wish the collision killed me. I wish that I didn't hang on, or that I wasn't so strong willed to live. At the hospital, my mom's side caught wind from my sister, who was told by my manager that I was at the hospital. They all showed up, my dad, on the other hand, told me not to let anyone from his side know. Anyways, I'm sitting in the ER with just some road rash and a lump on my head (from what we could see at the time), surrounded by family. And I started crying. Not because of the pain, because I felt none, not from the shock. But because I felt bad for making them worry about me. I don't deserve their worry. I don't deserve their love. I've been lying to each and every one of their faces for years, and none of them know. I sometimes just want to disappear, just vanish, or just suddenly wake up and be gone from this bad dream. Just now, while writing this, I've been having the though to go to the kitchen, grab a knife, and just end it with a prick, or just grab my bedsheets and tie them off tight. But I know I won't. I'm a coward with ideas and no drive. My drive left me long ago. I just go with the flow and try to cause the least amount of trouble, so when the time comes, no one will miss or notice when my time comes.
