Tried last night with pillsCan't remember too much of what happened besides taking a ton of extra strength Tylenol and acetaminophen. I texted the crisis hotline posted here after my arms and legs went numb and they called the police. Afyer an hour long anbulance ride I was given charcoal fllavored with cherry (disgusting btw) and sent to toxicology. Spent until three a.m. throwing up pitch black vomit and bile until I was just dry heaving. 

Now they are looking for an open bed nearby after I was pretty much forced to admit myself (either that or involuntary). Now I'm just nervous about my first time in an adult ward. What's it going to be like? 

Sorry about the rant I'm not exactly mentally organized right now.
