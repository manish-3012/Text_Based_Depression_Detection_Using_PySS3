201XI used to lurk around this sub for an unknown amount of time before I actually made my own reddit account. I was too scared to post anything because I thought Iâ€™d be swarmed by the generic â€œthink about your friends and familyâ€  / â€œpermanent solution temporary problemâ€ comments. I still lurk around the other â€œsadâ€ subs because it seems like youâ€™re placed on thin ice with each comment you make.
 A few years ago, think I made a stupid post asking about suicide methods as my very first post on this account then deleted it after a few hours. My memory is bad and continues to get worse. I donâ€™t know if it was this sub or not.
  Things have gotten better since then. Iâ€™m almost done with high school. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel again.
