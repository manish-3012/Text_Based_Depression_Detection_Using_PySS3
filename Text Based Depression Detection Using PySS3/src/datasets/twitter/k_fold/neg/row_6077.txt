It's been a while.Almost forgot I had this account. Can any of you relate to the feeling of taking steps backward? I feel like I put a ton of effort into making progress with my depression and bad habits, but then after one fuck up, I'm right back in this spot, wanting everything to end again. I have a hard time not blaming myself for these things when I really know better than to cause them. People around me feel obligated to help and/or feel responsible for my panicked decision to down pills but no matter what had happened I'm the one who took them. I really scared some of my friends this time, and the one I love. I think she felt the worst about it. Whatever it was I took made it almost impossible to tell what was real and what wasn't. Felt like I was dreaming, and I treated it like a dream at times so I was talking nonsense. I kept losing my train of thought before finishing my sentences, I kept forgetting where I was and what I was doing. She just watched with tears in her eyes. (It only occurred to me just now that I'm not even completely sure she was there. Could've imagined it.) It took a really long time but everything's worn off now. My best friend seems to just not wanna talk about it, maybe if we talk it'll feel too real to him. I think he just doesn't want to hurt. He told me I said bye to the girl but I don't remember it. I'm gonna cut it short here because I feel like I'm just gonna ramble. Thank you for reading and/or contributing to this sub at all. This sub has opened my eyes in many ways and helped tremendously.
