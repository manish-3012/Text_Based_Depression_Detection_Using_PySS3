How do I keep going onI really don't want to die. I just want to be happy and enjoy life. But I just don't see how that's possible. When things get hard I quit. I've hated all the jobs I've had, I end up quitting. I still live with family, but eventually I will need to move out and I will have to work, even if I hate my job. These past several years have been crap. I'm 21 years old and I thought by the time I reached this age things would be great. Life is just depressing, I don't see how I can keep this up for much longer.  Reddit is the only thing that helped, but lately no one responds to my post in Depression. I guess eventually I will have the courage to kill myself.
