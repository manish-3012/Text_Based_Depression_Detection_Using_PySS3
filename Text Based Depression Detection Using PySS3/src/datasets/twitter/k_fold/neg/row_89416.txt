All I think about is suicideI've been depressed for along time, I've never had a gf, never kissed a girl, I've been bullied physically and verbally.  I don't have any friends, this has been like this for my whole life.  I'm never going to go anywhere in life I'm just sick of living.  I usually spend my days drowning myself in porn and selfharm and thinking about how shitty my life is .  All I want to do is just put a gun to my head and and pull the trigger,  I don't know what to do at this point besides going through with suicide.
