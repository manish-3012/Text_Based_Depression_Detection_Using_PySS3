Week awayI picked a date to end this misery and torment I have been in

I watch tv, I exercise, I talk to a couple friends and they have no idea of how bad I am.

I've always been a good pretender at letting everyone think I was okay.

I'm not okay, my life has been turned upside down and soon I'll be homeless.

I live in constant physical pain, nothing helps..I am unloved. I have no living family left.

I can't work due to the pain, I get very little cash from the government per month, it's not enough to safely live on.

I pray to God that something will change for me but I think God has better things to do than listen to one broken down woman
