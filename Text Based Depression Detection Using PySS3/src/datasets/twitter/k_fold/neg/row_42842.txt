Life is nothing but a looooong slog and I'm tired of caringI used to want to kill myself because I thought I was worthless and had no value I thought no one would ever love me. Now I know that isn't true my life has value i have the greatest girlfriend on earth and I am a good person. Now I'm just exausted I feel like I'm in a constant daze can't feel anything it's like I'm seeing life through a window. I am exausted and don't want to keep doing this year after year. Only reason I haven't is because of her she would be so distraught and I can't do that to her but something has to give.
