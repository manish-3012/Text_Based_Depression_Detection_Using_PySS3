Tired of living but scared of dyingIâ€™ve had a rough couple of years and Iâ€™m exhausted. Itâ€™s 1 step forward and 20 steps back. I am trying so hard but canâ€™t seem to ever move forward. The only thing that makes me happy is sleeping and staying home just relaxing, knitting, or watching tv. My best friend passed away last year and it really fucked with me. I never thought about death so much until then. I want to have everything stop and just get a break. I want to have this end but Iâ€™m scared of whatâ€™s to come once it ends. Iâ€™m not a religious person and donâ€™t know what I believe happens to us after we are gone. I think what I fear is who has to find me. I donâ€™t want my family to have to see me like that and have always said that I want to be cremated and not put on display. 

I fear leaving my husband behind. He has been my rock and I seriously donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d do without him. I fear for the pain that will get left behind because I want my pain to end. 

I wish there was a simpler way out. Leave behind no pain for others, no one to miss me, no one to grieve over me. I want to stop my own pain but donâ€™t want to inflict pain on others in the process. Iâ€™m at a loss for words and donâ€™t know where to go
