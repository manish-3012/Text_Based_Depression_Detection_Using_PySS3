Living is painIf thereâ€™s something I'm proud of then itâ€™s the fact that I'm still here writing this. Every morning I wake up, I have to constantly worry about so many things that it overwhelms me, I feel like I'm losing control over my own life. If every morning I wake up and have to constantly worry about so many things then I don't want to wake up anymore. 

I always see people with amazing talents or successful people and I admire all those people then I think back to myself â€what do I have?. Iâ€™m not handsome nor rich, I don't have any special talents, I can't draw or sing. Men, I can't even wash my clothes let alone singing or anythingâ€. Why can't I be born with something unique? Why canâ€™t I be more competent? Why canâ€™t I be more confident?

I'm just tired. Tired of living. Tired with life. Tired with everything. And I just want to end all of it. All those pain, all those suffering, all those mistakes that people laughed at me. I can do that with a knife to my throat and thatâ€™s it, I'm free. Free from all those suffering yet I can't. I canâ€™t bring myself to do it. Am such a coward, arenâ€™t I ?

Edit: I'm not a native English speaker so I apologize for my poor grammar. I just want to vent it out
