I'm done with trying to make something of myselfI know that I have things to live for, that things will get better if I stick with it, but seriously life just freaking sucks. I just found out my girlfriend is cheating on me, my only friend ditched our plans to watch the NFL games today for who knows what, and I'm freaking the fuck out because if I don't pass accounting this semester I'll be barred from graduating with any sort of business degree from my university. I literally have 0 ambition for anything right now, I have no idea what I want to do or how I'm going to do it. I hate how everyone on facebook is getting married, having kids, starting great careers, and I'm just barely getting by. I just hate myself right now and I don't even care about fixing myself and that makes it even worse. Somebody please help I don't know how much longer I can hold on :(
