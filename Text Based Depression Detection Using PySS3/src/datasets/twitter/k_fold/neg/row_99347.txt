Iâ€™m closeSup yâ€™all!! 2nd time posting
So here recently, I found myself wanting to drink the contact solution spiked water (terrible at really â€œcleaningâ€) until I realised that it wouldnâ€™t do shit; if you use it to clean shit that you put into your eyes, it wonâ€™t have harmful effects on you.
Back on track, Iâ€™m trying to improve certain aspects of my life, but that feeling never goes away. Like, that feeling of â€œthis is not a life worth livingâ€ and Iâ€™m aware of the repercussions of what Iâ€™m wanting to do, but I still have that feeling of â€œI should do thisâ€. Idk maybe itâ€™s some weird subconscious complex that I deserve it?? Fuck if i know. All I know is that Iâ€™m getting tired of that feeling and just all feeling in general
