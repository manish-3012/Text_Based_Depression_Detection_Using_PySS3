Here's what I'm gonna do today TW 

Cry in my room, lie to my parents that I'm fine and it's just a cold, cut myself, cry because of the pain and then go to sleep while they're there thinking I'm studying  
 Hopefully I'll die from the bleeding in my sleep because I don't want to watch them see me in that condition, as I have no idea how I'd hide my cuts... also I'm trying to push myself away from my father as much as humanly possible...he's been sleeping in my room in the other bed and I'll try to make some excuse  to get him to go in the other room, since I'd need some time to get used to self-harming and work on how to hide them
