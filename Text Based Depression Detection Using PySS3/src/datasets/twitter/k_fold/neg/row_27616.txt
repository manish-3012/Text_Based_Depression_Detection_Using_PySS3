Today Is the Day...Today is the day that I have decided to end it. Nobody cares about me. Nobody will miss me except my mom but at least I won't be a burden on her anymore. People I thought were my friends have abandoned me. Act like I don't exist anymore. I reach out and and get no response. I'm the black sheep . The one everyone avoids. No friends. No job. No money. No home. About to be evicted in a few days. And now no life. Crazy how when I had my shit together that I was always the one to help people. To lend them a shoulder to cry on. An ear to listen to their problems. Some money to help them out through a tough time. I never asked for anything in return. I just loved being there for others because I knew that they needed someone to make them feel like they were worth it. Now I need someone and there is nobody there for me... It really is a dog eat dog cold world...

Tonight I take my last $20 and buy some cheap vodka, some pills and head up to the roof top of my building and I'm going to jump and hope this 10 story fall does it. It will probably be messy but oh well. I doubt I'll feel anything. Bright side is that at least I get to go out on my terms.
