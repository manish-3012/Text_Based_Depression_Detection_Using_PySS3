I want to kill myself, but i'm scared for how it might hurt my family.My parents in particular have had a turbulent past with suicide and i'm scared of affecting them with my death. It's been the only thing keeping me alive sometimes but it hasn't improved my feelings of numbness at all. I guess i'm really just getting this off my chest.
