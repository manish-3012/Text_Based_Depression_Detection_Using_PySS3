I will never be good enoughI absolutely hate the way I look. I am overweight, and apart from a brief period where I was anorexic, always have been.
I have never felt good enough.
I was raped for years as a young child, then I was raped again last year.
I have only ever loved one person. I told him everything that had happened to me and I felt safe with him. But the so called romance didn't last long because I was just a distraction for him whilst he waited for his ex girl friend to play the field and come back to him.
I feel like I was just tossed aside.

I feel like I've done nothing but try, try, try. Even my best effort isn't enough.

For a long time I've felt like I can't take it anymore. And tonight I snapped.
