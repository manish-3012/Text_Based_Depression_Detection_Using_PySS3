How close i amam tired of living, tired of being easy target for men because am trans, tired of alone, tired of cry, jobless, living with my parents. Sometimes i think of suicide methods that scares me, wouldnt mind sleep and never wake up. Actually i want to live but i cant change my life how hard i try. Am i close to suicide or how close i am? ðŸ˜­
