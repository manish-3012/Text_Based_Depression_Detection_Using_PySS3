I am doing everything right. I have a great job, a great girlfriend, I exercise frequently, I am on medication, I'm seeing a therapist. And I'm absolutely miserable.Really don't know what to do here. I mean, I find it difficult to justify in my mind that my life is going to get better. How is it going to get better? The drugs aren't working, the therapy is a joke, I can't get thoughts of suicide outside of my head. I mean, I really don't want to live the rest of my life this way, but I have always been of the opinion that manic depression is something that I will always struggle with and now that everything is going pretty well and I still find absolutely no joy in my life that doesn't include alcohol, I don't know what to think.

I am going to talk to my psychiatrist about ECT and atypical antidepressants. If they do not work, I will probably kill myself.
