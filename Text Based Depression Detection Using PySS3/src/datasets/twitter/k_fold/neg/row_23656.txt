I don't know why I keep opening up to my family members when every single person in this shitty family is either abusive or untrustworthyI opened up to my grandma about my abusive parents 20 minutes ago and her advice is the same "They're still your family, you should forgive them and love them because they provided food and shelter for you" bullshit that everyone else gives. I'm a fucking idiot for thinking it would be smart to talk to her about it anyway.
