How can my life possibly matter if there are billions of people on earth?Seriously, if I died today nothing would change about the world. Sure my family may be sad but they'd get over it eventually. As a matter of fact, I'm such a huge disappointment that my death would probably benefit the family. One less mouth to feed and one less person to worry about. Also, it's not like I have some hidden potential or will do anything that would actually make the world a better place. There are billions on this planet and trillions that lived before me and there will likely be trillions that live after me. What's the point? 

Like most people, my ultimate dream is to be happy and the occasional moments of happiness is the only reason I've tolerated life but I now realize that most of the times I've felt happy were an illusion. The happy moments of my life after 8th grade (before and during 8th grade I was ignorant and ignorance is bliss) have all been a distraction because there is only one constant in my life and that's sadness. If I'm doomed to live a life of sadness AND I'll have no meaningful impact then what's the point?
