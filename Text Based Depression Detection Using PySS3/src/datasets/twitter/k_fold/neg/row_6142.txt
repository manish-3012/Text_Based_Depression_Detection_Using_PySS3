Woohoo exam seasonSat down in the exam hall today, had a nosebleed from the stress of it, had a panic attack, left because I "needed the toilet", threw up, punched a wall a few times, now I can't move my swollen purple hand without it sending pain shooting up my arm. But it's ok guys, they're letting me do it next week instead.

There's a part of me that wants to write my suicide note in the exam I have tomorrow. Maybe then they'll stop fucking kids up with these tests.

Imagine the reason the exam system gets reformed is because I said it drove me to suicide. Yeah fuck it, it's for a good cause right?
