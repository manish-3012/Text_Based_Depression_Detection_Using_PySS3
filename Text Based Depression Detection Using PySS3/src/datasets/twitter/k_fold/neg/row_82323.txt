HelpIâ€™m gonna be straight up honest. I donâ€™t feel depressed Iâ€™ve never really been depressed that I know of. I have a great family that loves me and everything I could ever want. And still I want to die. I have close to no friends and am considered the weird kid in school. I am currently failing three of my classes when I was a straight A student. Everyone hates. I have tried telling my best friend but he doesnâ€™t believe me. (Says I just want attention). I honestly just canâ€™t do it anymore. I hate myself I hate my life and everything about it. Iâ€™m 14. I need advice and I need it now. And please donâ€™t give me the Suicide Prevention Hotline. I need help from a real person who knows what Iâ€™m going through. The only reason I havenâ€™t already ended my life is because I donâ€™t have the tools to. I have tried telling my parents before and they do not believe me.
