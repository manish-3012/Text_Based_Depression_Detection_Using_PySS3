Another FuneralThis was my fifth funeral attended too, and the fourth because of suicide. Seems I should've made that tontine because I would have won. 

Goodbye Gerald, maybe you're talking to Will, David, Jon, and Mason as we speak. In reality you're rotting in the ground. 

I want to join you guys soon because you left me alone. In less than 4 years I've lost my friends. People think I should be crushed, maybe I am, I don't know.

Everyday has been gray for a while. Nothing's fun. I'm just looking for stuff to waste time. 

Life is suffering and it's not beautiful.
