ChoicesIn 8 days i will have lived with intractable pain for 7 years due to spine and nerve damn yet i am still ambulatory. I get injections. I take painkillers a amount that is well below the addiction thershold as my doctor does not want to get in trouble with the DEA. I am not a candidate for surgery due to numerous factors.  i am also in good metabolic health. I eat fairly healthful foods. I am not obese. I have tried accupunctrue and physical therapy multiple times.  Please don't suggest seeing a chiropractor  to me. Also neuropathy medication usually given for nerve pain causes  a severe reaction in me. For the last three years I have had explosions in the frequency on tension headaches and migraines I suffer from to the point were I was experiencing a headache almost every day. My mri showed no growths or abnormalities in my brain.  I strarted to receive treatment for the headaches but they are only effective against the migraines and i am still dealing with 4 to 5 headaches a week.  So after 7 years of constant physical pain I am experiencing almost constant mental pain now. I have issues focusing, thinking, typing, my already limited opinion at life are dwindling. Given my Metabolic health and my ancestry there is a good chance i could suffer for another 35 to 50 years of this. How much Pain can one person take before enough is even. When you follow all you doctors orders and they tell you they are sorry and suggest some extra herbal supplements.  At what one does a 39 year old disabled man with no children draws the line?
