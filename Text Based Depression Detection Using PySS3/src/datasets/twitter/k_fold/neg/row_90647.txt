Homeless on my 22nd BirthdayHey everyone. I didnâ€™t know who else to talk to so I decided I would post here. I could use someone to cheer me up. I turned 22 today and I am really struggling. I am celebrating by myself with a soda at McDonaldâ€™s. It is the last money I have but I needed something. Life feels so hopeless and meaningless. I donâ€™t know how to get away from these feelings. No one, not even family has called or wished me happy birthday and I know I shouldnâ€™t care but I feel so worthless. Iâ€™m sorry for posting
