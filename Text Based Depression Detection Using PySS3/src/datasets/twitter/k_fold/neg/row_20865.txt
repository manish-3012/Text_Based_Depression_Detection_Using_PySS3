I lost everythingI could handle the depression and anxiety, hell i was almost over all that. But I can't handle this. I'm losing my house, all my belongings, my car just broke down, I can't get back into school after failing out, i'm 27 with no skills beyond retail, and im swimming in defaulted debt from school that gave me terrible credit. No family to all back on, and no friends that will take me in either. I've been learning programming and i am getting kinda close to being ready to apply to jobs... but at this point i've run out of time

I'm ready to kill myself, but i'm going to wait until the last possible moment to try to turn it around. If nothing else i'm gonna go out fighting. Maybe I can survive in a homeless shelter, become an actual programmer somehow, and get my own place. But  likely is the scenario i'm going to die a slow painful death on the streets.

Wish me luck reddit
