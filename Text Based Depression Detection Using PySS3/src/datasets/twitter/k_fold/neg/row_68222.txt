Just looking for advice. ThanksIâ€™ve been struggling with depression for a while now and Iâ€™ve been suicidal and having these thoughts for about a year now. This time itâ€™s different though because Iâ€™m actually looking up ways to die snd I donâ€™t just feel depressed anymore I just donâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m going to a therapist and a doctor so please trust me that I wonâ€™t commit suicide. I just canâ€™t understand snd deal with theses thoughts. How could I want actually kill myself? I do understand it Iâ€™m just in shock that I feel this way for real.
