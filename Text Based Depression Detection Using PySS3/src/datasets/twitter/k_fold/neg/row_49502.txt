Tired of everyone ruining my lifeI just donâ€™t get why everyone ruins my life. No one even gives me a chance. Everyone just hates me and prevents me from being happy. I didnâ€™t do anything to deserve this. No one cares at all. If people say they care, thatâ€™s a lie. If people say other would care if I killed myself, thatâ€™s a lie too. They shouldâ€™ve cared from the start. There is no point in me living with everyone ruining my life.
