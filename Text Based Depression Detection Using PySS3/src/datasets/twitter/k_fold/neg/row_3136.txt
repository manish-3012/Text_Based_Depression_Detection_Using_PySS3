I'm so lost. Help me please.I don't know if I can do this anymore. I've completely ruined my whole damn life.

Almost 2 months ago I broke off the engagement with my ex who I was with for 18 months, and now I hooked up with a girl and her and I were together for 3 weeks and I loved the sex and the relationship. But alas, I couldn't stop thinking of my ex.

Well her and I broke up last Friday, and right after her and I broke up, I went and slept with my ex. Now I don't know what I want. I have 2 girls who really want me, and I don't know who would be better for me. I feel something for both of me. And I'm getting pressured into making a decision.

I stopped taking my anxiety meds because they made me want to harm myself even more than I already do. I just don't want to wake up anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I find myself skipping class, and I'm supposed to graduate with my degree this semester and I'm fucking everything up.

This isn't me, and I don't know how to find myself anymore, and I just can't take this. I hate myself. I hate looking in the mirror. I was hurt by my ex, but I keep thinking what if shes changing for the better and I can be happy. But then I have people telling me that the other girl is better for me, and not to go back to my ex.

I care so much what other people say/think and I absolutely hate hurting people. And in this situation someone has to get hurt whether its my ex or this new girl. God, I really hate this so damn much.

I tried hurting myself the other, all I could do was hold the knife up against me but I couldn't go through with actually doing anything. I want to feel physical pain because that's better than the mental pain I'm going through. 

I'm so stressed and it eels like there is no ending to this train wreck. Someone help me please.
