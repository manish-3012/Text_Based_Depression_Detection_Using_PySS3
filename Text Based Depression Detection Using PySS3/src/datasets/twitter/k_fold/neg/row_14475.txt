I would kill my self but I donâ€™t want to ruin my boyfriends lifeMy boyfriend is amazing,  he has so much promise,  heâ€™s at the start of his life and a new career and my depressed anxious ass is holding him back,   He loves me and wants to do everything to help me,  but I just canâ€™t.  Iâ€™m a loser,  I feel like every part of me is dying.  Iâ€™m
In debt, I have no career goals,  Iâ€™m slowly starving myself, and heâ€™s gorgeous, getting jacked, and just an amazing person. 

I want to break up with him so I can die alone without hurting him.  I could kill my self if he wasnâ€™t with me.  I donâ€™t want him to suffer and ruin the rest of his life.  I know he will blame himself.  Fuck I donâ€™t know what to do.  

Iâ€™ve tried to just make it look like an accident or maybe if I just disappeared.  I thought I could jump off a bridge.  Pills donâ€™t work apparently.  

Pills donâ€™t work?!

So like if I take two boxes of sleeping pills I wonâ€™t die?
