I'm not doing so greatI don't want to speak to a professional for 50 minutes every couple of weeks.

I don't want to call the phone lines and to hear the flow-chart in the other person's voice. The carefully chosen words. I don't want to feel the pressure to tell them what they want to hear--that I'm not going to kill myself so that their job is done. (And I respect anyone who volunteers for these things, but a phone line can only do so much). 

I'm not doing well right now. I've lost a lot of things in life that I worked very hard for. I'm down to the bottom of the barrel of emotional resources. I worry about what I'll become if for all my efforts, this is all I have to show right now. I don't have another big fight in me. It feels like I spent it already. 

I feel like I'm slipping. But I feel like having therapy and meds wouldn't help. I've been on meds...and the most sane and physically good I've ever felt? It wasn't on meds. It was when I got plenty of sleep and exercise and I was no longer in school. 

I don't want a therapist. I am a desperate, craven woman. I want to talk someone's ear off for hours. I want to desperately cling to another human. Figuratively and literally, physically. I want someone to be my dad and my mentor. I don't want someone to report to, to hear more stock answers and be told basically to follow a workbook. 

But that's the thing. What do you do when you don't have any more ideas? There's no foreseeable out of this situation..this situation that is liveable...but for how long? I can live this way but I can't live this way forever.
