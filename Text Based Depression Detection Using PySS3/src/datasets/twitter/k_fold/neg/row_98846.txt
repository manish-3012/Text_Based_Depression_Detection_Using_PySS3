I have my supplies. I want to go soon.I bought everything a while back. I'm so tired. I've started abusing sleeping medications again, but it doesn't matter. I'm on four times the dose of one now. Hopefully I'll finish planning soon and end this. I just needed to tell someone i'm planning on killing myself soon. I talked to a friend tonight and they didn't understand why i was upset and stressed, and i couldn't tell them it's because i'm almost done. I give up.

EDIT: I also recently and for no reason have gotten agonizingly painful tinnitus that's only getting worse. There's no cure, but honestly I was planning my own suicide long before that, it's just furthuring my mental insanity. i can't even think right now the ringing hurts. I'm sorry  but i don't think life is for me. i want to make everything end.
