After 20 years of life no one knows me well enough to give me a eulogyYou ever sit around just picturing your funeral? Hell I donâ€™t even want a funeral. No one cared enough to get to know me when I was alive and they surely wonâ€™t care when Iâ€™m dead. I wish that could actually be arranged. To just get thrown into the ground without a word being said. Cause thatâ€™s how I lived my life, no one wanted me around alive and I donâ€™t want them around when Iâ€™m dying.
