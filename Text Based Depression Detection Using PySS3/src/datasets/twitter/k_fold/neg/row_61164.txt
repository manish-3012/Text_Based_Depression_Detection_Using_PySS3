Itâ€™s all my fault.21F. I ruined my relationship with the love of my life, my soon-to-be fiancÃ©e. Weâ€™re both left so broken-hearted and itâ€™s all my fault. Iâ€™m feeling disgusted with and ashamed of myself. I wish I could find a way to be self-destructive without hurting others, especially loved ones. My life is meaningless without him.
