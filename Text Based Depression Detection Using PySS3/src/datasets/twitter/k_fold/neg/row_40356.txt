I feel exhaustedHey guys, I don't really use Reddit a lot but lately I've deleted everything that has to do with social media, and I just left Reddit for a place I can let my mind speak I guess. 

So I am still in highschool, and all the years in the past I have never actually felt the feeling of just wanting to end it all. At the beginning of this year, I started failing all my classes, I get made fun of everyday, and I just feel alone. I feel like I don't control my life and never will. The feeling of having my life depend on the grades I get right now is terrifying. And I just feel alone, empty. Nothing is worth it. 

I wanted to end it in winter break but im too much of a pussy to do it. I can't buy a gun because I'm in canada. And I think I'll try to OD while in my sleep.

gn guys, have a great life &lt;3
