DoneReasons why Iâ€™m suicidal: 
My life is just rubbish, just the same thing everyday waking up at dinner time, feeling groggy, all I do is play on my Xbox, I get all these ideas in my head but once I start doing them it just dies. Sick of draining my parents of money, sick of everyone and theyâ€™re habit of making me feel rubbish for their pleasure, id rather do things that make me feel slightly content like gaming or eating before I do something like actually kill myself, I just explode all the time, I have thoughts of me fighting people, I donâ€™t see me growing up and having to endure 80 more years of torture, I donâ€™t want to end up in a rubbish low paying job that makes me feel so small and worthless and having to deal with bratty kids, I can actually see myself ending it, and I believe that Iâ€™d be happier dead, much happier, Iâ€™d have closure and I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with anymore scrap ever again. All these years of stress has leaded up to me having bowel problems, I have uncontrollable unexpected diarrhoea and painful gripes. Itâ€™s absolutely god damn ridiculous I have to deal with this at MY age, the fact that ME a 13 year old school dropout punching bag has to deal with suicidal thoughts. And I donâ€™t want to tell anyone because my autism has made me so awkward taking to people and most people donâ€™t give two anyway. So whatâ€™s the point? No, thereâ€™s no point, Iâ€™ll never be an manager, entrepreneur, footballer, basketball player, bounty hunter, Police officer, paramedic, fireman, soldier, businessman, salesman, etc etc none of those careers, I will never. Ever fit in. 
I would rather kill myself than live a life of repeated so called help and sadness
