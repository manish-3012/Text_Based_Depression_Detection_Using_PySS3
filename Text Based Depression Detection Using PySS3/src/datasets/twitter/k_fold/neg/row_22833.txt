I tried to kill myself and I fuking failed ffs what nowMy life is a fucking sad mess, a 2nd year med school who only gets joy in his grades, I have no interests in anything or anyone, I am not antisocial or bad looking, I just enjoy being alone away from everyone and everything. 

the only girl I've ever liked my whole life is out of my hand and just a dream that will never come true. Even the only ever  person that I thought of as a true friend of 13 years just didn't want anything to do with me for no reason, I didn't cry or anything, I think I just dont care. Last year I finished 2nd on my class, made the family happy, made myself happy, but now I cant get myslef to open a fucking book. So with nothing to live for I tried to end it, I fucking failed. Now what? I didn't study for shit, I have no friends and I am not interested in the whole friendship thing. My dream person is way out of my league, god it hurts to write that, I have no chooce but to finish school but I dont have it on me. 

Fuck why am I here Fuck fuck fuck
