i just want to end it.nothing has been going right today. nothing has been going right for the past 5 years to be fair. today i saw my sexual abuser, my uncle for the first time in years. iâ€™m falling behind in school. and my autoimmune disease is back and i have no insurance and canâ€™t afford medication so iâ€™m in constant pain. itâ€™s as if the universe wants me to kill myself. nothing is going right. i just want to die.
