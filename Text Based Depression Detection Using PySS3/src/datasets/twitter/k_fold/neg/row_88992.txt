A letter to the person who is the only reason I am still alive.This is a letter to my partner.

I love you, more than anything. You have made the last year the happiest of my life, by a large margin. I thought I knew what love meant before, but I did not. The feelings I have for you are... extremely surprising to me, especially considering that three years ago I thought I was a psychopath incapable of feeling at all.

I can never tell you how badly I want to die some nights. I can never tell you that you are the only reason I am still alive, because I feel it would be abusive to put such a burden on you. I know that the feelings I have for you are somewhat stronger than yours for me, though I do know you love me back. Or perhaps it's just that you have a network of support, and I have only you. I cannot be sure.

I live for the days I get to spend with you. My only goal during the rest of the week is to waste it, to get through it as quickly as possible, so that I can be with you. I wish I could ask for your help, but I cannot. I care more about you than I do myself, so I will keep quiet and carry these feelings alone. I love you.
