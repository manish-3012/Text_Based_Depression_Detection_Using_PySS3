I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to be suicidalThereâ€™s children and people out there who have lost their families or homes and really just want a chance at life, I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to be depressed or suicidal and I feel guilty about wanting to throw my life away when people just want a chance at theirs. My life is a mess atm and I really canâ€™t see myself doing anything in the future idk what to say or do.
