I really need some help here!You see a friend of mine(15 y) is always talking about wanting to kill himself because of how his mom and sis are treating him like sh*t. She(the mother) never congratuletes him on his good grades and she only sees the bad ones. At times  she tells him that he isn't her son and that he hates him. The worst part? His father passed away years before i met him(we met like a half a year ago). I hate to see him sad at school. Today he was very depresed but i somehow managed to make him fell better by playing Card Against Humanity with some classmates. He says that he can't win any argument with her because she is always screaming at him making him feel worthless and he can't raise his voice because that would be bad,and he can't ignor her because then his mother starts screaming at him because she is ignoring her. So please tell me ways to make him happy
Pls help me and i am sorry if my english is a littel bad(not my first language)
