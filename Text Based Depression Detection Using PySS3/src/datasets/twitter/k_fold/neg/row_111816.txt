I don't know what to doI don't think I really want to die. But I can't stop thinking about how to kill myself. It's quite easy for me. Noone would find me. I'd be dead before anyone finds me. Not that anyone would care. My family would be better off. I wouldn't bother my friends anymore. I just can't do this anymore. I truly think I'm not meant to live. I never have. I was an accident by my parents and now I have to pay for it. I can't live. It's too much. Please somebody help me. I'm scared of myself
