Passionless, directionless, friendless, pointless. Why continue?Feeling incredibly close to the edge these days. If it wouldn't devastate my family I'd be in the lake right now. I'm reaching out because I truly can't find a reason to keep going other than my family would be broken up over me taking the "easy route."

Nobody takes my depression seriously and I feel guilty every time I've opened up.
