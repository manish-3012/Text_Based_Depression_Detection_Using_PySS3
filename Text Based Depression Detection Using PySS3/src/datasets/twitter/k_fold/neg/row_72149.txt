I'm so alone20, Homeless, living in a tent in the woods... 

I haven't eaten in 4 days, I haven't had a conversation with someone in 2 weeks.

I only sleep about 4 hours a day due to paranoia, I don't have schizophrenia just sleeping in the woods is actually terrifying.

It's non stop anxiety, it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack, I'm on edge all the time. I don't get a moment to just relax and breathe without worrying.

Loneliness is definitely the worst part, having someone to call my own is a literal fantasy.

Fighting this on my own is impossible.

I'm just ready to give up.

I don't see the point in continuing, I don't see a future just more of this.
