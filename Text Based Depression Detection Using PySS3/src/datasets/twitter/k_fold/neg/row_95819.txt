I'm nearing the endI've been clinically depressed ever since I was 8. 

I'm 17.

I want nothing more in life right now than to die.

No one can help me. I've been suicidal probably since middle school. I can't stand my parents at all. They always try but I never let them help. I never let them help me with anything and I've treated them like shit, so in return they treat me like shit. I can't stand life anymore even though life has gotten better.

Every day I get one step closer to killing myself, and o don't know what to do. Honestly this may be my last chance.

I know I'm going to get the classic "but think about your parents" thing but I already did. I don't know what to do anymore. This year has been the best year of my life, but nothing has made me happy yet. I got a shit ton of friends, I hang out with people a lot, and I do a lot of shit now. I thought this could fix it. Guess I was wrong.

I know people will miss me, but I really can't stand living for another day, let one another week

I feel useless, I feel like i don't have a future, and I'm probably going to die feeling the same way.

All I ever wanted to do was art. And I can't even draw anything to get myself into college.

There's nothing at this point that I can see that is actually going to help me out. This is probably my last chance.
