Trying to make it a weekI got a good job so I'm trying to get through the days leading up. I just dropped all my classes due to everything going on. I'm reaching my breaking point again and feel so worthless. I'm holding on to a thread. I have no pills to try and kill myself again. I just want to die and the pain to be over. I had a dream today I had my own room with my cat and I felt so happy and free. I realized it was a dream almost immediately and woke back up in hell. How much do I have to insure to become the person I am supposed to be? When is it enough? Am I even alive?
