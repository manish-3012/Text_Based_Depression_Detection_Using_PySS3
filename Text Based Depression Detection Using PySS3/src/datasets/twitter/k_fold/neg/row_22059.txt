I've done something terrible and the time feels rightI had the worst breakdown of pretty much the entire year the last week, probably cause I didn't take my meds, whatever the reason and just did what i always do when that happens, hurt everyone around me.

I just couldn't get the thought of my first attempt some months ago off my mind, it was such a sad state, my mom sobbing so hard and not letting me go and seeing my dad like that for the first time in my life. This week has to be the worst though, and I ended up hurting my only friend I've made all my life, I just straight up ended it without any specific reason aside from me crying and my heart burning, and that person tried so hard to convince me that I shouldn't do this with them

jesus fucking christ I don't even know what to write anymore, my entire life being abused my school teachers and classmates and the only first who gave me a chance I do this to,. and it seems like they've blocked me cause they aren't seeing my messages now, then again I get what i deserve

I honestly just wish my mom and dad would peacefully die now, cause then this wouldn't be so painful and make me feel guily of hurting those around me. I'm thinking about the 4th floor, I smashed my head on a wall once and it hurt so damn much for some time and didn't even do the thing, I just hope this one works

so much suffering my entire fucking life, I really don't see the point anymore
