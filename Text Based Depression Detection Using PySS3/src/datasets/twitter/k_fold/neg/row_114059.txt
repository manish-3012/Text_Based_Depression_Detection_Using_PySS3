I want to get helpIâ€™ve had depression and anxiety for a while now, even though Iâ€™m so young. I was supposed to see a doctor this year for that, but now I canâ€™t see one until November. I havenâ€™t seen a doctor in 3 years since my parents divorced.

My therapist canâ€™t be there as often as I need.
I feel like I canâ€™t talk to any of my friends or family because they brush me off.

So I started writing a note, started making a plan and everything.

I want to get help so, so bad. I want to be understood.
I start school tomorrow. Maybe if I tell the counselor she will care? But then Iâ€™d probably be sent off somewhere. 

Would that be a good thing? Would I need to be sent off like that? Maybe itâ€™s the only way Iâ€™ll get taken seriously. Maybe I just need to indulge in my self-harm habits again so I can get help. 

I just want the pain to stop..
