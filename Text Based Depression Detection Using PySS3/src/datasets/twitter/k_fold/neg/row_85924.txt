It feels like I can never be the person I want to beIâ€™ve disappointed people time and time again.

I just stay in my room and play video games.

The point I want to get across is this: I feel like Iâ€™m never gonna be the man I strive to be. I have everything I could desire. A computer, a nice home, a bed, a cat, a phone, a switch, really a lot. Yet, when I look at myself. Iâ€™m acne ridden. I have a stomach thatâ€™s alright I suppose. But when I have my girlfriend I canâ€™t control my own feelings around her. Sheâ€™s my first and I feel like Iâ€™m constantly fucking up. Iâ€™ve been with her for almost 2 years now. I feel like sheâ€™s eventually losing her love. I just want my hornyness to stop when Iâ€™m around her. I want to love her, I want to be interested in everything she says. I want to baby her. I know Iâ€™m a prick and I canâ€™t change, I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. I wrote my first suicide note today. I feel like people are gonna call me dramatic but Iâ€™ve been suffering with depression for awhile and this isnâ€™t helping. Sorry everyone
