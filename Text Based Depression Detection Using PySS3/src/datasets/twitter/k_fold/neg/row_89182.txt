Dreaming of DeathI dreamt of my own suicide last night.


I was running from a group of men intending to rape me, and decided I'd rather end my life than be blamed and shamed all over again...no way in hell was I going through that. Not again.


So I jumped.
I rushed to the edge of a nearby cliff and leapt...practically flew.


My life seemed to float by in slow motion...defensive attacks I could have made against the men trying to destroy me, the faces of people I Love, a baby boy that I couldn't recognize...those moments went by like missed quick-time events.
That is, until I belly-flopped onto the highway below.


The last I heard in that shattering subconscious reality was screaming, and the sound of my body breaking, like stepping on a snail.


I woke up crying.
But it almost felt nice...to escape reality by ending it all.
