38 and wanting to dieMy family have said that I have been a "fighter" since I was born 3 months premature, more visits to the ER growing up than I can count, no real friends, two failed marriages due to my spouse cheating, 3 heart surgeries and last year a stroke + half dozen seizures hit at 37.

While physically I'm fine aside from a left field vision cut, my already bad depression got much worse. Finally told a doctor this year and was put on medication which helps a bit but I find myself searching for ways to end things as I am tired of the physical pain and the memory loss/confusion along with being a "fighter".

I know it will upset my family but that will pass and I'll just be a memory.
