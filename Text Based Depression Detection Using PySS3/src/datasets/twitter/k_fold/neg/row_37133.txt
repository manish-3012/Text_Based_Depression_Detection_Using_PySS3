My best friend and everyone else I know has left me behind and I don't know if I can handle being utterly alone anymore.I've always had trouble making friends and connecting with people. I'm not shy or antisocial, I don't have any trouble making "friends" with people in my classes, but as soon as it's over they all drift away and I never hear from them until after summers over. Well now even my best friend is giving me this treatment, posting about going out with all these other friends and barely even fucking speaking to me. Only issue is I graduated high school so odds are I'm never going to fucking hear from anybody ever again. I'm on my own entirely and I just can't handle this kind of loneliness. I don't see the point in living if I'll never have anybody to share this life with, and so far history has shown that that's gonna be the case. I just feel so utterly alone in the world. I mean fuck. Uhhhhh. Life's a bitch. I don't think I'll ever not be alone so I'd just like to get this life over with while there's at least some people that'll at the very least notice. I'm just gonna fucking fade off into the background and die alone and unremembered anyways.
