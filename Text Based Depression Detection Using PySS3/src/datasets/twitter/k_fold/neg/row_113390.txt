no more guilti'm starting to feel the worst that i ever have. the only reason i am still alive is because of the guilt i have over making my friends (and i guess family) sad, but that's all starting to fade. i'm realizing just how replaceable and how meaningless my place is in everyone's life. there is only one person (my best friend) that genuinely needs me the way i need them. the things i love began to not give me any satisfaction weeks ago, nothing gives me joy for more than a few minutes. and then i'm back to feeling how i feel right now. worthless. insignificant. unmotivated. lonely. nothing feels worth it anymore. nothing feels the same. i don't feel like me, and it's starting to make me wonder if there was ever a real me. if i had ever been myself at all. i can't really remember. i mold my personality around whoever i am with, so i truly don't know who i am. i dont seen a future for myself. it's just darkness, nothing. i'm doing the worst in school than i ever have, and i don't even have the energy to care. i don't care about eating. i just don't want to function like a normal human being anymore because it's not even for myself anymore. i am still here because of guilt. but the guilt is wearing off.
