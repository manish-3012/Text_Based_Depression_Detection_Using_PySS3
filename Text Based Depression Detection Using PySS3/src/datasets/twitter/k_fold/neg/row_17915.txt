Breaks my heart talking to family members who love meIâ€™m genuinely grateful for my family, i know they care about me. Iâ€™ve been alone away from my family in another country for some years now and i got the chance to talk to a couple of them that I havenâ€™t seen in a while over a zoom call, i got emotional and cried during the call because I really do love these people but i want to die and i know they dont want that so i have to hide and keep pretending like i care about career and Iâ€™m invested in this world.

And i dont want be wicked enough to bring it up with any of them because they will try to make or convince me to keep living when Iâ€™m done and ready to die. After the zoom call my cousin called and tried to ask if i had any issues, how can I tell him im suicidal? I really wish I could tell my family about my desire to die and they would oblige. Iâ€™m scared of hurting them but living life daily is hurting me and i know Iâ€™m being ungrateful with this but Iâ€™m genuine when i say I really want to die as there is nothing for me in this life.
