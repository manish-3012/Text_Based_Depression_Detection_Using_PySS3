i kind of want to die.i'm not really gonna do anything about it, but this is too... suicidey? to post on /r/self so it's going here. throwaway because one person on here knows my handle and i'd rather not risk it. so yeah, i'm here and i want to die. i have a brother who's 12 (i'm 15) and even though he's just 12 he fucking torments me. and i get really really upset but not in a sad way, like i'm just pissed at him. not to sound like a whiney teenager (even though as of right now, that's all i am) but nothing will ever be done about it. he's got such a bad attitude and he's just horrible to everyone. even my mom hates it but he's the youngest child so he's always gonna have that extra leeway that i and my older brother never had. i know that i'm older so i'm expected to do extra work and have more responsibility but he never did the stuff i did at his age. he's so lazy and it's really honestly just annoying. and he makes fun of me for the stupidest shit???? like my mom was having me pick up dog poop for the 4th of july "party" (its not) that she's having today. my brother was laughing at me and calling me names. luckily my mom made him do my job and took away his phone for the week because even still, he wouldn't stop giving me shit. anyways, enough talk about my brother. i lost the only person i've ever loved. it's not like he died, but he hasn't talked to me since i took him to a concert and i kissed him at the end of the night. it wasn't even the first time we kissed. it was the 3rd time and like.... it wasn't like it was out of place, i guess. we were holding hands the whole night and we bought and wore matching shirts ffs! i know that i'm in the wrong for kissing him and i'm definitely not saying that i was entitled to it but i feel like i at least deserved an explanation. and i'm not at all hoping that i love someone romantically again. i'm basically aromantic other than being romantically attracted to him. i don't really like having identities anyways so aromantic is more of a description i guess.... but ugh people ask me about it and they talk about it like it's an illness. i'm not broken i'm just not interested in romantic relationships. and my dad!!!! oh my god he's awful. i don't like calling him my dad because he and my mom got a divorce when i was 3. i went to his city across state so he could take me to a concert and he's so horrible. like i've finally realized that he's really, actually emotionally abusive and i'm not just a crybaby. the gaslighting is horrible and he has like.... no compassion. i have a fear of feet/socks/some shoes like i cant have them within a few feet of me and i sure af cant touch them. he was getting the laundry out and he dropped a sock (even clean ones freak me out ok) and he asked me to pick it up and i was a bit shaky but i did it reluctantly to avoid being yelled at. guess what? i was still yelled at. he was saying that it's clean and i knew it was pointless to try and explain so i just cried. he also has a dog and i am very very very allergic to dogs. he didn't do anything with it, he just let it sleep with me and that's it. i was sick the whoooole trip and i wanted to die just so i wouldn't be so sick anymore. his dog staying with him for another few days was clearly more important than my wellness? thanks dad, i guess. now i suppose i'm just having to live through this because he buys me things to try and make up for his shittiness in my early life. he doesn't know he's still shitty. i got a weezer concert and doc martens out of the trip which was pretty cool. crying all the time wasn't. i feel like i should have mentioned earlier but i cut and burned myself for a long ass time. i started when i was like 11 or 12 and stopped january 31st of 2014. at the same time, i got out of a psych ward for a near suicide attempt. i didn't go through with it but i don't know if i'm glad i didn't. thing have gotten better and worse since then. one of my best friends since 7th grade (we're both going into junior year of hs right now) is like the only person in the world that i can talk to about not wanting to exist and just general suicidal ideation. she trusts me to not kill myself and i'd trust her if i ever thought i might hurt myself or make an attempt. i know she loves me a lot and i love her too, but i can't help but feel paranoid that she might not actually like me, you know? i don't get along with my family and it feels like i never really have. we're just so horribly incompatible to the point that it's not healthy for any of us to be living together but i'm only 15 and i'm gonna be stuck with them at least until i go to college in like 2 years more or less. i just feel like living isn't worth the effort and i'm not even afraid to die anymore. that's what being depressed for so long has done to me. sorry for the wall of text and thanks to anyone who's read this much.
