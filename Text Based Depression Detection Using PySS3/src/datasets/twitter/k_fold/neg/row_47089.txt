Tonight my dog may have saved my lifeI was in a car accident over a year ago and still have issues doing most things. This means I have no job, and zero income. Going through the process for disability, but I may lose everything I own before I get an approval. 

Had a fight with my ex that I am still in love with, (lost due to mood swings and depression from accident). I've been holding on to lost hope that I can win her back, but every day I push her further away. 

Tonight, everything just hit all at once and I wanted to end it all as fast as possible. The thought of this broke me. I sat alone on the couch crying and punching myself in the head. 

At some point during this, my dog came over and put her head against mine as if to block my hits. When I stopped she, (50+lb husky) climbed up into my lap. 

She usually stays to herself and rarely tries to play with me or ask for attention. I don't know why she did it. She may be the only reason I'm still here to write this. 

So now I have a severe headache, a black eye, and a lot of swelling. But I'm curled up on my couch with my dog instead of leaving her all alone. I don't know how I'm going to face tomorrow, but I'm going to at least try. 

Just needed to share this. I have no friends to talk to and just needed to get it out.
