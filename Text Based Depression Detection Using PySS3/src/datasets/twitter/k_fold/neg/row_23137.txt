Girlfriend wants to kill herself, urgent, please helpHello, I am 18 and live in Denmark, my girlfriend in 17 and live in South Africa.

She has very religious parents and yesterday they found out about us and I didn't hear from her until this morning in a string of messages saying she tried to kill herself yesterday and that she  wants it all to end.

She has previously been beat up by her parents, but this time it has been to the extend of her bleeding from her mouth and unable to see.

I can't even imagine living without her and I want to help her more than anything, but how do I fix this situation.

What are the options when she is still legally a minor? If she was 18 I could get her out of the country via an au pair solution. 

What the fuck do I do? I feel drained for ressources. I just want to save her but how the fuck do I do so? Do I file a police report? If that would even help though. Obviously the coporal punishment law is being abused to the limit, but I don't think it can make it stop...

I am probably looking for an answer there doesn't exist, but does anyone have any idea what I can do to fix all of this, please?

**UPDATE:** She ended up in the hospital yesterday, because she took too many pills in an attempt to kill herself. Luckily it failed and she had a realization, she didn't want to die. She is alive and 'okay', she won't be allowed a phone to talk to me for a month-ish, but knowing she is okay is all the relief I could ask for. I feel so grateful, and I would like to thank the people giving it thought and tried to help, it gave me hope, so thank you.
