What can I do?I have dealt with depression and childhood trauma since I was a teenager. Iâ€™m turning 25 years old in a few days. I dropped out of high school seven years ago. I couldnâ€™t find a job because of my social anxiety. And I have isolated myself from the outside world for several years now. This will sound clichÃ© but I donâ€™t care about life anymore. I donâ€™t give a damn. I just want to die. However, I know I will leave my family with a pain behind. Thereâ€™s no such thing as bettering myself. I just donâ€™t care. But what do I do? If I stay alive, I will continue on living a miserable life and basically have a slow death. If I take my life now, my family will be hurt. Idk what to do. This is a big conflict for me.
