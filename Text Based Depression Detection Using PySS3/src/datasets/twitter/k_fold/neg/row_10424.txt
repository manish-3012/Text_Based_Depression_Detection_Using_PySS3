The days after discharge have been the hardest of my lifeI admitted myself into the psych hospital this past Monday as a last-ditch effort to not go through with my suicide plan. They are moving me to partial hospitalization Monday, and discharged me Friday. Itâ€™s only two days, and I keep telling myself I just have to make it through those two days and then Iâ€™ll be in php. But itâ€™s so hard. I barely made it through yesterday and Iâ€™m fighting tooth and nail to make it through today. I feel like Iâ€™m trapped in a burning building with no choice but to jump. 

Iâ€™ve done the research, Iâ€™ve planned extensively. I wish I could get rid of this like biological impulse to not die so I can just get on with it and take that way out. I donâ€™t have anything left to hang on to
