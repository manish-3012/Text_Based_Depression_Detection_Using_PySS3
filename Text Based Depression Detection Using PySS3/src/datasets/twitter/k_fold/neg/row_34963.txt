Suffering from chronic pain, planning on committing suicideI'm 22 years old. For the past 3 years, I've been been suffering from joint pain. It's going on 4 now. 

At first it was bearable, but it got worse about 16 months ago. I have pain and aches and cracking in my knees, ankles, groin, lower and upper back and neck and shoulders. I also have elbow pain and chronic plantar fasciitis in one foot. My surrounding muscles are weak. 

I went for an MRI of my shoulder. I have early symptoms of osteoarthritis, at 22 years old. I have similar symptoms in my other joints, but haven't gotten it tested yet, but there's no point, I already know what's there. Confirming the diagnosis will be worse. 

I will have this pain for the rest of my life, as it's incurable. I just can't believe that my body is disintegrating at such a young age. My pain isn't excruciating all the time, but nagging. It's the fact that It will never heal that kills me. I used to be fit and athletic, to this. 

There's no point in living.
