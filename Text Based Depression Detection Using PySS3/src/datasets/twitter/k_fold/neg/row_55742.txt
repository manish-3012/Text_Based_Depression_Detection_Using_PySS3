How a pro suicide website saved meA few years ago I was sitting on the window sill on the 10thof my dorm building, looking up how high you need to jump to die.  I can't remember the name of the site now, and I think it no longer exists.  But in my search I stumbled across a site that detailed why suicide,  questions to ask yourself first, and most importantly techniques.  Whoever made it was a genius. Because they convinced me that there was a 28% chance I would survive that jump, most likely with a severe handicap.  Thinking with my luck I would survive. That night and many nights after I came back to that window but never could take the chance at survival. I looked it up recently as I've been having similar thoughts again.  My survival chance was closer to 5%.
