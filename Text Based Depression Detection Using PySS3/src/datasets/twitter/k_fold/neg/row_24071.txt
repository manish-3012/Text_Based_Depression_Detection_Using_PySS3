I don't know what to do...I have OCD and depression and over the past 2 weeks my anxiety has become pretty bad. I panic in movie theaters and I can't listen to certain songs or wear certain T-shirt's. The thing that's worrying me most is I can't stop obsessing about suicide. I see like all the different ways I can do it and it's scaring me. It doesn't stop. I dream about it almost every night and I'm loosing sleep over it. And I'm not actually suicidal. I don't want to die. Things are okay. But it doesn't go away. I'm scared to tell my therapist cause I don't want to go away and I can't tell my mom or else she'll freak out. I haven't told anyone and I don't know what to do. When I spent the night at a friends house she fell asleep and I was stuck awake for hours because I was thinking about getting into my car and driving into a wall. When I went to Disneyland for my birthday (June 11) I kept thinking about dying on a ride or dying on the freeway and my sister would ask if I was okay and I would lie and be like yeah duh. I don't want to die like I really don't but I don't know why I'm obsessing over it. Even the small problems that pop up aren't that big of a deal and I've been okay. But this is not okay and I'm worried and I feel like I can't control it and I don't know what to do. I know I won't act on it but it's driving me crazy and I need it to stop. Whenever it happens I write down what I'm feeling in my notes app and I look at memes or dogs or you know something nice and positive that will distract me. But it comes back and I'm in this really frustrating cycle where I'm developing a pattern of doing routines like washing my hands or brushing my teeth a lot because when I'm clean the thoughts go away. And I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. 

Ps. Sorry for the rambling and poor grammar lol
