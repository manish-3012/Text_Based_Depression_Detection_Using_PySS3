I keep going around in circles but always end up at this point.I went through my first chronic bout of depressing about 2 years ago but managed to get through it by myself, it was the first time is fully stopped caring about work, my personal appearance and became fully, fully consumed by suicidial thoughts.   
It came back about this time last year and I again managed to fight it off but had gone through planning suicide methods and timings. 
They then came back about 3 months ago and I started having really intense daydreams as I was walking, of blood pouring from my wrists, trickling over my fingers and on to the floor. 
I was aware this wasn't normal but was too embarrassed to tell my doctor so I emailed a suicide help line, they told me to talk to doctor. 
I lied and said I would because I just felt too ridiculous to ask them for any more help via email.   


After that I was fine for a while but now they're back and keep cropping up.  

I don't want to talk to my doctor because I don't know her that well and it feels odd.  
I can't tell my friends or family because I don't want them to worry but now I can feel these thoughts keeping back in, I don't know what to do.  
Is there anyone else (groups, good websites) apart from my doctor I can talk to to get them some advice for the next step, as I don't think I'm strong enough at the moment to fight this again.
