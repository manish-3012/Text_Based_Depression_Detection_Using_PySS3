Please Don't Call the PoliceIf you are worried about a friend and want to do a welfare check, please do not involve the police. Here's why:

(1) At the very minimum your friend will be very embarrassed and humiliated when the police show up at their door, especially if their friends/neighbors see it.

(2) Sometimes, hauling the potentially suicidal person off to the hospital is the default (or even required) setting for the police, but your friend may or may not need/be able to afford that level of care.

(3) Some cops will use a welfare check as an excuse to give themselves (in the name of "probable cause") a free tour of your friend's living space, and anything they find (weed, for example) could land your friend in jail.

(4) Even good cops will probably run a check on your friend for outstanding warrants, to make sure they're not some escaped serial killer, and they may discover warrants even your friend is unaware of (for example, bench warrants for unpaid bills and traffic fines). The result is the same- arrest and a trip down to the local police station. Not great for the suicidal/depressed.

(5) It doesn't happen often, but there are cases where scared police officers overreact with deadly results. 

Call a friend, go yourself, but don't call the cops unless you absolutely have to.
