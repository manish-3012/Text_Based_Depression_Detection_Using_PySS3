Gf's ex bf threatening suicideOk so basically I've (26m) been seeing my gf for a few months and before that she was in a relationship with another guy, which is in a different state now. Things weren't going good with him and he got kicked out of there living situation. She feels like he is her best friend and saved her life by brining her down here to get in recovery. They were both recovering drug addicts but since recently my gf has been relapsing and I'm pretty sure he has ever since he went back to where they came from. Anyway throughout 9ur relationship I have been understanding and have been fine with her talking to him even though he makes it clear that his intentions are to get her back. The other day he hung himself and was cut down in time to still be alive and know is facetimibg her pictures of ropes saying if she doesn't come back he will do it again. I do get that this is very hard for her and makes it feel like it's her fault, bit when she goes back to where she's from i know she will fall back into using and he will not let her leave. It just seems like he is using it to manipulate her and it's fucked up, I'm just wondering if you guys have any advice on how to go about this because she's planning on leaving in a couple days and I don't see it ending well
