It's just so hard...I'm a senior.. high school. Everyday is a struggle of depression and subduing myself to my OCD's demands. I hate my family, I truly do. Imagine hearing the person you hate the most every single fucking day. Imagine being consumed by all this hate you can do nothing with. Imagine not eating or showering because of the potential risk that the people you hate have eaten, touched, or used it. I have nothing. I've got no money, I've got nothing to strive for, literally nothing. The only reason I stay in this place that slowly breaks me apart is because of high school but it's so, so hard. Even if I get that diploma what's the point? I'll leave my family, I'll be homeless, I'll be starving and it'll just get worse. I don't know what to do.. and the only reason I typed it down here is because keeping it to myself is suffocating me.
