I have a friend who may be suicidalEvery day, since the second day of school this year, I've sat next to a particular friend at lunch. We've known each other for over two years, but lately he's been abnormally sad some days, and normal others. Today he asked me why I sit with him, and I told him that he is my friend. He said I was his last friend. After a bit more discussion, he said that I kind of annoyed him, and he wanted me to sit inside. 

A friend of mine told me to show him that I would care if he died, but I am not entirely sure how, especially since he doesn't seem to want to be my friend anymore (he unfriended me on Facebook, too, as frivolous as that may sound). 

I'm not sure what to do, and I'm afraid of telling someone, because everything might end up being fine, but I'm terrified that I'll end up not saying anything, and he'll kill himself. 

EDIT: He's been isolating himself from everyone, too. This year, he's been really, really antisocial in general. 
EDIT 2: Earlier this year, he mentioned wanting to actually do stuff with other people (as in, hang out and other social activities). But he said he was too socially awkward, and didn't have enough friends. Today I asked him if he would still attend Doctor Who Club (an after school club, which another friend and I are trying to restart), and he said no. He's changed his mind about wanting to do stuff with other people, apparently, and just sits around watching anime all the time.
