Just admitted and without much of a plan afterI'm 18 and have been suffering from depression and anxiety for years . I recently tried and failed at taking my own life and am currently stuck in an ER right now waiting to be transfers 200 miles away. I can't begin to explain how angry I feel and where I currently am. I just want to go home and sleep in my own bed. I don't know what I'm doing, I feel everything from here is just down hill . I feel like now that I tried nothing else matters, I've never wanted to escape from reality more than right now.
