I wish I shot myself a year ago. I can't get my hands on a gun anymore.Where I'm from, it's impossible to get a gun. We go through military service and I had a window where I could have gotten access to a lethal rifle and not some pansy pistol that I'm pretty sure could leave a brilliant spray of pink on the ceiling. 

I don't want to jump off a building. What if I don't split my skull open and bleed out, but just break a few bones instead? What if I just end up being paralyzed? who'll throw me off their balcony for me? 

The brightest idea I have now is to get blood thinners and bleed out. I'll even donate blood before hand so I'll need less to bleed out on! Even this isn't fool proof. That's why I wish I ended it all a year ago.
