Do you think their is a such thing called heaven?Sometimes i feel this place isnt for me i feel depressed almost everyday, im alone almost 24-7 with no human interaction whatsoever except maybe a call from my family but if i tell them my problems they pretend its nothing. Im so ugly im afraid to go in public in front of other humans,i dont think ill ever feel comfortable here.

by the way if you were to see my picture you'd probably vomit.

what is thier to live for when you dont have a present or future.

I cant even be their for my dad because of my issues.
