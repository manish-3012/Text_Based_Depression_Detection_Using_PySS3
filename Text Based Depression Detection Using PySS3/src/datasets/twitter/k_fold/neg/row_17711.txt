I am almost 40 and have absolutely nothing to show for it.I am 39, almost 40, single, no kids, no wife, never married, was homeless for ten years. No car, no family, no friends, I am utterly alone in this world. I have absolutely nothing but a 500 dollar laptop and a monthly disability check and 3 shirts and 4 pairs of pants and shoes that are falling apart and I can't afford any new shoes. I can't work unless its sitting at a desk at home, I have severe chronic depression, severe social anxiety and ptsd. makes being around others hard to function. 

I have witnessed over 10 deaths and 3 murders and 5 suicides in my entire life and have suffered through severe child abuse growing up ranging from incest, rape, molestation, being beaten daily. My family tried to kill me several times and they even accused me many times of abusing them or stealing their stuff and trying to get me arrested. 

I have literally nothing in my life and have no reason to keep living or being alive. I am renting a bedroom from an elderly woman and if she dies I will go back to being homeless and I can't do it anymore especially with arthritis in my knees, feet and lower back. There are days I can't even get out of bed there is no way I can survive being homeless again. 

I have no job, my resume is empty, I have no education. tried for ten years to get my GED but failed it. I need to do every subject from 1st and 2nd grade to 12th grade and I took classes, tutors, teachers and still can't get it. I fail in every subject and in stuff like science, math, history are my worst subjects. I can barely add or subtract as it is. 

I just have absolutely nothing in my life going for me and no matter how hard I fight or struggle to do anything, all I do is fail at everything I set out to do or it somehow manages to get worse on me or make my life worse than it was before I tried.

There is just no reason for me to keep living.
