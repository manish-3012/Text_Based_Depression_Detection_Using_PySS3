2 years of HPV28m. Going to try to make this short. Iâ€™ve had HPV for 2 years. Been treated by doctors twice and done home remedies. The second time I was treated by a doctor I had them froze off. Seemed like it worked. I was clear for 4 months.  Started seeing someone. But now the warts are back. I have to tell her that she might have it. My self esteem, confidence, and mental health is so bad it might kill me to tell her. She is part of my very large friend group and when I tell her everyone will know. I had thought about suicide during those two years, but not like I am now. I feel so empty and worthless I shouldnâ€™t even be alive. If it werenâ€™t for the harm it would cause my family I would have been gone last night. I know my problems are small compared to many others but itâ€™s like time that killing my and the fact that I was free and now Iâ€™m not again. I want to live my life again but feel like the only way to escape this is to end it.
