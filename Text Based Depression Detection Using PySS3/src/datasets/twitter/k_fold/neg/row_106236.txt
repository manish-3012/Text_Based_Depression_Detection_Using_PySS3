I cut againI have a total of 67 cuts now...I can't stop and for some reason I just want these wounds to open more. Like the song from Ariana grande, I'm working "Side to side." LoL I attempted to go down the road twice now...but I'm not confident enough. Idk guys. I think I'm accepting the fact that I am worthless, uneducated, lonely, stupid, ugly, etc... Could this be goodbye? I don't fucking know. I told my friend about it and it seems as if she's not really listening whole heatedly. There for some reason seem to be no one who understands what cutting feels like in my circle...idk anymore. All I know is that right now, I'm tired. I am going to sleep in hopes of not waking up. But before I drift into sleep I'll listen to "Pua kiele" by Josh tataofi. Beautiful song. That's the song I want to hear before I go out.
