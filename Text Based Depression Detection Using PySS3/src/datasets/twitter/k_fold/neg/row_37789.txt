My feelings...Iâ€™m tired...

I really am...

But I donâ€™t want to die, because Iâ€™m scared of dying....

So I keep living...


And I help my loved ones in need of support because I care for them.

But thereâ€™s this one friend I had.
She didnâ€™t have a great home life, and neither was her school life okay. So she felt suicidal and tries to cut herself...(thankfully I stop her)

But I was there for her,because she deserves a friend and the more we grow, the more we became attached.

I guess thatâ€™s why it hurts more and still a lot...

But she becomes distant one moment, and I donâ€™t know why. We were friends so why now that this happened.

And she avoid me and my friend group...

And here comes a post that she made on YouTube, it features my friends(they didnâ€™t like her anymore at the time) but then came to me.

How we turned friends but she victimized herself when all Iâ€™ve been was a good friend to her all these years...

I cried...hard, so I called my best friend up and tell her the news. She told me it wasnâ€™t my fault, that I wasnâ€™t in the wrong...

Yet, why do I feel in the wrong. What did I do to make her feel like this and how could I change it. Was it my actions,words, or thoughts that made her feel this way?...

Thatâ€™s how I feel when my friends feel sad and depressed.

So the fact that she decided that I was a â€˜fakeâ€™ friend hurt me and still does.

We avoided each other but I still want to be friends but it doesnâ€™t seem like that itâ€™ll happen anytime soon.

So that time period made me feel worthless, useless and weak. I wasnâ€™t strong to keep a friend around...



Just like back then...(we left to different schools and I couldnâ€™t keep contact of her)



Every time I look at my contact that I still keep of her, make me want to vomit and cry like i did before, condemning myself for my misdeeds that were no fault of my own. Feeling shameful and disgusting.


This happened months ago and I am recovering with my friends behind my back but I still feel her piece that she took from me empty and hollow...

Hopefully you didnâ€™t have toxic friends that you gave the whole world to just throw you out and if you did, I welcome you with open arms...you are not alone amigo
