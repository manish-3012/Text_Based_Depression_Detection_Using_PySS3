Help Me.....I am depressed to the point of self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

I have no friends, no family, no job, no life.

I dont want to live anymore it hurts so much to see everyone else being happy and to get angry at the world for being happy.

I am studying biology at UoW staying at Weerona Campus and i have told 4 people there that i am depressed and they didnt care.

I dont want to be a monster.
