my head space is terriblewhile I want to disclaim I will not harm myself, nor have I ever tried:

I am so tired of my brain. I don't understand how an organ effectively placed to aide my existence is hellbent on destroying me. The ruminating thoughts, the put downs, the incessant need to remind me I waited too long after pushing my shit down and not talking about it effectively. I am sorry, I know I am weak now. And I hate it. People are dying and here I am complaining about my mind. I am sorry. I don't know where else to go. I cannot take my head. I can't. I want to start over. I can't live this thought process much longer.  I took too long to seek help, I can't do it. I am too sensitive and everything is too much doom. It is ridiculous, what I cannot put up with. The worst part is I have spent too long portraying my okay-ness. No one knows.
