I'm killing myself on sunday morningI was happy with the girl of my dreams, then it turns out I guess I was fed lies. I never did anything to hurt her and now I don't have anyone. I did what she asked of me and turns to her parents and they make her break up with me. Then she tells me that's not what she wants and she wants to stay with me. I needed her, I did my best to care for her. She asked me to stand up for her I did, I take the blame and I take the shit for stuff she did. She goes to her parents, but this time they say it is enough (I only did as she said).

So they start trying to file a claim of harassment (I WAS DOING AS SHE TOLD ME) and then making her cut all contact. They then must have gotten things to spread and now at school I'm getting labeled as abusive, shitty, an asshole, a rapist, a sex offender. I can't take this shit anymore.

I did my best to be nice but I got used. I've had some decent friends and now they all used me and here's another one. I hate being treated this way and I'm so alone.

Today I was getting glares from all of her friends while I was crying in the back of the class. I had to lie to my counselor that I would be okay and I would be there on monday. I won't be.

Like I'm so fed up with getting used and lied to. I know she knows she hurt me, and she won't stand up for me or tell her parents what really happened.

To make things even better today my school's campus police officer told me that I was the reason she would no longer be getting a professional education, and that I ruined her life. I should be gone. Everyone is trying to ruin me and spread rumors and bully me and I have no friends and I've been used. 

To make things best they can be, she told me she would fight for me and stand up for me and that I would be okay and she loved me and she would be lost without me and I tried my best to be there for her. Then she chewed me up and spat me out.

Sunday morning I'll be gone.
