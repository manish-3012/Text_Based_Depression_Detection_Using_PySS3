Suicide is the only answerI have socially isolated myself after making friends several times and consistently being abandoned, shunned for various reasons, abused, or even them just getting tired of me. It has been a long lonely journey, yet I havenâ€™t killed myself yet. I consistently try what I can to help my various mental illness, or shall I say diseases since they are chronic issues and persisting problems D,:. Maybe someday I will find enjoyment in life and stop having countless suicidal thoughts where time after time I get closer to attempting suicide another time. Maybe this world is just a fiction of my imagination, for I shall not know until my current consciousness dissipates. Or maybe itâ€™s just pre-onset schizophrenia d:. Anyways I hope nothing but enough pain for myself to attempt to kill myself once again and take my miserable life out of this terrible existence.
