Stressed.I'm not only stressed but I'm really suicidal at the moment. I've received my math exam mark back today and I did poorly. I think i cannot make it to my university of choice with the mark I am at right now. My parents think I'm smart... but i'm not. If i don't make it to that university I don't know what to do
