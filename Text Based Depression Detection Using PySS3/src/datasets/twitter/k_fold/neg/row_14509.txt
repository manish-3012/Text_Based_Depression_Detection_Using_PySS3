I might die tonight.I've decided that death by intoxication/alcohol poisoning is my way to go. I've debated suicide for a long while now, trying many methods and none of them have worked until this one I believe. I won't say what I'm drinking or how much because I want to protect others from a similar demise. All I'll day is that I've drank a bit already, and I plan on drinking more. I tried to get in contact with my old friends to explain myself and my actions before I go, but not one of them gave me the time of day. I've effectively ruined my own life. There is no coming back for me. My life is ruined. I see no reason to continue. Everyone is better off without me and their lives cannot ever get better with me around and existing. I just wanted to apologize before I go, but even that's not possible. 

To my family, I'm so glad you existed. I believe I'll die quite soon, but you all made my life worth living to begin with. Please forgive me and continue to live for each other. I love you all endlessly and equally. I always will. 

XXOO.
