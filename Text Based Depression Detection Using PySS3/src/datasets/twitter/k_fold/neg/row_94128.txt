Iâ€™m worried about my friend, and Iâ€™m not sure at what point to get his family involved. Please help :(Basically, I started getting close with this friend a few months back, and we really click and started opening up to each other. A few months in, he disclosed that he was incredibly depressed and hopeless and felt that his life had no positive future prospects. He told me to leave for my own good. He also told me that he had a history of cutting himself and i know itâ€™s true, because he showed me the scars. 
I know that he continued to self harm, although I tried to be involved and keep him from doing so. Recently, things have gotten really bad. We continuously have conversations that end in him getting frustrated with me refusing to agree that he has nothing to offer the world or a friendship. Heâ€™s slowly cutting off everyone he used to be good friends with, and swore he wouldnâ€™t do that to me (Iâ€™m not stupid, I know Iâ€™m not different and that it was entirely possible that he might) and lately, heâ€™s slowly backing away from our friendship. We used to talk every night on FaceTime or the phone but lately he seems to not even want to text. 
Iâ€™m scared because heâ€™s openly admitted to me that heâ€™s suicidal and a couple weeks ago drunkenly threw the phrase â€œsoon Iâ€™ll be dead and..â€ into a conversation. Iâ€™ll be honest; I panicked. I started crying and asking him if he had any plans to kill him self and he said he didnâ€™t even have any options to if he was going to try and assured me for the night he was fine. 
The conversations where he says heâ€™s given up on everything and doesnâ€™t care anymore and that his life is a dead end are becoming more frequent. He refused my suggestion of therapy because he doesnâ€™t believe it will help. I have his address and his roommates phone number is case he tries anything, but I want to be able to help more than just calling emergency services. 
I donâ€™t know what to do. I want desperately to help him but I canâ€™t if he shuts me out then Iâ€™m left with limited options. At what point do I call up his family and tell them? He swears that will make his situation worse because his mother just died a few months back and theyâ€™re dealing with a lot. 

TL;DR My friend is suicidal and getting much worse. Iâ€™ve tried all i can to listen and be there for him, but itâ€™s not helping and heâ€™s starting to shut me out. What should I do? Would it make it worse to contact his family? Help please :(
