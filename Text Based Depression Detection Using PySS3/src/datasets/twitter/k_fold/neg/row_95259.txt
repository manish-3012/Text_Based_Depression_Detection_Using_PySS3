So then where do I go from here?I already decided I want to hold off on killing myself for a little while but I'm determined to do it *one day*. I'm not gonna be one of those guys who just keeps delaying it over and over again because he's scared. Fuck that.

I have no interest in "living" if you know what I mean. No desire to travel the world, have sex with random girls, get wasted all the time, get a well paying job and start a family. None of that shit. While I'm still alive I want to spend that time planning my suicide out and mentally preparing myself to be ready for that day. 

Problem is; aside from that I don't know what else to do while I'm still alive. I don't want to waste my time trying to experience life because that would sway me from my path and i see no point in being happy because that emotion is worthless. 

So what do I do? I really have no idea what to do and it scares me. Living scares me right now but I have no choice but to stay alive until I'm ready.
