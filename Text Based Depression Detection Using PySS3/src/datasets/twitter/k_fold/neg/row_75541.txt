Question about my future intentionsHey to whoever is there. I am up and wanted to talk about stuff; maybe to help me think. I don't ever want to choose to end my life at any specific moment, but I hope to finish life before very old age. I'm 27 and posted in bipolar subreddit to talk, I feel better than I have my whole life. I'm doing well in terms of following my career goal, but a slew of mental disorders is exhausting to manage and I worry it will get worsw, because I exhibit and realize I have numerous psychologically diagnosed conditions by my psychiatrist. The latest incident is last year where I wake up every morning feeling tense and needing to hurl, clonzapam has helped curb incidents when I have on me. Life has been an uphill battle to finds myself and control my disorders and I worry about my future. I feel irresponsible to start a family with my inability to be consistent in my emotions and a great of passing a mental disorder to a child. It hurts that o recently had dreams where I have kids these past months, because I feel I am not balanced or stable enough to give a child everything they deserve(what I feel I needed as a kid growing up). My father has my mental disorders and my  life was very unstable growing up fast of his mood swings. I grew up anxious and without any semblance of confidence, which took a huge toll on me; for the rest of my life even. I've faced a lot of my fears and am better off but I really hope I don't become old and worse mentally than I am now. It feels inevitable and I hope to pass away before that takes hold. I abuse drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, and engage in risky behavior; something expected of someone with bipolar and other disorders. I just want to vent and say I hope to ruib my body and choose pass away(I don't consider our suicide but it feels similar). I don't know how to make paragraphs so sorry for the wall of text. Maybe I'll pass out soon
