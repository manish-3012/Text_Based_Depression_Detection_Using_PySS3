I feel like my best days are behind me.Today I began the second semester of my freshman year in college and I'm miserable. Despite the fact that I have a few friends here I feel completely lost and alone.

 As much as I hate to sound like the guy who won't shut up about his days in high school, I have to admit I think junior year and on will always be the best time of my life. I didn't have any responsibility, all I had was free time with my amazing friends who I spent every single day with over the summers. Senior year I remember the only problem I had was being in love with one of my friends who didn't couldn't care less about me. I'm still in love with him, and while I know it's for the best, it hurts to think how long it will be before I can see him again.

My first semester was pretty shitty. I had a lot of laughs with the friends I did make, but when I look back on those few months they don't really mean anything to me. I wouldn't mind losing those memories. I'm not so as much homesick as I am terrified that the rest of my life will be this bleak. I want to leave this school so badly but I don't know where I'd go. I could transfer to another school that's not as respected as my current one, but my best friend goes there. I know that's not what's best for me, but I almost feel like I don't have any other option. I feel so completely alone and am haunted by thoughts of ending it all.
