Happy Birthday To MeMy 18th birthday is just 24 hours away and I am completely indifferent to it. The best birthday wish I could receive would be for this one to be my last. That's how my birthday's have been for years now. They make me depressed and numb. I just don't want to live another year. Living is exhausting and painful. Even in the rare good moments I can't help thinking this is just a lapse in a consistent flow of misery in my life. Whenever I think I'm getting better I just get far worse. The worst part is I don't have the balls to kill myself, so all I can do is sit and pout about how I wish I was dead because my life fucking sucks.

I didn't graduate from high school. I got my credits but didn't do my community service hours because I'm a lazy piece of shit. Summer's almost over and I still haven't. I live with my abusive mom and sister and university was going to be my way out, but like most things I fucked that up for myself by not doing shit second semester and getting my acceptances taken away. Now I'm stuck in this hell. I don't have a job. My friends are always too busy or flaky to hang out, so ultimately I just stay home and eat like shit, which makes me gain weight, which makes me not want to go outside, etc. 

In 3 hours I'm leaving on a trip to Montreal and have absolutely no money for food or sightseeing. I don't want to go but I put down $700 already because again I'm an idiot. My hope is that I just drop down dead within that time frame
