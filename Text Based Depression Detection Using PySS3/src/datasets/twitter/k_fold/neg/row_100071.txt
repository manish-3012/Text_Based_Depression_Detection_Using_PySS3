I couldn't bring myself to it last nightHad everything planned, each time I kicked my wheelie chair from underneath me I kept pulling it back with my feet.

I'm not in massive debt or anything, just been feeling miserable over the last few weeks. I have been isolated and my friends alienated me.

My girlfriend loves me very much, I don't feel the same way about her and haven't got the balls to tell her.

How can I make myself feel better before doing something terrible?
