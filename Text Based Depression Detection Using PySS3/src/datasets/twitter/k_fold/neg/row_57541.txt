I can't make it stopThe thoughts, the voices telling me to end it all. They grow stronger and each day I get weaker. I am deteriorating. The girl I once was..the person I once was..she is falling apart. My life is falling apart. The pills aren't working. No matter how many I take, they never work. I'm tired you guys. There are billions of people on this earth and I feel alone. I AM alone. The only way out is through death. The only way to quiet the thoughts and voices is through death. The only way to peace is through death. The only way to make it stop is through death.
