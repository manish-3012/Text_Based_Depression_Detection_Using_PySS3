haha pain. (â—â€¢á´—â€¢â—)So uh.. yeah, I'm a 13 year old non-binary person 

I'm currently struggling, I want to do homework but whenever I try to, I just can't. 

I use drawing as an excuse to not do anything other than lay in bed while watching streamers, I hate it here.

My "mom" (If I can even call her that) refuses to get me professional help because I haven't shown any "symptoms" when I am genuinely concerned for my health

I just.. feel sad, I feel like school is mainly the cause of this. I want to drop out so badly because it's affecting my mental health to an unhealthy level but I can't. 

I feel like a failure, I have no hope for me in the future- heck I don't even know if I'm going to survive to my 20s.

I keep hearing "It's going to get better" from people but my mind just doesn't seem to believe it.

Am I just sensitive? Am I really blowing this out of proportion and making it seem like it's a big deal? Probably, that's what my mom says

I'll just get scolded if I even try talking to her or anyone about it, I don't feel safe in my "home",  can I even call it a home? 

I'm only happy whenever I'm on Twitter or interacting with online friends, maybe watching a few streamers and spending hours just watching videos.

I've started to doubt my feelings more and more, what if I was just faking this without knowing? Am I really just being sad for nothing? Is it my fault for being sad about school?

I just want to feel the release of all of my worries once I die, I can't wait for that day that I feel peace again- please I just want it to end, even if I'm still 13, I can't handle the pain anymore.
