LMAO... I am gonna go.Time to hit up 4chan and find out the best ways to go. I can't say I didn't try, but I sort of knew it was going to come to this.

I had a good upbringing. In high school I met a great girl and we stayed together 8 years or so. We broke up pretty badly and I haven't heard from her since. I'm not going to get into too much detail about that though.

For the last 3 or 4 years, I have been trying to feel normal again. In that time I haven't held a normal job- I've just pretended to work for myself and I make essentially nothing.

At this point it really doesn't seem like anything is going to change- I have motivation for nothing and the bitterness that failed relationship caused doesn't seem to go away. 

I think that's a good sign that it's time to go. Now I just have to figure out how.
