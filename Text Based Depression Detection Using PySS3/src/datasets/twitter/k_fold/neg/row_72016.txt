I'm tired of crying myself to sleep every nightI just can't do it anymore. Pretending I'm okay, pretending people care when they don't, pretending my parents give a damn... None of it is true. The only person who will miss me is my boyfriend, and he will move on and find someone more worthy off him. Someone who can be the woman he fell in love with. Someone he won't look at our touch like they're a stranger. Someone he'll want a future with. 

I have no future. I won't amount to anything. I'll never find someone who will want to throw their life away on me. Who will want to grow old together. I don't deserve that. I'm worthless. Pointless. And I'm done with it. 

Babe, if you see this... I am so, so sorry. But it's for the best. I love you. I want you to find the woman who deserves you. I can't be me. I've tried. I can't find that girl inside anymore. For a long time i could. It was like she was trapped in a cage inside my mind. Now... she's just not there anymore. I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough. I love you.

Goodbye.
