It used to be just the occasional â€œwhat if I wasnâ€™t hereâ€ now itâ€™s screaming at meLong story short whenever I get upset now itâ€™s more than just â€œIâ€™m upsetâ€ oddly itâ€™s turned into â€œshould I even be hereâ€? The other day I woke up upset due to a text and it was the first time I looked into the mirror and actually thought about death and it was the most scary and repulsive thought I couldâ€™ve ever had in that moment. The voice of â€œshould I just goâ€? Is now coming more frequent during my bad days. Iâ€™m so sensitive and I *hate* it.
