I'm lost at sea. Knowing I'll drown, yet using every will I have to save myself.I do this nightmare almost every day now. No need to think twice about what it means. I hate myself. I hate life and most of all my life. I had the nerve to think that life would be easy. Started a career early on, and was good at what i was doing. I lost everything. It's been 10 years since I haven't work. I have no friends anymore. My dog, my only support, died a month ago. Every day, Every single day, i think of the failure that I am. I succeed at failing that's all i did. My phone never rings. I'm alone. I wish i could be normal. I wish i could be happy. Life seems to be a cool thing for some people. For me, it's just a mountain of anxiety, pain, and suffering. Where do you go from there? How do you keep on breathing when you have nothing and no one to do that for? why did it happen to me? Why can't I find a tiny bit of happiness? How can someone fail so badly at something so many people are doing so easily? They get married, they have children, they have friends, i can't even seem to get out of bed. Life doesn't seem to love me. Maybe i should leave.
