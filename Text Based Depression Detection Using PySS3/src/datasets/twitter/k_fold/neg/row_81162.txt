Stuck in life.I want to commit suicide but I'm too anxious to do that and I will always have thoughts of suicide.  I'm empty now and I've enough of being alive. I don't want to do anything but people don't understand it. They're mad at me because I've another way of thinking. Life is useless if we all gonna die. Just let it end it all. Everything is useless. How can we communicate of we're trapped in our boddies? Sorry for my negative thoughts. I'm just really depressed and I'm never gonna get better with medication. I'm just a disgusting person.
