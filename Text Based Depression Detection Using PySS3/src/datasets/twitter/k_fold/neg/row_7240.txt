Now I know that my time has comeIt will be Sunday, I am afraid, but I am ready. 
The wish for something good to happen before that day still here, but I know it won't. And I accept.

I wish that all of you will be able to go through any difficulty, I wish that all of you will be happy someday, soon.  I will be somewhere trying to help you.
