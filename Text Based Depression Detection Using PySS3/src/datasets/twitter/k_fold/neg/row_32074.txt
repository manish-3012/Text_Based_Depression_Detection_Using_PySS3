What is the point?Every day I wake up, sometimes work out, sometimes eat food, then go to bed again. Same thing every day. I don't really see any reason to keep living when I just keep repeating this over and over. One day during the upcoming week, I'll go for a trip to the mountain, and I don't plan on coming down. Is there really any reason not to die now?
