An acquaintance made a suicide threat, I'm not sure what to do.I play in a band, and last night there was some ridiculous drama with an opening act.  He threw his guitar down and stormed off stage.  When my band got on, we noted the lineup change and poked fun at what had happened--not for very long, but apparently enough to cause this person great distress.  

I really, really wish I'd considered the possibility that the guy could be seriously depressed.  Anyways, I reached out to him today to see if he wanted to meet for a cup of coffee and talk it out, and he unleashed a pretty vicious tirade that I can't print here for the sake of his privacy.  I said as little as possible, and I eventually realized that he's seriously mentally ill.  At the end of the conversation, he said, and I quote, "you never stop to think that somebody might want to fucking kill themselves after the way you fucking treat them."  

Guys, I'm ignorant about this stuff. I've stopped talking to him, because he sees me as a major antagonist, but I don't know the guy very well and I have no idea how serious he is.  What's my best course of action here?

FOLLOWUP EDIT:  I had a friend of his talk to him.  He then contacted me after blowing off some steam and apologized for overreacting; I apologized, too, and told him that I didn't care about assigning blame as long as he was safe.  We're getting a drink together today and I'm going to try to actively listen to him.  He's in treatment already, which I didn't know, and I think he'll be okay.  Thanks, Reddit.  The lesson to take from this is that you never know what someone else is going through, so err on the side of being a positive person and always accept that people might have a reason for apparently bad behavior.
