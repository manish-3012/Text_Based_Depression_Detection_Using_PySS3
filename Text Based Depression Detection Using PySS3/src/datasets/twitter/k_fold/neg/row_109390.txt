Canâ€™t go onI canâ€™t take it anymore, the love of my life is dead, and every time i, for a split second forget it happened, I instantly have to relive the moment I found out that she was gone.

Itâ€™s a living hell, Iâ€™m always tired yet canâ€™t ever sleep unless itâ€™s from flat out exhaustion, i feel so sore all over, and Iâ€™m all alone in it.

I have no one else, all I had was her, and now sheâ€™s gone, and I want to join her. Where we wonâ€™t ever have to feel pain and can be together forever.

I want to be free of this pain, and misery, and just hold her in my arms and never let go.
