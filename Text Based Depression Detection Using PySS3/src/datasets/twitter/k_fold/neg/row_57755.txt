There is nothing left to fight forObjectively, nothing. People have told me I'm the strongest person they've ever met. I've kept fighting, but I've been naive to think it will resolve to any sort of life that I can live. Had things been a bit different, had I been more selfish or just a tiny bit less concerned with other people's feelings I think I could be living a good life by now. I could have meaningful relationships, work, community. But my options have been whittled down over the past five years as I've shied away from hurting anyone, letting my empathy be used against me, letting myself be exploited - and not even for anyone's significant gain.

I'm leaving Monday. I've thought about finding renting an apartment where things have opened up more. There's a decent chance the virus will affect me badly. But at least I could be around people again for a while, even if I don't get to find any real relationships before I make an exit. I don't know. I've dreamed about swimming out in to the ocean or just heading up into the mountains to die, and those seem like real options now.

There's a lot I'd like to say to the people I've known over the last few years, but no one's listening. I had been deluded to think they ever would or could. In retrospect, dumping text into the void of the internet seems about as meaningful as any conversation I had with the people I've loved so much these past years, for all the consideration they gave me.
