I canâ€™t do itI have tried to OD, i tried to throw myself off a bridge and I tried to hang myself. This shit is hard. Nobody ever mentions how much courage it takes to do something. Itâ€™s only until i am face to face with my demise that i realise how impossible it is for me. I am obsessed with Jodie Jose and she did it the right way, but will that be the same? What do i do?
