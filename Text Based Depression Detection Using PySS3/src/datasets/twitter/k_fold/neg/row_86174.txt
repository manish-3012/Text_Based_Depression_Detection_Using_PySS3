Failing to self destruct hurts but not having to hurt anymore doesnâ€™t.I donâ€™t really want to be here anymore. Iâ€™m a narcissist, Iâ€™m a thief, Iâ€™m a liar. I was a good person at one time. Iâ€™ve thrown it all away. I chose to do so. I knew my actions would catch up with me. But when they finally did the person that loves me the most wont let me go. Iâ€™m lucky but it hurts. I want to be gone. Iâ€™m sick of hurting and hurting others
