Yesterday in the morning I tried to stab my father but cut my finger really deep. There was a lot of blood and I started panicking.It started with him showing me the cat's bag with his sand but didn't say anything because he had mouth wash or whatever it is called in his mouth and I didn't understand what he wanted me to do, perhaps clean his toilet? But my father already did it. He then came back into my room and asked me what did I say and I answered I don't know what you want from me and then he grabbed me by the hair and pulled me to the entrance of the apartment and leveled me to the bag level, I just screamed ok you want me to get rid of this I get it. I came back into my room to change and he entered and started insulting me and hitting me really hard, I just told him that he wants me to be nice to him when he's not nice at all to me and insulted him back because I had enough. He just kept hitting me and I snapped and went to the kitchen grabbed a knife and tried to stab him in the shoulder I think but he took it away and accidentally cut my finger open and took me outside by my shirt but I noticed how much blood was coming out and banged on the door to let me in. The shirt I was wearing was covered in blood and the bathroom wall where the light switch was too and the toilet paper still has blood. He told me to go to the doctor and assign myself s psychiatrist because I'm a crazy bitch. The way he treats me is happening every day, I had enough of it. I want to die.
