I think I've finally made it to the end...I've reached the breaking point, everything has become too much. Even my own death.

A week ago, I decided I was going to fake insomnia to get a prescription for sleep medication to kill myself. I'm a lazy sack of shit so I didn't bother. Sunday, I looked at the LD50s of all of the drugs I have and found my number one candidate. It's kind of a stimulant so it probably won't be a fun way to go. I decided I'd do it the next day (meaning yesterday).

Yesterday I wasn't prepared, I didn't want to go out on such a sad and pathetic last day. I cried myself to sleep last night and got ready for today. I decided to live out today and make it as good as I could. I told some of my closest friends goodbye for the first time, I normally just say "see ya" or "until next time". Everything I say has a deeper meaning than what I actually say, so maybe they picked up on it. I plan to write my parents a nice note, I feel so bad for them. They deserve better. They deserve perfection, I've only been able to give them that via academics (I plan to tape my report card to my note, straight A's, big fucking deal huh).

Tonight I will say goodnight to my parents and tell them that I love them. Then I will reach for my liquid courage. Then I will take my final dose of drugs and wash it down with sleeping meds to hopefully make things more pleasant. I plan to write my note and a small will for what little I own and then ride off into the sunset of music and questioning whether I made the right decision.
