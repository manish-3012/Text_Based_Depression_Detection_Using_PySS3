The few people that keep me from ending it all are selfish.My life is painful, vicious, sad, and hard. What right have they to keep me tied down to this shitty world? The world we live in is hellish, terrifying, evil, and cruel. I live in the United States where we have a psychopathic warmongering fascist as our president. We elected him. The people wanted this to happen. The rest of the world isn't much better and often worse, filled with tyrannical dictators, oppressive regimes, and evil corporations that exploit the vulnerable. There's so much nastiness and cruelty in the world and it's all you ever read in the headlines (which are themselves corrupt) and I'm powerless to do anything be victimized and watch others get it even worse than me.

There is no chance of escaping into my personal life either. Most people I know seem to loathe me and those who don't are family members and a handful of pity friends. People have made it very clear that I'm not wanted and any time I try to be engaged and join the conversation I'm immediately met with cold sneers and deliberate silence, the consequently eschewed from the gathering because I am a lesser member of the pack. I am lonelier than you could ever know. It doesn't help that my grades are in a perpetual sink hole and I've failed to achieve anything meaningful on this planet.

I should've left ages ago. I've been stranded on this planet filled with awful creatures for far too long. I used to be a relatively happy, optimistic person too, before I became a young man and all the joy and light inside of me got sucked out. The only people who would actually miss me when I'm gone are my brothers, my sister, and my mom and dad. My extended family might extend their condolences to them, but that's about it. If it wasn't for them, I would've done it a long time ago. A hate this awful world and I wish I was fucking dead.
