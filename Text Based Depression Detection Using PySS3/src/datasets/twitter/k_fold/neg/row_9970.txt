Call Suicide Hotline or Self-Injure?Hello, I'm in a very dark place. The last few nights that I've felt suicidal I've reached out  to the Suicide Crisis Chatline and they've been really helpful and prevented me from doing anything that I don't want to do. Unfortunately it appears to be down and the IMAlive line is off for the next week (it seems). 

I need some relief. Should I try to call the suicide hotline, even though I'm terrified of expressing my feeling out loud (hence why I've used the chat line)? Or should I self-injure, which probably gives me an equivalent amount of relief. I haven't done this in years but I'd probably mildly cut my wrists.

What does this sub think? Thank you in advance for your help.
