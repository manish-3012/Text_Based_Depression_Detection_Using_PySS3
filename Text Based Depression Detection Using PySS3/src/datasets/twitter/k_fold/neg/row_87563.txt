I donâ€™t want to wake upIâ€™ve been in bed for the past 3 days. Iâ€™ve been faking at home sick so I donâ€™t have to go to school. My depression is at an all time worst. My dog passed away a few weeks ago. My parents are the main cause of my sadness, and have recently told me Iâ€™m not allowed to go away to college next year. I have no friends at this point, as I donâ€™t feel any urge to go outside of my house anymore. I just want my pain to end. Iâ€™m too scared to kill myself. I just wanna go back to sleep and not wake up.
