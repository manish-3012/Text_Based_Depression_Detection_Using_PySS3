Nothing left to look forward toA few years ago, I felt like I was on top of the world: I was going to graduate from an Ivy League school, I had amazing friends I could see every minute, dream job lined up, and was in peak physical condition. I thought I had my life sorted out.

Fast forward to the future, I'm currently unemployed, fat, ugly, and also suffering a lot of physical problems from excessive binge drinking. I just don't have the motivation or will to move forward anymore. I think back on how amazing my life was and then just feel like a useless piece of shit looking how much I sandbagged since. I have no money left in the bank, still no job outlets anytime soon.

I want to die, but I'm scared to actually go through with it. I feel like me disappearing would also benefit everyone and that I wouldn't be a burden anymore. God, fuck this shit. What will happen after they find my body?
