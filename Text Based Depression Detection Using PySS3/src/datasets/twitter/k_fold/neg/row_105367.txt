Can I just talk to you for a few minutes?Feeling frustrated right now, I wish to enjoy things, I want to have goals and look forward the future, but all I really desire is for it all to be over it already. People are "so proud of me" for pulling through a hard time and putting my life together, but all I really did is semi-arbitrarily pick some things I thought I should want and achieved them. For example, send myself back to school, got very good grades, live in a beautiful little place, have a boss I like, and in a few days I'm leaving to travel to another continent for a month to do humanitarian work, mostly in orphanages. 

I should be proud of myself and happy with this, but all I do is feel hurt and afraid all the time. I have been having to get doctor prescribed sleeping pills so I can fall asleep at night, or else I just spend all night battling my anxiety. It's that or I'll drink so I can calm down. 

This isn't new it's been almost 10 years now, and it's not going away by doing meaningful things with my life (fucking volunteering in orphanages, anyone?) or getting exercise, or talking about my feelings with people I trust, or achieving goals in my life. I have made some attempts to get medication in the past, all that did was help me lose my job and increase my suicidal tendencies to beginning an attempt and having the police called on me. So now I don't trust talking to most people about it. (I don't resent them for it, I'd probably do the same thing, but it still means I can't be open with them) 

So yeah, I'm sitting here, I should be packing to leave the country soon, but I just can't care, and I hurt, I want to throw up, and I feel like something is physically crushing me down. And I keep fucking TWITCHING it's driving me crazy.

K, I'm done now. Now I feel guilty already, with my petty first world problems. I have no business complaining, but here I am.
