I'm at my breaking pointI've struggled with undiagnosed mental illness since I was 15 had a few attempts between 16-18 but I feel like they don't count since nobody ever knew. Here I am at 19. My health was good for a few months now I'm in the worst state I've ever been in. Eating makes me sick, sleeping I have night terrors, all day my only thought is suicide. I'm terrified to get help. I feel awful because I am angry 24/7 because I'm not dead yet, and my bf thinks I'm taking out my anger out on him. I really don't mean too, I just am torn. Do I kill myself without saying anything or do I break up with him so he hates me than I kill myself?? Like what do I do?? I know that my fate is suicide. I just don't want to hurt him. I love him, but I'm suffering. I can't keep doing this.
