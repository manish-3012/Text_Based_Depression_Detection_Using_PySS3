Decided to write a future suicide note to all the people I care about. The first one is to my brother. Here it is:Last night I spent a little over an hour writing a suicide note to my brother. I intend on making one for everyone I care about (10 or so people). Not sure if I'm really going to go through with it but this is certainly the most serious I have ever been about it. Not sure what I want or expect from this community after posting it but maybe someone will see this and realize I have it a lot worse than them and they will reconsider on their suicide. 
  
Here it is: 
  
Jason,
  
It's crazy to me that we really didn't grow up together but later on in life we got to be so close. Being 8 years apart and all we just went through life differently as kids. My earliest memories of you are when you were living in the garage at &lt;redacted&gt;. I vividly remember a time where mom had made dinner and kept on calling you to come in and you snapped that you didn't feel like eating. This had to have been back somewhere between 1997-1999. You were going through some mental health issues of your own and me being a child I just thought you were being such a jerk. Now, I can totally understand how it feels to be crippled by your mental health. 

Another memory I have doesn't necessarily involve you so much as it involves Jeff &lt;redacted&gt;. Back in 2006 when he and I first started hanging out together he was driving a relatively new Ford Mustang, had a girlfriend, was moving in with said girlfriend, had a sweet job working at &lt;redacted&gt; and from the outside looking in appeared to be "living the dream." I remember thinking, "I really wish Jason would get his shit together like Jeff. He could totally have this life." At the time you really didn't have anything going on, I think you were working at Bloomingdales or something. Today, I am very proud of my big brother. I'm proud of what you have become. The passion you have for your career is something I can't even fathom for my own life. You truly have found your niche in life and I am confident you will be one of the all time greats at what you do.

As a big brother I just want you to know I appreciate you. We may argue, fight, and disagree, but that's what brothers are supposed to do. I hope you don't have any resentment toward what I did. 

I spent the better part of the last 9 years of my life in complete agony. Everyday was a struggle. Some days more so than others. Imagine every single day of your life thinking you were going to die. Multiple times a day. You can't enjoy things most people like to enjoy because of how crippled you make yourself. You can't go out and have drinks because any amount of disoriented you feel causes you to think it's an incoming stroke, heart attack, or aneurysm. You can't even think about going on a vacation anywhere for fear that you will be too far away from the hospital and will die should some catastrophic medical emergency take place. Simply driving anywhere outside of my normal 5 mile radius causes distress about the nearest hospital. Eating, smoking, drinking water, the most basic of life's necessities caused anguish. I would get lightheaded, dizzy, fatigued and various other physical symptoms anytime I did the most menial tasks. The only time I could escape how I felt was sleep.  

My latest therapist asked me "how do I know that we are done with treatment?" I was a little taken back by the question but didn't take long at all to answer. I told him when I knew who I was. Almost a decade was spent living the way I was living. I didn't know what I enjoyed doing. I didn't know what I didn't enjoy doing. All I knew was panic and anxiety. I knew the things that would trigger those feelings and would avoid them. Unbeknownst to me, what ended up happening is my world became smaller, and smaller and smaller. 
  
I didn't know if I liked camping or not. All I knew for the last decade is that camping put me too far away from society, from hospitals, from help. The act of camping didn't necessarily bother me, the panic it brought on is what made me not like camping. To this day, I have never camped because of that fear. That same logic could be applied to so many parts of my life. I don't know if I like Hawaii, or snowboarding, or fishing, or really anything that remotely took me out of my small comfort zone. Not because I didn't like these things, but because they would fuel the anxiety and panic. 
  
Simply put, I didn't know who Ocmike92662 was. I didn't know what ocmike92662 liked or didn't like. I don't know what mikes passions are in life. Im not saying that at 26 all of life's questions should be answered. I am saying, however is that at 26, one should be able to identify what they enjoyed doing, what made them happy, what made them continue with life. For me, I didn't know. I don't know if anyone could tell you what I enjoyed, what I liked doing and for good reason. I didn't feel any commonalities with anyone except for people with anxiety. I decided recently to go out and find new friends. I figured I would start with meetup.com. The basic premise is to type in the things you enjoy, things you would like to have in common with other users and it would match you with a like minded group of people. I drew a blank. With 10,000 groups and activities going on all day surely there would be a group for me but after searching for hours I couldn't even figure out what I liked doing. 

It didn't appear I liked doing anything. I lived to battle the demon inside of me. Every. Single. Day. 

Now imagine living like this for 9 years. Over 1/3 of your life in a jail cell inside myself. I spent arguably the greatest time in ones life as a shell of myself. I have not felt like myself since August of 2007. This is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem. This is not a temporary problem. This is most likely a problem I will face in some way for the rest of my life.  Don't think of me as losing the battle. I lost 1, but there have been thousands that I have won. 

I can not stress this to you or to anyone that there was nothing you did to contribute to my decision. There was nothing you could have don't to prevent me from making my decision. This was a decision I had to make for myself about myself. I spent many months debating this. How long would I allow myself to live like a prisoner? How long would you have lived like this? Before you get upset and think I took the easy way out, seriously ask yourself: how long would you live like this? I've tried the best I could to paint the picture of my life the last 9 years. Think about all the things you enjoy about your life, now imagine tomorrow, and every day for what you believe is going to be the rest of your life you can't enjoy them. You can't travel, you can't eat, drink, smoke without having some kind of panic. Out with friends and the only thing you can think about is the need to go home because you might pass out and die, or have a heart attack. Can't go to sporting events. Can't be at the mall. How long would you allow yourself to live like this? 15+ different medications. 5+ therapists. 7 psychiatrists. Nothing seemed to work. Things almost felt like they were getting worse, not better. How long would you do it for?

 I decided long ago that today would be that final day. 

Don't think of this as a sad time, but rather a happy time. I finally don't have to live like this anymore. I am no longer trapped; suffocating by panic and anxiety. 

I love you so much bro, keep being you. Except, be nicer to mom. You only got 1 and she did a damn good job given her circumstances. Actually she did a great job raising us 3 kids and it's a lot more impressive considering her circumstances. 

PS - mom is going to be beyond upset. You need to take care of her for a little bit. Dont get frustrated with her, love her, hold her, let her know that if she truly loved me she would understand why I did what I did. For me.
