I fear that I am relapsingAfter a year or two of relative happiness -I say relative, because my past misery is all I can compare it to-, I fear that I am again slipping into that deep abyss which has led me to commit suicide before. I say commit rather than attempt to because the last time I did it right, and only by pure chance and someone coming home early did I end up getting to the hospital and surviving. My loved ones were so infuriated with me last time that I feel that I have nobody to talk to, and especially nobody who has gone through the same thing as I have.
