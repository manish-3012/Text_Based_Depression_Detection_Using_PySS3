I'm tired of fighting so hard for my shitty lifeTW: self harm

Here's a brief summary of my life so far:

- Abused sexually and emotionally by parents for 20 years
- Escaped them last November
- Been financially struggling, about 80% of my income goes to rent.
- I can't work consistently because of PTSD and IBD
- Came out as transgender last year and am currently 4 months on testosterone. This would be a good thing but my top and bottom dysphoria have exploded to levels where I can't leave the house. Currently can't afford top surgery.
- I've never had a problem with school but I'm in school for engineering and classes are hard to begin with but PTSD makes sitting through lectures extremely overwhelming and exhausting
- There are so many little things to do to make sure my parents are completely out of my life and also to make sure college is paid for that I'm completely burnt out from being in constant crisis for half a year

I've been feeling like every interaction with people hurts me so I've withdrawn. I do all of the things that are supposed to make you feel better, I exercise 5 days a week, I eat a vegan diet, I do yoga almost every morning.

These things used to work but they're not working anymore and the pain from my PTSD and complex PTSD are too much to take. I can barely afford to eat. I am a waste of space and the only thing that makes me feel better consistently, which is singing, I can't do all the time because it'll annoy my roommates and also my voice is fucked from second puberty. I feel like everyone prefers to talk and no one wants to listen to what I have to say, I just get talked over or I freeze and dissociate when it's my turn to speak. A huge CPTSD trigger for me is people telling me what to do/interfering in my business when not asked. I feel so ignored and cast aside. People don't believe me when I am right about things. Lately when I've tried to stand up for myself I just get shot down or ignored.

Lately I've been realizing that I don't feel safe anywhere. Not my body (dysphoria), not my sleep (nightmares), not in food (IBD), not my house, not my school, not my friends, not anywhere. I've started the healing process from my childhood shit but it's worse than the actual trauma. I can't keep on doing this alone. 

Maybe I just need to fucking die. It'll be good for the world because I won't be a burden anymore and it'll be good for me to finally feel safe (not feeling at all). I self harmed today and was on the edge of compulsively stabbing myself. Maybe I should just do it. God I just want something in my life to go my way. At least I can choose to leave it.
