my goshi want to die. i have so much regret that i canâ€™t live with. i feel so far behind in life. iâ€™m a private school student whoâ€™s parents pay for the crazy tuition. i had to leave school last semester because i tried to kill myself and now iâ€™m too far behind. it doesnâ€™t sound as bad as it is. i want to kill myself but i donâ€™t want my dad to find me. his sister killed herself when he was around my age. his side of the family never talks about it. theyâ€™re very tight lipped about these sort of things. my grandparents have told me that he hasnâ€™t been quite the same since it happened but thatâ€™s to be expected. i canâ€™t put my death on him. i love my dad. he watched his parents bury his sister and i donâ€™t know if he will be able to bury me. i canâ€™t let my mom find me. she already has so many issues and her finding me wonâ€™t help. me not being here will help her i think but it would be so traumatic for her if she finds me. the worst i think would be if my brother finds me. he just turned seven. he looks up to me and i need to be a good role model for him. i want to be there for him and him finding his sisters dead ass will be terrible. i donâ€™t even have words to describe how terrible it would be. i donâ€™t know what to do at this point. i canâ€™t be here but i canâ€™t not be here. i canâ€™t tell my parents about these thoughts because i need to be a good daughter for them. idk i hope no one reads this. itâ€™s dramatic and gross but i need to get it off my chest.
