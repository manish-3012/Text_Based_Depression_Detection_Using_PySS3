It's just..not interesting at allI commited suicide and no one knows except my mom and siblings and of course polices..I mean, I have NO ONE to tell my feelings. Should I talk about how I hate life with my mom or..how I cut myself with a razor? Lmao my siblings didn't even talk about this. I only love my grandma (she doesn't know this things.) and she is old, lmao scared to lost her. I know, I know maybe 2-3 people will read this and try to help me (that's mean everything), that's so..thanks but it's not helping anymore. Because EVERYTHING IS NOT GONNA BE OKAY. I think I found a way to kill myself easier ^-^ (hope it's works) so..if you're thinking like, "then why the fuck are you writing this if we can't help you?" Because I'm not asking for help. This is my goodbye. I love you all..who is suffer from depression, anxiety, bipolar and other menthal illness. And girl, (Her name is Revna ^-^) if you see this one day, you are the best person I've ever met. You tried to help me but..I didn't deserve you..I don't and won't deserve you..Please take care of yourself, I love you :')
