Called Suicide Hotline earlier tonight, didn't help, I'm not sure that I will ever be "fine"I am in love with someone who probably doesn't even register me as a "possibility". I'm sick of hearing that "you'll find someone else" or that "you're not really in love". I'm 27, and I feel completely hopeless.

I don't even have the words to convey my feelings. I hate myself, I hate the entire life leading up to me falling short in her eyes, and I hate whatever God may or may not be out there, because while I'm not some great person, I don't think I deserve to feel this deep, lightless pit in my stomach.

All I want is to take her hands in mine and just stare into her eyes. I feel like I could die happy, if I just felt like even for a moment, she cared about me in the same way I care about her, even if she could never feel as strongly.

I feel completely lost, and I have no will to keep going on. She was the reason I was trying to better myself, getting in shape and chasing a good, high paying job. Without the thought of us being together, nothing else in the world matters. No job, no amount of money, nothing could make me feel as complete as she made me feel whenever she came up to hug me.

Her sister said earlier tonight, she bets she'll be engaged by the end of the year, and as soon as she said it, I felt my whole world tumbling down. I want to be that for her. I want to start a new life with her, she is the one I looked at, when she was dancing and singing to her baby nephew, I thought "She's the one, she's the one I want to start a family with".

I feel like I've been so stupid, and I don't know that I am going to be able to survive this.
