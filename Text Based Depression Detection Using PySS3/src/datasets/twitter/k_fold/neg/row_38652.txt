I doubt I will ever try again after my first couple of failed attempts, but I still beg for non-existence.I attempted twice and both times survival instinct had completely overridden my desire to take my own life. Ive felt like a slave to my body for 3 years and the few minutes before my attempts, I thought I would finally be in control, but my body still managed to stop me. I felt a sense of regret but never had a clear idea of what I was regretting. I wonder if it was a lingering effect of my body trying to keep me alive.

I'm too scared to try again. Trying to hang myself and suffocate myself was so painful and the panic I went thru is something I never want to experience ever again. But I still want to leave this world. I wish there was an easier way for me to go but everything is in my way. I just feel so trapped.
