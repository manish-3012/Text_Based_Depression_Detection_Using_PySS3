Miserable for yearsI have been miserable for years. I have friends who loves me, and I do awesome things all the time. I may look happy on the outside to all of them, but I'm terribly miserable. I have no reason to be this miserable but I just am. I feel guilty knowing that there are people worse off than me toughing it out when all I want to do is just stop existing. I don't know what to do anymore but I can't take being this miserable much longer. :\
