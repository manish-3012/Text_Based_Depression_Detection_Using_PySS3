You know what I donâ€™t get?How people who have gone through things like the Holocaust and other massive tragedies are still here...like the survived horrible things and then chose to keep living. My pathetic ass has some PTSD and obvious depression, and I think about dying every single day. So how are they here and smiling and living their lives despite it all? I admire it so much, but I canâ€™t relate, and it makes me feel so much worse. 

My dad always told me that he had been depressed too before but he made â€˜because he just had toâ€™. Canâ€™t relate to that either. I donâ€™t feel like I have to. 

And the cherry on top of this shit is Iâ€™m a fucking mental health teacher in a prison. Like I teach coping skills and shit, and canâ€™t follow my own advice. I feel like such a lying treacherous snake when I look at my clients and tell them itâ€™ll get better, when I canâ€™t even convince myself of that. I teach that suicide is usually someone who doesnâ€™t necessarily want to leave the world but rather just wants the pain to stop. But I genuinely feel that I want to leave the world, as though I canâ€™t handle the suffering anymore. I try to watch these videos of survivors of things as motivation and I just came to the realization that theyâ€™re doing the opposite. 

Where does this strength and will to live come from?

I donâ€™t know.
