Needing helpNot that people give a shit, which is cool and all just need to vent. 
I got a text from my gf, or former gf at this point Idk, who has ignored me for the past month and all that went through my mind was damnit what does this bit*h want now, she was my best friend but ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸, and I legitimately can't handle my emotions being played with on a wim because she is board and lonely. She constantly wants to chat when it is convenient for her. It's fucking with my already screwed mental health issues and sending me back down the spiral into being suicidal again because I can't handle her shit and mine at the same time. Besides she's the only one I have right now because none of my friends are responding, its like I don't exist anymore so I might as well make it so I don't.
