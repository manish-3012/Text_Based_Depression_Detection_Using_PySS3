I have a prescription. Iâ€™m really contemplating suicide this week.Iâ€™m over everything. I have bpd and Iâ€™m so sick of how my brain is. I hate how I canâ€™t work anymore. I hate how Iâ€™m good for nothing but sex. Barely even good at that.

I have around 15-20 pills of quetiapine that was prescribed to help my bpd. All it did was make me dissociative. I have no therapist. I have no doctors.

I hate myself in every possible aspect. I hate how much of a leech I am - and I hate that the only part of my death I canâ€™t justify is how badly my best friend will hurt. He needs me to be his release. 

At the same time ; I know for a fact heâ€™ll just stone up and get on with life ðŸ˜‚ heâ€™ll be fine eventually ðŸ˜‚ everyone will ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

My family knows Iâ€™m sick ; my sister will just make fun of me even after I die ; my younger siblings have each other ; I can justify it all.

I get my car back from my best friend no later than Friday.

I drive to the top of the mountain.

I light a joint.

I take the bottle.

I canâ€™t think of any reason not to ; just got to make it to Monday I guess...
