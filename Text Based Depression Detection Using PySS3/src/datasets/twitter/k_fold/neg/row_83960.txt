I cant seem to get back upIve been coming up with a plan to end my life for 6 years now. i am a former police officer

6 years ago a woman I was seeing called the internal affairs dept and made allegations against me. She claimed I was meeting underage girls and having sex with them.

She claimed to have retrieved images and e mails from my computer which proved her allegations.
I am not going to go into an extreme amount of detail other than to say

The entire thing was a lie made up. Had I done anything even close to what she was saying I would be in state prison instead of writing this. After she made these allegations I suffered a minor heart attack. flash forward 18 months, the investigation into her allegations is done and they have nothing. 
I am so disgusted by the way I was treated by the dept that I resigned my position. I can no longer do that type of work because I cannot stand behind or work for a dept that so blatantly treated me like shit 

I cannot seem to get past this. I cannot seem to find a job and have been told straight to my face by one interviewer that I am too old.
I really miss my own line of work sometimes. I was good at it. I guess in light of current events with regards to cops everywhere this may not be such a bad thing

I do have a hefty life insurance policy tho and it will all go to my kids. In the end I will look like just another car accident victim.

I was able to find out why this woman did what she did.
She thought I was seeing someone else, someone younger than her and she thought that by going to my internal affairs dept and making these allegations that they would in the end report back to her with their findings. I cannot seem to wrap my head around her thinking. I really had no idea just how crazy she is.

anyhow, thank you to whoever takes the time to read this. I know I rambled and for that Im sorry. There is just so much more I could write but its too much to re live.
