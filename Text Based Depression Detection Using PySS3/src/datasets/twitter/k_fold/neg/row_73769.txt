Killing myself at 19 years oldIâ€™m currently 18 in college right now. Iâ€™m 100% sure that I want to die. Thereâ€™s nothing I want to do with my life except kill myself. I used to have dreams of wanting to get a gf and eventually raise a family and have a good career, but I donâ€™t want any of that anymore. Iâ€™m too defective of a human being to have any of this. I do nothing to improve myself. Iâ€™d rather just end everything rather than go deeper down the never ending spiral of misery and loneliness.

In fact, I want literally nothing in life except death. I want it as soon as possible.
