I don't see a way out and I know its all my fault.I am currently an admitted student at a UC and newly graduated from high school. Every one tells me this should be an incredibly joyful time in my life full of new possibilities. I've ruined all of that for myself. I cannot explain why because I don't know why, but I procrastinated in submitting my final grades and completing an online course for my transcript. I had a C in a Spanish 2 course my Sophomore year and decided this year to try and retake it for a better grade online as advised by my counselor. As a result, I put that grade in as an incomplete class in my initial application to colleges. I've been admitted, but haven't completed that course and I'm 98% sure it's too late to do anything about it. As some of you may know, failure to submit a final transcript results in loss of admittance. In addition, inconsistencies in a transcript can result in the same consequence. This transcript is due Monday, and I just sent my old high school counselor a pathetic email begging for help I doubt she can give me. I'm facing the loss of my future. Everything has spiraled out of my control due to my own stupidities. I want to end it. I'm a waste of space. There's no need for me here. I might as well be dead if not in college. I was going to major in biochemistry, be a doctor, and make my mom proud. Now, I'm nothing. I may as well be literally dead to her in addition to figuratively. Help me. No one can help me, and it's all because of me. I know this May seem petty to some because of the gravity of other problems on here, but, to me, this is devastating and I'm having a real problem seeing the light at the end of this tunnel. It's just all dark.
