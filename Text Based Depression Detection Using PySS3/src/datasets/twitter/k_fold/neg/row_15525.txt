Reason to liveI have no reason to live. I don't really want to achieve anything. I don't even know what I like doing (something productive I mean). I don't want to imagine the pain my parents would go through if I killed myself. I'm pretty sure I've been dead mentally for years, I am alive physically just for them. I see no purpose in my life. I go to college for them, I am constantly afraid I will disappoint them with my college grades. I have few friends and I am rarely happy, I thought getting into a relationship would help, it doesn't.
What should I do? I don't know for how long I can keep living like this. How can I find a purpose for my insignificant life?
