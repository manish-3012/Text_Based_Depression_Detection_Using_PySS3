I don't deserve happinessMy life is falling apart. I feel like a burden, I feel like nobody will ever truly love me, and, quite honestly, I don't see why they should. Many people are jealous of my achievements, but I never feel good enough, I never meet my own expectations, and I don't think I ever will. I have these recurring depressive phases where I'm usually very close to doing it, but even when I'm alright, I feel like I don't deserve to live - I feel like the only moments where I see myself in a realistic light are the ones where I'm suicidal. I can't get help, I have to keep pretending that I'm fine because my mother is very sensitive to health-related problems and she'd sure as heck have a mental breakdown if she learned that her daughter has issues. I couldn't do that to her. But still, my boundaries to take the final step go lower every day.
