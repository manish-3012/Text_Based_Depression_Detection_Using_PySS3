I feel inadequateIm not even sure if this is the right sub i guess its me "crying for help". I thought i kicked the pain, the depression, i had seen such brighter days before this covid bullshit... lost my job and have been struggling for months with mental health and finances and within the last week it finally came back.. the urge.. that terrible numbing feeling that i just wanna go cause its not like im waking up looking forward to much. My girlfriend keeps me anchored well i really adore her infact probably the only thing i stick around for, shes doing so much better than me right now and supporting the financial basis of the relationship for the most part. I still cant seem to find a job or anything to keep me going i mean i know this all sounds ridiculous but its been almost 9 months and i dont think i can keep up anymore. Again idk if this is the right sub but maybe someone out there has some tips to help keep afloat? As alone as i feel i know i cant be.. sorry if message seems scrambled, my mind is too.
