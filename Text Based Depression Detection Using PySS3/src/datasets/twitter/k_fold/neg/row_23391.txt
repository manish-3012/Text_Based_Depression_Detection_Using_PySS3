I can't do it anymore. I can't keep feeling this painIt sucks. Every day sucks. If I knew that there was a chance that one day the pain will be over, I might be able to hold on. But there isn't. I don't see how anything can get better. Life sucks. It's my fault, and I blame myself. Which makes it even worse. I can't take the loneliness and pain and self-hatred.

I'm sorry.
