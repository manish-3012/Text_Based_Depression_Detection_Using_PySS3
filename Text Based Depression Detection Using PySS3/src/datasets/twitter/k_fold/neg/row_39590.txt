Hitting rock bottom again...I posted here a while ago with my entire background. 

Well I was feeling better for a little while and now Iâ€™m back here again. Iâ€™m so fucking sick of yo-yoing. I was in a perfectly fine mood earlier, and then my phone charger stopped working and now I want to kill myself. I am so fucking sick of little things like that setting me off. I am so sick of laying next to my sleeping husband, sobbing because I want to die, and then pretending to be at least a little better when he wakes up. 

I want to die and I could do it so easily. I have so many pills for all my different medical issues... beta blockers that will drop my heart rate too low. So many different opioids from my surgery. Rizatriptan. Gabapentin. Xanax. Trazodone. I have a sandwich bag full of old pills I am supposed to take  to dispose of for my dad. Iâ€™m so close to doing it.
