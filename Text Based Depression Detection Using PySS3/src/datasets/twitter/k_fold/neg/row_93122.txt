(x-post from r/depression) How do you get people to understand issues in society that they'll never see firsthand?I keep trying to write a post, get a bunch of stuff down, and delete it all. Not even sure if this goes here, but yeah, I feel depressed, so why not?
I have HIV. I'm 23. Was diagnosed a little over 2 years ago. I have private insurance. My daily HIV medication is about $2,800 a month, and they require me to have my (life sustaining) medication mail delivered through a specialty pharmacy, where I have to call weeks in advance to schedule a home delivery.
My private insurance considers retail pharmacies "out of network providers" for this certain medication (the one that keeps me from dying), so if I go to the local Walgreens or CVS and get it, I will end up having to pay the $2,800 out of pocket - for just one month of medication.
Recently, I went through a move across the US and was short on medication. I'd done this before, call when I have pills for the next two days and they are able to expedite it. When I called last week, they couldn't have it delivered until the this week, giving me 2-3 days where I'd be out of medication. You might not be aware, but not having medication is very dangerous when you have HIV. You can acquire resistance to the medication that makes it ineffective, requiring you to switch to an older med, usually having more severe and numerous side effects.
Without any other option, what else am I supposed to do besides risk developing a more severe HIV strain? I've been struggling to make rent this entire past year, there's no way I can even think to afford almost $3,000 for 30 days of pills. I work part time. I make good money per hour, but I don't actually track many hours. I'd have to work at least 5 hours a day to afford to stay alive. I also have school loans to pay off, rent to pay, food to buy. I can't even possibly imagine the idea of ever having a family, because I don't see any way out of this pit that I find myself in. While I find it irresponsible to bring a kid or someone else into my situation, I lose hope when everyone else is moving on with their lives. I feel like I've been stuck in place for over 2 years just trying to stay alive, and I don't feel like I even am anymore.
When I've face issues like this, I go through a really rough patch. I get very "-cidal". First it was thoughts of self harm, cutting or a plan for my way "out" when I just can't take it anymore. However, my thoughts have warped to "if I'm going to develop untreatable HIV, I might as well give it to the people that are fighting to prevent me from living a healthy life". I think that I might as well hate-fuck some people so that they understand this internal struggle that feels like it's going to rip open my throat before I have the chance to. This struggle of "make money, but not too much money or you won't qualify for medicaid and it'll be harder to get meds". The struggle that I had sex with the wrong person once, and now society's greed is physically, mentally, and emotionally hurting me. How if I lash out and don't tell a sexual partner, I'm considered a criminal, when I just want to live - actually live, not worry about all this shit that I find myself in. The worry is the thing that is driving me crazy, but no one understands.
No one understands the things they don't see or feel or deal with. Things like this are taboo to talk about, so how do you even make them understand how you're feeling when you can't even talk about it? When people do ask how I'm feeling, I say "fine", but I'm really thinking "Where the fuck do I even begin?". When you feel so disconnected from reality, like you're living in your own personal nightmare, and you can even logically see how fucked you are, how do you even begin to make things better? I don't want to take the easy way "out", but I don't understand how to get this rock off my chest without my whole world crashing down in the process.
Sorry if this has been an unintelligible load of crap. I just don't know anymore, and I just can't keep caring.
