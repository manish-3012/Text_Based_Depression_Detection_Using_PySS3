Okay, cry for help maybe, feeling so depressed but hopeful I can get out of it extreme depressive stateHello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So, I have a very unique situation that most might not be able to relate to, or if you can then great. I was at one time last year a successful person, had two degrees. Then I decided I was not happy with my relationship, my girlfriend grab my pistol and threatened to kill me with it and then herself. I was able to get away, then she said she was going to kill herself and I did not want her to do that because I did care for her and still do. I came back (biggest mistake of my life). I went into the house she point the gun at my head and told me "say your last prays" as she said she was going to end my life there and then. She then told me that we were going to watch a show she wanted to see one last time. She ended up doing this and then I got away called 911 she told the police that I had struck her 4 days prior, which was completely untrue, and I had a taser cartridge in my chest. I was arrested for domestic related charges, she was arrested the next morning and I was still in completely shock. I lost my job as a security director for a local university, I did not have any prospect or anything.. I had to start over as my degree were in psychology and criminal justice.

Basically, I went to work at a dog food factory one week later, and truly never have processed this event in my mind. My ex plead to a felony and other domestic related charges. She got 3 years probation, and I fought hard ended up getting a pretrial diversion to get the charges removed after 2 years. I am not 11 months into this agreement and since we are both under court supervision we are not suppose to have any kind of contact. Her PO contacted me to give stuff back even though she already has everything she owned. Her PO does not believe me and I told them I no longer have any of her stuff. I have finally gotten back on my feet more then a year after this life-changing event and I have become really depressed because talking about this to the PO and everything has brought all the repressive feeling and despise I have for her back to the surface. I truly feel like going out with my car driving into the country and killing myself, but I do not know why I also have so much hope for the future. It feels like my ex is not just trying to get back at me for telling on her, she told the court she was not really going to kill me and that her intent was to only scare me into staying. 

She had a history of trying to say she was going to kill herself so that I would stay, she was s insecure that she would say I cheated on her when I only wanted her. I chose to end the relationship because she accused me again of cheating and I told her everytime where I was when I was and started to feel like she was everywhere, not only because of who she was , but what she said she would do if I ever cheated on her again??? I never did in the first place. She made me scared to be myself and I am a big guy (6'5) she is 5'4 why does she have do much power over me? I never struck a women in my life. I am just depressed because my choice in a women has led to my life being the way it is. I have even re-enrolled in school to better myself and actually am in school to become a therapist. I do not know what I can do. I really just need help processing this and anything will help. Please really I just need some help!! Words, anything will be so fucking helpful, I feel empty, helpless and a guy should not feel this way about a women I loved.
