I've thought about it lots, ironically I'm scaredI've considered taking my life on several occasions. The reason I'm scared is because how it would effect my children. I'll a married father of 5 beautiful children whom I all love dearly and they love me the same. I have fought with depression for awhile now not even knowing for the 1st few years what to call it. I deal/dealt with the most basic problems in life money &amp; drugs  which lead to relationship issues. I lost my mom/best friend almost 3yrs ago, who was my everything I'm a self proclaimed momma's boy. From there things got worst by the second. My family fell apart, my dad, brother, sister, some aunts and uncles stop seeing eye to eye and cause me to resent a few ppl. The only reason I haven't gone through with it is because of my kids. I know at the end of the day it's the wrong thing to do, it's just a phase, there will be better days ahead, my situation is mold in comparison to others. I get all that but when you constantly go backwards in life no matter how hard you try, and try and stay positive. It comes to a point when you feel like there is no other alternatives. Deep down I KNOW! I don't wanna do this, but I feel I'm running out of fight. I don't even know why I'm making this post, because I think I've heard every solution to try and fix my problems with a zero percent success rate thus far but I figured can't get any worst by posting this.

TL,Dr I've considered suicide lots of times but never attempted it, I suffer from depression which led to financial, relationship, drug and family problems
