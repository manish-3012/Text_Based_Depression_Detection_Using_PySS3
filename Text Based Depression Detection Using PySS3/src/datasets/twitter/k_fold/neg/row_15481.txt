I donâ€™t think I want to kill myself right now, I just want to not be alive anymore.Christmas was horrible like it always is. My dadâ€™s still dead, my momâ€™s still a drunk, I still have no friends and am single and alone. I spent the holiday like I always do, binging on shitty food and drinking too much, pretending that I donâ€™t care that Iâ€™m lonely and that my family insults me every waking minute. I didnâ€™t spend one hour without thinking about just ending it. Every year, I try to tell myself, â€œjust one more year and things will get better.â€ And every year, nothing changes. Iâ€™m more alone, poorer, more depressed. Why should I try for another shitty year?
