Get married or get hangedSo... Many dark situations around this forum, ain't it? I feel like I have no right to complain. I will talk about myself a little, nevertheless, and hope it does not sound superficial.

Im a middle class brazilian man, 28 yo. A journalist. The old sort of professional that is going through extinction. 

I've been dating a girl for the last 9 years and now she is arranging everything for marriage. There where no decision making, no kneeling in public with rings and stuff. Just procrastination to consense.

Things should be nice. But they make me sweat instead. Look, I never had no parents, I have no idea how to raise a kid. Or take care of a home. At work, my bosses should notice at any seccond that a bot can probably do my job.

I am not a vermin, though. If I decide to play a parody of a happy 50's coupple, I can do it.

My doubt is... To run, to kill my self out of fear, etc... Or to face a life that looks so strange to myself.
