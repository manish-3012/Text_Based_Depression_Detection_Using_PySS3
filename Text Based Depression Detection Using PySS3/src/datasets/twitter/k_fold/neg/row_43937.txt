I messed upNearly 3 years since I was in a psych ward. 

Last night was my SO's matric dance (think senior prom). I'm 1 year older. 

Anyway it started so well. But I wasn't feeling well and was being awkward on my phone. One thing lead to another and she went to cool off / cry in the bathroom of the venue with 5 friends to support her. I knew I did something wrong but I just felt confused and scared. Her friends individually insult me or tell me to leave her alone. I sit on the floor outside the bathrooms for 40 minutes without knowing what's going on. She comes out and now I just want to go home. 

We head back to hers and I just break down crying, which I never do. I felt so attacked and like I messed everything up. We go to bed and I leave the next morning. 

We discussed our emotions, how I don't open up enough and she constantly says "I know I hurt you but - you didn't tell me what's wrong / my night was ruined too" 

I know this was her night, I know it was meant to be special for her. And I just stole that opportunity from her because I made her feel anxious (she has high functioning aspergers and GAD). I stole the chance she had to remember the night fondly or to dance more with her girlfriends. 

I just feel like the worst boyfriend in the world right now, we've been together for 2 years and 3 months and I've never messed up so badly. 

I think I should just die and make everyone happier. 

My ex is a good person too but I messed up and she hates me 3 years forward. I think I just can't be a good partner if these good, kind people meet me and have their emotions hurt and ruined. I'm just a bad person so if I die, no one else will suffer.

I'm sorry , I know I left out details I'm just very tired.
