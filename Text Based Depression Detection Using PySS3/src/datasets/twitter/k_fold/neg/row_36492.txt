Violent ThoughtsHey, I'm 15 years old and I have Bipolar,ADHD and anxiety/social anxiety. That's all about me.

Anyways, what I do is isolate in my room all day, I leave my room maybe a few times to use the restroom or to get a snack. I see no future for me, like I'll be lucky if I make it to my 16th birthday (my birthday is on April 10th) and like I have the tendency to think about and think in depth how I'm going to cause chaos. I'm  not a really violent person but these thoughts are taking me over, and one day I'll get fed up with these thoughts and actually commit a mass murder and or a violent act.
