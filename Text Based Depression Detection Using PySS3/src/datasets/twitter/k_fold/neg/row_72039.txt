Life's Good.For the first time in a long time life is really good. I can't actually point to anything material that should bother me; I just landed a job, I'm about to graduate college, I have a good relationship with my girlfriend, I generally enjoy my friends, etc. With that being said, I still feel empty all the time. I don't know where my passion went if I had any, but I don't want to actually do anything. I want to chill in bed and watch Netflix until I'm tired and sleep again. When things were bad and I felt this way and had suicidal thoughts my hope was "well at least things will get better." Now things are by all objective accounts, better, and I still feel so heavy and empty. What am I suppose to hope in? Do people just love their whole lives like this?
