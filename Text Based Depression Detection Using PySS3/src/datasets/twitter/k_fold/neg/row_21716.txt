I need advice(bad grades, anxiety and suicidal thoughts)I'm having a real bad time at college and life overall, i started college this year, and i have 17 years old, that is some kind of conquest to most people in my contry, but i'm falling behind, and with anxiety and suicidal toughts things are going pretty bad. Now, i think i'm going to fail most of my grades, even the easy ones, this will beÂ a very shameful experience and i don't want more of those, i don't have friends and my Family does not help in any way possible, even after i already tried to overdose myself some times in the past years.I also have other sea of problems but i think for now bad grades are the most draining thing, cause the only thing i had going well was good grades in high school, without them i'm really nothing.

So i'm going to ask what can i do to minimize the problems, or what you would do in this situation, cause starting over after this will be really hard, also how can i keep away the suicidal toughts andÂ self-loathing, i don't have anything to overdose now if i had i was going to end my suffering, but i don't have any painless way right now.
