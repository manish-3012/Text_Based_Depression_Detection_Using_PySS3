I probably actually deserve to die...I took my current boyfriends virginity, and i deeply care about him. But at the same time, im very jealous. I am a sexual assult survivor, and I am so fucked up from it that I slightly resent that he had someone who cared about him for his first, meanwhile I had someone thrusting himself into me, and when I cried out in pain telling me to "shut up its supposed to hurt". I want to kill myself for even being remotely jealous about that since I actually love this guy and I dont want to wish bad things, but it hurts me so much and I feel so alone. I dont know what to do...
