At what point do you condone suicide?Don't say never, because that is bullshit.

If someone cannot hold down a steady job, is that the point?

If someone cannot maintain positive relationships, is that the point?

If someone knows their genetics put them in a position to only be a drain on society, is that the point?

For reasons of job, education, shame, self hate, virgin, etc. I'm sure I am far past this point. Before I go I would like to get your opinions about this question.
