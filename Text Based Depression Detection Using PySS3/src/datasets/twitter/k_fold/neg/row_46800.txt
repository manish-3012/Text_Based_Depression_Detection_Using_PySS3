IdkI donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m on here, Iâ€™m not suicidal although I was at one point. Working out actually does miracles, therapy and drugs arenâ€™t bad, but really, just a good fitness routine goes a long way too. Regardless, Iâ€™ve just been feeling really down lately. Iâ€™ve failed in all Iâ€™ve wanted to succeed in and some days I do still just wish some of this would end. Iâ€™ve never had the guts to actually do it, not even when I really wanted to. Iâ€™d say some stupid excuse like how, â€œpeople would miss meâ€ or how â€œI could go somewhere in lifeâ€ or how â€œI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s beyond deathâ€ but every excuse just made me feel worse. I just wanted to end it and now I guess Iâ€™m kind of afraid thatâ€™s coming back. Schools gotten ALOT harder, relationships have gotten ALOT more complicated, and although I try and try, no matter what, I can never seem to accomplish my dreams nor get better at what I want to get better at. The shit Iâ€™ve ALWAYS wanted to be good at, and the stuff Iâ€™ve practiced a lot has just seemed to get harder and harder the more I practice and I canâ€™t seem to get better. I know Iâ€™ll never be able to do what I want to do when Iâ€™m older at this rate. I just canâ€™t imagine how some people do, then I think of how many people have and it makes it so much worse. Iâ€™m just tired all the time and I donâ€™t really have any more drive. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s school or what, but then I look around, see Iâ€™m at the tail end of most of my classes and feel even worse that something thatâ€™s THIS easy to some could be so hard for me. I just feel like Iâ€™m a failure at everything that matters and if thatâ€™s all I am now, then what will ever make me worth anything when Iâ€™m older, when I NEED to succeed at this stuff. Right now, everythingâ€™s just a hobby, but when you need it to survive, when you canâ€™t live without a job, how will I stack up? How can I compete then if I canâ€™t now? Everything, even sports, which I have been beyond passionate about throughout my entire life, which I have practiced endlessly, which I have constantly conditioned myself towards, Iâ€™m just, kind of, decent at. Nothing worth paying me over, so then I turn to academics, then I fail at that too, and I donâ€™t know where to go. I wish there was a release, everyone has something. A passion, a hobby they have that lets them just let go when they want to scream and cry and shout over the stupid little annoying things in life, but Iâ€™ve never had that. I just want to be good at something I love, I just want to do something Iâ€™m passionate about later in life. So many people find that, why the fuck am I just so god damned, bad at everything I try.........I want it to end, please.
