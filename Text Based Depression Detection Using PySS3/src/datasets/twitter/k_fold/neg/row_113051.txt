I've done everything I canI've tried my hardest to be happy. Made an effort to hang out with friends...but it's always awkward and I'd rather just be alone. I don't have any redeeming qualities. I'm not smart enough for it to matter, can't get a decent job, not pretty enough for anyone to love, not funny enough to have any close friends. I'm tired of trying. The world is just full of misery and it's never going to be worth it. I'm in my mid 20s and still being financially supported by my parents and I feel pathetic. My dog died last week and so I basically said goodbye to the last thing that brings me joy. I'm not good at anything, and I just feel like a massive waste of space. I'm fat and ugly and surrounded by beautiful women all the time who have friends and boyfriends and successful careers. I'm sick of trying to be skinny, to be pretty, to be successful, to have enough money to be financially independent, to be good at art, to be good at anything, to be likable, to be an adult with a clean apartment and a fridge full of food instead of a mess who eats fast food for every meal. I don't feel like I can try any harder, and it's not enough. Everyone else seems to do life better than me with like 10% of the effort I put in and I'm sick of it. Being a human is too much...it's overwhelming. Plus I miss my dog. I really don't want to be alive anymore.
