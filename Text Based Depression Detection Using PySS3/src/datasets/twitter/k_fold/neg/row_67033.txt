i donâ€™t even knowi guess i just need to rant, none of my friends want to hear it so here we are. iâ€™m 10 months clean and thatâ€™s great and all but iâ€™ve never wanted to relapse more than i do now. and whatever i can handle that - i keep putting off relapsing until i eventually do it. but it sucks, anytime i hit a â€˜milestoneâ€™ i feel like itâ€™s not a big deal. iâ€™ve told my friends iâ€™m 10 months clean and they just say nice. theyâ€™ve both self harmed and not gotten as addicted to it as i am but still...? like i wanna feel appreciated. 

i also moved to another state and while that helped with my seasonal depression i know NOBODY except my parents and my coworkers. 

itâ€™s been quite almost a year since the last time i tried to kill myself and i donâ€™t wanna try again but i just wanna die. i would really apprentice it if a car hit me or i just didnt wake up. 

i donâ€™t know, iâ€™m not gonna do anything i just needed to rant so if you read this, thanks? i guess?
