I can help other people, but I can't even help myself. I'm a failure.Hi,

This will be short. I'm a 22M for reference

I have a few friends. One of them doesn't know this, but she is the reason I haven't ended it all. I love her, but not in a romantic way. In a bonding sort of way. She opens up to me about her feelings and insecurities, and I am always there for her. I'd drop everything for her at any time because SHE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I AM WANTED, AND THAT I MATTER. I haven't told her this and I'll take it to my grave.

I don't want her to know my thoughts. The last time I did I pushed her away and she left me for 2 years. I attempted to end it all but I couldn't. Something stopped me.

Even now, we haven't spoken for months and I feel scared to even text her. 

I'm sorry if this is too small a reason to be feeling this way.
