so dang tiredI have a neurological disorder that causes tumors to grow..at 4 days old my left leg broke thanks to a tumor in the bone..later lost that leg..theres been 27 surgeries.. my experience in adolescences has fucked me up..always anxious, depressed forever lol.

thanks to my medical issues I need medical, medical restricts one from making money..

idk I'm just so sick of it all...this illness will just get worse, and I'm stuck being forever poor.

I plan to leave soon, just trying to get some money for pills, and boxes for my things.

why the heck does life gotta be so brutal
