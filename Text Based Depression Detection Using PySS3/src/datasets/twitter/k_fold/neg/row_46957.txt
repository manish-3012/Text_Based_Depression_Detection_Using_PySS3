I'm concerned about myself but not sure if I should tell someone irlI've developed a habit of thinking "I want to die" when life is putting me in its vice grip. I think it over and over. I haven't had actual thoughts of suicide, just this overwhelming thought about how I wish *something* would put me out of my misery. I try to remind myself that there are other less drastic ways to "end" my problems and that I can always work my way back to whatever I'm committing time to worrying about but this recurring thought is always the first response these days and lasts a full 20-30 minutes initially. Given the less than stellar responses from those around me to my depression I'm not feeling confident enough to tell anyone I know. I've been thinking it over and over but I only just now felt up to making this post. I don't want to kill myself yet, I want to "quit" living, but it's honestly just semantics when I boil it down and I'm scared something could push my over that edge.
