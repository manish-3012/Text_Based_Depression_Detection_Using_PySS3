I dont even know man...I've lived a meh life so far, and it looks like its only getting worse from here on out. So i'm probably quitting b4 uni comes around. I am aware that it might cause sadness although i dont personally think so and/or really care about my peers to be honest. Since i was put in the state im in by them in the first place. Building yourself up is hard when your base is fucked kinda thing y'know?
