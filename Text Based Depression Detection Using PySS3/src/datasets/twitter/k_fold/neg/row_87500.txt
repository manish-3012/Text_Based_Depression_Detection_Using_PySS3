How can no one find out whatâ€™s wrong with me so I can be normal and enjoy life again?I havenâ€™t brushed my teeth or showered in 3 days and I go for days like this at a time for months now because Iâ€™m so low energy

My joints hurt and I never go outside cuz the cold hurts me like an old person and Iâ€™m only 23 

I only do the bare minimum to look good for work and always feel disgusting

I donâ€™t know why customers are even nice to me or like me at my job. I literally only have kindness and prettiness going for me. I feel stupid because my brain fog from malnourishment is so bad 

My stomach is constantly in pain and I am constantly scared of food or feel sick because of my health issue 

I have more tests coming up this week and after and if they canâ€™t find something to help me I am going to lose my mind

Iâ€™m at the end of my rope and have cut off almost everyone close to me but they donâ€™t realize Iâ€™m preparing for my own death in my mind 

I literally am suffering constantly and I donâ€™t even know what to tell work anymore because I call out so much 

I fear that everyone misunderstands me and thinks Iâ€™m not really sick because I saw a GI specialist who told me I look like Iâ€™m in perfect health

But I had to drop out of university twice now with only 3 classes to graduate because Iâ€™m too sick to make it to class

Anyone who knows me knows this isnâ€™t me

I spent my birthday, thanksgiving, Christmas and New Yearâ€™s Day alone in my room, not eating, just crying or staring at the wall

How can no one find out whatâ€™s wrong with me so I can be normal and enjoy life again?
