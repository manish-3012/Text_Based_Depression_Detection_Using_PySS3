What is going on?I donâ€™t really know where else to post this but Iâ€™ve been listening to a particular song for a while now and Iâ€™ve found that the more Iâ€™ve listened to it. It appears to have slowed down and sounds a bit distorted and different somehow. I swear it never sounded like this before. 

I also keep getting this weird sense of detachment and sometimes things appear to move like words on a screen. Or an object. 

I keep feeling like Iâ€™m being watched by someone or something. 
And one time I looked out the window and the sky was bright red, I was so confused but when I looked away then looked back it was normal again. 

It might be nothing and just me. Or it could be because Iâ€™m not eating properly. (Iâ€™m eating under 800 Cal everyday, sometimes itâ€™s below 500)
