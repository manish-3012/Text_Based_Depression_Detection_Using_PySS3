Iâ€™ll try again.I was taken to the hospital a couple of months ago when I absorbed 40 extra-strength Tylenolâ€™s. By the time I was discharged, I was optimistic and had created a plan for me to follow and improve my life. 2 months later, Iâ€™m exactly where I was at that point.  The newfound motivation didnâ€™t last and its even worse this time as Iâ€™m broke and lost the summer job I had due to my laziness. This Saturday, Iâ€™ll jump off the third floor and fall head first into concrete. I tried going higher but Iâ€™ve always been afraid of heights.
