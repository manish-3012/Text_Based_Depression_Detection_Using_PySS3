I just can't do this anymoreI hate myself. I hate myself.

Everything about me is wrong. I'm not tall, not handsome, not clever, not well adjusted. I'm short and ugly and strange.

I'm emotionally stunted. Fucked up in the head. My moods are out of control.

I'm clingy. I'm a stalker. I'm a monster. I'm the bad guy, the dark shadow, the starving man outside the restaurant window.

I'm pathetic. Weak. I can't do this anymore.

One person in the whole worls gave a fuck about me, and I'd have done anything just to keep her right there, just to make me feel like I wasn't totally alone, totally worthless. But I had nothing to offer her. She's gone and I'm left obsessing.

I hate this I hate everything. I'm exhausted by the weight of my own hatred. I want to just die. Die, be free. Feel nothing. 

I'm terrified. I just can't do this anymore. Please help me someone.
