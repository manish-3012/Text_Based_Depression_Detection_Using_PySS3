I think I might be readyEverything in my life has turned to shit. I've lost everything, including my potential. I have nothing to live for. Nothing I do helps. Nothing anyone says helps.

I have a text ready to be scheduled to someone so when I go my body can be taken down by the gardai before my family is home, but I don't even have a friend I can send it to. Just my ex who has already moved on, just further proving I'm nothing to be missed. 

I'm so alone. I have nothing. Nothing helps. 

I've deleted all my social media, this will be the last to go when the time comes

Edit: my family have an unspoken suicide watch in action. Ex girlfriend raised the alarm.
