It's all spiraling outI've never been the type to vent, but for some reason, this seems appropriate. I've spoken to a psychologist two years ago. I was diagnosed with GAD and minor Depression, most people say they go hand in hand, one causing the other. For two years I tried CBT, was on Zoloft for about 6 months, but I didn't feel like myself, and was wound of the medication to avoid withdrawl symptoms. Things started looking up, I was able to find a job that fulfiling and have really cool coleuges. i have a small circle of friends, and am in a relationship for 8 years. She's fantastic, supportive and we have talked about this before many times. The thing is, nothing, and I do mean nothing drives me any more. The things I used to love just don't make me happy any more, I stoped playing guitar after 10 years, I stoped reading, stoped making things out of electronics (which was my most passionate hobby). Every day, I wake up, thinking there really is no reason for me to go on, I can't see myself in my future any more, and the feeling is growing heavier every day. Anyone gone trough this phase before? Is there a way out? I would really appreciate your help.
