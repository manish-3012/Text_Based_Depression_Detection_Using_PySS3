Fuck lifeIm in hs and I had three amazing friends, i treated them badly because one of my friends was my bf at the time. Everything is settled but the damage is done, I see my ex eveeyday in class and I wanna cry to my hearts attent but i cant. Everday I hear my ex talk to people and act hoe we used to.
I cant evan eat lunch with my remabing two friends cause my ex is there.

 I seperated from everyone I held dear to me. And I cant handle it anymore i have no one to talk to and it feels like im glitching out. My hands are shaky and I dont know what I want to do so I would sit down than stand up than sit. If it wasnt for me having a cat I would have offed myself already
