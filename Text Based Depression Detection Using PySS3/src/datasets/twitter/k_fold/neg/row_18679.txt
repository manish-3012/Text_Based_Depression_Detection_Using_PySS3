grhshsbthfbdhjsIâ€™m out of options. Iâ€™m an 18 year old girl and I have schizoaffective disorder and autism on top of other debilitating mental illnesses. I live with my cousins and share a room with my mom who has stage 3 colon cancer. Despite being on chemo and radiation, sheâ€™s getting worse. I have no social life and was homeschooled since the 3rd grade due to my abusive ex-step father who isolated my mom and I 250 miles away from our family. Iâ€™m on disability and get $750 a month, not enough to live on my own with and besides, I couldnâ€™t leave my mom in her condition. I wouldnâ€™t be able to handle living alone anyway, I have psychotic breaks every few months. Iâ€™m not smart. My mom taught me to the best of her abilities but she was no teacher. Iâ€™m too poor to get into college and have nothing to put on my resume anyway. I donâ€™t know the first thing about being an adult or living in the real world. Iâ€™m a burden to everyone I meet. I canâ€™t have children because the idea of passing down this disease is too much to bear. I have no option but to kill myself. Life wasnâ€™t cut out for someone like me. My decision is final, Iâ€™ll end my life once my mom passes away. And seeing how things have gone for her recently, it shouldnâ€™t be too much longer. Is it bad to say I canâ€™t wait?
