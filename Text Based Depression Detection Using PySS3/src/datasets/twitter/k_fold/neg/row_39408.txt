I'm ready, I thinkMy wife came home to me, drunk, again yesterday. I keep trying to quit but I can't face the world without it. She screamed, we argued, she left. I assume she's saying with one of her sisters.

She's 22 weeks pregnant. 

Money is tight, because I spend too much on liquor. 

My father was abusive and probably depressed and I'm heading down that path, too. Even if I managed to stop for a month or three months or a year I'm eventually going to be home alone guzzling vodka. I'm not a kind person when I drink heavily. I hate myself when I'm like that.

I hate myself all the time these days.

I can't put a kid through that. I can't be the husband my wife deserves. I can't be a waste of time anymore.

I don't know how to compose a note. I don't know how to say that I love you so much that I can't burden you anymore. Or that the moment I found out about my kid was the single brightest thing that's ever happened, the one moment where I really thought this, this is where I'll get it together.
