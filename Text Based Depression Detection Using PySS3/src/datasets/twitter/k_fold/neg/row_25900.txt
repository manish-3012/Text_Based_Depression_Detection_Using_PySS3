Intrusive thoughts are making me feel broken and Iâ€™m not sure how else to dealI have violent intrusive thoughts thanks to my OCD

I cannot do this anymore

No matter what I do my brain wonâ€™t give me rest

Itâ€™s so painful


My life is otherwise good but my brain tortures me nonstop it hurt it hurts


Itâ€™s been like this for 15 years and itâ€™s getting worse
