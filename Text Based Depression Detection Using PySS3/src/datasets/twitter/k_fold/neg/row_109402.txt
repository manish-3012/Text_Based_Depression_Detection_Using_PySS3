Would anyone be willing to talk to me? My husband left againI feel so pathetic right now. So much of my self worth is wrapped up in this man and he left again like he always does. I told him that every time he leaves I get closer to actually going through with it but he doesn't care. He leaves because when we fight it escalates to violence. We fight because he lies to me.

I try so hard to be a good wife. When he leaves, I want to die. I see these veins in my wrist and I want to shred them. I tell him this and he still won't come home to help me. I don't even know where he is right now. 

The only thing stopping me is this beautiful dog we adopted together. One day that isn't going to be enough.
