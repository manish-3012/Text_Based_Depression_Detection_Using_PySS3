this is unimportantif you read this, go focus on someone else on this sub that needs the help more.


i've been dealing with depression and anxiety for almost 5 or 6 years now. 
i always knew i wouldn't make it to 18 and i feel like this is going to stay through.

i made some progress. i felt better for some time.
then i didn't.

things happened. i'm dealing with ptsd now and i act like it's the worst thing ever even though what happened to me is nothing compared to others.

i just took apart a razor.
i haven't cut since november. was two years clean before that.

i just wanna slash up my whole body. 
just a bunch of small, little cuts til i'm fucking covered in blood.
i'm so angry at myself. 
i fucked up all my problems by letting myself be assaulted.
and now i'm back at this fucking low point.

i wish i had a gun.
half a year til i can buy one.
don't know if i can wait.

i have a rope, but my ceiling wouldn't hold my weight. 
my best bet would be trying to overdose on caffeine pills, but the dose i have here would probably not be enough.

i just want a sure way to die.
i just want to punch the walls til my wrists break.

i hate everything.
