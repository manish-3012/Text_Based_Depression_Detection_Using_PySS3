How do I know when I'm unsafe.My rapist is going free. What he did apparently didn't count. 

I've been abused my whole life and when I finally got the courage to come forward against the most recent person to hurt me. No one believed me. Or they did believe me and thought it didn't count. He is going to get away with it and do what he did to me to other women. Maybe this is because I deserved it. Maybe they are right, maybe it isn't that bad. 

I want to die so, so, so, so badly. I close my eyes and just pray that when I open them I'll be dead. I don't think I would ever kill myself. But I don't want to live. And I do have a plan for how I would go if I worked up the courage. 

I don't know how to know if I am unsafe. And I also don't know if I care, because I kind of hope if I am I don't get the help I need. Thinking of continuing to live day after day in a world where I can just be hurt with no recourse is too much. 

What do I do?
