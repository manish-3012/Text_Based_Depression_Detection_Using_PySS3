I wish I could end it now, but for the sake of my grandmother, I have to wait.My grandma has cancer, doctors say she has maybe a year. She's the only one that has ever felt like a parent to me. My family is all fucked up. I have no friends. I'm 17, senior in highschool. I should be there right now. I missed 60 out of 90 days last semester from waking up depressed, and sleeping 14+ hours a day. Video games used to be my escape, but lately even that isn't working. I plan on killing myself the day of my grandmothers funeral.
