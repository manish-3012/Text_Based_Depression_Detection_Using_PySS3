Thinking of committing Suicide on my birthday (2 days from now)I wrote out my note today, after a row with my parents I still live with (Iâ€™m a nearly 30 year old loser). Itâ€™s just this decision is the only one that makes sense and that has made sense in a long while. Itâ€™s sort of as if my whole life has been going to this direction forever. As if itâ€™s meant to be. I was thinking to overdose on sleeping pills, Valium and absinthe - whilst also leaning into a strangulation set up from my wardrobe. I was thinking to do it on my birthday which is 2 days from now. Basically I ruin everything and Iâ€™m not a nice person.
