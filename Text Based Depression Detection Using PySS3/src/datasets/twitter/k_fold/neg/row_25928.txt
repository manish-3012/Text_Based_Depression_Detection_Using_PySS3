Iâ€™m too comfortable to move forwardTo lose weight. To work on my self esteem, to learn how to properly cope with my mental illness. Itâ€™s too late for that, and honestly I canâ€™t go through the effort. Itâ€™s true what they used to say on r/fatpeoplehate. Weâ€™re nothing but a leech for government resources in the long run. We waste food that could go to other people. I understand. Iâ€™m a parasite, and itâ€™s wrong of me to even try to change. Easier and better for it to end quicker. At least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m trying to build the courage to do right now. The world is unfair and unless you win the genetic lottery or get incredibly lucky your life is probably going to be shit and you wonâ€™t get to experience a normal childhood or even adulthood. Life is cruel, the fact that weâ€™re sentient is cruel, living is cruel. Iâ€™m done.
