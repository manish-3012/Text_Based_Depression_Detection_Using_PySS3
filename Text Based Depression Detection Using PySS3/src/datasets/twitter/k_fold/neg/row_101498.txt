I plan on grabbing it.These thoughts of pulling the trigger are getting to me, while everyone's out of the house I'm going to bring it with me to "The Spot", I hope that I have the balls to actually do it... I'm tired, weak, and exhausted,  both mentally and physically. Just a pathetic joke that has been going on for far too long.
