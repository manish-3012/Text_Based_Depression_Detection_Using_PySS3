TiredI just got out of an abusive relationship. I loved her and respected her so much. Even after everything, I want her to find love and lead a happy life. Iâ€™ve had suicidal ideation before but I knew I wouldnâ€™t do it. This time is different. The only thing bothering me is feeling bad for whoever finds me dead. I have a few ideas on how to do it. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll survive, and then Iâ€™ll have to deal with people being disappointed with me, not that they already arenâ€™t. Sheâ€™s blaming me for being abusive, while I wasnâ€™t. I didnâ€™t do anything. I was in so much pain in order to make sure she was happy. I didnâ€™t care about myself, and I still donâ€™t. At least then I had hope for the future. I donâ€™t really have anyone to live for now. There will be some people whoâ€™ll miss me, but they have support. I know theyâ€™ll be fine. Iâ€™m just so tired of being alone. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this.
