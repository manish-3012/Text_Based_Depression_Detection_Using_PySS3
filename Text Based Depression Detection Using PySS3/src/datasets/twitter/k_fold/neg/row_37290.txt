I'm slowly drinking myself to deathAnd I feel absolutely nothing close to regret. With the state of the world, and after losing my job, I'm finding it impossible not to want to just destroy myself. 

I had been a year sober when the quarantine happened. About two weeks later I'm selected as one of the handful of employees laid off from my company. (I'm using a throwaway for a reason)

I am safe, and have plenty of savings. I've been married seven years to a wonderful man. My home is comfy, albeit small and it has some problems. I have more than enough time to really enjoy my hobbies now.

But.

Part of me still wants to die. 

When I was a teen, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. The multiple medications we tried and therapy only seemed to make my case worse, and at some point I ruined my life by getting addicted to drinking. 

As I said, it took some time but I finally kicked the alcoholism, for a solid year, but this whole mess just brought me right back to it. Nothing comforts me anymore, not even my amazing husband and life, and I don't want to exist anymore. I'm scared to go to therapy, with the virus being so prevalent in America, because I don't want to catch it and pass it to him. 

I don't mind if I die, because honestly I'm a waste of oxygen, but he's at risk and doesn't deserve it. 

I know I need to quit. My foot has been numb for days now either because all I can do anymore is sit in bed, or I drink a 24 pack of beer in two nights, but either way I'm finding it hard to not slowly kill myself by drinking every night. 

I've contemplated sleeping pills, but im too scared to go that route. I'm drinking right now, and I just want to end it, despite how good I've got it.

Seems hollow if im not worth anything at all.
