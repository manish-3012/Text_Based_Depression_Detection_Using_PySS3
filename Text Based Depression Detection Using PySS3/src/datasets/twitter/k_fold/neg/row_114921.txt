Throwaway for obvious reasonsWhat, in your opinion is the most efficient and clean way of killing myself? I don't want to have an option to go back on my decision or have someone do it for me, so meds are out of question. I don't want to feel much pain or have it take long, so cutting veins is out of question as well. I don't want to jump in front of a train or anything like that, it would create delays for unassociated people and traumatize the staff.

Any ideas?
