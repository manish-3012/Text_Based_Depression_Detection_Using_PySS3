I'm gonna do itI have a date set on when I'm going to kill myself. Recent events have proven to me that I'm not worth enough for this world and I can't continue living like this. My whole world has fallen apart. I'm basically alienated immediately by anyone I meet. I'm gonna end it on the 4th.... I don't have a method picked yet but it's probably gonna be overdose. I have the meds to mix in the right way so that I will actually die. Not really looking for sympathy or empathy. Just wanted to post this (say this)  outloud.
