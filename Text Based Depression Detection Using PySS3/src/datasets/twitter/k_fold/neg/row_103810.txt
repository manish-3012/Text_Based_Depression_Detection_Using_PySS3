I donâ€™t have timeGo to someone if you need help or if you feel like hurting yourself. Let someone know. Thatâ€™s what weâ€™re always told. I have told everyone I want to die but am told in multiple ways that they donâ€™t have time for me. 

To day is the 21 year anniversary of my brothers suicide and i have been hit with severe depression unrelated to this time of year. I have been drowning in thoughts of suicide and the more I seek out help the more I want to kill myself as I realize no one cares and is too busy with their own lives and their own problems. It hurts so much to know that everyone I love is willing to just sit back and watch me fade away but itâ€™s the motivation I need to move forward. I even told my mom today and all she could do was tell me to calm down and guilt trip me for acting like this on the anniversary of my brothers death. I told her it should make her more sensitive to my problems and she said â€œI love you but I donâ€™t have time to talk about this.â€ 

You people have no right to tell suicidal individuals to seek help. You have no right to minimize our issues so much by even assuming anyone would give two shits about us to help. We only got this far because we DID seek out help and those we sought help from only served to push us further to the edge with their general disinterest in our pain.
