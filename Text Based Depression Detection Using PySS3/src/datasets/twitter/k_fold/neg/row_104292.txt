I'm not interesting, and I just fucked up a chance for some honest-to-god socialization.I just can't be normal. It's official. I get anxious, and nervous too easily.

I have been trying over the last year to step outside of my comfort zone. Be less introverted. Let more people into my life. So to that end, I organized a little eat-out date with some friends and acquaintences. I made a big mistake,

I was completely outgunned at that table. I brought everyone together and they had little to no interest in what I had to say. These people have *lives*, you see. Interesting, fruitful lives, with lots of experiences that they had no problem with sharing. They hardly asked about me. So caught up in what they had to say to each other. I felt marginalized. Worthless. Exposed for being a completely shallow, boring, shit person.

I'd kill myself right now if it were easy. I just want people to ask about what I'm doing, and while I want to know about my friends lives', of course, I feel like I need to talk and discuss my situation.  
I don't know if I'll ever speak to them again. Maybe I'll wait. See if they want to talk to me first. See if they'll show some mild amount of interest in what I am. I have alot to offer, I swear I do. I love video games, crazy anime, tv shows, music, all sorts of things. I want to share my thoughts, but no one asks for my opinions.   


What's sad is that this post will be buried in a matter of hours. One, maybe two replies. But itll be forgotten. Just like me. So, I guess i'll just disappear.
