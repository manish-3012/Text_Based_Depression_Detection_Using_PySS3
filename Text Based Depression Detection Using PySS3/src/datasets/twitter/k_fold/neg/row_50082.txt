Plan postponed but the suffering continuesI decided to postpone for a few more days my plan. My ex who is fully aware of what I intend to do, asked me to reconsider and postpone it. I saw the pain in his eyes and said yes. But i dont know if i intend to keep that promise.

I still love him so much. I know its never going to work because he's married now. But i dont know how to live in this world where the love of my life is building OUR dream with somebody else. I know its selfish but I want him for myself.

I want to run away as far as possible. If only i can bring him with me. If only we can be together in this lifetime. If only his face is the last and first thing I see in the mornings. Life would be better. Life would be so much better when he's with me.

If only I can just cease to exist. There's no point of living when all you try and you ever wanted keeps on getting taken away from you. All i want are the simple good things. I just wanted a simple happy life with him. I want him. I just want to be with him. I know im selfish. And stupid. But i cant seem to move past this. I dont think i'll ever will.
