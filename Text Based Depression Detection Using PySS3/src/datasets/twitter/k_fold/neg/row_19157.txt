Every day I think about itIâ€™m 21 (f) and I know thatâ€™s young. Severely depressed and anxious my whole life and have been to therapy multiple times. I just feel like Iâ€™m so much more fragile and unable to cope than those around me. Iâ€™ve been having serious issues with money lately and every day I think about ending my own life. Every time Iâ€™ve asked for help from my parents theyâ€™ve been so disappointed in me. I know people will miss me I know itâ€™s selfish Iâ€™ve seen all of the â€œdonâ€™t do itâ€ videos Iâ€™m just so tired. Iâ€™m so tired and I feel like struggling any longer isnâ€™t worth it. I feel like all of my life Iâ€™m just going to be struggling to earn money and to what end.
