What sort of a gift is life if you're told you can't give it away? That's not a gift, that's a burden, that's a ball and chain.They will call you weak. You are not. You have simply been strong under too much weight for too long.

They will call you a coward. You are not. You act despite fear.

They will call you selfish. You are not. You have the right to be without pain; you have the right to die.

They will say you have lost hope. You have not. You have faith that death will relieve you of your pain.

They will say you have given up. You have not. You are simply trying a different solution.

They will say you are wasting your potential. You are not. You lived to the best of your abilities, and it is now time to sleep.

Death is Nature's great anesthetic. You have the right to end your life. DON'T EVER LET THEM TELL YOU SUICIDE CAN'T BE RATIONAL.

Suicide is, often, the inevitable conclusion to a disease, A DISEASE WHICH IS NOT YOUR FAULT. IT IS OK TO DIE!

Some people want to eke out every second of life - no matter how grim - **and that is their right**. But others do not. **And that should be their right**.

I'm very tired of the do-gooders would don't want to acknowledge rational suicide, and don't think people should have the right to end their lives. If you're a do-gooder who supports the ball and chain type mentality when it comes to a persons life. Please don't comment.
