Bouts of apathy for the past two years.I don't understand. I lead a good life, with close friends and I've got a good future ahead of me. Even if that weren't the case, I have many people who would support me if I fell on hard times, and I've got a lot of lee-way. I know what I want to do with my life, I have self-confidence, et cetera et cetera. 

Still, even though I laugh everyday, and can smile earnestly, I honestly don't feel like keeping going, as selfish as it sounds. Whenever I wake up and have to fulfil my social responsibilities I think of how much easier it would be if I just didn't exist, and how much more pleasant it would be to not live. 

I've never been good at describing my emotions through words, but I guess I've been feeling like life is nothing but a chore for the past two years. And the worst part is that while I don't have much desire to live, this issue isn't really serious compared to what plenty of other people go through on a day-to-day basis, either. It's some kind of annoying inbetween.

Sorry for the rambling post.
