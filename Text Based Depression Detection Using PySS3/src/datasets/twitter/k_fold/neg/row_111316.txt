Having a hard time feeling things clearly.Had a suicide attempt about 4 months ago. Started feeling better with medication and therapy. Discontinued psychedelics which helped push me towards suicide. I now get crippling anxiety around the friends I had before my suicide attempt. Yesterday I almost blacked out during a panic attack. I've set up a schedule and tried to stick to it but have a really hard time sleeping. My girlfriend ended things last week which hurts but wasn't unexpected. My old best friend texted me out of the blue this week. We talked all night and I was laughing just talking to her through text but things will never be the same between us. The last time I saw her she spit in my face and we hadn't talked for a year and a half. My most important friend right now is with another one of my friends. I've been interested in her for awhile but am trying to chill out and feel like it's just friends. It's hard when I think about her a lot but I know she wouldn't be interested and she's an important support for me. She doesn't reveal deeply personal things to me very often but when she does I feel important and that's a good thing. The semester is starting the 16th. I'm scared to go back after missing last semester while dealing with my suicide. Other then my breakup I've been feeling really good this week but the last 2 days have been HARD. I feel disconnected from my body when looking in the mirror. My scars still make me sick and I don't remember how my hand felt before my suicide. Typing this puts things in perspective and I know I need to make a plan to deal with all of these things. Best of luck
