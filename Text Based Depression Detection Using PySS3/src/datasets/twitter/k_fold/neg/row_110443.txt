Can weed or other drugs help with suicidal thoughts?I tried killing myself twice. I can't live like this, every day hurts. I have spasms during the day because of painful memories in my life and at night I have nightmares.

I don't want to go to doctors or therapists or take their meds because the main reason for my depression is that I was abused by people in the mental health industry as a kid.

Gaming, TV or reading doesn't relieve the mental pain, I break down crying even when it's happy media I love.

I try alcohol but I hate the taste and it doesn't seem to have any effect. I drank 1/4 flask of vodka and don't feel any different, should I drink larger doses?

Can weed help? I'm willing to do drugs I just don't wanna take meds from the mental health industry because of the abuse I suffered from them.
