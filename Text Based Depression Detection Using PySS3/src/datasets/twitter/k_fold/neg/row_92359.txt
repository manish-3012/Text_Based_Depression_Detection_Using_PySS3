Little rant of saddness (sorry).I have been doing better lately and I'm trying so fucking hard to be better and try to question my demons and see things in a better light. But it just sucks to be consistently reminded how little my existence matters, like I try so hard to be a good person and a person worth knowing and being good to others. I make an effort with people, try to be supportive and check in on them when theyre poorly. But no matter what i do, I am only ever the back up or back ups back up, if that. It forever feels I am not good enough and that they see that beneath all the effort im not worth giving equal effort back too. Recently I just keep ending up wishing i got sick, just so I could get it confirmed for me that no one gives a fuck. Im sorry for the rant, but I find this group comforting even tho I never post. Tonight I'm just sad, but I hope I dont make you sad. Im sorry.
