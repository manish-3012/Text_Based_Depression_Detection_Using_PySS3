NothingTo be honest I could do it right now. Iâ€™ve hit the peak of several years not feeling anything. I used to feel anxious, and I donâ€™t now, but I donâ€™t feel anything else. I just feel nothing. I donâ€™t know if feeling nothing is grounds for it, but the prospect of Feeling nothing for ever is ... Iâ€™m not depressed even, and I should be happy, I have a job that pays well, I have savings, Iâ€™m in a better position than I have ever been, but I just donâ€™t feel it. I really donâ€™t feel anything, if Iâ€™m not at work I lay in bed, I lay in bed for two days straight, I get drunk often but not enough for it to be a problem.  I am so far away fro the people I love that kind of I donâ€™t exist. And they are why I havenâ€™t before. It seems as though if you donâ€™t care you shouldnâ€™t do it, but at the same time it seems that if you donâ€™t care you might as well.

ive tried in the past, and Iâ€™ve felt desperate, but now I donâ€™t feel desperate. I just donâ€™t feel. Iâ€™m a nice person to others, but I have nothing inside me, in the past I did. Now I have money, Iâ€™m not rich, but I have money from working and saving and I realise that it doesnâ€™t matter. Maybe I have fed it today, I donâ€™t know. On my days off work I take a heap of antipsychotics and drink and sleep to try to make it through the week. But its shit. I feel so empty that now I could do it. I wish I didnâ€™t. I take anti depressants religiously, but I feel nothing, I can work and manage a team but I feel nothing. I have nothing. I want no material things, I have zero interest in having relationships. I can feel it like I have already done it.   


I donâ€™t know why.
