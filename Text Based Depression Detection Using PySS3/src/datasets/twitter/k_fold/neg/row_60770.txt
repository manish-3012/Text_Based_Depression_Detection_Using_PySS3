Feeling like life is in rut for lack of a better word.Since I graduated highschool about a year ago I've been in a constant depression, feeling like im going around and around in the same circle every damn day. I'm in a job I hate (Attempting to get out but not working out for me so far but thats another story) All of my friends have either moved away or just plainly don't talk to me anymore, I get to see my boyfriend once a week if that, but even when we're together he's tired because he's constantly working. Nothing is exciting to me anymore, I can't get into school because it's way to expensive but I don't qualify for financial aid. I've never seriously considered suicide until recently. It's like a thought that stays in the back of my mind that I just can't seem to shake, theres no real way for me to change anything at the moment. I feel the things that do make me happy are slowly slipping through my fingers. I honestly don't know what to do anymore...
