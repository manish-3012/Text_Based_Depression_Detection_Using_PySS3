I tried speedrunning one game but EVEN my run got rejected. Fuck this bullshit.I spent so much time trying to do it and record it, and then after submission it got rejected, like I wasn't rejected enough in life before: 2 times in a row by college and 2 times by a girl (she is really toxic, so thats not that much I guess). I guess its just gets worse and worse everyday. Fuck this.
