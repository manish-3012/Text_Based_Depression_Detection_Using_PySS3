I'm staying busy, but it doesn't feel like I'm going anywhere and I hate it.Hey, /r/suicidewatch.

I've been dealing with depression since highschool, but since I graduated May of 2014, it feels like it's gotten much, much worse, and I'm starting to just wish I was gone.

Part of this is because I still live with my parents, I'm sure. I had the grades to get into a university, but I opted out, choosing to go to community college because fuck debt, amiright? Anyways, living with my parents is a problem because they're religious, I'm not. That's just part of it - we don't see eye to eye on most things, but I'd never tell them that.

However, they did recently find out I smoke. Nothing too heavy, just a hookah pen with a small concentration of nicotine. Because of this, however, they decided they were going to ban me from using the Internet, because "if they don't punish me, I won't learn." It's like I'm a child to them.

I don't hate my parents by any means. If I'm being objective, they've been good to me, but living under their roof only adds onto what I consider my problem: I'm not going anywhere.

I've got excellent grades, I work often, and I'm working on getting my driver's license, but regardless, it feels like it's all for nothing. I have quite a few friends, but it doesn't feel like they really care, which I have discussed with them. They think I'm overreacting. 

I really just don't want to wake up tomorrow. "I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere." 

Perhaps the only reason I'm still alive is because I don't want anyone to mourn my death. I know how I'd end my life, and I really, really would if I didn't think about all the grieving that would follow.   I just wish I could fade away.

This might just sound silly, but it is how I feel.
