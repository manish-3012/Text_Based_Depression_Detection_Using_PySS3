Been trying to depart for hoursso ya i have NPD and had no empathy most of my life. burnt most bridges and ended up depressed and too afraid to face anything. so fitting i take cowards way out. 

the carteroids are hard to find but then you hit that dizziness and i bail after 7 seconds. dunno how this supposed to be painless. hopefully there is no lake of snakes and flesh eating eels on the other side. next time ill try 14 seconds. nothing compared to another day in my minds prison
