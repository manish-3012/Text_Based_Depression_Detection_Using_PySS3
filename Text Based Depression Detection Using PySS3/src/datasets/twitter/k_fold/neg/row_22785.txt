I have too much stressIâ€™m not super suicidal but itâ€™s been getting more intense lately. I feel like everything in my life is good and then suddenly I lose it all. I lost a lot of my friends because of me just being a jerk. I have gotten so stressed from school so I donâ€™t even know what to do. Every night I go to bed wanting to die in my sleep. Any suggestions to help this?
