Sorry worldi have tried. i have tried everything, i am 15 and i cant lose thought of how i am the worst person. i thought that i havent seen anything in my life. "it cant be depression, i am just a kid what can i even be depressed of?" i told myself lies, thinking i will belive in them someday. i cant take it anymore, i have tried my best. today, it all ends. i will kill myself, life is pointless, i cant take it anymore, my exams start in less than a month, and i havent even started to prepare for them. i thought there was time, but no. i cant watch my parents think of me as a dsgrace, tonight it all ends, thank you everyone for trying to cheer me, but no more can i take it.
