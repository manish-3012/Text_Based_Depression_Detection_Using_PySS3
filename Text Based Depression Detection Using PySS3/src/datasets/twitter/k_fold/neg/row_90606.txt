I messed up my life and there is no way to fix it.I should have stayed in my city and done bcom. 
I should have been dating SA instead of leaving for the UK. Now she is married and she was the only girl that was interested in me.
I should not atleast left after one year of suffering in the UK.
Everyone was telling me that i should do bcom.
My brain is fried from too many prescription meds. 
I cant recover from when i was medically restrained and put in a mental hospital for no reason. 

There is no way to fix any of this. I dont have the will to live my messed up lonely life of pain. Im not depressed. I just have just fucked things up too badly. Im sure that everyone will understand why i had to do this.
