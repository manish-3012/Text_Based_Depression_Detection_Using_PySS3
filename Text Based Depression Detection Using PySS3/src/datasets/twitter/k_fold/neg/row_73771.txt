I'm so close to doing it!!!I don't want to detail into my life but I need help. My life is so hopeless and I'm so sad, I cry a lot when I think about my pathetic life. I hate myself SO MUCH!!! I can't go on like this, it's just too much too handle. Honestly, I hate the idea of death but nothing could be worse than this, I just want to disappear and never come back. I'm so sad that when I was outside, I just started crying, I'm a mess. I honestly think suicide is the answer, I've been sad for so long and have no hope of getting better. Life is torture.
