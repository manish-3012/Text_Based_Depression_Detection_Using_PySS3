After months of struggling I finally got the courage to tell someone about my suicidal thoughts and was dismissed...I've been struggling for several months now with suicidal thoughts/ideations. I've constantly been reluctant to share my increasingly difficult internal conflict with anyone for months now. A lot of the reluctance stems from how terrible the mental health care system is in my city, as well as the stigma that surrounds my main mental illness (a stigma held by not just people in general, but also psych professionals). I was forced into inpatient several times in the later years of high school and if anything, my experience there just made my mental health worse. The adult psych wards in my city are much worse. I've had literally dozens of referrals fall through and so I haven't been able to get the treatment I need in well over a year now. I keep telling everyone that I'll tough it out, make it through, etc. But in reality I'm falling apart from the inside out.
So, I finally went to the clinic on my university campus and told them the truth about what I was experiencing mentally and physically. I even made sure to mention that I'd been reluctant to be forthcoming about it all given the past negative experiences I've had with the local mental health system. After just a lot of waiting and explaining my situation to professional after professional, I was finally just told to go home because, in summation, there apparently isn't any reason to provide me with some degree of professional care unless I've literally planned my suicide step by step. It is beyond frustrating to be continuously dismissed. I'm made to feel like a burden, a waste of time and resources, a cry baby...
If anything, I feel like my experience today has just made things worse. I feel even more worthless than I did before and I didn't even think that was possible at this point. 

I guess my post here was just a way to vent. I don't know.
