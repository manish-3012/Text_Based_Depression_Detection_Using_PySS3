Everyday my life gets worse.My life gets worse everyday, and everything I try doesn't make anything better. I can't do anything right. All the shit in my life is hemorrhaging and I don't know how much longer I can stay strong. I've tried to kill myself before years ago and swore I'd never try again, but I'm as close as I've ever been before. I have only one friend, and I can't talk to them about it because they'll have my parents intervene and make things worse. I just want to die.
