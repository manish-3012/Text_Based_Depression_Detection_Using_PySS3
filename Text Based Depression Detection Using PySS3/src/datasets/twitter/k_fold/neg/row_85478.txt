I just feel so brokenI know you guys have a lot of people to respond to and sorry to add to that. It's I don't know what to do anymore. For the past few months and especially this last month I have been contemplating suicide a lot. Like just last week I almost did it and even had my suicide note written. 

I have had some problems lately and just feel so broken. Like I have been trying to get a job but no call backs. I am failing a class. My long term relationship is over. My parents are angry over my fairly recent college change. This is just recent and add onto what already was a bad mind set so it pushed me even farther. When I write this out it makes me feel selfish because I have a pretty easy life. Like I don't have to worry about a lot of things so I should not feel this way because people have it way worse. 

I just want to die. It feels like I am on a downward slope with no hope for the future. But I am also scared to hurt the ones I love but leaving. I just don't know what to do and I just hurt all the time. I don't know if this made sense but I just had to tell someone because I don't know what I am going to do.
