Not sure what to do...Hello anonymous internet people.  I feel so alone and scared right now.  I guess some would say that I have had a sad and troubled life but I always managed to get through it.  In some ways I was lucky, I found a job working at a technology consulting firm right out of college.  Everything was going great until 9 months ago.  Looking back I think it was the stress of my job that caused it... 

I have never been much of a social person, and have always felt insecure around others since I can remember.  About 2 months ago I attempted to kill myself by tieing a bag about my head and drinking a shit ton of bose.  The short story is I got scared and couldn't do it.  After I pulled the bag from my head I  promised myself that I would try to keep going one day at a time.  

Now that its 2 months later, I feel like im sinking in a ocean full of sorrow and regret and the oxegen in my lungs are fading hopes and dreams.  I don't know what to do...
