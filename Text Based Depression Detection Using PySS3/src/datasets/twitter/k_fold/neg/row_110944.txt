Is there actually any hope?Anytime someone is suicidal the first thing someone says to them is â€œthereâ€™s still hopeâ€ or â€œyouâ€™ll get through itâ€ but is that actually true.  Iâ€™ve been suicidal since age 8 and nothing has gotten better, in-fact itâ€™s gotten worse yet every time I talk or attempt suicide every says thereâ€™s still hope.  Is that true?
