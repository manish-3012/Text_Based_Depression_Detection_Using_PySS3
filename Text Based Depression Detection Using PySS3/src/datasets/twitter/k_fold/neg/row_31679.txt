what to do when...?you no longer feel that need to stay alive in order to not cause pain to your relatives, i mean, that's what is keeping me alive for the past year more or less, but lately i been stop caring about it and struggling to find another reason.

Mostly my grandparents, my mom, dad and sister already know about my plans and i think they understand me, i guess it's because i been thinking and talking about it for more than 10 years now.

xo guys and sorry about the grammar mistakes i'm from a non-english speaking country.
