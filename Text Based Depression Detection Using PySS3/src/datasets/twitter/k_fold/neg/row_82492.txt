I'm screaming out for help, I'm so alone.Why the fuck am I still here. Why haven't i taken all my pills, or cut so deep that I'm passed out on my bedroom floor bleeding to death..I am sick of getting hurt, loosing people and people leaving me. It's bullshit. I'm a failure. I should die, I'm better off. I guess I should start thinking about it. I want to end this pain, but I don't know whats holding me back from not overdosing this very second.
