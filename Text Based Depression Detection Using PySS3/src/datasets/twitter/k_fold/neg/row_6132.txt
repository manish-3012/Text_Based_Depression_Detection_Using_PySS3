As my isolation grows longer, thoughts of murder and rape enter my mind.The humans I see every day start to look less and less like the same species as me. They start to feel like just another animal. 

I start to fantasize about how I could corner one of them and attack them. Satisfy some of my carnal needs. 

I don't want to be this way, or have these thoughts. But the less real affection I receive, the more attractive and comforting these thoughts start to be. 

Why would somebody want me alive? I'm like a dangerous animal. I wish somebody would come and kill me. I would be better off dead I'm sure. And anybody I'm around would be better off too. 

My urges to kill myself have always been stronger than my urges to hurt others. I've come close to killing myself. Standing at the edge of tall structures. I go with the intent to jump, and I could if I had just made one sharp and sudden movement. I've also thrown myself in traffic, but it was pretty low speed and I got up without a scratch. 

The closest I've got to hurting anybody was when I saw a pretty girl walking at night and I started to follow her on my bike. I could tell she noticed me and was scared. But I feel like it was a far cry from actually interacting with her, let alone hurting her. 

I assume as I my period of isolation and loneliness continues, I will start to get more courage to do both. But I really hope I kill myself before hurting anybody.
