I want it to stop!I met this girl about a month back and we've been talking everyday since then. I just recently moved to the town shes in for college and we've hung out everyday and have had so much fun. But I told her I had feelings for her and she replied saying she didnt want a relationship because she got out of a bad one and that she has no feelings for me. This ruined me, I was so emotionally invested in her, I had multiple panic attacks and now suicide or any way of escaping is all thats on my mind. Im sick of feeling alone and I want someone to be with me but at this rate I dont feel like its going to happen. I just want to die but I dont want to ruin the lives of my loved ones. It would destroy them if I did this, its why im sill going and still suffering.
