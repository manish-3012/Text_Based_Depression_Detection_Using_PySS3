im planning on ending my life so i wont be a pain to my parentsHello, I'm a 13-year-old living in Europe, recently, my laptop broke due to a hardware issue, and my parents wasted precious hours getting it too, and back from the repairs shop. I love them so much, but now I've managed to spill a drink on it, completely ruining the keyboard, this isn't the first time I've fucked up and cost my parents money, money which they could've used  better, I feel like a terrible person for this. its all my fault, I understand, I was reckless, I'm planning on ending my life so I won't be a pain to them anymore, and cost them more money, I haven't told them about the laptop spill, because I don't want them to stress about it, I love my parents so much and I don't want to cause them suffering, I don't know what to do, I'm definitely having second thoughts.

I wrote this on a throwaway, for obvious reasons.
