I know what I have to doI have a bottle of wine and ativan just sitting there waiting. I know if I took all of that I'd be able to go. I'm just laying in bed waiting. Waiting for anything. Maybe waiting for God to come down pluck me up and tell me it was all a cruel joke and they're sorry.

I'm tired of everything. Tired of nobody caring and feeling so alone and cold in this life. Tired of feeling abnormal in everything I do. I just want to quit this cruel joke called life. I want to quit the constant rejection over and over. I want to quit on a future that looks more grim and shitty than I could have ever imagined. I want to quit on hoping anything will get better, because it never does. It just gets worse. It keeps getting worse. And when there's some sliver of hope? Nope, that was just there to give you some wind so that when cold hard reality slams you back down it hurts even more.
This has been my life. Just becoming broken more and more. Every day I feel lower. And I think and say "what if I did this" and "what if I did that". And try and think of solutions... but in the end it doesn't even matter. Because nothing matters. What's the point of doing anything? I don't even know why I'm here. Why I'm alive. I'm just going to die eventually anyways. Why wait? So I can have a bunch of shitty things happen to me? So I can be depressed for another 20 odd years? So I can watch myself age into nothingness?

There is no point. There's only death. And I would rather die now. It will hurt. But it would hurt in 20 years anyways. At least now I won't have to suffer. Please God I just don't want to suffer anymore.
