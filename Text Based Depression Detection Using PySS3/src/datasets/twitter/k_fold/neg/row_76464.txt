why wont i kill myself?I don't get it, i hate my life, i hate my situation, i hate myself, i hate the effect I've had on the people i care about but i still, no matter what state i get into as a catylist(sp?) i still fail to damage myself in any significant way or die. 
Do i just convince myself Im suicidal for attention? It's increasingly frustrating
