The fuck is wrong with me?Seriously. I live in the greatest fucking time to ever be alive in (well, yet), and probably the greatest place on *earth*, damn it.

I'm a student. I get good grades, I'm happy with my life, I'm even looking forward for the summer vacation to end. I'm looking forward to seeing some of my friends from class again. I'm looking forward to start on a new project in a programming class this fall.

I mean, it's a shitty programming class, but I've learned programming on my own, and I'm going to make something way a head of what's expected, and am looking forward to an easy A+. I've even got an app on Google Play. And I'm really proud.

I have absolutely nothing in my life to feel bad about. Yet I do. I have no idea whether what I feel qualifies as depression or not. Probably not, though. But I feel *depressed* at least, a lot. And I don't think it shows either. I mean, I joke around when that's appropriate, I smile most of the time (genuinely), and have close friends whom I love. But in moments like now, I feel so, so bad. And I just don't want to feel it anymore. Which is where I have suicidal thoughts, feel guilty, and get even more depressed.

But jesus fucking christ, I have it so god damn good, yet I have suicidal thoughts. And that makes me feel like a little shit.

But that's only suicidal thoughts though, I haven't ever seriously considered it. And I'm probably not going to do it, either. Which is why it's probably the wrong sub, too. Sorry if it is.
