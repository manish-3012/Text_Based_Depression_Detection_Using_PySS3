Girlfriend who I love very much dumped me and now I don't know what to live for and hate myself for failing her.I don't know exactly where things went wrong but I know my autism, quietness, and difficulty finding and keeping a good job and being successful played a part. I'm still awful at communicating my feelings and wasn't able to reassure her that things would be ok.

I was really depressed one night and she called me and I fucked things up yet again and she said it wouldn't work.

I don't want anyone else and if I didn't have autism or any of these struggles things would be fine...I can't stand being me and want to die it's obvious at this point I will never be happy.
