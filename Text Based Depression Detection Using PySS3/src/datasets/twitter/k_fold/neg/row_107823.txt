Exams stress and depressionMy mood is absolutely uncontrollable. Ive been trying to distract myself from the fact i have to travel 2 hours to do one fucking exam tomorrow. 

I failed 1, out of a 10 part exam. Thats the only thing i need to go back for and fix. 

I just heard that two days ago I have an exam tomorrow. Out of fucking nowhere i get a call. The official email was send to me yesterday.

Im currently dealing with a ton of negative emotions and questions. I have very little to no reason to keep going in this life that ive been suffering for far too long. 

Now this exam out of the blue really fucking broke any sort of wall i managed to build against these suicidal thoughts. This stress on top of everything is just too much for me to handle.

 After im done with them tomorrow ill feel better until i stress about the fucking results of them for weeks. 

And lets say it all works out just fine, the damage has been done. The combined clusterfuck of different negative im so fucking done what has this life ever given or shown me that makes any of this worth it. 

Im absolutely done theres no way anyone is ever going to convince me that i shouldnt end this prolonged suffering sooner rather than later.

I can feel my time in this life is running out fast and its the only god damn thing that brings me any comfort anymore.
