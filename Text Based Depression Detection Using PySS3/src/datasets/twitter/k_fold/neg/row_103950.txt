Need advice. My childhoods best friend took his own life and I don't know how to copeMy best friend from when I was younger has taken his life on the 26th of December and I've found out Sunday. 
I started talking to him week prior to it and he seemed depressed but didn't mention how bad it was. I keep thinking that there must have been something I could have said or done. We made plans to hang out when I'm back in the city. And now it just kills me to know I'll never be able to again. I keep checking his Facebook, going through the messages, hoping its just my mind playing jokes on me and it's not really happening. 
Since Sunday, I keep waking up from nightmares. And just feel so depressed over it, everything just seems pointless. 
Someone please give me some tips.
