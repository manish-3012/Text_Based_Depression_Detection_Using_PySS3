Well this is goodbye foreverI have the wrost graduation party ever no one came to it i was so so so emotional i guess im not loved or care for ðŸ˜­ðŸ’”ðŸ˜”

when i lost my twin sister back in January 2002 when my mom tell me the news i took it harder than my family ever did after that i begin to change i become angrier pushing walls throwing pillows even try to run away and left home than when i got older even came more aggressive at that i was n the hospital bc of my angry i wasn't safe at my home after i got out of the hospital i found out that my great uncle pass away then the death keeps on going by the year every year was a new death for me until i become so overwhelmed that last month last year i try to kill myself i end up in the hospital and end up going to the walker house to get some help went about a month without my family or anyone and my phone i couldn't sleep at night stay up for weeks straight than when i got home going to away for a month did not help me i felt worthless i was still feeling that i was not amount to nothing just a piece of dirt on the ground waiting to be step on i have no friends everyone hates me 

i been thinking that this world is not worth holding on to the cruelty of it what im at getting at im just a worthless person and that i will ever be i feel like taking my life so this is goodbye forever ðŸ˜”
