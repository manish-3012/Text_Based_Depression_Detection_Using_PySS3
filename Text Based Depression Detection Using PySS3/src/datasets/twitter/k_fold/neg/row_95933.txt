The worst part.Today something very bad happened to me.  I can't go into the details because there's legal stuff up in the air and I don't want anyone to recognize who I am.

I have fantasized about suicide my entire life.  It is my escape, to know that I could end it if I chose to.  I've never tried, but I've always wanted to.  I want so bad to be back where I was before I came into existence.  Not sad or even happy but just, not.  I want it so bad.  I want it now more than ever in light of todays events. 

My problem is that I have a fiance now and I'd feel guilty doing that to her.  The worst part about this love I've found is that I'm no longer free to off myself.

So I sit here now, razor sharp knife in hand, and I am stuck.  I know I'm physically capable of doing this.  I've already drank enough to manage the pain of the cutting.  I know I could go deep with this knife and really get in that vein and I could be over before long.  I want that, but I can't leave her.  She's asleep in the other room and she has no idea what's going on. 

I don't know if I'm asking for support or what but I just wanted to write this out. Thanks for reading.
