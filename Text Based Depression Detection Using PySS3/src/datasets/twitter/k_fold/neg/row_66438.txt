The past yearAbout a year ago my ex cheated on me and that just seemed to unhinge me somehow and spiral all my other issues together into one. I fell into a hole and then my friends went off to university, I turned 20 and within a month my family moved house. My parents noticed something was wrong and together sorted me some therapy/medication/help but I've always felt like all I've done throughout it is manipulate whoever i was talking to by saying what they wanted to hear and for weeks on and off I've just had nights when I drink so much and just want everything to end. This is one of them nights, I'm drunk and I just happened to stumble on this sub so we'll see what happens before I pass out I guess.
