I want to disappearI have a family so I really can't do anything even though I want to. My public image has been completely destroyed, I have a really bad reputation, I'm always anxious, I'm depressed, rarely I have a good day and think this'll actually work out in the end. I have no reason to be except my family. I'd either go somewhere far far away, though that wouldn't fix my problem or make me happy, or I'd kill myself because that would end my terrible existence. My life's been a mess since my childhood. My friends are there for me, they offer me their help, but why would I accept it when it doesn't even matter what I make of myself and what I think of myself when I'm an absolute nobody. A disgrace. I'm really ashamed of myself and I don't want to wake up in the morning. I don't want to talk to people. I don't want people to look at me, know that someone like me exists. I hate my life. I hate myself. I don't want to work on my future self when I'm an absolute zero.
