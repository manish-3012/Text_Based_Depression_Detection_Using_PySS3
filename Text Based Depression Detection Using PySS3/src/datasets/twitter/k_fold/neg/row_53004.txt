I'm at the end of my ropeApologies if this post isn't written very well. My thoughts are frazzled, and as much as I've tried, I can't gather them enough to think straight. These past few weeks things have gotten really bad again. About a year ago is when I last felt this awful, and for a while I was really convinced I was getting better. I've been clean from self harm for a year and a half, and I went a few months without ever wanting to do it. The thought wasn't comforting at all. I didn't want to die anymore, and everything was okay, and now it's not and I'm not quite sure what happened but I want to give up. Badly. 

On top of the constant urge to cut, and to jump in front of a train, my eating disorder has gotten worse. As a result, my physical health has plummeted. The other day I couldn't stand up long enough to brush my teeth, and I had to sit down. I get completely winded walking up a short flight of stairs. Forget my hopes of a daily bike ride now that the weather is warmer. 

I've also been dealing with pretty awful intrusive thoughts, mostly all of them self-destructive in one way or another. I can't tell you how many times I've been teetering on the edge of smashing my phone to bits or fucking stabbing myself or some shit. Anyways. I'm not sure what my point of this post is, but I guess I'm just at the end of my rope. I've been considering checking myself into the hospital, but I sure as hell can't afford it myself, and I'm not looking to tell my dad that his precious little girl wants to die.
