I can't be productive everI haven't played a single video game today, or watched a single video. I've tried to stay focused on my homework but I just can't. My brain is always all over the place and I always pace back and forth every 5 minutes, sit back down, and realize I've gotten little done. It's taking a toll on my happiness, my grades, and everything. I just can't do this shit anymore man. I'm just crying for help at this point because I don't know what else to do.
