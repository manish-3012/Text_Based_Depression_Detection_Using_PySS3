I'm getting worse.Dirt. I am nothing but dirt it seems. I'm currently in college but because of COVID-19 and then summer, I've been stuck living with my parents. All their interactions with me involve talking down and belittling me. My mom mocked me for wanting to learn Portuguese, she laughed at me for wanting to read about Buddhism to improve my life, she mocked me for wanting to research my ancestry. I can't talk to my dad about anything, and haven't been able to for a decade. I've heard him express his dissappointment in me to other family members. Both my parents think so little of me, everyone thinks so little of me, and I know I'm the black sheep of my family.

They recently stole money from me, and I know they did it. I know the time frame, who was home at that time, how much money I had and where I kept it. I would have been 100% fine giving some to them if they asked, but they didn't. They didn't because they don't even have a modicum of respect for me, no one does. I must be an unbelievably shitty and broken person. I deserve all this, I'm not sure, but I have to because why else would all this happen? 

I snapped. I had the worst emotional breakdown so far. I cut myself, I beat myself black and blue with a couple metal belts, I broke stuff. And now, the latest addition? I straight up pulled clumps of hair from my head and bashed my head on the wall. I sound so crazy right now. If by any chance you're still reading this long post, I need to die. I need to kill myself, and I want to do it on Friday, October 16, at 9:00 pm. I don't know if I want to leave a note, I'm not convinced anyone will read it or care. I know a train runs right through the town I live in, and I know when it will be passing through. I don't think I'll ever do it, but all I can think about is suicide and the peace that hopefully follows.
