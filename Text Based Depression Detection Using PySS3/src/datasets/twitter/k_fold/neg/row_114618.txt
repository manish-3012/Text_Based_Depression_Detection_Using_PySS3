No one actually wants me around, they just don't like the idea of me committing suicideSuicide makes them uncomfortable. Suicide sounds bad. Suicide looks bad. But nobody actually wants me around. If I were to die I wouldn't be missed for all that long. If I could just get over the fear of pain or being semi successful I would kill myself in a heartbeat. I wish I could get my hands on a gun and a quiet spot alone in the woods.
