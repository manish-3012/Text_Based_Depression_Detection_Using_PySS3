I want everyone around me to hate meI wish I could make everyone hate me and forget about me. They already do it so often inside my head. If nobody would miss me I could set myself free. Instead I just bother everyone else with my problems as I get worse and worse. I don't think I want to get better any more, I'm too far gone.
