Iâ€™ve loved 3 girls in my life that I have never forgotten. and recorded this track for them, Reminiscing our good times/nights. Iâ€™m drunk on wine and pills, lowers inhibitions I guess.In this case, â€Emilyâ€ itâ€™s not neither of their name. â€˜Emilyâ€™ became a figurative emotional amÃ¡lgama to all of them, also I donâ€™t to want expose them, of course. 
So, I have some depression and all that comes along with it (2 attempts, ataraxia, loneliness, minor anxiety attacks, complete days in bed, feeling that any sooner I might do it again etc) for years. Also Iâ€™ve been reading this sub for years (with a different account hihi). But I still like to write and record songs from time to time. This is one is to three girls, to reminisce. Maybe the last one that Iâ€™ll record. (never thought of using this sub, itâ€™s a cheap shot I guess, to promete my tracks but Iâ€™m high in wine and xanax right now, then why not).

be kind , thanks. Iâ€™m no professional.
