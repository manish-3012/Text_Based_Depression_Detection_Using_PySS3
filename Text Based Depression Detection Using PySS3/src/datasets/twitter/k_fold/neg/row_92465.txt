Just a ramble. I've been feeling very down. I have emotional sparks, including depression. This will often come up for no reason and I'll think of how different the world could be if I committed suicide. 

Unfortunately things have been much worse. 

For background, I am a 16-year-old girl, whereas hormones are a definite possibility in this situation, there's another issue that's occuring alongside. Unfortunately my mother lost her home (might I add she's horrible with money, and she's put herself in a financial hole) and now we have nowhere to put the dogs. My dad has a house 20 minutes away with his fiancÃ©e and they refuse to take the dogs. They will attempt to find a home for the dogs but they won't take them. This creates a large ruckus between the entire family and I'm in the middle. I can't do anything and no matter what I try. I also am emotionally attached to my dogs and it's horrible. I can't give them away and I can't solve any family problems. 

For some extra info:
I also think my mom is bipolar. She's mentally ill in some way. 

I can't deal with my family and I can't deal with giving my dogs. I've just thought about how much easier it would be just to die.
