Crying for the last hour, feel worthless and want it to stopI've just been having a shit couple of days and they keep getting worse and my antidepressants arent working anymore.  I've been sitting staring at my knife and computer screen for the last hour.  All I can think about is how people would pretend to care about me for one day to come to my funeral and then forget about me the next.  Everyone keeps telling me Im not good enough.  My life is shit I have no friends anymore, no one cares.  Everyday is a fight just to get out of bed I can't take it anymore.  This place is so empty of love I have no one to support me.  I can't even put the feelings into words because my mind is racing and my fingers are trying to push the fucking keys right through my laptop.
