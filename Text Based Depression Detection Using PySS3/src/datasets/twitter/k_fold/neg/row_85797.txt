I bought the gunI'm a 23 year old man and I am going to kill myself at midnight (or 11:59 - i haven't decided my DOD yet). I have a small penis, and have been turned down by many guys because of it. Every day I am ashamed by it, ever since high school I have been dpressed because of it, and I have come very close to killing myself - this is the 7th time, and I'll do it right. It's something I could never fix aside from killing myself. and I have always fantasized about suicide, even since I was in primary school. I don't have any saved records of being mentally ill (thank god I never pulled any big stunts before) so my background check was clear and I bought the gun.

I'm currently fixing grammar and spelling errors (and whatever mistakes I come across) in my "will" (if this is even valid, I'm just writing what would go to who). My PC will go to my younger brother, my phone will go to a domestic violence support organization, my furniture will go to my older sister, my TV to Goodwill, and a few more things. I've bolted my door shut and added extra makeshift bolts - a ram would be needed to break through what I have set up. I also (almost finished) bolted the door to my bedroom, AND (ditto) the door to my Bath room, so there are 3 hard things keeping anyone away from my body. I have about 60mg of Xanax, and some phenobarbital sitting in the cupboard. I bought a big container of vodka to wash it down. Those are in case I chicken out. Then I'll shoot myself, maybe cut myself a little bit to ease any anxiety.

Any preparation ideas? Not sure what else I should do other than the will. Wipe my computers? idk
