Been off my meds (unintentionally) and have been spending a lot of time around narcissistic family due to Easter. Called in sick today and made a mistake in doing so, I think my job is at risk. In high panic mode and feeling like my options moving forward are limitedIâ€™ve been trying to be so strong the last little while...I work in a great place that unfortunately has some toxic bullshit about it and I can usually handle it, but that on top of it being Easter, Iâ€™ve had a lot of pressure on me because I donâ€™t have a good relationship with my family, they are very damaging to my self worth and Iâ€™ve had to endure their passive aggressive bullshit over the weekend.  Iâ€™ve been off my meds because Iâ€™ve been so scatterbrained and itâ€™s really having an affect on me, and Iâ€™m sick to my stomach from all the self destructive eating and anxiety Iâ€™m experiencing.

I called in sick at work today.  I didnâ€™t realize it was the second time Iâ€™ve called in on a Monday, Iâ€™m still in my 90 days and my boss is PISSED.

He texted me back after I let him know I wouldnâ€™t be in. â€œAre you kidding me sick again on a Monday we need to have a serious conversation tomorrow.â€

I texted back that I understood, he said â€œI donâ€™t think you do letâ€™s just chat tomorrow.â€


I feel like Iâ€™m weak for having called in.  Iâ€™m weak for not coping better with my family or work pressures.  If I lose this job it wonâ€™t be the first Iâ€™ve lost due to loss of motivation from constant stress outside of work.  

Everyone around me is tired of hearing my excuses for not going to work because they think I just am lazy.  They donâ€™t know how I donâ€™t sleep or how my anxiety has controlled my life. 

Iâ€™m tired of fighting myself, fighting my family, and fighting every day.  They think Iâ€™m weak.  They think Iâ€™m pathetic and theyâ€™re right.  If I canâ€™t handle the mundane day-to-day how can I handle the rest of my life?

Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to make another bad choice which may ultimately be a good one, whether I down my pills or cut myself, I can never hold up the image that Iâ€™m a fully functioning person for long.

Someone please help, Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to lose my job again and that Iâ€™m just going to give up.
