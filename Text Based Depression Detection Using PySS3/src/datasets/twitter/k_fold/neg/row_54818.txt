I'm tiredI'm tired of living each day trying to make myself happy. 

I'm tired of being the person there for my friends when they're not there for me. 

I'm tired of not being good enough for you and I'm tired of still trying. 

I have a pistol in my gun cabinet and I want to go to my local park and shoot myself.

I'm tired, goodnight.
