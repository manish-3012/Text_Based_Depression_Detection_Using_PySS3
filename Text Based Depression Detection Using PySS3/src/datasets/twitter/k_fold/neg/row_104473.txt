Im thinking rationally enough to see that Im thinking irrationallyIve been having suicidal thoughts for quite some time now. The thought of dying is apealing to me, but not because my life is not. In january 2014, around my birthday I was failing school and all in all not a very good state of mind. I tied a noose, kept all my knifes near me, kept tabs on ammunition and firearms in the house but I never followed through. I barely graduated high school, and then I took a few classes at the local branch of my state college, failing one, and barely passing the other. I got myself a job over the summer that I still have, electrician's apprentice, or more his gopher. I took this semester off since I needed a break from school.


Now here I am, a disposable income in my parents house, and I feel like shit. I dont see anyone outside of my job. I just sit at home on my computer with friends I have online.

I told my mother I was having suicidal thoughts at the begining of summer. She and my dad have clinical depression, genes huh. She took me to see a therapist that ive seen a few times before for different reasons. That didnt last long. I feigned "getting better" to him to space out appointments, and we just forgot to go to the last one. I feel like I should be better now, I have no pressure from school or work, and my life isnt exactly one I want to leave, but death just seems so... inviting. I'm strangely calm, yet terrified at the same time. I have no idea what to do (half lie). I get nutzoid anxious whenever I'm thinking about my mental state in the same room as someone, even online behind a mask if anoniminity. Each person is their own protaganist in the story of their life, and I am a protagnist in mine, that doesnt want to be one, I want to be one of those brainless npc's that wont distract or detract from the main characters' story.

I am now going to press 'sumbit' before I decide that this post will cause more harm than otherwise thought.
