I wish to check out, permanently.Iâ€™ve decided that I want to end my life, and will commence â€˜Operation Suicideâ€™ on Wednesday when I get paid. I canâ€™t handle the pain anymore, and the fact that I havenâ€™t been able to help someone I love and care about makes the pain all the more real. Iâ€™d like to travel to another city, stay in a hotel and end it - but I need advice on the best method in which to do this. Suicide by height? Suicide by pills? Suicide by hanging (difficult Iâ€™d imagine in a hotel room) or perhaps suicide by slitting my wrists in a bathtub whilst intoxicated. I need a pain free, fast way to die. TIA
