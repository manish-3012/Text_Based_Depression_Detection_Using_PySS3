I can't stop thinking itI'm in a really dangerous positionv rn. I don't really expect anyone to answer or help, I'm psychotic these days and my bipolar took a really word turn.


l feel like I'm seriously stuck, in a stage between mania and depression where I have extreme suicide thoughts plus the energy to execute them. 

I feel like I'm trapped 
on a lift 
in the belly of a whale, 
at the bottom of the ocean. 

(That's Radiohead.)
I feel trapped in my head, I'm feeling away from my body already, I wish I can do it, I know it's stupid. 
I'm in this point in life where all are stable unless my head.
