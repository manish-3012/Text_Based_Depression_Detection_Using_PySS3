ThanksDamn I'm so glad I found this sub. you guys are great and always listen without judging. I have trouble opening up to people but this sub is so perfect for that.

Sometimes I post just to know that there's still good people out there that don't judge you. I have such a hard time seeing the good in people. It's good to know we all have each other's backs.

Thank you for having my back.
