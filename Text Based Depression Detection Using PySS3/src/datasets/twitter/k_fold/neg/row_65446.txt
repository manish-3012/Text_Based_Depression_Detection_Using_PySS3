Husband didnt careI have been suicidal for a couple of years off and on.  The last 6 months it has gotten bad, and especially in the last month.  Each day I fight so hard to stay alive.  I have failed everyone my entire life, and no matter how hard I try, it isnt getting better for anyone.  

I opened up to my husband during an argument about me being suicidal, and he didnt care.  He acted like I didnt mean it.  It's not like go around telling people I'm suicidal.. this is serious to me.  Private.  Because I dont want people trying to stop me when I do. 

He showed absolute no concern.  No worry.  Nothing.  He continued to tell me how angry he is at me for ruining our finances in the past which are still affecting us (even though I've changed my spending habits and am working hard and overtime and everything).  He says he has a right to be this angry and make me feel this bad for what I did in our past, even though I'm consistently doing everything to make up for it now.  

I'm on my bathroom floor making plans to either hang myself or try to fight another day.  I cant do this anymore.  The daily fight in my head is more than I can handle anymore.  I've been fighting for too long.
