my anger has taken control.I can't seem to control my asshole irate anger. IT's like i'm in third person watching it happening with no control. Over stupid things. Never anything bad enough to be fired. I tell everyone it's okay to hate me because i know the asshole but this asshole is tired and drained and has become so numb to all feelings. I just want this to stop and the trigger seems to be my only hope. I made it to 30. At 14 I would of said there was no way I'd see 21. I don't know what to do and i'm done. I cleaned off my desk and have all person belongs in the car. Closed the ebay store and I don't know what's going to happen for here on.
