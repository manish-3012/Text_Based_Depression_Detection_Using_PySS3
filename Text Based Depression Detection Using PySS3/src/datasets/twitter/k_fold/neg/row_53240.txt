This is why I'm a shitty person who should shut up and die alreadyYesterday.  Supreme Court.  Gay marriage legal.  Obama sings Amazing Grace.  Everyone's supposed to be celebrating.  

I'm not.  I'm just pissed that, once again, things are getting better for *everyone who isn't me*.  Yes, I actually *preferred* living in a country with that kind of discrimination, because it meant I wasn't *quite* at the bottom.  I had it better than someone else, in some theoretical way (ain't no way I'm getting married regardless of legal ability).  Now?  Nope.  "It gets better" for everyone but me.  I've been waiting 13 years for any kind of improvement in my life, and it's only gotten worse. 

And now a whole chunk of the population just got a huge boost above me, taking away one part of life where I had it all right, if not great.  

Yes, this makes me an asshole.  Yes, this makes me a biggot. That's who and what I am.  "Be yourself," they say.  Well, **who I am** is neither a pleasant nor nice person.  **Who I am** is the kind of person who is only held back from spitting on same-sex couples leaving the church or the courthouse by my own rank cowardice. **Who I am** is a shitty night who deserves to die.  Preferably beaten to death in the middle of a Pride parade.  

Time to look up parade routes.

Who am I kidding?  I know I'm too much of a fucking coward even for that.
