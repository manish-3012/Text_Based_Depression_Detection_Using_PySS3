Nothing gets better for some people.We need to stop lying to everyone and telling them that things get better. They don't more than half of the time. Society is cruel and dismissive. It's okay to hate your life and want yo opt out, life isn't fair. I've been depressed for more than 10 years and it truly has only gotten worse. This is Many peoples reality.
