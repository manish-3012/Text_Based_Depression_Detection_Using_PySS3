I'm 31 this year and I've achieved nothingIt doesn't matter why this happened, it's just excuses. I did badly in highschool and even failed a year. I dropped out from university. I wish I could be an artist but I clearly didn't have the talent in my youth so it's a completely ridiculous idea but I still started practicing at 25 with no hopes of succeeding whatsoever. Meanwhile there are thousands of people who were better at 15 than I am now. I'm such a dumb idiot for even thinking I would get anywhere. I don't have a job and I can't find one because I have nothing to write on my resume.

I just exist to take up space and waste oxygen. I want to hurt myself so bad, I have a burning hatred towards myself I don't know how to quench.
