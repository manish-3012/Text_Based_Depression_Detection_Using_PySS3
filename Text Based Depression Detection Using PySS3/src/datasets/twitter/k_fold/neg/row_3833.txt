Feeling terrible and suicidal after a break upAfter just two months, my (now) ex-boyfriend decided to break up because he just didn't want to date anymore. He said he was not suitable for this kind of relationship and that it was too much responsability do date with me since I am depressed and suicidal. He wasn't mean, he just didn't want this relationship anymore and he is free to do this. I am not angry with him, but I am sad because I loved him...

I thought of committing suicide the day before yesterday. Actually, I live in a 7th-floor apartment and I think I could just jump from there and end it all. I think my parents felt I wasn't feeling good and they invited me to stay in their house this weekend and here I am. I'm planning on killing myself next Tuesday because I will go back to my apartment, but I'm so confused, I don't know what to do... I'm afraid of failing and living a miserable life. Please help me. I'm tired.
