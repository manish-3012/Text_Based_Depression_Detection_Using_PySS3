I donâ€™t know if I should keep going. I just canâ€™t handle this lonelinessItâ€™s just been so fucking hard. Iâ€™ll be a year 13 next year and Iâ€™m really dreading it, especially because the year 13s are known as being very social people who hang out in large friend groups, but Iâ€™ll just be sitting alone hating my existence like I have been doing all of this year. I am just really not looking forward to it, and I wish I had the courage to just kill myself.
