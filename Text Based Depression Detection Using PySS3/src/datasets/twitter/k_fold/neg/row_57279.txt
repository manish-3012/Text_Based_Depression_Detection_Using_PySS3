What happens after Iâ€™m gone?I want to leave so badly. I want this pain to go away. Iâ€™ve been in and out of therapy since I was 15. Never had a stable job. Never got good grades in school. Itâ€™s gotten worse this past year. I attempted suicide for the third time in July; I couldnâ€™t go through with it because Iâ€™m such a coward.

But the thoughts crept back today. I havenâ€™t left my room all day today. All Iâ€™ve been doing is reading and scrolling through Reddit.

I started to wonder what would happen if I died. How would my parents react? My father probably wouldnâ€™t care; we were never that close. My mother would be heartbroken for awhile but sheâ€™ll get over it. My two friends (the only friends I have) will probably be upset for a bit, but they wouldnâ€™t be completely alone. They both have other groups of friends to rely on. They donâ€™t need me. Iâ€™m just a waste.

I wouldnâ€™t have to be a burden anymore. My mom wouldnâ€™t have to take care of me because Iâ€™m a useless fuck up who canâ€™t find a job.

But the fear is holding me back.

Someone. Anyone. Please. Tell me to go through with it. Help me not be afraid.
