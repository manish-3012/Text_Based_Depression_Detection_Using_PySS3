i dont knowHi. So school has started for me and it's the end of the second week. Recently, I've been having so many problems with my friendships and I'm just starting to think I'm the problem. I wish they cared more, I wish they'd just listen to me or even acknowledge me. I wish they didn't use me when it's convenient for them. I just wish they loved me. But maybe it's me. Maybe I'm not lovable. And all of these relationships are turning to shit and my skin has been acting out on me and I've been feeling so fucking insecure. This week has been so bad and I cried myself to sleep while my mother hugged me. Of course, I had to do it silently. My parents and my siblings are my only reason for living. It's so frustrating because my parents went on a trip for a ceremony and when they came back, they said they'd have to stay away from me for 2 weeks. They don't want me to face them, which is clearly not how it works but they've been trying to stay further from me for my safety. And it makes me want to cry because if they had something, I'd want it too. If they were out of my life, I'd kill myself in a heartbeat. But I just wish that I could be held by them, but they're "social distancing" with me. I just.. I don't know. I'm so burnt out. Once again. And I saw a video on Instagram of this pig balancing and walking on this little ball and it was so fucking cute. But I cried. Why did I cry when I saw it? I don't know anymore.
