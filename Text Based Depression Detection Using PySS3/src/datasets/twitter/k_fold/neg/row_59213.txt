Iâ€™m going to break my promiseMy best friend made me promise her that I would stay alive for a year.Iâ€™m scared,Iâ€™m a shitty person,I donâ€™t want to hurt her,Iâ€™ve been recently spamming her a lot,talking about suicide and self harm and telling her stuff like I donâ€™t deserve a friend like her etc.Sheâ€™s a really great person honestly,I donâ€™t want to be the reason she hurts.Iâ€™m worried because she doesnâ€™t need this toxicity in her life.Iâ€™m planning to kill myself pretty soon
