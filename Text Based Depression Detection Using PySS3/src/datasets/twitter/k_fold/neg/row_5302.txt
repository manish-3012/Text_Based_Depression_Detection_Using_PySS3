Hi igI made a throwaway account to say this but I just feel lonely and bored of living. I've been in relationships but I never cared when they left. My dad died and I felt no empathy. My mom is probably gonna join him soon from how sick she's getting. I stopped caring about my paintings and music. I just play video games and binge watch anime but I feel so bored with being on this planet. I that there is an afterlife and I hope I get lucky. If I post again then I probably was too much of a weakling to do it.

I think that we should get to choose when we want to die if we get the chance and yeah I could get therapy but with how the health care system works then I'll probably be in debt and want to die even more.

Welp if anyone wants we can do a double suicide bye...
