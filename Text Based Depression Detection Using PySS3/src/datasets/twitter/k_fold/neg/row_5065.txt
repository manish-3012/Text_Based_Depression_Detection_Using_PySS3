Staying up late because I don't want to start the cycle over tomorrow...or the next day.Came here because I can trust anonymous people without worrying my friends and deal with patronizing concern. Maybe someone can do something for my perspective besides "people would miss you" or "things will get better."

I've been to therapy before on/off, and every time it has a new flavour, but never does it quite get what I need. I've tried to turn my life around by changing how I look at relationships, trying my best to help others, doing what I can to make myself and others proud.

It's not enough.

I can't see past the fact that every day passes by, things happen, I go home, sleep, get up, repeat. Sure, interesting things happen along the way, I see people I care about, but those are all fleeting in their own ways. Great experiences pass. Bad experiences pass. Eventually, I'll die. I'm finding less and less motivation to live out the in-between, and fast-forwarding to the end of the tape just sounds like the easiest way to deal with it all (aside from the whole fear of it all). In law school now, even the idea of changing the world and winning at the supreme court for human rights sounds...eh? I'll just have to get up the next day and start over on something new after that. I stay up at night to avoid having to face the next day of repeating it all, I sleep as much as I can otherwise to avoid being in reality. I watch a lot of movies and tv to avoid engaging in the routine of life, but this just seems like useless escapism. Why live in fantasies when that's all they are? Why live when I essentially am only happy experiencing something besides reality?
