trash bags and hair ties- not a great combo for meJust tried to suffocate myself with a bag and a hair tie. Man that was scary as hell. I'll be honest when I was planning I thought it would be quick and easy but once the air got thin and the bag started to close in on me I had to rip it off and my cat looked at me like "wtf you ok mate?" in other words I'll be trying to bleed to death tomorrow wish me luck
