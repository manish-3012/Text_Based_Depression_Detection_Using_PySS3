I Was Never A Suicidal Person......but now I think about it everyday. How much better it would be if I was dead. But I can't do that to my kids; they are 9 and 11. They are all I have in this world, and I can't let them down and ruin their lives.

But I feel like the walking dead. I have no family....lost my brothers, sister and oldest son due to my insane mother with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. I am estranged from them all, including my father, because everyone believes her and her smear campaign. 

Lost my best friend and administrator at my business. She just opened an identical business 300 feet way from mine and solicited 95% of my clients away. I've had this business 10 years. Now I am pretty much starting over, but don't know if I can salvage it.

Found my husband's diary. He said he hopes I die in a car accident so he and our kids can be happy. Says he wishes he never met me, and that I ruined his life. Confronted him with it and he said was just "made up stuff."  

I have High Functioning Autism, anxiety and depression. I can barely leave my home or run an errand. I have absolutely nothing to live for, except my kids. I love them so much, but I don't even want to interact with them lately. I just want to scream.

Life always got better, but this time it is not going to. I'm 48. There is a group of people cyber-bullying me, but I can't prove they are posting about me. The people who left my business are slandering me and cyber-stalking me, but no one will believe me. I just literally have no one. I thought if I wrote this, someone would read it, and someone would hear me, and that's all I wanted.
