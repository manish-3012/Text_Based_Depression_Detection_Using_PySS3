I called the Suicide Prevention Line and she basically told me itâ€™s up to me to find a reason to stay alive!She kept pausing after I spoke, putting me on hold, and was pretty cold and just wanted to call EMS on me or hang up. 

I shouldnâ€™t have called, life really DOESNâ€™T have a reason to be alive.
