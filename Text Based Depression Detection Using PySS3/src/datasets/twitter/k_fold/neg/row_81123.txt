I get so emotional &amp; angry I want to cut my arms to ribbonsI get so angry and I donâ€™t even have a reason to be half the time. I get stressed or anxious or angry or overly emotional and I want to cut my arms. So. Badly. I can practically see the dotted lines on my arms, and itâ€™s like I feel a tingling pull where I want to cut. Itâ€™s always the same few spots on my mid forearm. 
I havenâ€™t. But damn itâ€™s hard. The thoughts just keep coming back over and over. 
Postpartum has been kicking my ass. Iâ€™m 8 weeks P.P and sometimes I think Iâ€™m doing pretty good, other times I hate everything. More often than I care to think about, I canâ€™t stand being near my daughter. Sheâ€™s beautiful and I love her but Iâ€™m having a hard time with taking care of her. My husband does so much to help me... but I have these intrusive thoughts telling me how much Iâ€™ve ruined his life and how I should just disappear. 
I want to go to anger management classes, therapy, and probably have my meds adjusted (again.) but Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t find the right words to express how I feel and what Iâ€™ve been thinking. Iâ€™m 21 fucking years old and have a hard time verbally articulating what Iâ€™m thinking. 
I abuse my husband without even realizing Iâ€™m doing it (if such a thing is possible.) I have taken the single most important person to me and destroyed him. Iâ€™ve made him wish he was dead, hate himself, but still he loves me. What kind of twisted bitch does that to her husband. He has saved my life so many times and Iâ€™ve destroyed his.
