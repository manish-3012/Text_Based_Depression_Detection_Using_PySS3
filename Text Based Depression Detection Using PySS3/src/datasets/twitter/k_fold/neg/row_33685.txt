no passionis life worth living when you donâ€™t have any passion? i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing or what iâ€™m aiming towards anymore. iâ€™m going to college soon and idk what i wanna study. it makes me feel like an idiot. why canâ€™t i just be passionate about something? I feel so behind because it seems like everyone else knows what they want to do and here i am being a waste of space. i want to fucking kms everything is too overwhelming. i donâ€™t have a chance at life anyways iâ€™m too fucking stupid.
