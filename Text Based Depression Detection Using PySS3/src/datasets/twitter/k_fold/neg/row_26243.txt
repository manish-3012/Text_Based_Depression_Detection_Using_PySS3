44yom and if it was not for my three wonderful kids I am pretty sure I would end my life.I feel like the past few years my life has fallen apart. I got laid off, engagement ended, and started a new job I hate. All my friends have moved away or grown apart, and I live in a dying town. I cannot communicate all the reasons why and be pithy, but life just seems so empty. I no longer fond joy in the things I used to. I used to get along fine with people, but lately it seems like people have been malicious and terrible towards me. I have been thinking about how much I just want to go to sleep and not wake up much more. My kids are the only thing that keep me from doing something. I have been divorced for almost 11 years now, cannot seem to find anyone that I am happy with. Tired of feeling disappointed in my life and in myself. I am to the point I cannot take much more.
