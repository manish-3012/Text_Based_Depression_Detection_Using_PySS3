I'm a coward.I typed out a long spiel about killing myself. But I can't. A big part of me almost enjoys the suffering. Masochist is almost fitting. But there isn't a sexual arousal by it. I just think I deserve to feel miserable.  

And yet I'm posting here. Like a cry for help. Either some part of me wants to get better or I enjoy reaching out with hope and stripping it away again. I really don't know anymore. I think I deserve this. Sorry.
