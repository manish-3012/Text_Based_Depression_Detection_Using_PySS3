Waking up...In bed, you open your eyes and realize the best part of your day is over. Sleep. The only time you feel no pain or suffering. You lay in bed thinking, â€œhow am I going to pull through today?â€ 
Maybe you take your meds, maybe you drink your coffee or maybe you sit and lay there contemplating why the fuck you cant be normal.

That empty feeling in the morning is the worst. 
Knowing you have to fake a smile and interact with people who have no idea you want to spill your brains on the floor every moment of every day. Maybe you make them laugh, maybe they think youâ€™re the smart, charismatic co worker. Maybe theyâ€™re starting to catch on you donâ€™t feel so good inside your head. Regardless, it doesnâ€™t change the fact you want to die every idle moment your brain gets. 

Some of us are young and havenâ€™t experienced much of life. Some of us are fully grown and independent adults with families and work that depend on them. At the end of the day, are we any different?

Stress, anxiety, loneliness, frustration, exhaustion and constant thoughts of death. Why is it that we are plagued with these thoughts when so many around us seem to be â€˜normalâ€™?  

How do you guys cope with these thoughts? I donâ€™t believe in god or an afterlife, but I like to hope and think death will end my suffering. So many of us are only still around because we canâ€™t actually follow through with our attempts at suicide, or we canâ€™t put our parents/siblings/children through the pain of losing us. Iâ€™m running out of time. Iâ€™m running out of motivation. Iâ€™m going through the motions. The fear of pain from the noose or the slit wrists or handful of pills stops us. 

One day Iâ€™m gonna lose the war. 
One day Iâ€™m going to get through the pain and look back at how I conquered 10 years of depression and suicidal thoughts/ attempts. 

What keeps you going?
