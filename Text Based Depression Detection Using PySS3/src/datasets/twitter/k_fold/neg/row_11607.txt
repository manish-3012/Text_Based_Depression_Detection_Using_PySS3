Why should I live if itâ€™s hopeless?Iâ€™ve done the things in my power to improve. Iâ€™m done. I remember thinking that when I would get to where I am now things would be better. They arenâ€™t.

Iâ€™ve just lived my life wrong, there is nothing I can do to mitigate that fact. Itâ€™s done, I canâ€™t get what I want and thatâ€™s clear to me now. 

I donâ€™t know what else there is other than existing til enough of the people whoâ€™d be impacted by my death are dead. At this point, Iâ€™m getting less and less concerned about offing myself now and just letting the fallout happen. 

Iâ€™ve never wanted to hurt anyone, but I am not sustainable. 

Is there any reason to continue? My regret is tearing me apart every moment of every day at this point. I canâ€™t see it to be honest.
