I think going insane... I need helpIt's me again... I'm sorry I'm back, but I just need to get this out of my system and hope something will come of it. 

I'm losing my mind, this never ending struggle in my mind, of wanting to end everything and staying alive for those I care about, I feel like I'm a rational guy, I know if I go through with it, I'll make so many lives worse, but I can't take it

I used to not have temptations about suicide, but now when I drive, I feel blips of temptations telling me to swerve into a ditch, or fly off the guard rails. Of walk off cliffs or buildings. I'm scared. I'm losing it, I can barely form coherent sentences in my mind, 

my family treats me like I'm a mindless child nodding and smiling like I haven't just word vomitted absolute nothing. I've been getting paranoid, and delusional, and I don't know how much longer I have until I delude myself into going through with something
