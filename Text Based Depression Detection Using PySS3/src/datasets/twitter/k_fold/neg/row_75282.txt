I turn 30 on Tuesday and I want to kill myself before thenMost people would think I have a great life. I'm married, I was medically retired from the military at an early age, and I think most people would even describe me as a happy person. However, I'm not. To be honest, I'm extremely bored of living the life I do. The most excited I get is from smoking weed and going on drug deals. I actually dream of being a drug dealer, despite having a college degree and years of military experience. I threw my $800 iPhone into the river yesterday, and immediately regretted it and started screaming and crying. What other grown man does this? The reason I was medically discharged from the military was because I developed schizoaffective disorder btw. I really just kind of want to overdose on something or hang myself, and sick as that sounds. Sorry, I reread this and it makes no sense. I'm high af. I get angry at my wife and family sometimes for being in the way of killing myself. I'm so sick. I'm honestly scared and want to get better, but also want to die. Extremely conflicted, and for some reason I have this voice in my head that keeps telling me I only have until Tuesday to make up my mind. I think I'll finally end this all and free myself. Just the thought of that makes me tear up with joy.
