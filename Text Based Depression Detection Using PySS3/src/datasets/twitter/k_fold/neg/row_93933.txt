parents treat me like a failed investment because i didnt get into a "great" college and abuse me about it everydaymy mom tells me all the time about how much she wishes i hadnt been born. names that i get frequently called in the house is: devil spawn, piece of shit, dumb bitch, fucking retard, autistic, etc. 

the worse thing is that it's always sporadic. like some little thing i do, whether i accidentally leave my glasses in the bathroom or i don't put her favorite cup in the right place, or something stupid like that will set her off. she'll go on and on about how im forgetful (which i am, and ive been trying to fix it and its gotten a lot better) and then it'll go on about how all my friends are going to great schools and ivies and how im stuck at a top 20 school like an embarrassment and that she's ashamed to present me to my dad's smartass friends. 

give me a break. my dad's abuse is his complete dead-beat nature. he doesn't do anything. he just lets my mom do her shit and chimes in with her at times. he likes to call me a failed investment a lot, too. 

Asian parents, I suppose. I'm 17 (not 18 yet) and I don't live in the States. Mom's been threatening to kick me out, but as an international student it's complicated to even get a part-time job. The rent where I live is ridiculous to the point that the housing crisis has gotten really fucking bad. 

my mom tried to kill me a few times (smothering me with a pillow, strangling my neck while pinning me down) and she beat me up a lot from when i was in elementary school all the way to high school. I don't mean beat up on the bum a few times - I mean beat up all around my body until I got bad bruises. She would stomp on me, kick me, drag me by my hair, slap my face after immobilizing me so that I couldn't defend myself, pinch me when I slept until I woke up and she could yell at me more, bite me and threaten me with one of those large Chinese cutting knives at one point. It's really hard for me to go on and I don't have anyone to lean on all my friends and extended family are in different countries and nobody wants to hear me cry about my abusive parents, right? That'ts what my mom likes to say- that the reason why my friends all left me was because they were tired of me bad mouthing her. Lol. No, the reason why I lost friends in high school was because I was bullied by someone older than me when I was a freshman until everybody left my side. And she told me that the reason why I got bullied was because I deserved it, and that I wasn't normal. 

For a long time, escaping reality has been my way of coping. I got an obsession with video games, comics, books, tv shows, anything that would help me forget that I was living in a shitty ass world. But it's not really working anymore.

Help.
