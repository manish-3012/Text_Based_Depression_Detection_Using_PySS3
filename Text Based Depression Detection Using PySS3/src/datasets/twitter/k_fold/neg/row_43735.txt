first and last postI dont know why I decided to post to here tonight. but currently on an another ongoing mental breakdown. im an 16 year old female and tonight im going to end my life once my sis goes to bed and my dad goes to work. it's 1:39 am at the moment and im just so ready i've never felt this hopeless and i've got what it takes. Ive lost all my friends im a burden to my parents and i'm hooked on meth for almost a month now. before ive been doing coke 3-5 times a week. my life is ruined Â i have no more options to fix it. my mental states a mess im diganosed with ocd and depression and my delusions from when i was a child are coming back and im experiencing more sleep paralysis, exploding head syndrome, and falling   asleep hallcuations im start this will lead to something actual. it's over tonight i can end it and end everyone's misery over me tonight.goodbye
