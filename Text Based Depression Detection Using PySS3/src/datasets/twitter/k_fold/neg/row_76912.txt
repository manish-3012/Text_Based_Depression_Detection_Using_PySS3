I can't explain it but I really wanna die.I don't see a purpose In life, eventually the universe will collapse in upon itself. I used to really enjoy life but slowly I have been getting worse and worse. Everyone I talk to says I'm crazy and I have a stupid one sides romance with someone I thought I was close to. Really the only thing stopping me is I just don't want anyone to have to cover my funeral expenses and I just don't wanna be a burden.
