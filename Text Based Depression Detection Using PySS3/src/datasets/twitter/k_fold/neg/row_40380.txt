Having a lot of thoughts of suicide recently after losing yet another job and being too depressed and honestly sociopathic to care to even try to find a new oneWas trying at first, but I applied at like 15 different places and didn't even get a call for one interview after going in and talking with all of them multiple times over like 3 weeks..... Been thinking it'll just be easier to leave. I'm not bringing anything to the world or my family or to anyone. I'm costing my parents money. I'm wasting everyone's time. There's absolutely no good coming from me being here besides the fact that if I wasn't a microscopic amount of people comparatively would be a little sad for a week and then move on, I won't ruin the world or anyone's life. My mom and dad might be devastated, but I mean they're not gonna do anything it doesn't matter nothing does hsjdjfnsjdbcnfnf
