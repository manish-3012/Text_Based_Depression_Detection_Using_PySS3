I have never posted before but I need someone. ðŸ˜žI have had an extremely difficult life in every way you could imagine. I have kept fighting. But I fell in love. Itâ€™s not my first time but the force it took me to love again is something i cant explain. He was my best friend. I tried for months to get over him. He has been so patient. Hurt by my being hurt. We basically dated without the title. I didnâ€™t know what he was doing though so i thought i had to play â€œthe gameâ€ which i had never done before. It ended up being my downfall and he started dating another woman a few months ago. She says she loves him and he says he might love her. I am not ok. Today we talked and held eachother for hours. He just let me cry. Then he walked away forever. I told him i needed him to be strong for me and help me not talk to him because i have been in so much pain. I am not ok. I canâ€™t lose someone else. Especially not someone i love. Someone i felt safe with for the first time. I am begging the universe to let me keep him. With everything Iâ€™ve been through i am surprised this is the worst pain ive ever felt. But it is. I cant deal with this. I dont know what i did in the world to deserve the life ive had and what people have done to me. Im strong as hell though and have made it through it all but this is going to kill me. It IS killing me. I will never have him and ive lost my best friend. I cant handle this. What did I do to deserve this? The world is so cruel. It made him just for me. Perfect just for me. Put him in front of me. Let me feel safe then it ripped him away. I am not ok ðŸ˜ž
