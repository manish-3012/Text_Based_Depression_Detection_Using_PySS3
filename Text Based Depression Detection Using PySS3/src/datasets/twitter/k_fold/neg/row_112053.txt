Hi. I'm 14 years old.Hi. I know what you're probably thinking at this point "Oh he's just a teenager, just some hormones" Well no, that's not it at all. I can still remember being depressed when I was somewhere in 3rd grade? Somewhere around that time. I just don't see the point. My grades have always been shit and I've barely scraped up to pass every year. I mean, there's no doubt your entire future depends on your grades throughout your life and I can't even see myself getting the local community college. I have just around two weeks of school left and me passing? No, not gonna happen. I can't tell anyone that I'm depressed these days. My friends are barely so and don't care enough to do anything. I'm a compulsive liar, an idiot, and a overall failure to my family by this point. Even if I somehow managed to drag myself through middle school and high school there's always going to be my grades over my head, constanly reminding me I have a shit future waiting for me. So why not end it now? Just save myself the extra bull in the future and by the time anyone who cares about me, even a little, can just move on and forget me by the time they're out of high school.
Thanks for reading.
This is my first post on Reddit so don't be a jerk if I did something wrong, alright?
Sorry for wasting your time, I guess.
