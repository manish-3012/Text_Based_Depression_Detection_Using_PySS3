I donâ€™t have an interesting title. Iâ€™m not that witty, but I believe I should include the word RANTI have been struggling lately. I think Iâ€™ve posted all over reddit. Iâ€™ve been reading some posts that seem to show that I am not alone in feeling crazy, acting inappropriately or feeling suicidal or even trying to plan it. Iâ€™m not saying any of that is healthy. I am aware that it is not. That is why itâ€™s hard to find ppl to discuss these things bc most ppl will not admit or acknowledge it when they have it. The world can be so lonely sometimes so it is reassuring to hear that Iâ€™m not entirely psychotic despite my diagnosis being bipolar 1 with psychotic features. Sometimes I get so angry at myself and my existence. I have more hatred for myself than I ever have anyone. Ugh this has turned into a rant so Iâ€™m stopping. Iâ€™m just gonna drop my poem here.

One less piece of trash
In this litter filled world
One less waste of space
In the shape of a girl
