I just want it to stopIâ€™m tired of waking up everyday.

I have severe ptsd from ongoing traumas throughout my life. Every waking second of my life is painful, and I donâ€™t get much of a break while asleep due to nightmares. Iâ€™ve pushed away or ended every relationship/friendship Iâ€™ve ever had and Iâ€™m completely alone. Recently I got into legal trouble and am facing felony convictions. I just feel like it would be best for everyone if I were dead. Iâ€™m tired of being in pain. Iâ€™m tired of fighting for the sake of my family. I just want this to be over.
