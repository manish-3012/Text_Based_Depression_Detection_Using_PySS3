Today is my birthday. I donâ€™t believe that anyone cares about me.I feel like as I get older thereâ€™s nothing left for me. My friends are losing interest in me no matter how much more I invest into those relationships in order to keep them. They are the only reason I keep myself alive. But yet, none of my friends make any efforts out of what is initiated by me. I am never good enough. Itâ€™s really hard to make myself think that anything will get betterâ€”I cannot make more friends. Iâ€™m not interesting or contribute anything to anyoneâ€™s life ever. Iâ€™m alone without reason to keep going. Iâ€™m losing hope and losing the patience that things will end up ok. I want to die.
