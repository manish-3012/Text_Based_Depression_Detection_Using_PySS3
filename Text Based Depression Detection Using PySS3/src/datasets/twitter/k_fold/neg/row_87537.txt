I don't know what I'm doing anymoreI am close to giving up I lived in a good family that had enough money and all of a sudden its going wrong(money is gone family is tearing apart because of stress and its makeing me depressed) I know this seems really shallow but the thing is Im really depressed so I recently decided to buy me a knife in Counter Strike by selling a few things, I ended up falling short and tried to gamble to get the remainder that I needed ofcourse I just ended up losing everything I had and now I feel like the biggest sack of shit ever.
