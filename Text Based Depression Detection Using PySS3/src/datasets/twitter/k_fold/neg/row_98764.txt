Nostalgia hurtsCurrently listening to the ost of a game that my ex girlfriend played with me. She generally dislikes video games but it was the one game that she didn't mind playing with me. It's a depressing song already but I can remember listening to it in the background while we both fell asleep on my tiny bed. I don't know why I keep listening to it, its' been 5 years already. It's not like anything is going to get change and get better.
