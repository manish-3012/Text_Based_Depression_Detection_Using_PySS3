Can't think of a title for this that's not really generic.This post is way too long. Don't read it. My life has been an unending string of disasters that have reduced me to a pitiful shell of the person that I used to be. At my private Christian pre-school I was apparently a rambunctious child, prompting the owners of the fine establishment to speculate that my horrid indiscretions such as being left handed and going to the restroom without a pass were a textbook case of "demonic possession." My mother yanked me out of that school away from everyone I had known there and took me to a different Christian pre-school, from which I graduated into a private Christian elementary school run by the same staff. Everything was great for a while until a change of management brought me into the charge of an upstanding woman of faith who informed me about many of the facts of life, such as "all real families have a father" (I'm the child of a single mother). 
As a result of this and similar revelations I came to spend much of my time in the school library crying, until I received the sage advice that I should "Shut up" because I was "just making everybody miserable." The Bible consoled me with the thought that the majority of people on the planet were irrevocably bound for eternal torture. Especially the possessed ones. I figured I'd save God some time in collecting me for the pit; my mom caught me with a butcher knife pointed at my throat and took me out of that school too (and once again the company of all of my friends.) I dealt with this cultural shift in the way that any rational person would - by banging my head on a metal pole until my mom picked me up from school each day. 
It wasn't long before I was tracked into a program for "special kids" at school. I literally rode the short bus. This is when I learned about the magnificent benevolence of the human race. My teachers in a positive frenzy of mercy decided to keep all of the hard things that I clearly couldn't deal with at arms length in favor of informative stories from the "7 Habits of Highly Effective People." One such story was about an Olympic swimmer who achieved last place in all the events, but for whom people still cheered because he tried. I learned from these sorts of lessons that if I really gave it my all, someday maybe I too could be a failure of the sort that people patronize to out of politeness. In fact largely because of my situation (re. short bus), in my social life I'm pretty sure people thought of me that way already. I guess dreams really can come true. 
Over time I learned that if you put on a facade of frivolity and happiness, people at least pay attention to you even if they can't be guaranteed to like you. I got a reputation as a class clown pretty quickly after that. People told me that I made boring classes entertaining. That was the closest I ever felt like I got to friendship with most people. I had a few friends, but to most people I think I was an annoying gadfly. 
Still things seemed like they could be looking up. I got into a public high school that didn't have the equivalent program, effectively mainstreaming myself. The administrators there had a different opinion of me than those at my first school, and I was tracked into AP and Honors programs. Then I got into a fairly prestigious college, though not Ivy League. I think it surprised people that the same person who would stand up and yell "DUN DUN DUNNNN" at dramatic points in class was pulling a 3.8 GPA. I made a lot of friends freshman year of college too. I thought my problems might be over. 

Then I got diagnosed with some sort of problem that none of my doctors could explain, and had to have an organ removed, forcing me to drop about a semester of classes, and to commute back to my home town every week for the next 6 months for follow up treatments. After a while most of my friends basically abandoned me to have fun and do their own thing. I can't really blame them, except that I do. But I also blame myself for not being the kind of person who's interesting enough to deserve friends. Call me irrational for believing this if you want, but there are plenty of people who get WAY worse than I've had and have friends around them helping them through it. Clearly Iâ€™m doing something wrong. Anyway, I thought maybe that was just a rough patch too and things would start going back to normal. But in the period of about 1 year, mostly concentrated in the last 6 months, all sorts of other things happened, which I will summarize to save length on this already absurdly long post: 
- I got fired from my first job for not knowing how to do something they never trained me to do after a grand total of about 2 months back after surgery, and haven't worked since
- My mom took 20 sleeping pills and I had to stay up all night making her promise she'd never do it again, telling her to go to the hospital over the phone, etc.
- My mom almost died from an infected tooth, temporarily developed dementia, and started having random falls on the pavement
- My first girlfriend ever and I broke up, and she told me that she loved some other guy that she fell in love with afterwards at least "a million times" more than she had ever loved me. Also apparently I'm ugly.
- I started getting high blood pressure, and about a billion cavities that I can't afford to fill right now.
- Everybody I know moved into off campus apartments, me included. I don't have a car and can't drive, so it's almost impossible to schedule any sort of social or recreational events. 
- There is suspicion that I may be a victim of identity theft. I know nothing about credit and have never used a credit card in my life, but it's apparently already ruined.
- After a while I lost my ability to pretend to be happy all the time, and most of my friends stopped contact with me. They all found replacements that were more interesting and fun than I am. And that's basically all anybody cares about. 
The immediate cause of me writing this post is that my roommates apparently didn't even think it was necessary to inform me about what they were doing at all until one day before they decided to move out of the apartment I set up for everybody. I used to consider two of them my friends. I should have anticipated this since they mostly ignore me now too.
I used to be optimistic about human nature, but now I'm convinced that people in general only act out of self-interest, and love and friendship are just convenient lies that we tell ourselves to feel less shallow. I feel like I'm being consumed by bitterness and misanthropy, and I think it would scare the hell out of me if I were not also being consumed by apathy and nihilism. Thank God for small favors I guess. I'm not sure if I would characterize myself as suicidal, but sometimes I think that if I were hit by a meteor and died tomorrow, I wouldn't mind as long as it was quick and painless. By the age of about 21, I already feel like I've lost hope for the future.
