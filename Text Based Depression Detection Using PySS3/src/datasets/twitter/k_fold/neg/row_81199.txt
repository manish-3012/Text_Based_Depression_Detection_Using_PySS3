Tired of constant anxiety, hypervigilance and depressionI donâ€™t want to die, but it feels like it is hard for to find peace of mind. Sometimes I dream about not existing at all in terms of complete absence from the world. Never been, never to become. Nothing to compare to. Kind of before one was born, if that is where we come from. Billions year passed without any sense of effort.  If there was life before that and no absence, at least there was a  refresing reset that is comparable to that. Iâ€™d like to have a something like that. To leave it out and start fresh.
