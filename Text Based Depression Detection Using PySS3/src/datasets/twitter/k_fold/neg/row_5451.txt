Part 2So this time last night I was crying and typing things out for this subreddit and explaining it all thinking I'd get a solution.

I got mad, got sad, deleted my post, then attempted.

Failed and came back. I want to want to be around, but I don't. 

When I express this to someone close to me I feel like an outcast.

When I express this to the internet I feel too privileged to complain.

I just want to stop feeling things but owe too much to my friends and family.  i hate the idea of them being sad because I'm gone. I just wish they'd forget me.


anyhow, just getting this off my chest (again). I hope I'll die in my sleep tonight, but if not ttyl
