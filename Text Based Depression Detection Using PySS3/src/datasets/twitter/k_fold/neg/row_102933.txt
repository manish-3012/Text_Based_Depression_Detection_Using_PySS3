Asking for suggestions for a session on Suicide preventionHello guys

I have to deliver a presentation on how social media and internet can help in suicide prevention. 

I am currently based in India and would love it if I could get some perspective from you people about why people commit suicide, how can they be stopped from doing it or anything else that you feel I should talk about. 

Thank you :)
