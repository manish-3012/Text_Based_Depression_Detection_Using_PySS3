What to Do?I'm usually here helping other people but today I need help. Been struggling with depression for two years and my antidepressants have stopped working now. I hit a new low today and all I wanted was to jump off a building. I hate myself for having these thoughts because I don't wanna hurt the people I love. What to do now?  I don't want counselling because I have tried it before and it made me worse. I don't want to go off my meds because I'm scared of what I might feel and do.
