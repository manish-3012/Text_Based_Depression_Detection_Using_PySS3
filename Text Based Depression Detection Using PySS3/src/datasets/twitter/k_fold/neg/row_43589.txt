I just need to talk.This will deteriorate into rambling soon, I know it will... so forgive the structure. I am falling apart at the seams. It's not surprising, given that I was barely holding on before. Years back I fell apart similarly to now. Back then, over a span of three years, I tried to take my own life five times. I fear that I'm heading down that path once again. Since I can't reach my therapist and all others are out of reach... I came here. I just need to get things out of my head and somewhere else._x000D_
I won't lie, I fucked up. I pushed away someone who loved me and whom I loved. I had a reason, but perhaps I did the wrong thing. I am a prideful and selfish person and while I might've helped her solve a dilemma within her... I am miserable without her. I lost the chance I was given. There's no way for me to contact her, the account is gone, she left no digital footprint to follow, I tried and couldn't find anything. And it's all my fault. She's gone and I'm powerless, like always._x000D_
I haven't eaten anything in days. When I tried, I just vomit. Any time I think about what happened, I vomit. My heart hurts, my physical heart, the organ pumping blood... Probably because my panic attack lasts for a few days now without end. I barely sleep. All I do is sit in silence. I know what this means for me, I know where it leads. How it ends.
