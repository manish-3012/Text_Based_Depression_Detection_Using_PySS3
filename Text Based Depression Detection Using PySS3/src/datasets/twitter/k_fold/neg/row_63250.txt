I've struggled with depression over the years, and I've had a rough couple of months.This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Since my early teens I have always struggled with depression. It comes and goes, I've always felt disconnected from people. At times I've wondered if I possibly have Autism or another mental disorder. Even though I am comfortable in social situations, I feel as though it's only because I've learned the patterns and behaviors I am supposed to exhibit. I do not actually feel or connect with people the way others seem to.

Anyway, this month me and my long term girlfriend broke up. This caused me to have to find a new place to live. This is causing a financial strain on me because I was also let go from my job. On top of this I was in a car accident and my mother was diagnosed with cancer. 

I haven't had problems with depression in years, and I pride myself on overcoming the demons that bested me earlier in my life. However, I cannot deny that this month I have been "down" (I'm assuming most people in this sub know what I mean) and tonight for the first time in about 10 years I am seriously considering a way out. 

It has been great to get all of these issues off of my chest however even in writing them I am realizing the hopelessness of my situation. I have never been this far into the hole before, I would appreciate any kind words or advice.
