I dont want to die but I don.t see other way outI dont even know is it ok to post here because I dont plan to commit suicide yet but I have noone or nowhere to turn to.    
I'm just really tired of myself.   


I know i know in comparison of other, I am lucky, I have no disabilities, a roof to be under, three meals on table and perents who don't treat my bad. Yet constantly, I just fucking keep ruining my life. And I dont know how to fix it. It just a repeat that i thought I was doing fine for once to just found out I done thing horribly wrong, or forget important event, for example my fucking final exam on Friday.  

I try, I did try. But why it never enough, why right in front of the end I have fucking ruin everything and just throw all my effort away because my brain just want to fuck with me. I just wish I have a gun so I could blow it to mush.   
I have no friend to fucking ask hey. please help me in the fucking photography that I have to do in college.   


I am just so done, done with my future that I had flush down the toilet the moment I choose to follow the fucking wild dream, done with the resentment that I have no one by my side to help me while everyone have one, done with me who just have to keep fuck everything up, done with the burden (which is me) who always have to rely on my parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

So done with me who don't have to courage to die while I know I absolutely should, for me and everyone's sake.   


I just wish something just kill me. I should not be born at all. I am sorry.
