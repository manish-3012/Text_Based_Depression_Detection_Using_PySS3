I'm going to run away and kill myself in the next two weeks...There's a lot of shit going on in my life right now. Most of it is permanently ruining my life. I've been on and off suicidal for a while, and I've been self harming and taking drugs/drinking. I'm only 14 but I've been through a lot and I'm tired of everything. The worst of it all has happened, and now I have no family to talk to, no family that loves me, I can't see my friends anymore, so I have no one. I've lost my phone and all my freedom to hang out so I have nothing going for me. I also fucked up everything for myself and the people around me. I feel like I have no more chances, and even if I did, I would have to live in this shitty way for another 5 years. I can't take it anymore. I know it doesn't seem like much, but it's really complicated. I'm sorry for wasting your time, but please don't comment saying that I'm being a bitch or what not. I'm running away from home in a few days to the city, I'm going to spend my last days with homeless people, doing drugs and getting drunk, and then I'm going to kill myself by slitting my wrists, overdosing, starving, or just jumping off a cliff. I've written a runaway/suicide note already.
