In less than a year I will literally be the lowest man on our planet.I don't really believe, or agree with the notion of "good" or "bad" but if I had to fit into I would be the latter. I have always been an asshole who literally only cared about himself and even when i felt guilty about being one I didn't care unless it actually affected me.

I'm 20 years old and in college. (Well it's summer break). Recently had a VERY bad break up. I'm not gonna say this is the reason that I'm doing this but it certainly didn't help. And it's just another prime example of me being a deplorable human pile of shit.

I have had suicidal thoughts since was in second grade and have always liked the idea of it but I think I should have done it much sooner than now. I would have preferred to have been aborted because I think I have only caused pain to other people in the world.

So many of my problems are indescribable. They feel so niche and pointless to some. Maybe they are. But I think I need to go. I ruined the life of someone I dearly love. That is unacceptable.

I have been thinking of how I was going to end my life, A gun would be too much and hard to get, There are few tall buildings close by and I'm scared of heights so jumping is unlikely. 100% helium isn't sold easily in amazon and I've already tried a noose.

So, I have another way to kill myself. I really want to talk to someone but at the moment im feeling very tired.
