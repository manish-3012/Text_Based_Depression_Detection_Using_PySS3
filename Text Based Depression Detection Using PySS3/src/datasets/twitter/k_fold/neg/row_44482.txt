My life and my career is a shitshow. cant take anymoreI did what everyone says is the right thing.... found something  I liked and could be good at. Went to school to get an honours degree in a field with pretty good job prospects. I could have left it there and got a job like my classmates did. But I made the worst decision of my life and decided to keep going, narrowed it down and did a phd. That phd has ruined my life. Because its so specialised there are no job prospects. I hate academia so I dont want to continue down that path. I dont have enough transferable skills (apparently) to get a job. After 10 fucking years of college I cant get a job other than a minimum wage data entry clerk. I cant afford to buy clothes to go to work. I cant afford to take a vacation or keep my car. Im a five thousand dollars in debt and I'm drowning. I'm 32 years old and I borrow money of my mom and dad every couple of weeks because I cant make ends meet. I've tried looking for jobs and nobody wants to hire me. I cant take it anymore.

The fucking ironic thing is, I tried to kill myself when I was 19 years old because I felt like I would never make something of myself or get to college, I felt hopeless and trapped. I got better though and when I finally went to college and was good at it I thought my future was bright and I'd never think of suicide again. But here I am once again. I feel like I've been fooled. My life and my career is a mess and I've done all I can just to end up getting kicked in the  teeth again. Fuck this.
