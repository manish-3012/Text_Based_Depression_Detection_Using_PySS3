Poem that I care about for some reason
Finally I can think less!   
Give me peace and go.   
Jigsaws start making sense,   
seconds before the snow.    
    
Lightbulbs pop and shatter    
Glass will remain here in these doors  
Where the ravens choose to gather     
Silently, forevermore     

Iâ€™m a bleeding field of flowers  
Bed of nails; toss and turn
Iâ€™ve been in this room for hours 
The troughs have been out worn

The plants are violent, hungry
Kick down the doors and let them see 
Touch, explore, snatch, crush, 
And slice right into me

You could come watch me melting
Down by the corner store
Where the vine wrapped brick buildings 
Restrain me by my core

The air is sharp and frozen
Heat takes the form of trees
Earth was surely severed and
Her halves will never meet

I donâ€™t know creative
Inspiration is on strike 
Iâ€™m exposing the inner body
With a rusted pocket knife

Scar tissue disintegrates 
Sirens swarm in to steal peeks
Of the purpura nautica 
Of a sailor who never saw the sea
