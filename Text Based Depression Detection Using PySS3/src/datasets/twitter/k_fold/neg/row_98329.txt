i dont want this anymoreI'm angry and tired. Recently I've been getting dizzy spells, and I'm almost always tired and irritated. I can't sleep well. But I don't want to get up either. I'm constantly just 'floating', drifting in and out of a limbo like state.


I hurt myself, and it was brought to light by a few teachers when I got careless and accidentally exposed the scars. I spoke to the school counsellor, but it feels like she's not listening.

Finally my teacher told me to stop lying to myself. That I should stop hiding who I am and asking for attention. That I should stop pretending my life is sad to get people to listen.


I don't know if I'm really pretending to be sad to gain attention. Even now, I'm still trying to figure it out. Maybe I am, considering I feel lonely despite having friends.

But never once in my life did I feel I could truly talk to anyone. i want to seek professional help, I do. But even if I did and assuming my parents won't mock me, they wouldn't be able to afford it. Or maybe I'd be distrusting of the doctor.

I have friends. People I genuinely feel happy around. But most of the time I can't help but lose patience with them for stupidly small things. I get angry with them. But they're nice enough to brush it off. Or maybe they're just tolerating it, I don't know.


My mind is a bloody hellhole. I can'-t look at someone or do something without the constant fear that they'll hate me. Even if it's for small things like not saying, "Hi.". It's pure torture when I mess up. For hours I keep harping on the bloody thing, and feel like an overall piece of scum.


I don't want to do anything, I just want to die. I probably should be seeking medical help. But that's not an option for me anymore. Talking to people won't work, so for now, until  I'm ready to go, I have decided to push everyone around me away because I don't want anyone wasting tears on me when I go.


Just wanted to get this off my chest.
