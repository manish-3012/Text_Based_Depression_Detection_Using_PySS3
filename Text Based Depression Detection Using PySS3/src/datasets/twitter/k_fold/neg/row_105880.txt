[20M] I just want it to end...Life just feels worthless, I feel worthless.
I am currently on an edge to suicide as my current state of deep depression just keeps on going while as I feel useless to everyone and kinda acknowledge that no one will ever truly love me as my current gf is about to break up with me because of how I think about myself.
It just feels as there is nothing else to live for, as there won't be a happy end for me.
