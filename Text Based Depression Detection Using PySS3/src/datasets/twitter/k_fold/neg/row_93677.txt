I canâ€™t even talk with someone about my feelings so why would I live longer like this (donâ€™t mind my English)I really donâ€™t know what to say but thoughts about suicide are getting in my head and I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I want to look for help but I donâ€™t wanna live my life anymore. Iâ€™m doing my best to be the perfect daughter for my mother and be the perfect sibling but every time they donâ€™t trust me and they searching everything in my room to find what they can use against me. 
But in general I canâ€™t talk with anyone in my family about my feelings. Itâ€™s like a taboo in our household. Iâ€™ve got anger issues and since a couple of weeks Iâ€™m getting panic attacks because I overthink too much. Iâ€™m stressing too much. Iâ€™m going on walks without anyone knowing so if I want to disappear for good they wonâ€™t know it.

The reason I donâ€™t talk about my feelings with my friends is because they wouldnâ€™t understand all the pain Iâ€™ve been through. I see my feelings as a weak point which I donâ€™t ever have to share with anyone. The person Iâ€™m projecting is someone who doesnâ€™t feel affected at all and doesnâ€™t have much emotions to share but when Iâ€™m alone all those things are getting on me. 

It has officially become too much to handle and I donâ€™t ever want to share my feelings so Iâ€™m getting bad thoughts on how to end it all. I hope that if Iâ€™m gone someday they will finally accept that sharing your feelings will help others and that they learn a big lesson. My voice doesnâ€™t count so why would I share my feelings with them?
