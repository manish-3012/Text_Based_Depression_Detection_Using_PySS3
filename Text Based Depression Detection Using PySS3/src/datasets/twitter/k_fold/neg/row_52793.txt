How am I supposed to face another Christmas like this?I have nothing to show for myself. I'm just a burden. How am I supposed to look people in the eye when I can't afford to get anyone anything.

I've been thinking of going to another country and trying to disappear before I kill myself. I'm too full of guilt to do it here. There's always something going on that makes me want to wait and not pile more shit onto the people around me. Maybe I can just disappear.

I've tried to get help, I've tried medication. I'm just not suitable for life.

I've made an attempt before. I plan on setting a date to do it and in the mean time desensitize myself to harming myself.

I wish people could understand.
