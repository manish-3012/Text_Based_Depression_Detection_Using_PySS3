My boyfriend thought about killing himself and is sinking into a deep depression. Please help me help him.Reddit, I think I need your help. I've been dating a wonderful guy for the past year; he's smart, funny, and absolutely one of the best human beings I know. The problem is that I am convinced he has serious depression and so far has not received help for it.

The story: He was seemed like a normal enough happy guy when I met him a year ago, but sometimes he'd get pessimistic and sad out of the blue and start saying things like "Why does everyone think life is worth living and has a point?" He's a philosophy major, so at first I just thought this was hypothetical discourse and talked about it academically. This kept on happening on and off a couple of months after we started dating until one day we went out to the local pizza place and I guess it was a bad day, he started sobbing in the car and told me about the time when he was in high school and he was all set up in his fathers garage to kill himself but somehow couldn't bring himself to do it. We both cried and he agreed to go to the campus psych center and get some counseling. He went and the psychologist tried to tell him he has A.D.D. (which may or may not be true, but it wasn't really the issue he was there to seek out help for). So he stopped going but it was soon pretty clear that this wasn't some passing event. I think it might have been in his childhood too. I asked him why he never did more activities as a kid and he said that he didn't want to bother his parents and make them have to take time to come to practices or games or anything like that (and I know his parents and sisters and they are not negligent or mean parents).

Sometimes when I spent the night at his place, he bolts up in the middle of the night in a panic. I don't mean like whiny, attention-seeking behavior, I'm talking real mental distress. After a party once, with his friend crashing on the couch outside his bedroom, I made a silly joke about death as we were dozing off and he freaked out and bolted out of bed to the front yard and it took a good fifteen minutes to calm him down and convince him to go back inside. That's happened twice since I've known him, but generally he doesn't talk about his depression or his thoughts (to 'not worry me') and I thought it might have calmed down until he graduated a few weeks ago. He applied to a fellowship and a teach-English-in-China program. The fellowship rejected him and he told me plainly that he doesn't want to go to China, but 'what else can he do'? His friends are slowly leaving town for their own careers and he's convinced he will never do anything with his degree because he has no interests or passion for anything. He tried going back to the clinic once more after that but they seem to be going in the wrong direction and counseling him on 'changing his negative thoughts' but I don't think he even told them the full extent of his depression.

He's a smart, wonderful man but he's plagued by these feelings that it's too late for him, he's squandered all his opportunities, and he won't ever do anything with his life but worry me and he wants better than that for me. It breaks my heart to see him like this and I stay up at night worrying about him. I can't do much in person right now because I'm 300 miles away on a research internship until August but I desperately need to find help for him. I don't even know what I'd do if he hurt himself or worse. His parents and friends don't know, I don't think, but I don't want to tell them. Counseling isn't helping him and he's been getting more and more depressed since graduation in May. I asked him when the last time he thought about suicide was a couple of days ago and he said 'yesterday'.

Please Reddit, I love this man and I want to spend my life with him. Please tell me what I can do or where I can find help for him so he doesn't have to live this way.

Edit: I posted this in /r/Askreddit, which is apparently a bad idea. Please just don't tell me to leave him and get on with my life. This is not manipulation, this is not a teenage phase, this is quite real and scary.
