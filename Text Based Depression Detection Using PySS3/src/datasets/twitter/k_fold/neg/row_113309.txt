My boyfriend gets mad at me when I'm sad sometimesI've been doing kinda well lately, I haven't really had any suicidal thoughts in a long while and no sobbing fits either. 

I am kinda paranoid and always think all these horrible things: I'm evil, annoying, stupid, a burden, and nobody likes me, etc. I ask my boyfriend to reassure me about these things like I ask him if he still likes me and loves me. 

Well last night I was feeling guilty over some stupid shit I did in the past, a long time ago, and told him I was sorry I was a bad person. I asked him if he thought I was a bad person and he got really mad at me. 

He went on a huge rant about how he hates it when I ask these stupid questions that I already know the answers to and how I have no good reason to think all these bad things. I said how I always forget the good and remember only the bad when I'm sad and he said, "I doubt it."

He doesn't really understand depression at all. He doesn't understand why I'm sad over things that happened ages ago, and he doesn't understand that I genuinely think those bad things are true when I'm sad. I've tried explaining depression to him and that I'm not lying about what I feel, but he didn't believe me and he doesn't understand. He says, "Why can't you just ask for cuddles or shit instead of interrogating me?"

I never meant to be annoying, I didn't mean to make him feel like I was interrogating him. I just like to hear nice things and be reassured that I'm not terrible. I never realize that me asking these questions again and again and "Really? Are you sure?" makes him so angry.

It's been like a whole day but I can't stop sobbing. I feel like such a burden and like I'm just annoying when I'm sad, and like he doesn't ever want me to ask for help. I just wanna die because I feel so horrible after last night. I want to hang myself or cut myself open, please help.
