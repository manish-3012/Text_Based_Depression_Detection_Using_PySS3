Posting my old poetry before I decide to finally do it. My way of letting go of my belongings..Disappointment. Failure. 
Your future lies ahead in misty clouds of which way is which. You've chosen a road with pavement stripping off. Broken signs causing confusion none can which lead you. You walk for what may seem like years sweating all your pain. Soaked in regret and shame leaving traces of your misfortune behind with each strained step you'll find. Your calves ache and your feet blister. But you continue walking along this never ending path enduring such pointless hardships 

You'll never succeed. 
You'll never suffice.

You're a disappointment.
You're a failure. 

I know the periods are whack but it wonâ€™t let me post it in the format in which it was meant to be read, so periods for emphasis and pausing is the best I could do. Sorry.
