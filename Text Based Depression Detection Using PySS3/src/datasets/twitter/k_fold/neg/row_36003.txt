my university messed up and iâ€™m going to do it tomorrowclasses start tomorrow and today they send me an email that i didnâ€™t get the only class i signed up for for my minor. this was the only class i looked forward to this year and they tell my one day before that i didnâ€™t get in and that i now basically have to study a whole nother year since i actually need that class for my future job. 
i sent them an email, but itâ€™s sunday so on one is working here (im from germany).

nothing ever goes right in my life and to some people this might seem like a stupid thing to push me over the edge, but iâ€™m just so done with everything.
i canâ€™t remember not being suicidal. i literally wanted to kill myself since i was like five and iâ€™m just so done. there is no point in anything and all my plans will never work out. iâ€™ll go to my uni tomorrow and if things wonâ€™t get resolved iâ€™ll honestly just jump in front of a subway train. i donâ€™t even care anymore. why be miserable and study something i donâ€™t even care about to get a job i donâ€™t want just to die when im old when i can just do it now.
