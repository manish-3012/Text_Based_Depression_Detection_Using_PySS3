I quit my horrible awful please kill me now job today. Now what?Two more weeks of hoping to die in a car accident on the way there in the morning, but too numb to shed a tear. Two more weeks of terror at the idea of repeating today tomorrow on the trip home. And then, I guess I'll find out how much deeper the issues go. Will there be rainbows and singing birds the morning after?

I know my life will remain pointless. This fantasy of freedom is all there is.
