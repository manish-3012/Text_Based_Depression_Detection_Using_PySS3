I tried to kill myself last night but my friend stopped meNow I feel absolutely heartbroken. I begged him &amp; begged him to let me go, that I donâ€™t wanna be here anymore. Screamed at him for how selfish he is for keeping me alive. I ran away &amp; tried to jump into the canal, but he chased after me &amp; kept pushing me away so I couldnâ€™t jump in. I wrote a suicide note a week ago &amp; left it for him to find before I left the house. I have been so serious about this for so long but I canâ€™t do it. Instead Iâ€™m forced to stay alive &amp; be trapped in my own head. Iâ€™d be happier if I was dead. I spend everyday slicing my wrists up, hating myself. Surely he should see that Iâ€™d be better off dead.
