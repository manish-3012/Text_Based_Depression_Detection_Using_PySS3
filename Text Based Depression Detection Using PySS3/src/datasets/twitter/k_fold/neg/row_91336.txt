I see the end.I just cant get a win in life.   Or in general.  Cant even win a simple video game.   

Ever since jan 2015 ive been in a absolute living hell.  Before that i was in a bareable hell.    Now, i have literally no friends, no aquaintences, a family who doesnt understand.   

I'm a failure at literally everything i do.  I'm done trying to live.  Not worth the struggle.   Not worth it to keep hurting my family over and over with lies and petty problems.     

I'm getting the idea that the universe doesnt want me here but for some reason likes to just beat me down, way down past rock bottom.   

If my Family is reading this.  Im so sorry.  I really tried in life but life didnt want me to get far.  It didnt want me to be happy for some reason.  Ive lost  3 friends to suicide and they were all that i had.  Maybe the universe/life is telling me to join them.   Im sorry for those that i will hurt.  Im sorry i was a disappointment.   Im sorry for everything.  Forgive me.  

Goodbye.
