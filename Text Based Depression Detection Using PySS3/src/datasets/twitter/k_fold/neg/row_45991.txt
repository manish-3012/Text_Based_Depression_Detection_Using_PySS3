Alone.I deserve the feelings. 

I don't deserve happiness, I should just stay alone.
I'm not anyone's friend, no one's partner, no one's thought. 
I'm just a highschool kid with nothing other than her art.
I have no one to smile about. My mom is nice and so is my brother, but Im a burden.
They'll be ok, I think.

I wonder if it would be easy to go for the pills right now. 
I want to, yet I'm too tired to move away from my bed for them.

Being a kid isn't bliss when all you are is a mistake.
