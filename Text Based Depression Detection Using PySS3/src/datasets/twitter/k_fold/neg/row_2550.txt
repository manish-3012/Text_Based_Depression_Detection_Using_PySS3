Is there any reason beyond empty platitudes why i shouldn't do it tonight?Life is empty, lonely, and devoid of all color. Everyday is the same. People put on fake smiles to work jobs they don't want so they can afford things they think they care about.

This is not something I want to be apart of or near at all.

I thought people cared about one another and sought meaning in the blank void. Instead they use and abuse acquaintances, friends, and even family and then they toss them to the side.

Maybe my one flaw was I tried to change a terrible place into something decent.

Oh well, time to go join the hoards of other suicidal white men.
