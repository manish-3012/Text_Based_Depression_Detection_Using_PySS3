I tried right ? Now its not on meHello, just wanna share this 

3 months ago I started going to gym, going out with friends every friday / saturday when possible, got a "Nice" haircut, stopped with sleeping for 10+ hours a day and tried to live like a normal person

And here im, still sad depressed fuck with no gf ... I feel like I should end it 

Why am I like this ???
