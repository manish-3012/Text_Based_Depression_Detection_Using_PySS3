Is this a good idea??Hey there. I'm a 14 year old male from Denmark and i've been thinking of comitting suicide for about 2 years and i was thinking:
Instead of comitting suicide, i could just leave everything for a couple of days, by simply packing a bottle of water and a bag of food and just leave, to make my normal routine a little diffrent.

Is this a bad idea? I have started to fall in love with a girl who also loves me, so i think she's going to miss me, but i really need a while away for everything. My parents and close friends might miss me too....
