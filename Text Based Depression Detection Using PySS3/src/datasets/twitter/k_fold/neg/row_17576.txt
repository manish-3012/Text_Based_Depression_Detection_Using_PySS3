I'm completely trapped...I'm a 30/F with Aspergers still living at home with my parents. My dream was to own a farm someday and have horses and lots of animals, but sadly that will never happen. Because I have crippling social anxiety and I suck at math, I can't get a decent job. I'm currently on disability for my issues. I have tried working other retail jobs to boost my social skills, but it didn't work. I've hated every second of it. Dealing with the public is just not for me. I'm just too awkward and I completely suck at talking to people. Right now I'm working a minimum wage job that I hate stocking shelves at a grocery store. It's so boring, but at least I don't have to deal with people much. 

I have thought about going back to school or learning web design, but the problem is that because I'm on social security, I can't make more than a certain amount per month. Getting rid of it is not an option because I would never be able to afford health insurance on my own. Also, if I get fired or if I'm unable to find work due to my poor social skills, I would have no income. 

I've literally racked my brain out trying to figure out what to do, but I guess I'm doomed to be poor the rest of my life. I don't really see a way out of this misery except killing myself. To make things worse, I just heard my sister and her boyfriend are buying a house with a lot of land and are planning on building a barn so they can have horses. And no, I'll never be able to go to my sister's house to visit the horses. She hasn't spoken to me in over 15 years because she thinks I'm a loser. I'm so sick and tired of hearing how successful my sister is and I'll never get to go anywhere in life or follow my dreams because of my issues.
