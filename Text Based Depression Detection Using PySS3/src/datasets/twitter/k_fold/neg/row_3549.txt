I'm too scared to want to live, because it seems inevitable I'll die soon.Everything for me and my family is constantly been going on a downwards spiral ever since I graduated 6th grade. I have tried so much to improve without any results. My friends even invited me over to live abroad for a while with them, it was really scary, even though I might have improved a little bit I was sent to a hospital because of the treat of me committing suicide, didn't do much other than men having to spend a night in a very uncomfortable position. My friends asked me to leave later because I was too much of a burden and I can't argue because I know I'm a useless pile of crap. Even my mom sometimes says it's better if I was gone. Maybe everyone is right I should be gone and I really wanna die sometimes, but I'm such a coward I can't make myself do it and idk why. Why can't I just free everyone of having to carry my burden on their shoulders? I'm useless I'll never be anything good so why can't I just be gone? I  hate myself, so ugly selfish and cruel. I'm just a monster.
