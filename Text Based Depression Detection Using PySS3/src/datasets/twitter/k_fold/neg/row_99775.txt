I canâ€™t even sit for a moment without thinking about my worries and anxietyI canâ€™t meditate because that gives me a moment to think about everything that is giving me debilitating stress. All I wanted to do was sit outside and watch the trees and the park and I couldnâ€™t even do that. I could only sit there and worry and feel uncomfortable and want to just cry. I just want to leave this world.
