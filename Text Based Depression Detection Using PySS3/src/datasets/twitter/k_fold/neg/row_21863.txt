Please help meIâ€™m starting to unravel. At my job I hired someone that has more qualifications than me, Iâ€™m afraid theyâ€™re going to fire me and give him my job. He deserves it, because Iâ€™m so messed up and confused Iâ€™m doing a terrible job anyway. I know the people there hate me, but I need it because I have a lot of debt I need to pay off. Iâ€™m recently divorced and I left behind 3 beautiful cats that were like children to me. I miss them so much it physically hurts me. My parents loved my ex husband and were devastated that I left him. They are strong, conservative Christians and are very judgmental. 

I started seeing this guy that I used to date in high school. My parents absolutely hate him. Heâ€™s more of a free thinker like me, has tattoos. He loved me for who I was and he was my best friend. I loved him so much. I have something wrong with me, Iâ€™m not sure. The therapist said it was major depression. I started pushing him away. I told him that I wanted to take a break to figure things out. I went cold, stopped talking to him. He threatened to tell my parents about our secret relationship to try to get me to talk to him. He showed up to the place my dads band was playing at and I freaked out. If they knew about our relationship theyâ€™d disown me, Iâ€™d never get to see them again or be the maid of honor at my sisters wedding. I told him I never wanted to see him again and he said he was going to tell everyone about our relationship.

I came clean to my parents, told them I had been seeing him behind their backs out of fear that heâ€™d tell them first. Theyâ€™re furious at me. My sister wonâ€™t speak to me. And my ex now has a new gf. I still love him and it hurts to know he could move on so quickly. Everyone that I love is gone.

Iâ€™m all alone. My Betta fish is dying. I canâ€™t do a single thing right. Please someone talk to me. I hate the silence. Iâ€™m so fucked up. Itâ€™s all my fault.
