Feeling so lostThe crippling anxiety and depression of everything I've been though feels like a weight that continues to press against my chest feeling like I'm suffocating...I never wanted my life to end and I'm far too afraid too...but If I had the chance I wouldn't want to exist with this current life, I'm far too damaged and broken..and the loneliness is killing me slowly...
