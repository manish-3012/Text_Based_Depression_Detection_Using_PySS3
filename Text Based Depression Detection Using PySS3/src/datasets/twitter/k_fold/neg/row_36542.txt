need someone to tell me i'm wrongI hate doing this. I hate that I have no one in my life that I can turn to and lean on, so as a result I am asking strangers to carry my problems and help me. I'm a 19 year old guy with no hope. I have spent most of my life lying to friends and family. I have done everything from deny my sexuality to photoshopping my college transcripts so my dad didn't know I failed every class. I am currently out of school, and working at a shitty grocery store where my manager constantly harasses me. I am in love with a guy that doesn't reciprocate the same affection. I try so hard to be better, I have tried medication but I still feel that suicide is my best option. I am scared.
