My whole life is messed upMy family is narcissist and only care about them self or the other narcs. They tell me I was unplanned all the time. I was abused physically, emotionally, and somewhat sexually at a young age. All my "best friends" have fucked me over in the end. Every time I fall for someone it ends not in my favor. I literally have no one. People pretend they care but really they don't. I don't even know why I'm writing this? I guess to get it out there.  I don't see a point of living any longer. Nothing gets better ever.
