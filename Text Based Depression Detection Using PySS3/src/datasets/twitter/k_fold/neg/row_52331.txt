I honestly don't know why I'm still hereMy worth is measurable by less than a spoonful. Sure, I may have a degree, with certain certifications, and a job, but at the end of the day when you also have ptsd and bipolar 2 and can't function worth a shit at work it's a different story. I have pushed myself to get where I am to make up for so many mistakes, and not think about things that have happened, but I can never recover from it. Medications and therapy don't work. I don't do anything right and it's more than obvious my boss wants me gone. It doesn't feel like there is really a future because who in the hell wants me? I could be a teacher or a district attorney to better the world, but I cant even keep a single friend. I'm just unwanted.
