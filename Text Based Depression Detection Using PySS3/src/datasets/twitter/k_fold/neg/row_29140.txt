I want to die and I don't know how to copeI don't know who to speak to. 

The person closest to me hurt me badly today. The criticisms are valid but I just wish that the delivery is more respectful (he told me that I'm fucking lousy at the work that I've done for him). I feel worthless and unappreciated and I know that it is a passing phase and that he didn't mean it that way. I want to get better. I know that I'm brilliant in some other parts and he acknowledges it too. I am usually extremely self assured and self aware. 

I just don't know how to get out of this spiral right now. 

I need a quick advice on how to shift my mindset so that I don't keep thinking of giving up and dying tonight.
