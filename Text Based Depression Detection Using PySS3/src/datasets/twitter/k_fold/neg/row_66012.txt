I need help, please.My friend is talking about killing herself, and I don't know what to tell her. It's all over one guy who lied to her and just wants her for sex. She says she loves him, and she can't see the point in living if the one she wants the most doesn't ever care if she's there. I've told her it will get better that one day she'll wake up and he won't matter anymore, but she says she doesn't want that to happen, that she might not be here to see the day when she's finally over him. She also thinks all she does is hurt people, that she ends up hurting all of her friends, but I've told her time and time again that she's worth it, that her friends still love her, and still want to be her friend. She's also said that she could be easily replaced. I don't know what to tell her anymore. I really don't want her to hurt herself over a selfish little boy. Please Reddit, is there anything I could do?
