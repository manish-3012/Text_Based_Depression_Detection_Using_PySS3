I really need someone to talk toI am a 30 year old man, a hard worker and alone. I am still a virgin, I have an embarrasing fettish that has ruined my life, including the loss of very close friendships who I loved, I dont know where to go from here. I feel like there is nothing more to offer anyone. I want a family, but it seems impossible to bring up my kinks to prospective mates, let alone trying to control what I feel sometimes. sometimes I load my pistol and play with it thinking who would even care it I took the magic pill my life has been nothing but a joke and honnestly I am glad my father is not around to see what kind of 'man' I am.
