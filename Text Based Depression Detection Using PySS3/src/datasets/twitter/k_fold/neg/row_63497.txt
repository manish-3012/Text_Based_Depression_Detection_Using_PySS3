I canâ€™t forgive myselfIâ€™m going to be straight forward. I did a disgusting thing. Im 16 and I dated the 13 year old. I didnâ€™t know she was 13 as it was an online relationship she concealed her age from me. I donâ€™t think she meant to lie to me though, I think she was just uncomfortable with sharing her age. She always seemed that way, which is why I never asked her. I donâ€™t want to die. I just donâ€™t think I deserve to live anymore. I donâ€™t deserve friendship or love. I think Iâ€™ve ruined my life. 

What can I even do?

I used to think life was alright. But I lost all my friends. Iâ€™m always alone. Why. Why does this world even exist. Everything is pain . I just canâ€™t live with myself. Knowing I may have caused someone trauma like that.
