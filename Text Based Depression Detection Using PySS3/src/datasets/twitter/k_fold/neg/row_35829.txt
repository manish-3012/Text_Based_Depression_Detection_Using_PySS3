I am a monster and I should probably get this over and done with.I'm 14. Everyone hates me. I'm beginning to lose my friends because they're slowly beginning to realise that I used to be a cutter. My parents hate me and I give them nothing but grief and my dad said he's waiting until the day I die. I know he was angry and didn't mean it but that's so true. 

My sister thinks I'll kill my grandma or her even though I have no intention of doing so but I'm angry and she thinks I'll snap. She's scared of me and she'd be more mentally stable if I just ended it. The only reason I'm alive now is because I thought she'd be fucked up if I died, but I've already fucked her up enough.

I know that I'm never going to be happy again, and I've completed everything I want to complete in my life and I'm ready to go. I know the world will be better off without me, and nobody's gonna love me because I'm a fat, pathetic, ugly, useless bitch who can't do anything right and I think it's just the right time for me to leave before I make things worse.
