Wish I could dieThereâ€™s never a moment that I donâ€™t feel like I want to die, yet Iâ€™m just too much of a fucking pussy to do it. I wish I could just go to bed and then not wake up so I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with all of the weird ass things my brain tries to think of to stop me doing it. 

I donâ€™t know why I care about people, they all want me to disappear, yet just like everyone else theyâ€™d think of me as a selfish brat for having the entitlement to kill myself, theyâ€™re all just too scared to say it.
