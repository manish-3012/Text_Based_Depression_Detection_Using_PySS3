I know that people care about meBut everyday I dream of dying. All the different ways, the places, how it would feel. 
I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it because I feel like Iâ€™m just so repetitive, and no one is going to tell me to shut up and that Iâ€™m being annoying.
Well, actually my husband did once. He told me to either kill myself or stop talking about it. 
I was angry with him, but heâ€™s right. I should either do it or stop talking about it. 
Iâ€™m sitting on the floor alone at work. Half crying and knowing that I have no one to talk to.
Even if I had someone, I have nothing to say, really. Iâ€™m just so so tired of feeling like this. 
I should just do it. I think jumping in a frozen river or lake is the way to do it. 
I donâ€™t want to jump from a building or hang myself. Iâ€™ve tried pills, it didnâ€™t work. And  I have no idea how to get a gun. 
I also need a stranger to find me. I canâ€™t do it at home, my dogs would see me die. I could never do that to them. 
At work seems like an acceptable place as well. No one here cares about me. 
This is so embarrassing. Just being unhappy for no reason. I think my therapist is throwing her hands up too. 
I think people are all excited to help initially, but the reality sets in at some point that they canâ€™t do anything, so they stop trying.  They still feel obligated to act like they care, because if I ever actually did it, they want to feel like they did everything they could.  I get that. 
Itâ€™s just so hard to want to talk to someone, but also to not want to at all. 
I want to do a million different things right now, but all I can do is feel stuck to the floor.
