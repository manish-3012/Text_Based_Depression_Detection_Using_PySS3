My sister's heart was sickMonday afternoon my sister (25) was found dead on her bed. She committed suicide. She put herself to sleep. 

She was very good looking, friendly, sociable and she was about to graduate from med school back home. She was already working in a clinic, she already was making money and had lots of job offers. 

She came to visit me last week. After I told her I was so sad about my sons autism diagnosis she decided to come and visit me and my babies. It had been about 5 years since I saw her last. 

She came here, visited, went shopping and had lots of fun. She was young and beautiful, she had everything she wanted. I don't get it. 

Little did I know, she was here to meet her little nephew and niece and say goodbye. She came here to say goodbye and I had no idea.

Her heart was sick and I didn't see it. I was too involved in my own world and worries to really see her. I thought my sons autism was the worst. How stupid I am. I didn't realize, I didn't notice her heart was sick. 

I saw her last week, just last week. Today she's gone, and forever. 

I wish I had hugged her more. You never know when the last time will be.

What the hell do I do now? I'm driving myself crazy, I'm in pain thinking how much she hated being alone and she died alone. What was she thinking? What made her do it? Was she in peace? Was it because we weren't there enough? I can't breathe, my chest hurts.

I just saw her last week. If I had known. It saddens me to think she felt alone and that's how she left.  

How am I going to move on? I can't think.
