Might do it tonight I donâ€™t know what to doItâ€™s a complicated story but my boyfriend and I are in a weird place for the past couple hours and heâ€™s been helping me through my shit but I keep fucking up no matter how much heâ€™s trying to reassure me and now heâ€™s just frustrated and wonâ€™t talk to me and doesnâ€™t want anything to do with me right now it seems like, just closing the door to go to bed like Iâ€™m not right there, so basically I canâ€™t go in the bedroom to sleep so Iâ€™m just alone and I have severe depression and ptsd and Iâ€™m in a really tough place in life but Iâ€™m in therapy and on medications. Iâ€™m still suicidal, for weeks Iâ€™ve been writing my suicide thoughts and notes to my mom, idk how she will get it but Iâ€™m having a full blown panic attack right now and I canâ€™t see any option besides taking all my pills, I donâ€™t know what to do, I hate doing this to the people I love but the mental illness is winning. I think I will do it tonight
