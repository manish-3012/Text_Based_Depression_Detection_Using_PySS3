Itâ€™s getting closer to my conciousnessâ€™s disappearanceI have endless reasons to live and not live but my life is continuesly getting more and more painful overtime, I fear I will not make it past the next few months, but Iâ€™m doing my best. Iâ€™ve been avoiding substances for so long, and I know it will just make my hallucinations worse and may push me over edge of distressing hallucinations with paranoia to full blown paranoid schizophrenia. My schizophrenic episodes seem to be happening at the same time as my ptsd oftentimes. Itâ€™s so difficult to push through this pain and believe I will be able to in the long run. I hope I find a way to continue staying alive without offing myself. Itâ€™s just really hard to fight these with my worsening sadness, and I fear the worst???? I donâ€™t really know what the worst is living or ending my conciousness, but hopefully I remain alive. Update will happen as long as Iâ€™m living, however I do not have a system set in place for after death.
