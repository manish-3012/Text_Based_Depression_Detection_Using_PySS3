Want to kill myself in a week and a halfI want to kill myself now, but I waited too long and don't want to mess up a friend's wedding I'm going to next week. After the wedding there should be nothing stopping me. Hopefully I don't chicken out. I just want the pain to end and there is nothing that can help it other than death. Even if the pain somehow stopped then I still won't ever be content with my life, so what's the point? I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess it's kind of nice to be able to relate to people who might feel the same way.
