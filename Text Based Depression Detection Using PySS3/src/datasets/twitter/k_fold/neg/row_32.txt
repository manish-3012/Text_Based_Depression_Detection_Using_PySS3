Since my aunt's suicide 3 weeks before Christmas, I drink, take painkillers or both. I can't stop thinking I'll kill myself too.I see so much of myself in her it hurts. She wasn't even twice my age. She hung herself with a doglead. Broke a hundred hearts. I'm absolutely not afraid of death. Only the out coming for the people who love me. I come from a family of functioning alcoholics but I can't stop drinking. I drink a lot on my own. I self harmed after a rape I never told anyone about. I've not for a few years now, almost 7.
