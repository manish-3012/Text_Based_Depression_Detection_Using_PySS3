A girl I know committed suicide and now I'm having thoughts of doing the sameWe didn't know each other well, but it was still enough to cause some sadness over her passing. Around the same time, my stress and anxiety levels have been sky-high, which has caused a bout of depression. I keep having thoughts of suicide that I can't shake. Though I "know better," I can't help but think things would be better for everyone if I really did just disappear.
