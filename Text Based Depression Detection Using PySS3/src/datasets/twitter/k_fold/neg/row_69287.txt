I want to check myself into the hospital but I can't coz i'm in the middle of the semesterI keep having these thoughts of hurting myself in some way and i have absolutely no one, i can not express this enough, aboslutely no one to talk to. i want toget checked in but i can't afford to drop out of school and even if i do get better by going to the hospital now, it's gonna set me back more. I'm supposed to transfer to a 4 year uni adn that's really freaking me out. if i don't get in i'll have no where to go, i won't be able to live. i feel so alone,
