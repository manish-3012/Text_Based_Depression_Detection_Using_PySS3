I'm a failure, but I can't end it...Hello guys, I just signed up here on Reddit just for this.

I'm attending a vocational school and last year, I was one of the best students.

This year, a lot of bad things happened.

Before school startes this year, my parents finally told me the truth about their divorce after 7 years of telling me bullshit. And the truth is even more terrible than I thought it would be.

Then, school started and at first, everything was going quite well.

But then, a very close friend of mine (he's like a big brother to me and I often call him 'big brother' too) had a rough time, but he never told me why. He said he didn't know himself.

He pulled me down with him, I was worried about him so much that I was always afraid that he might do something bad (which is bullshit, because he promised he would never do something bad.)

It wasn't long until I fell mentally ill and I started going to therapy.

My friend got back up but I didn't, and because I wasn't able to go to school for maybe 2 weeks, I started getting bad marks.

The worse my marks got the worse my mental condition got, so I ended up not going to school for 2 months.

Now the school year is almost over and I've failed almost all subjects.

I feel like I've failed and ruined my life, and it doesn't help that my 'brother" doesn't even know how bad I feel, but I can't tell him. I don't wanna ruin his life and make him sad...

I already feel like I died a thousand times, why can't I die for real?

I really want to end it. I just want the pain to stop.

But I can't do it, for some reason...

The only thing that keeps me here is my 'big brother', because he's also my best friend and I don't wanna ruin his life...

But...What should I do now? 

My therapy is going nowhere, pills just make everything worse, my friend isn't happy no matter what I do and I just can't take the easy way out...

I really don't know anymore...
