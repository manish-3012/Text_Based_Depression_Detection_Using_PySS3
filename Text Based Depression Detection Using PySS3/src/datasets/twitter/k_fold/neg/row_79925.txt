I'm ready to die again. A couple of months ago I checked into a hospital after I put a gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. The gun didn't go off because the firing pin jammed. I spent the last couple of months talking to these so called specialists and listening to them tell me how "special" I am. I get out and come on and the key won't work. I kick the door in and all my stuff is gone. I contacted my landlord and he tossed all of it because I was gone. All I wanted after this trip was the pictures of my dead Father. It was all I had left of him and now I have nothing. Checking myself into the hospital made my life considerable worse. I am going to kill myself out of spite of the hospital system. No one told me how long I was going to be there and no one asked me if there was anything of any important I wanted to keep. Since I can't see my Father's face anymore I am going to kill myself. I just don't want to live in a world that would take so much from me without anything in return. I know life isn't fair but this is too much for me to deal with. I hate this world and everyone in it.
