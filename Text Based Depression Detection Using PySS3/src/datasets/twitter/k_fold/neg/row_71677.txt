My story...This is hopefully a message of hope... My mantra was always "It's a disease that I can be cured." It saved my life.

Going through school was tough for me, I was different to everyone else. I just didn't understand the social rules... say this, don't say that, if you do that you're a loser etc. Naturally I was a target, and it. went. Deep.

At the time my dad was in the pitts too, he had chronic pain and at one point described it like "having my leg sawed off with a rusty blade." Naturally he wanted to neck himself too. My sister was struggling with school and my mum was struggling to hold the family together.

I went to school in a tall office building and I always wondered about jumping out one of the window. I didn't want to die though, but I wished fervently that I was never alive.

Luckily I was an intelligent individual. At the back of my mind, I always knew it was a disease, much like epilepsy, Alzheimers or any other neurological abnormality was a disease. Luckily I always knew in the back of my head that it was curable. I split myself from the environment that was so evil to me, and I slowly improved. I later went back to school, and at one point I was scared of having a relapse, but I pulled through. I started realising I was put in situations that would have previously had me going to a corner, crying and wanting to be dead, and pwning the situation.

I am much stronger now. Much like working your muscles makes you physically strong, going through mental ordeals makes you mentally strong too. Although I wish i never went through that, I'm thankful for what it has made me today.

Good luck and God/Allah/Buddha/FSM/Shiva speed.
