My Gf is contemplating suicide. I don't know what to do.I've been with this girl for almost 5 months. She is the sweetest, kindest most considerate person I've ever met. Her family is a mess. Her parents divorced, father is an inconsiderate asshole. Mother is a narcissistic bitch. The mother forces her to do everything for her, including taking care of her adopted sister at the age of 10 like a baby. Her father kicked her out not too long ago and she hated being there because he has his new family and she doesn't feel like she is wanted or belongs at his place. She constantly (daily) fights with her parents. I found out, just last week that she cries herself to sleep 'most nights' which I think means every night. I found out a couple days ago that she has nightmares and she doesn't want to sleep because of it. Along with this she sleeps very little, wakes up several times a night. She's hinted at suicide before, when we met, she told me she has cut herself and thought about suicide to see if her parents would even care, they never noticed the cuts and if they did, they never mentioned it. In the past couple texts thats she's sent me, she tells me she wants to give up, she has given up. I've tried to give all my support but I'm not professional and she needs help. I was on the phone with her the other night and she said she wanted help, but her family can't afford it. Parents are freelance, dad seems to have money but with their relationship he probably isn't willing to spend it. How can I help this girl? She feels guilty receiving any help, she went to a psychiatrist before, but she says that its just one more thing her parents can use to guilt trip her. I'm so fucking worried. I don't know what to do please help me. I don't know how much longer she can take this. I forgot to mention, we are living in Beijing as expats, which is unfamiliar to most.
