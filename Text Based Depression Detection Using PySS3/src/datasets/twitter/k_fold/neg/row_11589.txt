Just wondering if anyone else feels like thisI've been on-and-off passively suicidal for a few years (or much longer if thinking about what death feels like as a young child counts) now and I don't think if this is a thing that other people feel. Let me explain... Sometimes I will be sitting, perfectly calm, doing homework or walking to class, when suddenly I'll think: "I don't think I would ever actually jump in front of a car or a train, but if one did hit me, it's whatever." It's usually worse if I'm actually in a negative mood, and much much worse if an extremely negative event happens in my life (breakup, friend fight, failing tests, etc.) because those usually seem to kickoff my deepest depressive episodes. Is there a term for this?
