I CARE ABOUT YOUI actually really fucking give a fuck about every single person on this sub, I really do.
I read through these posts and just cry.
I hate that so many people feel like this and I wish I could help you all.

No one deserves to get to the point of wanting to take their own life and I really hope that you all find yourselves and live out a happy life with a loving family, as many pets as you want and doing whatever it is that makes you happy.

Please keep trying
