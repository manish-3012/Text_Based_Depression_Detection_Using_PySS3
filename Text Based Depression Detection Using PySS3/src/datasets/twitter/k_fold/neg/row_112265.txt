Just lost my dream job. Took a bunch of pills. Will these kill me hopefully?I just lost my dream job and am in debt beyond anything imaginable and I'm only 20.

I took:
2mg of Xanax
1.5mg of Klonopin
3x 5-325 Percocet (oxy)

Read that these will lead to respiratory arrest so hopefully I die but can anybody confirm this in fact is a deathly cocktail of pills?
