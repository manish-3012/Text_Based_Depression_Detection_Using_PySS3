Tired of climbing mount motherfucker all by myselfAnyone who was at Pendelton will know the title of my post.

I'm tired, and have to get off this hill.  There are no buddies with me this time, no camaraderie, no nothing.  I can't keep going.

I just fucked up what was very likely my last chance at  happiness.  I'm old and getting older every day.  There's no light at the end of my tunnel, so why wait for old age or failing health to take me.

I keep telling myself to at least hang on another 2 1/2 years until my daughter is 18 and can legally inherit all my stuff, then I can set my pack down and get off this fucking hill.  But I don't think I can go that long.  Things will NEVER get better for me.  I fuck up EVERYTHING because I can't shut off my brain.  I say stupid shit, reveal stupid feelings, and scare and/or push people away.  A life of perpetual loneliness isn't worth living.
