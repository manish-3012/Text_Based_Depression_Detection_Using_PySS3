the range in suicidal thoughts?This morning i cried because i just wanted to be dead or disappear. life isnâ€™t terrible towards me but i feel like a soda can at the bottom of a trash bin. i feel useless and unworthy of life and i want a gun to the side of my head. i hate everything i need to do to stay alive. yet a couple minutes later i still hated life but didnâ€™t imagine multiple ways of killing myself. so question: 

Does anyone find their suicidal tendencies to be heightened and lowered at random points of the day?
