Feel like dying at 3 amI don't know.

This is just venting, I guess. This week has been Very Bad. As evidenced by the fact that I woke up at 3 am today, and 4 am yesterday. I'm hungry and shaky and weak, but I have no interest in any food heavier than fruit and haven't for a while. Ha, at least I don't have binging problems anymore.

I tell my psych I'm there because "I guess I'll continue living," but I haven't really chosen life. Everyday when I wake up and I feel bad there's that thought in the back of my brain that goes "well, I can always kill myself." And that's a relief.

I feel like dying at 3 am. I don't want to try anymore. I'm so tired. I know I'm not going to do anything. I don't know if I could through all the guilt. There's just not much I can talk about or think about right now that isn't the enveloping grief I've felt constantly for the past two years, and the numbness and apathy I felt for two/three years before that, and then the MD episode(s) before that. And then I'm ten years old again and I don't think I was happy even then. I can't even remember. Maybe I was happy, although I seem to remember having no friends and this same feeling in my chest at recess watching the other kids play.

My friend has a term for this. "Suicidal by design." 

I feel crazy. I'm taking a year off school. I have fantasies about a good future, but even if now's not the time, I know I'll never make it to the end of my natural lifespan. Someday playing Sims all day is not going to be nearly enough distraction. Even if it gets better it's going to hurt this much again, that much is inevitable. 

I can't take any more of this.
