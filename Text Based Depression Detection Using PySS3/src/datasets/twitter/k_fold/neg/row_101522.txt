I'm on a downward spiral.I was diagnosed with GAD 13 months ago. I refused to take medication because I didnt want to be apathetic to be happy. Unfortunately I've reached a point in my life, where I can see myself veering uncontrollably off course. I also often find myself completely zoned out, no matter what the situation. I fall asleep crying almost every night and I've just been completely devoured by suicidal thoughts. It's so painful and every night feels like the night I'm going to do it. I'm not lonely or in need of friends, I have those, I'm just so sad and filled with a callous disregard for myself. I get so sad watching people squabble over petty things, and then sad with myself when I become self aware of how egotistical I am, how I think I'm above these issue. I'm just lost and I feel like tonight's the night for real.
