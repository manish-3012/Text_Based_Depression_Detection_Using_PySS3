Ahh, help!Hey guys,

This is my first time posting on this subreddit. I've been struggling with depression for quite some time now but only recently has it started getting very debilitating. While I wait for a psychiatrist, I am wondering if anyone can suggest good therapy in and around Oshawa, Ontario. It's very hard feeling alone. 

Thanks!
