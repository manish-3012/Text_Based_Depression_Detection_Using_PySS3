911 told me I wasnâ€™t importantI was having pretty intense suicidal thoughts, and it wasnâ€™t until after I took all the pills that I realized Iâ€™m not done with this world yet. I called 911, and they told me they had better things to do than come help me. I had to take matters into my own hands. Because of shitty 911 operators, I could be dead right now. This is not okay.
