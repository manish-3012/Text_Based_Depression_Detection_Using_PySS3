Feel like a waste of lifeEverything feels so meaningless. Friends are ingenuine, only want me around as an emotional soundboard or helping hand. Cut everyone off. I hate school because I am so unmotivated and keep pushing things off until I half-ass everything. I'm wasting my life away. I just got fired from my job. Even going to that everyday felt so difficult. I try to keep bouncing back, but I just keep coming back to the idea that life is pointless. Even if I finish school, it doesn't guarantee a fucking job. And even if I did get a job, what if it's the same as always...bad management, being overworked, feeling left out. And having to work just to survive for a few years on earth, then just to die without any meaningful connections or anything I'm proud of or anything to believe in for that matter. It's all scary. I just want it all to end already. Please. But I'm too scared of even attempting it.
