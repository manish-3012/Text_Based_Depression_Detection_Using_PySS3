Iâ€™m giving myself until Friday to live. If my ex girlfriend doesnâ€™t make it to our meeting that day Iâ€™m ending itI have BPD and I push the people I love the most away. I hate doing this shit. She said that she was going to go but I asked her to resign and I instantly regret saying that. I lover her. I want her to go. I want her to come back but I fucked up. I just donâ€™t want to live with BPD anymore itâ€™s so fucking exhausting I just want to end it all
