Nobody would knowI literally have no friends, fucking zero anymore. My ocd and anxiety has been the most severe itâ€™s ever been, itâ€™s like it rules my life almost and now Iâ€™m starting to get depressed. I know for a fact if I did kill myself, nobody would know. I know this because I donâ€™t remember the last time someone reached out to me or even messaged me unless they want weed. I just know the landlord would walk in and not even see a rotting corpse.. but a fucking skeleton because literally nobody cares, nobody knows, all because I have no friends. I canâ€™t keep living like this, I try so hard to make friends, but with new people they might hangout with me once and itâ€™s a one and done thing. Kind of wish my life was a one and done thing, where I have one day and just go to sleep never to return to this reality.
