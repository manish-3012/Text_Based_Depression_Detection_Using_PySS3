:(There has never been in a time in my life where I can't remember actually wanting to live. I've had a pretty rough life and have been through a lot. There doesn't go a day where I don't want to die. The thought of just not existing anymore sounds so pleasant to me. I just want to get away so badly. This year especially has been pretty bad. I also just turned 18 and I am more lost than ever. I graduated high school a semester early and I have no clue what I want to do now. I never thought I'd still be alive so I never planned this far ahead. I'm depressed and lost and lonely and I just want it to end. I just want everything to stop. I can't handle anything and I just feel so alone. My mom knows about my depression and even suffers from it herself but she refuses to acknowledge it or let me talk about it. She thinks that she's the only person in the world who has it rough and tells me Im just overreacting. I feel like I have no one and I can't handle it anymore. I just want to feel important and loved. I want to feel valid. I want someone to recognize all the shit I have been through because my mom makes me feel like none of it was that serious. I'm just so tired. I wish I would've just killed myself in middle school when I had the chance because by now everyone would have been over it. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because Im too scared if what other people will think.
