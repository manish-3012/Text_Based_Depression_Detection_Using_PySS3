[Update] I know exactly what happened nowI know exactly what happened now. I'm going to express a view that may not be favorable. The guy, days after he raped me, just looked at me as if I did the worst possible thing ever and said, "You think people are good? You think being good and optimistic will get you far?!!" He'd always get mad at me for "trying too hard" or "aiming too high"

I won't forget it. It makes sense now how he can target me and rape me and then criticize me for my positivity and then tell me to kill myself because I told him a high rate of rape victims kills themselves. Whatever it is he believes, he somehow believed the world is an unfair place and people fuck over people all the time. He talked about race a lot about how things were different for him and his "brothers". That he has to try harder. Race was a huge thing for him.

I believe he believed he was participating in the ways of the world: fucking people over to get what you want then ditch them and tell them how stupid they are to believe in the goodness of humanity.

All these things sound horrible and you might wonder why I was with him at all. He was the type to pretend to be this sweet innocent guy while covertly sliding in insults and dangerous situations only to say he didn't mean it or laugh it saying I was overreacting. And then he raped me and began the massive verbal assaulting spree

Can someone explain this to me? Do you think it was a racist act against me? Sociopath? Psychopath? Narc?
