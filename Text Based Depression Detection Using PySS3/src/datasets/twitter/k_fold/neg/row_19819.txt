I don't want to die but I can't remember a day without suicidal thoughts.I honestly could not tell you the last time a day went by with out me thinking about suicide, it's a thought that comes so naturally but I have no intentions of acting on it. 

I went to the doctors a little while ago after a break-up for some help and was prescribed anti-depressants. I know, I probably have to go back on them. They did help to some degree and I shouldn't have stopped taking them.

Other than speaking to a doctor I've not told anyone else, my current GF knows that I have been on anti-depressants but I think I should talk a bit more in depth to her about the thoughts, although I just don't want to put pressure on her or make her feel like she needs to do anything different.

I've never done a post like this before, in fact I've never done a post at all on reddit. I don't expect answers or anything but it's nice just to write down how I'm feeling.
