Not satisfied with my life. I calm, swift end sounds best to me. Please do not try to talk me out of it, I want listen. Just help me move on. So my questions for you, and I want honest answers. How do I do it, so that it doesnâ€™t hurt my friends or family. Below are my ideas.I have about 60mg of Etizolam. I have alcohol. How can I do this painlessly, as if it were an accident, so it doesnâ€™t hurt my love ones.

I was thinking about taking the whole thing, drinking a fifth of alcohol, queuing up some nextflix, and never waking up. Peaceful ending.

What my family will see it â€œthis kid just did some drugs and fucked upâ€. The scene wonâ€™t be terribly graphic like hanging or a gunshot.

Any recommendations? Will this work? Is there anything I should add to this lethal combination:

I welcome moral support, but I will not listen to people telling me not to. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. This is my choice, and I will have a problem with anyone attempting to rob me of my  right to death.

The best you can do for me, is point me in the right direction (feel free to speak in hypotheticals), you are ultimately not responsible for what I read and put into action.

Benzos and alcohol, I was thinking of even taking one of those anti nausea medications they give to cancer patients so I do not vomit.

Thanks you all for your help. I plan on writing a not to my close friends and family (even my ex) telling them it is not their fault. I want everyone to be happy.

But as we all know, life is about putting your own happiness above all else. 

So, hypothetically speaking, whatâ€™s a painless suicide method, with Etizolam and alcohol (maybe we can add another). I just want to make sure it works, and I donâ€™t harm myself.

I love you all
