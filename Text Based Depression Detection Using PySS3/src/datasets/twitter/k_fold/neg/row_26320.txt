I honestly just want to leave.
I've been wanting to die for a long time. Sometimes it's worse than others. I will explain so maybe someone can feel a connection.
I'm still a very young person. (17) and it's been a rough last 5 years. 
I will be honest, my home life is fine. I have a loving family that would do anything for me. I am fortunate and thankful for that.

But, over time I have developed social issues due to many reasons. One of which being my insecurity in appearance. I think i am actually hideous so over time I have yielded from talking to people, making me more and more anxious. I now hardly talk to anybody except for 2 friends who know nothing about who I really am.. i'm on a tangent. My apologies. 
Some may say, i'm too young. I haven't experienced life enough. Things like that. And tbh.. I completely agree, but I don't have the motivation to do so. My thoughts are almost constantly plagued with thoughts of self doubt and hate. I have nobody to reassure me that "Everything will get better". I heard that once. 4 years ago. 
Nothing ever got better.. Regardless, I have many specific things that attribute to how I got to this point. I have no one to blame except myself. 

I keep ranting.. I'm sorry.
