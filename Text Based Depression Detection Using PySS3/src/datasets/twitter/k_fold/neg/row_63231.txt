I canâ€™t take it anymoreThis is now my 3rd time writing this. Iâ€™m going to kill myself by the end of this year because I canâ€™t stand the pain anymore. Iâ€™ve been bullied, ridiculed, and rejected for most of my life and I just want it all to end. I cry myself to sleep and in my car and anytime Iâ€™m alone. Sometimes I fell like I deserve all the things that happened to me at school and home because Iâ€™m a piece of shit, and maybe thatâ€™s trie to some extent. Yes thatâ€™s it, Iâ€™m just garbage who deserves to die, Iâ€™m a nuisance to everyone I meet and I canâ€™t wait to take my life. Iâ€™m gonna be doing myself and the kids at school a favor.
