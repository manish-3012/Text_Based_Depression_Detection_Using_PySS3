Its getting worseIm doing this on my main account mostly because I just don't give a fuck anymore. My suicidal thoughts are getting worse. So much so they've gone beyond thoughts into planning. Ive been recently put on Seroquil for Bipolar Depression and Ativan for PTSD/Anxiety. I just feel like its gotten worse, not better. Ive experienced too much trauma to feel like a normal person. I just want out.
