Life sucksI moved to the US two years ago, adapting has been hard since I donâ€™t understand nor fit the culture. No friends and barely any colleagues. I spend 99% of my free time at home with my family, my mom has psychotic breakouts about every two days and makes my life hell, brother is the typical annoying middle schooler and my dad is always at work. Iâ€™ve been depressed for at least 2 years now.

Everything I do fails, everytime I start a personal project something goes wrong and messes everything up. Grades have been going down and Iâ€™m stressed to death because I need to apply to college. Iâ€™ve been obsessively buying stuff to try and feel the void I feel but it doesnâ€™t work.

Iâ€™ve never actually tried to kill myself, but itâ€™s always been in my mind. I remember as a 9 or 10 year old I always contemplated jumping out of my window when I couldnâ€™t stand my parents any longer. I feel like I never carried it out cause I was able to talk to friends and calm down. But that isnâ€™t an option anymore. The only two friends who I still talk to are slowly moving on and leaving me behind and I progressively feel like Iâ€™m drowning. Ending it all keeps growing on me as time goes by, but I feel like Iâ€™m too much of a coward to actually do it. Even as my life becomes worse and worse the small little hope that itâ€™ll get better is still there, although itâ€™s slowly disappearing.
