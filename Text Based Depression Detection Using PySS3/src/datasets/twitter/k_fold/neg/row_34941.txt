Anyone else kinda know exactly what they need to do to turn their life around but just 'cannot' bring themselves to do it?Theres always an excuse "im too tired" (which ive only recently realised is due to depression) or 'I need to work' so i wont have time. Or I tell myself I wont enjoy something so why even try. 

When I think of what effort I need to put into "getting better" i just feel like fuckit, I'd rather just kill myself than live in my current state of mind. I end up 'researching' methods every night before bed. Overdose or Hanging is not viable for me. Been searching for suicide bridges and the one in my country(ive considered the 7 hour drive it would take to get there) has only recently been barricaded with a 26ft iron fence the entire length of the bridge.

I know what I need to do to get better but im just soo...tired
