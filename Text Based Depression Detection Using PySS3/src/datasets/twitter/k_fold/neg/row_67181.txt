I give upLet me start by saying that I used to be really depressed in the past and even tried to OD, but after years of pretending to be a happy goofball I actually became happy. Fake it till you make it actually worked in a weird way because by acting like I didn't care about anything I started to not care. Then a couple months ago I started a new job. Things were ok, coworkers were fun to be with, but I never really hung out with any of them outside of work. So I got the brilliant idea of going bowling! Surprisingly a bunch of them seemed as excited as I was to hangout together outside of work. Last week we decided that tonight would work for everyone and that we should get together at my place before hand to pregame. Awesome! So yesterday I go out and spend 100$ on alcohol/snacks for everyone . Today I found out that half the people couldn't make it, and the others were going to a different coworkers. So now I'm left here feeling more alone and let down than I have in years. I feel like all of that work I put into trying to be happy alone disappeared in an instant. I know it doesn't sound like much, but when stuff like this happens I can't get the feeling of "no one wants to be around me" out. Like there's something I'm always doing wrong that no matter what I try I can't fix. I'm planning on picking up my gun from my parents to "try out the shooting range." Thanks for reading I guess and I'm sorry I couldn't pretend anymore.
