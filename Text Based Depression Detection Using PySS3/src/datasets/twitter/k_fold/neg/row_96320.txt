I don't know what to do anymoreI don't have any friends. My family treats me like shit, especially my mom who calls me names, hits me, and threatens to kill me. School stresses me out so much because I've always been so good at school but I've been getting bad grades because I'm so sleep deprived and I can't concentrate. I feel horrible about everything because I have so much but for some reason I can't appreciate it. I've been self harming since I was 9 and contemplating suicide since I was 7; I'm 16 now. I've attempted suicide twice but I was saved by strangers walking by and I hate how I'm still alive. Since I'm a teenager from a financially well off family I feel like I'm just being whiny or just being another angsty emo kid that's just going through some sort of phase. I'm not even technically diagnosed with depression or any mental illness. It would be better if I just died right now. Hardly anyone would notice. Most people wouldn't care and maybe even be happy that I'm gone. I don't know why I haven't already tried to kill myself again. Maybe I've been hoping that things will get better? I know it's stupid because nothing has gotten better so it probably never will.
