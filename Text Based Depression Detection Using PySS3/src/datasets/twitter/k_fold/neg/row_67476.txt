Seems patheticI know itâ€™ll seem pathetic to say this. Iâ€™ll get the â€œ your 27 and donâ€™t worry that some girl has dumped you more then likely. It was a long distance thing get the fuck over it.â€ I donâ€™t know why man it just hurts. Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll kill myself but I donâ€™t know how to really find the right page to make this kinda post. Never really used Reddit just lurked. 

Fuck though it hurts, Iâ€™ve tried messaging her for abit now and nothing. She looks at them and my snapchats and stuff but nothing more. Maybe I am pathetic for this but Iâ€™m here in my room at midnight crying and I just feel lost..... I donâ€™t have a lot of confidence in dating cause I never dated in high school and just never knew how to do the whole flirt thing. This hurts.... it all hurts and I want her to just talk to me and hear her voice and hear her say I love you to infinity and beyond like we always did...... Iâ€™m sorry for the long post
