Struggling to find help (UK) 

I've been depressed for almost a year and 2  months ago I tried to kill myself, my flatmates managed to stop me and  called an ambulance in time. About 4 months ago (during the summer) I  decide that I needed to get find help so I self-referred to a therapist  in my area. I completed an assessment but they said that they couldn't  take me on because I couldn't commit myself to a year's worth of  sessions.

I went back to my university  and contacted the Student Mental Health Service and told them that I was  feeling very close to suicide, they told me to contact my GP instead. I  talked to my GP but they wouldn't be able to see me for 3 weeks. After  trying and failing to kill myself, I went to my GP appointment. I was  referred back to the Student Mental Health Service (the same place that  told me that they wouldn't take me on) and again I was told they didnt  think I was suitable for their treatment. They told me to refer myself  to a local therapist. So here I am, now waiting another 4 weeks for an  assessment, but I will almost surely not make it until then.

It seems that everyone tells me to reach out for professional help, but I have and no one listens. Can anyone help?
