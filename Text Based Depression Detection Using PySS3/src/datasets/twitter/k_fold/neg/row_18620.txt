Donâ€™t do it. Please.TW

Iâ€™m not here to tell you that other people have it harder or guilt you for feeling the way you do. Iâ€™m here to tell you I love you. Iâ€™m here to tell you that you matter. Things do change and I hope you all realise this before itâ€™s too late.

6-8 months ago, I was at the worst of my depression. I lived alone and no one would visit me, despite my numerous attempts to avoid being alone. Many people had voiced their hatred for me, especially my ex boyfriend who had only recently broken up with me at the time and used my love to stroke his ego. Any time I tried getting better, things got worse tenfold. Every waking moment, I spent intoxicated but the people that knew didnâ€™t show concern. After a night of extremely heavy drinking and self-harming, I knew I was completely ready to do it. I called a friend of my ex boyfriendâ€™s who had remained kind to me throughout our breakup and kept it lighthearted by saying I was feeling â€œdownâ€ while I prepared myself.
We spoke about his aspirations, what he was doing with his life, how his girlfriend was. He had absolutely no idea that within 10 minutes, Iâ€™d be ending the call and my life.
I ended the call and went to hang myself, and after feeling guilt for making a friend think I was okay, I decided just before losing consciousness to save my own life. I was taken to a hospital and in the hours I sat in the waiting room for my evaluation, I realised that even though no one seemed to really care, I still felt love for people I could never express it to.
I feel love for you, regardless of what you do with your life, because I understand how it feels to be where you are. Iâ€™ve lost people I loved more than anyone to suicide, but they werenâ€™t selfish. They were hurting.
Donâ€™t ever be afraid to ask for help, and donâ€™t ever feel like a burden for seeking it. Getting better was the best decision Iâ€™d made, and I hope you can make the decision to get better too.
