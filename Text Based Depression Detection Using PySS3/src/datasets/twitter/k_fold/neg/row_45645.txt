I'm tired of being so sensitiveI'm so tired of little things putting me through so much pain. I'm tired of crying everyday over things that don't matter. I'm tired of annoying everyone around me with my feelings. I would rather kill myself then deal with this the rest of my life, but no matter how much I try, I don't know how to make it any better.
