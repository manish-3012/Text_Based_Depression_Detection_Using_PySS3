It only ever gets worse.I'm 19 and I've been developing various mental health problems since 12, including depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and depersonalization disorder. 

My parents were abusive when I was growing up and the only reason they don't continue to be is because I never talk to them. I was also in an abusive relationship as a teenager and now I run into my ex sometimes on campus. I'm afraid to go anywhere other than my classes and the library because I think I'll see her, and when I register for classes I get an intense fear that she'll be in one of them with me. 

It's impossible for me to interact socially (my social anxiety is basically at phobia status) and my only close friend lives two hours away from me. All of the people I tried to date either had no interest in me or were just hateful people who turned out to want to hurt me. I'm ugly and fat and nobody will ever want to touch me. I mean, there's a reason why the first four people I had sex with only had sex with me once and then never wanted to again. And there's a reason the only people who have sex with me now are friends who pity me. I'm disgusting and I drive people away. And that's all it's ever going to be. People are cruel to me because it's fun and I don't fight back. Nobody wants me here.

I get sent into crying fits that spiral down into me wanting to cut myself and kill myself every night over the stupidest things. Last night it was because I spilled food on myself by accident. I feel so completely beyond help with how depressed I am. I'm in therapy and on meds, but neither of them are helping at all. In fact, therapy just seems to make it worse. I feel like I have to die. I don't have any other options. I can't keep living like this.
