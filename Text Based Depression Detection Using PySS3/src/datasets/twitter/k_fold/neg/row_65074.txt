Can't eat, drink, sleep, brush my hair. Nothing, except throw up and cry.Im really tired of this. My body has completely given up on me and I want to go. My parents keep guilt tripping me and calling me selfish, even though they see me withering away both mentally and physically. I'm losing so much weight, I went from a size 16 to a size 8 in a couple months. I've been depressed since I was 14 and needed a push. Sunday was that push for me and now I feel I'm ready to go. I just don't know how to do it. I don't want to be in pain anymore, but I also don't want to go out a painful way. How do you guys deal with this is you are experiencing the same things as I am?
