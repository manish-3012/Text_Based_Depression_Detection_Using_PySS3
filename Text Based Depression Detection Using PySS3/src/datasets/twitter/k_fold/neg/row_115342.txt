I'll listen, if you'll talkI have a couple of hours today; anything you want to talk about. I'll listen, and you can tell me, and it might help, or not, we'll see.

PM me if you want.

PS: I'm not an expert. I'm not someone 'qualified' to help you or even a psychologist/psychiatrist. I'm just some person on the internet who'll give you some of their time if you think it'll make a difference - no matter how small the difference might be. Don't hesitate to PM me if you want.
