Everything can feel so good but again suddenly everything is shit...Atm I'm so triggered about some things that sorry if this doesnt make any sense. 

So in kindergarten in RiihimÃ¤ki (city in middle of a countryside and yeah I'm from Finland) already I was bullied really hard. I was punched there, I lost some of my teeths, overall people really didn't care about me and it was a shit time. I remember that luckily I had like 1 good friend there but still I remember more the bad things about that place. 

We moved then to Espoo, 2nd biggest city in Finland. I started my 1st grade there. My life started to go better there and I actually got friends from elementary school. Some of which are still my best friends but still I have bad memories even from there. I did some stupid or embarassing things for which people laughed to me. Well these things are normal for little kids i guess. But somehow these thing stayed on my head and I still haven't forgot most of these things

Went to junior high school. I was shy already but became more shy because things from elementary school stayed in my head and I became careful about everything what I said as I met new people except for a couple. Because of my shyness, I became an easy target for couple people in my class to tease me but not like in a way of bullying. But because they seemed to do this to me always it started to feel shit to get into school + with me doing again some stupid things in school or in my floorball team, people laughed at me. So this continued the whole junior high school from 7th till 9th grade. And 9th grade was the one where I first started thinking about suicide. Everything felt shit at some days. Luckily one of my best friends (legend in my eyes) got into same class as me and thanks to him I managed to survive it.

So now I'm in second year of my high school. I just turned 18 years old on March and the feelings are much worse now. As Finlands economy isnt the greatest atm it means that its not easy to get a job here and its a must to have an education to even have a chance of good job. To get a university you want and to have a chance for education, I somewhat need to decide what I want to become and need to choose my subjects already so that I can then apply for the university I want. Idk what I want to do in the future. I havent found anything really interesting. I have pressure to do well in high school to have any chance to get to university. My parents are pressuring me more and more to get a job but I dont find anything interesting to do. I've became more and more shy and meeting new people and getting friends is so tough for me now. Even floorball which i liked a lot is starting to feel shit. Nowadays there are those little moments where I feel so happy and everything goes well but then again I have shit moments which last about 100 times more than the happy moments.

I've been thinking about suicide for 3,5 years now but it wasnt serious thinking until last year when I really wanted to kill myself a lot of times but I couldnt. It felt like nobody cared about me. Friends were also like doing some stuff i didnt like about at all so i got distanced to them. Parents are more shouting to me than loving me or thats how it feels like. Then some point after first seriously thinking about suicide, I found thid subreddit and looking at many posts i felt same things but I also saw some comments and thats when I realised that if I would kill myself, my parents would be crying and feeling guilt about everything.

I hate this world or this society where I am. Only seemingly strong people even though they dont have the good personality get friends and girls. Another way seems to be in parties where people drink until they're heavily drunk. My friends wonder why I don't join them but basic finnish way is that when you drink, you drink until youre drunk. Fuck that. I loathe drinking alcohol that much that you become drunk. Every time at some point during classes some of my friends just start to talk about how they will go out and drink next weekend and shit like that. There are many more reasons why I hate this world but its almost 2am here and I'm too tired to think about anything now

I really really have wanted to kill myself for a long time now but I can't because of how my parents would react to my suicide if I would do that... Theyre the only reason why I can't.

I guess thank you if you've read my rant.
