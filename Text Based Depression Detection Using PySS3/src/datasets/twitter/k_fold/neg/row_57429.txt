AloneOut of the three people that are the reason I havenâ€™t killed myself, one has just had to see their mum in an induced coma. So sheâ€™s way too stressed rn for me to burden even more.
Another one was involved in a car accident a few years ago, one that killed her little sister. She has managed to get past this for the most part, but her advice is always to just look on the bright side of things and find a positive. I have no bright side Raveena, there are no positives left. I can never properly explain this in person, but Iâ€™m not capable of simply â€˜forcing myself to be happyâ€™.
Lucy is a lot like Raveena in many ways, and this positivity of hers is so beautiful, but it only highlights just how awful I feel, nothing makes you feel more like crying than seeing others laugh and smile while you wish you were dead. Lucy I know that you canâ€™t fix me, but just talking to you and feeling like I am actually close to somebody rly is one the only things keeping me going.

You three just seem to be getting so far from me, I havenâ€™t known you for long at all, but youâ€™re the best things and closest people in my life and I couldnâ€™t care about you more and I canâ€™t lose you.
You are the reason Iâ€™m not dead yet, but I just canâ€™t keep going any longer. I just canâ€™t do this anymore. The hardest part in finally killing myself is knowing what it may do to you.
If one of these posts does become a kind of suicide note, then know everything that I write is from when Iâ€™m at my most emotionally broken and I say a lot and assume a lot about peoples motives that after a day I know to be wrong. But If you have ever been a positive influence in my life, even if I donâ€™t mention you, you will be someone I think about in the moments before I die and I am grateful for everything and sorry Iâ€™m such a disappointment.
