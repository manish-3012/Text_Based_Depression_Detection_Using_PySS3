Why am I still alive?I feel like everyone just wants me to die, have a funeral, and rest peacefully. My high school dean of students, decided to make a death threat to me and my assistant principal supported him by saying he has every right to say that. Teachers would constantly laugh at me, telling me nobody cares. My guidance counselor refused to help me and just made fun of me and told me to solve me issues myself. I have since graduated, but I have extreme ptsd. I would like to buy pills and take them until I die, and then the world will be so happy with me, as I died. Suicide hotlines are no help, they just tell me to go out with people who are way older than me. I think I would be happy stabbing myself to death. I just want someone to help me to the best of their ability and not last two days and give up on me.
