Yo....Don't really know if this sub will help or not....


Just feeling pretty shit. Diagnosed with BPD when I was 12.
Recently lost my mum, was in charge of her funeral. Been kicked out of my dads, living with my younger sister.
Had an argument with her a couple of hours ago, been feeling super shit and it's just getting worse. All ready SH'd. Pretty much wanna kms.

Don't really know what the point of this is, just guess I wanted to say, to leave a reason if I do.
