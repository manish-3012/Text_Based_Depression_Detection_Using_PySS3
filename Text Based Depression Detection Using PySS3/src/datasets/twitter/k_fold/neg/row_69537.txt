I am going to end it all for my little boyMy only boy, only weeks old is going for surgery. He needs general anesthesia and I dont know if he will survive it, but I know he is the fighter I am not.

If he does, god I hope he does, he will need years of therapy, training, and support. He may never have the childhood he should have. Hes a perfect little angel, but for some reason he needs to be going through all this. I would suffer torture for eternity just to have him have a normal life that he deserves.

I have decided that I am going to end it all because I am a coward and cannot handle all of this. More than anything my family will need money to cover all these future expenses and I have taken out a large life insurance policy a couple of weeks ago upon learning about my sons diagnosis. If for any reason the surgery doesnt go well, I have prepared in my bag all I need to end my life. I wont spend anymore time than I have to alive should something go wrong.

If it does go well, I will kiss him and his mother one last time and then kill myself in a car accident involving only my car so they dont know I killed myself intentionally and have to deal with that thought.

I love my wife, I love my boy, and I cant live knowing the hardship that is to follow. More than moral support, of which there is a ton of around us, they need money. I will give that to them. I had a life I never fully appreciated until I held my son in my arms. Since the first moment I saw him I wanted nothing in this world than for him to be healthy and happy. That has been taken from us as a family, so I will do the only thing I can to help and end my pain.

The pain of my death will fade in time. My son wont remember my face only the few pictures of us that exist. But he will never have to work a day in his life and neither will his mom ever again, so all can be focused on his health and happiness.
