Being the â€˜rent a friendâ€™ sucks. I need support :(I just need someone to talk to about always being the friend people invite out when they have no one else or need to get the numbers up on a night out. Iâ€™m never invited to anything small or close knit.


All my â€˜friendsâ€™ are moving away for uni and my birthdays coming up so... fuck. Life just gets me down too much sometimes.


I can never admit to people in real life how I feel. I just lie through my teeth and smile say Iâ€™m ok ðŸ™‚ but it hurts. It hurts a lot. If I donâ€™t ponder on it and just move on in my head I donâ€™t feel as bad but when I really face my fears and realise that when the shit comes down to the shit, thereâ€™s no one standing by my side.


If someone I know irl sees this theyâ€™re just gonna do the same old same old ask if Iâ€™m ok and then carry on destroying my feelings by excluding me from their outings.


Iâ€™ve tried counselling and hotlines and itâ€™s just bullshit. For me at least it didnâ€™t work. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve wound up here... I just need a rock but I feel like Iâ€™m on a sandy beach.
