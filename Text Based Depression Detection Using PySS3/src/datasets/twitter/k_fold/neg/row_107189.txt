I am going to die aloneI'm too fucking exhausted to even type out some bullshit about how awful I am. Can somebody please just talk to me? I can't sleep and right now my solution to that is gonna be jumping from my 6th floor window. I want to curl up on the kitchen floor where it's cold and cry, but I don't want anybody to find me. Even if I did I wouldn't be able to bring myself to cry
