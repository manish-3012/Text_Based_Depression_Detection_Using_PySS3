Not a question of â€œIfâ€, only â€œWhenâ€Iâ€™m well aware of how this life will end.  
It will not be quiet, it will not be peaceful, it will not be from some freak accident.  
It will be loud, it will reverberate through the trees.  
It will be bloody, grim, and full of tears.  
I do not want to die, I canâ€™t begin to comprehend what nothing is. No life, no existence, itâ€™s such a foreign concept, and I am scared of it.  
But this life, is not one worth sticking around.  
I will make the choice, in time, to face that fear, rather than wake up one more day and face the fire in front of me.  
Iâ€™ve lost it all, my fiancÃ©e, my best friend, 3 kids, my dog, my home, my sanity, my ability to feel.  
I am naught but a shell of a person now.  
Bullshitting through every single fucking day of this life for the benefit of a family who has only lied and manipulated.  
For a mother, who saw to it that my fiancÃ©e would leave me so that I had no choice but to come home with her.  
I give every fucking but of myself for every person around me, and what the hell do I get in return?  
Nothing.  
Ignored, criticized, hatred, humiliation, hospitalized.  
Everything I do is for them, but in the long run, they couldnâ€™t give a fuck about me.  
My death, will only serve as an excuse for them to get sympathy from others, an event to be milked for their own benefit, for their own attention, a feather for their cap.  
I stay alive for them, and they canâ€™t even look at me like a human being, just a worthless fucking charity case.  
Iâ€™m fed up with it, and soon they will understand just how fed up with it I truly am.  

1 1/2 years since I lost my first child.  
And in 22 days, on my birthday, it will be 1 year since she walked out the door of my life.  
I donâ€™t plan on seeing year 2.
