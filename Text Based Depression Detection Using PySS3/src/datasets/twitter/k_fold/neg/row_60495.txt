Where am I supposed to find happiness?I thought working with kids was my passion. It's okay, but I'm working 12 hour days and recently the fear and anxiety of something happening to a child in my care has far outweighed the benefits, even though I've been doing this for years. So I'm miserable at work.

I don't know how I feel about my relationship. There are happy moments but there is also an overwhelming sense of "why bother?" and I know it's because I'm the problem. My brain fucks with me every single day and I have no stable sense of who I am or why I am.

I'm most of all miserable at home. Both of my parents are dying of terminal illnesses and I'm their sole caretaker. Not to mention my mother is still emotionally abusive, even in her current state. If I can't be happy at home, where can I be happy? Isn't that where people go to relax? What the fuck is going on?

I don't feel like I have anywhere else to turn and things are just getting worse by the day. What the fuck. Why should I bother anymore?
