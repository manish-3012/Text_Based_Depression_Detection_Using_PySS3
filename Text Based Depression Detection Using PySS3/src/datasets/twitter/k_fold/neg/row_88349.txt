I want to dieI've been feeling really suicidal lately and I kinda cane on here for help. Nothing really bad happened and I don't know why I've been feeling this way, but it's really strong and it makes me feel worthless ('it' being the suicidal urges) my mom never took me to get officially diagnosed, but I think I have depression. I have cut myself before, but I stopped because my sister found out. I've also been feeling like no one cares about me, even though I have a loving girlfriend and lots of friends. If anyone can tell me, I'd like to know if I actually have depression or if I'm just being stupid like I always am.
