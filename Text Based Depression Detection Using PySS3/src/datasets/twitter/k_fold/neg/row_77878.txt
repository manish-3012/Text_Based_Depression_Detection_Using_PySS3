Stuck in PhD, just one way outHello, my name is David, i'm spanish \(I'm sorry for my english mistakes\) and just passed my twenty\-seventh birthday. Fisicaly i\`m just average for every feature one can have, and mentally i've always been melancholic and depressive. 

Since I was a boy I have fancied science and nature, thus I studied Biology, where I discovered my passion for phisiology so when i finished it I enrolled on a Neuroscience MÃ¡ster.

Then, I thought that enrolling on a PhD whould be a great idea, I was motivated and i thought I was intelligent enough, so I got a great grant for young researchers in Spain and started to work in a lab studying migraine... But here I am, two years have passed, and still I can't do right a simple experiment, my team is waiting my ressults to puublish a great piece of work, but I'm not able to produce the data they need.

This experience has tought me that in fact i'm not just unintelligent, I have strong short term memory dissorders, obsesive tunnel vision and I'm even drifting towards laziness

Next monday my research team wants to make a meeting to start writing the paper \(they are aming good magazines like Cell or Nature\), but i have nothing to give them, so I have made my decision: I won't get to monday alive

I write this because maybe other people are in my position, and i think I could give good advice to some...
