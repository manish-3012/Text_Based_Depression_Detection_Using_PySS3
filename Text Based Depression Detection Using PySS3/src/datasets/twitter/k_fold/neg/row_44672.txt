Long distance girlfriend in need of help!!!We met online. About two years ago, I found a girl named who I nickname "Becca". She lives in the UK, and I live in Georgia. I always knew she had a tough time, even down to telling me she was raped at 9 years old. She cut herself, and cut herself, and just today she told she's gonna do it. I do not know what to do. I have known her for two years and we've dated on and off. I do not know how to get professional help for someone on the the other side of the globe. I even tried calling her and she is not picking up. I just brought her back into the light. What can I do? I am not losing her again, either mentally, lovingly OR physically. You catch my drift...
