I have no reason to live.Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this I just don't know where else to turn. To start I am a 17 year old male, I live with my at my uncles house with my dad because my father is disabled. I dropped out last year while my dad was in the hospital. I haven't found a job in three years. I haven't been in real relationship my entire life. I suck at everything I do. I am not smart. The only comforting thing for me anymore is music. I am getting tired of the same thing every single day. I'm thinking about ending it tomorrow when my cousins aren't home.
