The urge is getting stronger.I never had problems with depression, at least I dont think I have. I've never been to a therapist because I'm not going to pay some soft spoken idiot to tell me to love myself, and to appreciate the "little victories". 

I'm a 23 year old guy, and have accomplished absolutely nothing. I hate myself on every single level, due to the fact that I was terribly bullied all throughout school, both physically and mentally. I guess you could say I'm a late bloomer, even though I've yet to fucking bloom. I'm ugly to the point I traumatize children to tears, or immense fear. I have never had a girlfriend, I've never even held hands, hugged, or even been friends with a girl because you cant deny that shit is solely based on looks, and when you're ugly as sin you're simply shit out of luck. 

My best friend, my mom, passed away when I was 21, six days before my 22nd birthday. I have absolutely no friends. I've pushed each and every one of them out of my life because I dont trust them, and I know they couldn't stand me anyway. I have no one to talk to, the loneliness, or solitude whatever the fuck is going on, is relentless. 

I live in self hatred every single day. I dont know what to do. This self hatred, and loneliness is absolutely draining me. I cant see my life 5, 10, or 15 years from now. Everyone around me is so fucking happy and I wake up in a storm cloud. 

I dont even know what to fucking do. I just want this all to end. I'm tired of the constant heartache I feel everyday I wake up with no explanation. I'm tired of cry, I'm tired of trying. 

I just want to hit the power switch to life and be done.
