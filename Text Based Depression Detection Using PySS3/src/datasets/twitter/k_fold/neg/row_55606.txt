It's becoming intrusiveSo in these past weeks, I have thinking more and more about just ending it all. Not even methods or anything, just the thought of myself dead. The thought of dying was always there but it's becoming intrusive 

My life has been a failure up until now, I have no job, no friends, I can't stand my family, I'm a waste of space.

I just want to stop and reset. Or not even reset. Just stop.
