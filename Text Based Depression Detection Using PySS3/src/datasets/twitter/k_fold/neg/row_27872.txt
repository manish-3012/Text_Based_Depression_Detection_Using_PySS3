I wrote a suicide letter just in caseHello I am a 15 year old that is on the 9th grade and I have been diagnosed with ADHD, dyslexia and social anxiety which lead to a depression now I'm here suicidal

Now why I wrote the letter is because I can't leave with my always thinking someone's breathing on my neck.
I have been left out by my own friends but due to my anxiety I think they hate me even more if I speak. I wrote it because I can't leave with my pathetic life that I want to try the ressurection theory. That's all thank you for reading my post
