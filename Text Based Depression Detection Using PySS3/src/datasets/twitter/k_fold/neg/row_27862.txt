It's over for meThis is fucking hard for me to do I guess. I'm usually not the type of person who shows a lot of emotion, especially negative ones. Who am I? I really don't know. What am I? A degenerate, lazy piece of shit who is the one person in  the family who constantly fucks up and disappoint everyone. Currently go to uni, not a good one. My family, former friends, and my relatives consider it a shit tier school. Never been much of an A student. Well almost, until I recently figured out one tiny, little detail fucked up my future prospects. Sorry I really don't know where I'm going with this. Basically, I have all A that I worked really hard for all semester, but there's this one class, Mechanical Engineering, that I constantly fuck up in no matter how hard I try and ended up getting a D. But since COVID-19 was floating around, my school decided to offere a Pass/No pass grade for anyone who was struggling. Me, a lazy piece of shit, decided to wait a little longer. I missed the deadline by 2 days. Now, I have a  project due in 7 hours, I'm jaded from the work that got me knowhere, and this shit happens. My life is fucking over. I'm not even a CS major, I'm a bio major, I just took it because my dad, who still clung on to the little hope that I was a secret prodigy, wanted me to graduate early so I could pass MCATs and go to med school. I was lucky enough to have a chance, and I fucked it up so badly that It ruined my life. I'm done. I already emailed the people I know who can attempt to fix this. There's no guarantee, I might kill myself in seven hours. Who knows, maybe I'm too pussy and kill myself when my parents figures out that they raised a failure. Maybe I'm too pussy too and live the rest of my life in the shadow of my failure. Fuck me, I don't know.
