Iâ€™m struggling to hold on. Every week gets worse.This is the most depressed Iâ€™ve been in my life. These past two years Iâ€™ve lost important people to me every couple of months. First it was my dog from meningitis, my sister from cancer, my great grandmother from old age, and last month, my mother in law from a brain aneurysm. 

My landlord at my familyâ€™s home got remarried and wanted to sell the house weâ€™re renting, and we almost became homeless. 

My best friend and I were raped at a college party by a friend that we thought we could trust. 

Iâ€™ve been in a relationship for two years now (married one year on the 20th) and itâ€™s been a rollercoaster. I love my husband with my entire being but itâ€™s so hard to hang on. We bounced around each other for years unknowingly and when we met it was this strange feeling of like we were always meant to meet. I had never met anyone with such a similar background growing up as me (both military brats) and with similar ideations. We were fine for months until I found out that he had cheated early on. We ended for a while and reconnected the day he left for basic training. I wrote to him every single day from the moment I got his mailing address and went to Texas for his graduation. We got married a few months later and I had to wait for him to finish tech school before we could move in together. We were supposed to go to Italy in March but got rerouted to Utah because of the virus. A week after I moved in with him, I found that he had been unfaithful for a period of time through his phone and got hit for the first time. I was scared to sleep next to him that night and actually slept in a onesie in our bare living room for hours before I came in with two bottles of water and we talked and worked things out. 

I had trouble trusting him and honestly got in my head about it, which helped lead to where we are now. We would argue here and there and I would tell him that I needed time to trust him fully again. We were okay for a while. I would wake up at 4 am with him everyday, make him breakfast, and see him off. I was applying to college at the time and we only have one car so I was at home which I didnâ€™t mind. I kept the house clean and would do all of the laundry and make all of the meals. I greeted him when he came home, helped him take off his shoes and abus/ocps and ask him about his day while he got ready to relax and game. One day, he ignored me all day, came home and told me he was done. I begged him to not give up and he said his mind was made up. He would hit me from time to time, punch directly in front of my face and I would flinch and he would get mad because he â€œwouldnâ€™t actually do itâ€. It would always be an inch away from my face and I would get scared. He would call me insufferable and a crazy psycho bitch while I didnâ€™t call him any names (I called him an asshole maybe three times, and that was only because he had a few beers and was being extra mean to me). He would mock me and harp on the fact that I had no friends there besides his friends (we were 2000 miles away from everything and everyone I knew and I didnâ€™t know anyone there). 

Despite all of this, I wanted to and frankly, still do, want to go to a marriage counselor and talk through our issues. He left me and is living with a friend on base and Iâ€™ve been alone in our home. He wonâ€™t come to the apartment without a coworker and has taken most of his clothes and his gaming setup. I donâ€™t have a car, was living at home with my parents while doing college full time and have always done odd jobs for friends and family, so Iâ€™m struggling to find a job that I can walk to in the cold. He only just started giving me spousal support and itâ€™s not enough to pay rent. Heâ€™s pocketing the BAH now and I only have enough savings for another month of rent before Iâ€™m homeless. I havenâ€™t really spoken to my parents about it because I donâ€™t want to break their hearts. I havenâ€™t spoken to my friends in weeks. He spun the story so bad to his momâ€™s side that I wasnâ€™t allowed to be there when she passed and I spent the week sobbing in our home alone, praying for a family that hates me. (Thereâ€™s a lot to unpack there, she never held him accountable for anything that he did and would give him a slap on the wrist for cheating, etc.) I spent Thanksgiving alone for the first time in my life and spent the whole day crying because we were supposed to go to his Dadâ€™s house and I had been looking forward to that for a year. He doesnâ€™t check up on me anymore. 

Iâ€™ve tried taking my life but when I told him that I loved him and that I was sorry I got sent to the ER intoxicated out of my mind (I went out and was in the Uber when I told him that. I was in the town over, blacked out and donâ€™t know how I got home. They thought I got drugged). I think about leaving Earth everyday but Iâ€™m so scared of the pain and what will happen afterwards. Iâ€™ve always been lucky and have had a good life growing up. My parents and sister are caring and supportive, my friends would do anything for me and all Iâ€™ve ever known is love. They all deserve the world and I feel like such a failure, disappointment and burden to them all. 

I had trust issues with my husband but did everything I could in our home to make sure that he was clean, loved, and comfortable. Iâ€™m a â€œthis is itâ€ type of person when it comes to my marriage so for me, I made a promise to my husband and God that I would be here until death do us part and I donâ€™t want it any other way. My husband and I are young and he has a lot of growing up to do (as do I), but I canâ€™t be with anyone else. I donâ€™t want to lose him and my marriage and I refuse to lose our home and everything we worked for. He regretted the time we spent apart so much in the past and when I saw him at basic for the first time in months, I could tell that he had changed. He was mature and proud and had nothing but faith in us and our future. Even when I doubted our relationship, he was the one who reassured me during that time and told me that we would make it through everything that the world threw at us. That we would show everyone who doubted us that we would make it and that we were meant to be because we are. I originally wanted to wait two years and then get married, but he was so dead set on us being endgame that he convinced me that it was okay if we did it then. I donâ€™t regret it at all, and to be honest, last winter was the happiest that I had been in the past two years. 

Flash forward to now, Iâ€™m alone for the first time in my life, I fight every time I speak with my husband to save our marriage, and Iâ€™m majorly depressed (got diagnosed in the ER with that one). I donâ€™t have the money for groceries so Iâ€™ve spent the last two months surviving off of what weâ€™ve had stocked in the pantry and freezer. I now eat once or day or even skip a day or two so that I can prolong the little food that I have. I have a big pot full of jungle juice that I made (a mixture or tea, sangria, vodka, tequila, ciroc, pina colada mix, and strawberry daiquiri mix) as well as one of those big jugs of sangria mixed with a liter of vodka and leftover trulyâ€™s from the days my husband and I would invite fellow airman over to party at our place since weâ€™re not on base. Iâ€™m tempted everyday to just unthaw the pot, finish that, the jug and the trulyâ€™s off within the span of an hour or two with the hopes of not waking up. My husband doesnâ€™t check on me physically despite knowing how much Iâ€™m struggling so I probably wouldnâ€™t be found for days. 

The part of me that wants to live just slightly outweighs the part that wants to start over and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s getting me. Iâ€™m so scared of the pain, the chance of another failed attempt and massive hangover, scarring the people I love who donâ€™t deserve this, and the other ramifications that I could face. Iâ€™m tired of praying to God to save my marriage everyday and breaking down throughout the day. I cry making food, studying, in the bathroom, in bed.. everyday is the same and I refuse to give up on us. I know Iâ€™m too stubborn for my own good but as cheesy as it is to say, my husband is my dream. Heâ€™s not my only dream, but I refuse to give up on something when I know we have good within us. You guys are hearing the bad parts and donâ€™t know the full story, but there is good. I just donâ€™t know if I can hang on in the lifetime to see us survive. 

This post is long winded and Iâ€™m sorry. It felt good to say a little about whatâ€™s going on but at the end of the day Iâ€™m still struggling and honestly donâ€™t know if I want to make it to Christmas just to spend it alone. Iâ€™m so tired..
