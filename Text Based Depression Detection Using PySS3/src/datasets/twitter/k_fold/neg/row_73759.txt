im ready to give up. ive prepared myself. talk me out of it. give me optionshi, thanks for clicking on this post.

i rly need help, no one else is giving to me, u guys r probably one of my last options

i live my life in seemingly endless sadness, im currently 15, i find this is an issue as most of my thoughts, feelings, opinions, are deemed as "naive", or "invalid", or "attention seeking". but im none of these things, i keep it to myself i dont parade it around like some people do. im incredibly unmotivated, i make my own music which i wld say is good, but i have no motivation to put it out and advertise it as i have extreme feelings that it will fail. i find the world in general ridiculously uncaring, especially my school, they know about my issues with suicide and everything they lie to my parents and say yes we will help as much as we can, no one at school has ever even asked me how im doing, however they are incredibly vigilant when it comes to delivering me sanctions for poor behaviour (which often occurs as a result of my issues). i dont like talking to my friends girlfriend or parents about anything as it worries them. i am seeking medical help however all treatment they are giving me (diagnoses, medication, therapy) is having no effect on my wellbeing. nothing im doing is helping me and ive tried everything to fix things, smoking, drugs, meditation, dieting (may i add i no longer smoke or do drugs after quickly learning yes they are fun but they have no positive effect on my hapiness). im ready to give up. and i dont see myself lasting much longer. help. please 

another thing, please dont tell me the suicide is selfish, youll hurt everyone you love stuff, it doesnt work. i want to live for myself
