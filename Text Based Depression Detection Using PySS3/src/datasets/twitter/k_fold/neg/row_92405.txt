Anyone with depression have a few NDEs and are wondering why they're still here??? And anyone feel like they're just faking it everyday???I've been suffering with MDD since I was a child and am still wondering what it feels to be "normal". My relationships have been destroyed from it, and I've lost so much money due to "treatments" and other holistic bllshit I've tried. I feel that I have nothing to lose or gain anymore in this world (since everything in this world is turning to sht due to politics and greed), and I've been through it all, including death. I know life is suffering and pain, but how much can one endure. I've had about 3 near death experiences and I've just about had it. I have outrightly told people close to me that I wish I had died those times. I also feel that I'm just faking life now...always trying to find a reason to live and care about others. I had a cat (who was my sole companion)...and now am not allowed to have him back (my family took my cat in because I was hospitalized so many times). Why care about others when you don't even care about yourself anymore. My last option is to join some support groups. Anyone else feel the same? Thanks for reading this.
