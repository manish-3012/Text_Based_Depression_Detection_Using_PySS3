I can't deal with itI can't deal with being by myself ALL THE TIME. I can't deal with feeling love for someone who not only doesn't love me but doesn't want anything to do with me. I can't deal with seeing people in relationships and leading full lives when I can't. I can't deal with the fact I only have one very close friend and I almost never get to see him. I don't belong anywhere.
