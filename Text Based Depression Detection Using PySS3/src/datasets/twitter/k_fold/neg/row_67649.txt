My Psychiatrist told me that there is nothing else that can be done.I have been seeing the same Psychiatrist for several years, and have been trying to treat anxiety, depression, and PTSD related to abuse I faced as a teen. I have been hospitalized several times, and have been on countless pills. Yoga, acupuncture, diets, group therapy, a case worker. Most antidepressants didn't work well for me, one putting me in hospital after I had some really dangerous mental issues. I also receive ECT every 2 weeks.

A few months ago I requested a visit to a sleep clinic to deal with my nightmares. My psychiatrist refused at first, saying it would be a waste. I did get the referral and they found a sleep disorder and requested I work with a sleep therapist. The sleep therapist requested I see a mental health therapist one to one as well, as I am a bit of a mess. I completed a round of CBT, improving my sleep, which helps the depression.

So I go to my Psychiatrist for the therapy referral and he tells me that there are no therapists, that there is no longer treatment for me, and that this would be our final appointment. It has been a few weeks, I have an appointment for a second opinion set up in July, but I am also sinking in mood. If nothing can be done, why continue suffering? It is cruel to make me hold out in this pain for no reason. I want a happy, successful life, but if my psychiatrist is saying that wouldn't be possible, should I really put myself through decades of suffering for no real reason? It has been 15 years since my diagnosis of mental health issues, and no success. I am really worn down from it.
