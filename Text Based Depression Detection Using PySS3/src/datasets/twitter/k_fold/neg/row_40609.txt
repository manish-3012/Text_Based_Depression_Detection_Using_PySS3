i think the most selfish thing a person can do is have a childI don't think that people understand what not wanting to live means, or at least what I mean when I say I don't want to live. 

It doesn't mean that there's something missing that I need fulfilled. It doesn't mean I need your help. It doesn't mean I'm upset with you. 

It means that I don't want to live. It means I don't want to get out of bed, or shower, or dress myself, or go outside, or drive, or go to work, or talk, or eat, or hang out, or anything. It means I don't want anything. It means I don't want to exist. 

Even if I had everything I ever dreamed of, I would not want to exist. Simply existing for me is a harrowing experience and I want nothing more than to simply cease being. 

I hate my parents for creating me. 

If God exists, he can go fuck off.

That's all. I just needed to let all of that out before I go back to my routine of living each day as if they are all one, drifting along high on anything I can get my fucking hands on. 

How anyone could slog through this shit with a grin is far beyond my comprehension. 

I posted this on a throwaway because I hate reddit, but ironically I can't think of anywhere better to post this.
