I have never felt happiness, Why didn't I have the choice to never existIn the past I wanted to feel happy at least just for a second.

Right now fuck happiness, fuck life, fuck my awful perants, fuck my dreams I will never feel happy it's impossible really I've been through trauma that can't be fixed. I can't even get help.

Life is not worth living I'm one in almost 8 billion people what am I going to do with my fucked up self I have this one life and I didn't even enjoy it.
Made to be miserable. 

I wish I was brave enough to kill myself
