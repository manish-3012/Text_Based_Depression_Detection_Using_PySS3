Too pathetic to kill myselfI wasted so much time with trying to get help from other people. I don't know why I even try anymore. I'm somewhat living my dream of making friends (I have two already), but my mind still keeps going back to every bad thing that happens to me or every bad thing that I've ever done. And I've tried and tried and tried so much to get rid of them, and they always come back, and the only person who even exists right now and knows everything on my plate is myself. I don't want to go to therapy because I don't want to get hurt again, and I also feel like investing time in something like that is a waste. Why complain to someone about things you can't change when you can just kick back and play video games or something to take your mind off of things? But then that doesn't work, because your mind just keeps going straight back to it, and you can't focus while playing because that's all your mind wants to go to nowadays. Taking medicine won't work either, because you'll get bullied about it by family members and possibly friends if they ever find out, and it gave you a lot of paranoia anyways. Everyone really thinks I'm just a good for nothing useless scumbag, and it's somewhat correct, but I'm trying my best and I'm really trying to be a good and happy person but I'm good but just always so fucking sad or mad unless I'm alone. And even when I'm alone, those thoughts always come up, whether I'm washing the dishes, trying to sleep, or watching TV. I don't want to die but I don't want to live either, so I don't know. If I could change a thing in the past, it would probably be to get good friends. That would help out a lot.
