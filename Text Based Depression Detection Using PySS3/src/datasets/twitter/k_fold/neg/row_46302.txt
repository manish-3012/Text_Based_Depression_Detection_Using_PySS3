21 years old kissless, relationshipless virgin. I am not sure if I can take it much further.21 years old, I've never kissed a girl. I've never have sex. Not a single lady has shown interest in me. You may think I am a total ass hole, well I do have quite a few friends who think I am a typical good guy.

The obvious problem is my looks. Below average face, average body. Strangers do not want to talk to me as soon as they see me. Life is terrible. I've always tried to convince myself I do not need a girl to be happy but I am pretty sure that is not the case.

And  before you try to convince me looks are nothing, as yourself how much you being atracted to someone is dependant on how that someone looks?
