I feel like a disgraceI don't know how to put everything into words here, and I'm sorry if this is too long. I'm a 16 year old male and it seems my life is falling apart before my eyes. My best friend hates me over petty, worthless shit and left me at a time I needed someone most. My friends have began to drift away, my parents are disappointed in me because I want to live my own way, my grades are horrendous, I have a horrible panic disorder and major OCD. Also my girlfriend who I love very much, still has feelings for her ex. I hate everything about myself, I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I have so many things I wish I could redo. I'm filled to the brim with regret and sorrow. I seem to bring down everyone around me which makes me feel even worse. I just want to make everyone happy and not be walked on. I want to end up doing what I love in life rather than obeying and working a job that will make things worse. My family threatened to send me to the hospital recently, I don't want to be sent to the hospital though, I'm scared. Truthfully I've made detailed plans of ending it all. And tried on December 4th of 2011. I'm heavily considering trying again. No one seems to give a damn about me anymore. I just want the pain to go away.
