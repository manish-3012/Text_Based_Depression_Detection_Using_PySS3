Iâ€™ve almost lost my sanityThese past two weeks for me have been unbearable with nothing but nightmare after nightmare of what might happen next. Iâ€™ve been crying myself to sleep almost every night, and it feels like it will never stop.

I honestly feel like Iâ€™m about to go insane... when will it end?
