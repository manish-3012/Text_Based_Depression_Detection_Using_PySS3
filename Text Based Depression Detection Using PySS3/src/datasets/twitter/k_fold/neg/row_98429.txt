Yesterday I broke down while I was in the showerI was 5 seconds away from taking my bottle of pills to the woods by my house. The only thing stopping me was being afraid of what happens afterwards. If nothing happens then maybe that's better than feeling like this. I'm not happy about anything. I hate the way I look, I hate the way I sound, I hate my body, I hate my anxiety, I hate the way I think about dying every day. I'm so sick of it. I'm so fucking exhausted fighting every day. I'd rather feel nothing. Anything would be better than this. I've never come so close. I never thought about actually going through with anything. My family and friends would be okay without me. That's what life is about. Going through hard times and losing people. They would get over it.
