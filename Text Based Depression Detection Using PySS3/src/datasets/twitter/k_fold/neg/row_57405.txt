I'm done with all this painI cant do it anymore. The one person who I thought actually cared about me finally showed me her true colours. I'm all alone now. I gave her everything I could and now I have nothing left. I'm alone and scared and I dont want to be alive anymore. The world is a cruel place and I'm not cut out for it. I just need to figure out how I'm going to end it all
