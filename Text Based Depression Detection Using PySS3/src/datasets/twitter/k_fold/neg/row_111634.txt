[26F] currently on a psychiatric wardI tried to kill myself, I tried jumping off an empty bridge and a member of the Punic suddenly appeared and tackled me to the floor and restrained me there until police arrived. Police sectioned me and bought me to a local psychiatric ward. 
I've thought about suicide since I can remember, been on a number of different anti depressants, anti psychotics, and different therapies. Nobody can say I haven't tried to change the way my mind works.
I've come to realise I will always be this way and life is to painful for me I can't deal with it anymore. It should be my choice to not want to live and I'm so angry that choice is being taken away from me.
So now I'm in an empty room staring at 4 lonely walls. 
The other girls here are crazy, I can see why they are here. One of them thinks she's is an alien and is planning her "return to Venus" I can see that these people are clearly mentally ill.
I'm not like these people, I just want to be gone from this earth and it's not fair that I'm not being able to go. They think it can be fixed and it can't. I will never not feel this way. 
I don't want to be a burden on anybody or waste tax payers money by staying here when I'm still gonna feel the same when I leave here. 
What's the point in trying to force somebody to live who doesn't want to? I'm so angry
