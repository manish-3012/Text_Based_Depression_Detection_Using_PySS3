I think I will commit suicide in the near futureFirst of all, I am sorry if this isnt enjoyable to read. English is not my first language. 
I thought that it would get better. In the last few weeks, I did not feel so bad. I thought this time would be over now, but it is back, and much stronger now.
Of course there are some backstories, but that would take too long.
I just have the constant feeling of people putting pressure on me. Do this, do that. Act like this, not like this. Become a sucessful person, achieve something in life. Nobody asks me how I really feel. If I really want to be like I am.

I just see myself as a person who unsucessfully tries to fit in by beeing like everybody wants me to be. And while doing this, I see my life passing in front of me.
I am a bad person. I did a lot of Bad things in my short time of life. And in the end, I tried my best. I really did. But maybe it is for the best to end it now.

I'm not depressed. That has nothing to do with depression. I am just tired of living. Tired of torturing myself. Tired of getting beaten down by the universe every time I try to stand up. In the last weeks, I tried again. I really, really tried. And now? I'm back on the ground, exhausted and tired. The last time, I tried to help myself out. I reframed my thoughts, started to get out of this mood. But I am done now. I just want it to end. 

I dont think that somebody will really miss me. Of course, some people will be shocked at first. But after some time, people start to carry on. Nobody cares about me, so why should they do now? I am doing everyone a favor. Why should I torture myself through life, just to be a negative side effect for everyone? 


I dont know why I am writing this. Maybe to reframe my last thoughts. Maybe I want somebody to help me. I dont know. I havenâ€™t decided yet if I will do it or not. But the chances are high enough for me to actually write this text now. After that, I will write some letters to people I know.
