I can't deal with thisI've been getting support lately, and people comment back, and talk to me, but I only feel worse, because they're all so happy, and I only want to be happy,too. My depression is keeping me awake, and I just can't close my eyes. I haven't slept in days, and I think the only way they'll listen when I plead the voices yelling at me inside, is to end it. End it all. No planning, just a short and sweet death note, hugs goodbye, and a gun to my head, trigger already pulled, with a fake smile plastered across my face from my last moments. Then I'll know. Then everyone will know, I climbed out of my pit, and my next smile, will be a real one. Thank you, Matchotamium and stillhereforyou. You eased a weight, a small one, but it made me feel like I was inching closer, before this ocean of knives swallowed me up. I feel even worse, knowing that this post will be lost in billions of others,while the people that comment are like a broken record, saying *I'll talk* over and over, while secretly laughing at my pitiful life.

UPDATE: I'm sorry, but I still don't see anything good.
