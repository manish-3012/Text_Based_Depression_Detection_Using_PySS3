Things going to hell pretty rapidlyHi, pretty shaky right now. Been battling crippling depression for over a year (though, been more or less depressed my whole life), but recently have been showing bipolar signs, but no official diagnosis on that yet.

So, the last few weeks have been great. I've managed to be productive and somewhat getting back to normal, considering the circumstances. The few slightly manic episodes have been a real welcomed change from 24/7 depression and yeah, stuff just worked.

Now however, every single depressed thought that have escaped my mind recently came back in full force. Had a fight with my parents (not gonna go into detail) and feel like utter shit. Remembering my past attempts at suicide and generally suicidal thoughts just churn through my mind at rapid speed.

So, I'm just gonna get something to sleep on and hope it works out. I can't take another trip to the psych ward, then I'll definitively off myself. 

But really, I am scared of what I might do, especially if I'm bipolar (not 100% sure, but my therapist thinks so) and do something stupid and irrational. Not really wanting to die, atleast not until I'm done with a few projects...

Sorry, just rambling...
