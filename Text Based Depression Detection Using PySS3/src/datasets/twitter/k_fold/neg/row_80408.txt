i'm a disappointment with adhdi'm always too tired to do my homework

i always delay it until almost midnight

i always nap because i'm exhausted physically and mentally

i'm sleep deprived

and whenever my dad asks me how much homework i have left he always sighs in anger and disappointment

i'm a disappointment to my family

i wish i didn't have adhd

and plus i wasn't even diagnosed with adhd

i have all the symptoms and apply to the dsm-5

but my parents can't find a time to get a diagnosis (because of coronavirus, plus i have a sister with mitochondrial disease so they have to take care of her 24/7)

my dad thinks training works but always finds the wrong kinds of training, and i don't even know what type of training works, i can't go to therapy because of my sister and because of coronavirus

i can't get a diagnosis because of my sister and coronavirus

and even if my sister didn't have mitochondrial disease and even if the coronavirus wasn't there i wouldn't be able to get a diagnosis because my dad thinks training works but uses the wrong kinds of training always and plus my mom always thinks "look for solutions not a diagnosis" but she refuses to acknowledge that i need to have a diagnosis in order to receive accommodations

i have no idea what to do anymore

i get yelled at my teacher for not being able to pay attention

life is becoming a living hell

i don't know what to do

i'm mentally exhausted

i wish i could die and experience no more suffering

i don't want to suffer anymore

i wish i could just end my suffering

i just want to rest from all this

but i can't

i'm a disappointment
