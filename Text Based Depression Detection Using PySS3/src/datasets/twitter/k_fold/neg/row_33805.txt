Just waiting around for someone to finally shoot meI know the US is famous for guidance shootings. I have a full house of people - two people I dint like. One I love beyond anything but he isn't talking to me because he thinks I'm selfish like the other two. 
No matter what I've done in the past ti be a better person doesn't count. 

Now I'm just walking around hoping someone might take me  for a luna t ic and shoot me so I don't have to live in this misery knowing I'm all alone... 

I wish I never moved to the US.  I wish I was a better person my husband could love... I wish I wasn't so alone all the time...
