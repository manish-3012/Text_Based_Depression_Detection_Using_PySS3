i'll k m s cause of climate changeEvery week there are news about it, it's always worse than we thought

I already developed stomach pain cause of the non-stop anxiety, I don't really fall for these sweet lies anymore I know it won't be stopped and we won't magically fix it

I'm not a scientist so I don't really understand everything but I looked at skeptic arguments and someone always points out that they are flawed, I wish they were right but whatever (also I don't think anyone who is skeptical of the whole thing is a bad person, maybe they cope like this so I think people should stop bully them and holding them responsible for climate change)

 I think we either go back to prehistoric level of life and crash the global economy which would lead to a total war or just keep living like before and we will die from natural disasters either way I don't want to see it

I'd rather die young remembering earth as a blue/green planet rather than some yellow/brown wasteland

I wish you the best I actually hope some miracle happens and everything turns right but i'm too far gone mentally
