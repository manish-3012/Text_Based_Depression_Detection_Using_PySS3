It Doesn't Get Better.I deeply yearn for death. My life is better than it has ever been in terms of finances, social opportunity, and options. This was achieved through grueling effort. Yet all I want is to die.

I don't have the guts to kill myself by conventional methods. But if I could press a button and blink out of existence I would. I fantasize about being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer with 2 weeks to live. I break down into tears often when I look at my life and realize how lonely, pointless, and futile it is. No one loves me, no one knows me, no one will remember me, and no one cares.
