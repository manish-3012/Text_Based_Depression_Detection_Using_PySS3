Hi. I "like" being depressed. Help?I've been depressed for about 6 years now, and it has come to the point that I am constantly self harming and drinking. I can "make" myself happy just by trying to be happy, but I don't. I used to, but not anymore. I do things that I know will make me upset, like reflecting on bad memories, especially ones involving the abuse I recieved as a child. I have also told everyone I know not to text me, and then I deleted their contact information. I want to be depressed and I want to kill myself. But I guess I don't want to do it now. I want to get worse until I can't withstand life anymore, and I feel like I am pretty close. I know I need to change the way I'm thinking, but part of me doesn't want to. Well.. All of me doesn't. I don't know.
