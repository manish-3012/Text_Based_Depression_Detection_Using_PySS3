I think I'm too far gone to ever live normally, medicine and therapy hasn't helped. Is there anything else?Every day of my life is just agony. Physical and emotional agony. I always feel like I'm suffocating, I always want to throw up, my back and neck are fucked up from an accident and none of my family cares. I've got several diagnosed mental illnesses, one of which is misophonia which if you don't know about, if I hear a sound I don't like?? Will literally start hitting myself and bawling and swearing and scratching my skin off like an idiot. I feel so stupid...I was going to be a scientist but I can't imagine being able to do anything anymore. I used to have so many things I loved to do and I can't do ANYTHING anymore, I haven't gone to work in ages, stopped doing freelance art, learned one song on guitar for the past few months, I don't eat, I just sleep and my parents hate me for being so useless. I'm going to be 18 in a few months and I can't do this. I just cry every day and wish I could've been a better person and wait until something kills me in my sleep. I can't fit my entire backstory on here but I'll say life has thrown everything at me from other friends having killed themselves to being sexually assaulted when I was little to my mom physically hurting me and screaming at me and making me into a crybaby while my dad just gets high in the other room and never talks about it. Nobody at my house cares enough to find me help for ANY of these things plus the dozens and dozens of other things having fucked up my head in the past.

I've seen stories of people who mention a family member that struggled their entire life for decades before finally killing themselves because everything hurt so bad and I can't help but feel like that's going to be me. I don't want to suffer and suffer and suffer but medicine hasn't worked, I've changed therapists four times and all of them are equally useless. What is there left to do??? I don't want to suffer anymore but the only option I can think of is just finally dying. 

I'm looking for something that worked for you or worked for a friend or just...worked for someone that wasn't therapy and medicine. I'm out of options here. Every single day for so long has felt like the end of my rope.
