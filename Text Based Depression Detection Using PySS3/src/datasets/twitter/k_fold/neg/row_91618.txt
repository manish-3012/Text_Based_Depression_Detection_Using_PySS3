Everything just went so wrong so fast.I don't think I actually deserve to be on suicide watch but I really need someone to talk to. I think my girlfriend and me just broke up, I;m not sure. We do this occasionally but never this intense and now I think things may actually be over. I know this sounds really clique and maybe childish but I really planned for my life with this girl (We have/had been dating for about three and a half years) I really don't have much without her. 

I had just brought her home from work and we were talking when everything suddenly got terrible. I really have no other way to describe it than that, the day was fine leading up to it and seemed perfectly normal just a second before. The conversation became very venomous and she I should break up with her rather than deal with a problem I brought up. Then it became worse and worse until she called me manipulative and uncaring. 

I really can't believe she said that. I can't possibly love and care for a person more than I do for her and the thought of manipulating her somehow is really disgusting. I really do go out of my way to try and make her feel as loved, as cared for, and as respected as possible since she comes from a very emotionally abusive household. But the idea that she views me as this bad makes me sick. 

Then she just left. She went to hang out with her friends who for some reason believe she should break up with me. I'm not really sure why. I went a little off the deep end when she told me that and hurt myself pretty badly but I think I'm at a more level head after writing this. 

I don't think I've ever felt more beaten down than I do right now, physically and mentally. It's like I lost a fight I didn't even know was going on. I'm as low as I've ever been and I really hate it.
