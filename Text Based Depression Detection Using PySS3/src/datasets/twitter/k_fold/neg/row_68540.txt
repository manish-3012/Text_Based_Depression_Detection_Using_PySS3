Afraid to DieHello, this is my first post and honestly I only used to use this site for homework answers and funny posts but today I was hoping for a bit more. I'm dealing with some things and I know nobody cares but I thought I'd give talking about it a shot. I have depression and have attempted suicide about three or four times. I have also been an inpatient at several facilities and its been about three to five months since I've done anything dangerous to my health but recently some feelings have returned. I've restrained from cutting but I've started devising a plan to kill myself. I won't go into it but if things go the way I plan then I shouldn't be here by next week but the only problem is I'm kind afraid to die. I was brave before I knew what pain felt like. The last time I was in the hospital I was in the ICU for chugging 70-100 pills in less than an hour and the memories I have from that still haunt me. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm afraid to fail again. I want to die but I don't. I'm pretty sure I'll get hate for making this because you should know whether or not you want to die but it's hard for me for some reason. I was just hoping some of you guys could give me some feedback. You can be as mean as you want( I deserve it).
