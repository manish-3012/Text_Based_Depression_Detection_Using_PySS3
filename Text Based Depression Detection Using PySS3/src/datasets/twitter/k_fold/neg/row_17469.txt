Going from binge eating, to practicing starvationMy stomach hurts, and I feel like nauseous. I can't sleep, even though it's past midight. For the last few days, I tried to stop myself from binge eating. It's going alright so far, I'm getting better at controlling myself. I still have trouble moving around due to my (suspected) disability, but other than that I'm improving, I think. The con is, that food is on my mind more often now, and it's annoying.

Eventually, I'll be in full control over my caloric intake, and then I will be capable of starving myself.

 I will add dehydration, maybe some sleeping pills, that should do the trick.

I can't stand being housebound anymore. I thought I could use my time to write, or paint, but I'm stuck again. My head feels empty, and my lack of a life is pointless. I haven't been able to live much outside of my apartment for about 4 years now. All of my days have been more or less the same, and I'm scared of time flying by, while nothing changes. I wonder how long this will go on for.

My mother, who I live with, is close to 60. Every day I'm worried that she might die, and I will fall into the hands of people who won't care about me. Each day that I remember my situation is another instance of hopelessness. The only thing that brings me some amount of joy is fiction.

I tried to create it myself, but I can't write actual characters, as I lack the emotional capacity, skill, and experience.

Unless I magically wake up with the ability to walk again, I don't see any chance of actual independence. I'm not useful, I'm not alright with being me. I want to die. And I will try to.
