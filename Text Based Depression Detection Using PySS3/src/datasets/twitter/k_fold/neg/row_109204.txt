Quick vent postNeeded to get some stuff off my chest, feel free to comment with any similar feelings/emotions/opinions/whatever



It sucks, feeling like you have no one to talk to, I know this is a very common and un-unique trait but itâ€™s really annoying, I canâ€™t talk to my psychologist about my feelings because Iâ€™ll get involuntarily admitted to a fucking psych ward, I canâ€™t talk to my family about it because theyâ€™d worry too much and treat me differently when I just want to be normal, I canâ€™t tell my friends because it would permanently alter their opinion of me and also I donâ€™t want to drop a fucking bombshell like â€œI am having increasing amounts of suicidal urgesâ€ on them.

I really wish health professionals werenâ€™t obligated to break patient confidentiality here.
