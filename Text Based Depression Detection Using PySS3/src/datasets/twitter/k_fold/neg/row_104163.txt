Fuck the mental health systemIâ€™ve been suicidal for 3 weeks now and Iâ€™m trying to seek inpatient treatment. They told me I have to go to the emergency room for that. Oh, so you want me to attempt suicide first then youâ€™ll put me in there. You wonâ€™t just take me when I feel like thatâ€™s the only thing that can help me. Ok cool see you tonight I guess when I slit my fucking wrist open enough and bleed out so you can take me in and charge me $1000 dollars to sew some fucking string in my arm. Thanks. Fuck our healthcare system
