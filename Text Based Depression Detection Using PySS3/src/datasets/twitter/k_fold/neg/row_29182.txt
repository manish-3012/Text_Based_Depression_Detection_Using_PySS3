Itâ€™s just getting fucking worse.Name

I love you so much. I hope you know this. You know how rough itâ€™s been. I have no future. Iâ€™ve messed up irreparably. Not just recently but my life. Please know you were everything to me. And youâ€™re the reason I got to experience a lot more life then I deserved. Even though youâ€™ve already done so much for me, I have to ask you for a few more things. 

Please, if Iâ€™m on life support do not let me linger. I know it will be hard but I know in my heart that this is the right choice. Please sign my DNR.

Please let me go. I am not worth this. Anything. Anything you feel I promise that I regret knowing I made you feel that way but just... do your best to be over it. I am not worth it. I swear, I promise you will be so much happier without me.

Please make sure the pets are okay. They need to go to the vet; I didnâ€™t accomplish this.

Please keep in touch with my family.

Please study as much as you can and become a marine biologist- excuse me, aquatic biologist. I know you hate salt water.

Please move out of our apartment.

Please donâ€™t be sad- I wasnâ€™t meant for this world. I know you will disagree with this statement. I know you will be sad. But please just know that Iâ€™m finally gonna be okay. No more anti depressants that donâ€™t work, no more stupid therapy, no more guilt, no more hopelessness.

Please donâ€™t feel that you did anything wrong. You have been nothing but, as you called me, my angel. My savior.

Please find love again. Please. This is my most important wish. You were too good of a husband to not spread your love to someone else.

I love you so much. Iâ€™m so, so sorry. I know it will hurt for now but ultimately you will see itâ€™s for the best.

I promise Iâ€™m not worth your tears. Maybe when we were kids, but I sabotaged all my dreams and am not the person I promised you that I would be.

I really am so sorry. I hope some day in the future youâ€™ll forgive me.
