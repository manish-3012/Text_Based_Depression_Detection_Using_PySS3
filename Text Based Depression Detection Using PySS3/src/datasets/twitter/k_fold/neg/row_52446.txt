A little poem I wrote about suicide but who fuckin cares?I have no brain 

Receptors clogged with hate

It has grown completely inane

Chalk it off to ill-fate

So I sit in this house and rot 

I am missing something upstairs

Deserving of what I got

Void's eternal blank stares 

The pain of no love 

Torturous silence of no hope 

With this feeling enveloping me like a glove

I REACH FOR THE ROPE
