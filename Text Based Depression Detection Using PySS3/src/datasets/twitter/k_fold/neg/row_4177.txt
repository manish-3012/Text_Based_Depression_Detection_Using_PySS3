no one understands me.all my life iâ€™ve been the odd one out.

i wasnâ€™t exactly ostracised growing up, but because understanding and similarity in the outlook of life is so important to me in friendships, any friends i made would always drift apart and iâ€™m not gonna deny the fact that i played a big part in that with the detachment and unnecessary arguments/feeling irritated with my friends.

itâ€™s like affection repels me but being ignored/mistreated attracts me.

i always feel like i have to tone myself down when iâ€™m around/talking to people. my mind races with thoughts and ideas iâ€™d love to say out loud but the fear of being shut down &amp; looked at as weird always keeps me from saying anything. the thing is, whenever i present an idea or an opinion itâ€™s bashed but as soon as somebody else brings it up, theyâ€™re praised and agreed with, so i just prefer to keep to myself.

i also find it hard to initiate getting acquainted with people and letting them get close to me. other people usually have to start conversations with me first. 
i wish i wasnâ€™t so offstandish and bad at replying.

iâ€™m not trying to make this post too long, but i recently realised that i have an attachment avoidant personality and i always feel the need to leave somebody before they leave me. all my relationships are about being ready to escape at any time in case i hypothetically get hurt/betrayed. it makes me upset to think about how many nice friendships iâ€™ve missed out on by being so detached &amp; offstandish &amp; i hate myself for being like this and feeling unfixable/unable to change.
