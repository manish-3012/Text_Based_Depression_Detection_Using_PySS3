Iâ€™m just so sad all I do is cry and lay in bed and itâ€™s been yearsI made a post earlier that has everything itâ€™s dumb long so I thought I would make a smaller one though no one probably cares.    I have severe panic attacks every day too where Iâ€™m just crying and so scared Iâ€™m gonna suffocate from my throat swelling or a heart attack or something I have medication but it makes me so tired I want too kill myself some more itâ€™s a endless loop I canâ€™t escape I tried walking at the park and stuff like that but afterwards it would trigger a panic attack (or during) I hurt myself cause I think I deserve it I hide it well no one knows Iâ€™m 16 I have been too a therapist I was diagnosed with ocd ptsd gad and depression,I just want too kill myself I have not had a friend in 6 years cause I had too get homeschooled cause of anxiety and learning disabilityâ€™s no one cared anyways though...(also no one in my family or the therapist knows Iâ€™m suicidle cause my mom does not need too find out I will get thrown in a mental hospital they said I would, or get everything taken away) this is still long sorry.
