I feel like I'm holding on by a thread.I've never thought about suicide before. I graduated from college over a year ago and landed a pretty successful job working with pretty high class people. I've had an agonizing back problem for about 1.5 years and finally got surgery in July. After about 10 weeks I am pain free and feel like a new man. After I was finally able to return to work I've basically been laid off because there are no clients for me to work with. I'm a strength and conditioning coach. If there are any strength coaches out there you know that the in season for football can be very slow. So I'm currently getting calls everyday from debt collecters for student loans, barely can eat, barely can afford my apartment, and cant even heat my house because electric is too damn expensive. I tried to find other jobs to fill in part time but nobody is hiring. I'm not looking for someone to give me a speech on my career or what I should be doing. I'm just looking for some positive words and maybe something that will give me a different outlook on life.
