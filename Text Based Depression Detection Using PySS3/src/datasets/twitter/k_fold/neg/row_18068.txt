just took like.....7x my normal Zoloft dose and Iâ€™m scaredItâ€™s only 375mgs total(Iâ€™m on 50 daily), and Iâ€™m 4â€™11 113 lbs female. I know itâ€™s not gonna kill me, but Iâ€™m proper terrified. I couldnâ€™t go to the ER, I canâ€™t drive and the people I live with (not parents, Iâ€™m an adult. Long story about living situation) donâ€™t know Iâ€™ve done it, they could kick me out if they knew so no ambulance. Theyâ€™re super religious and think suicide is a sin.

I know I can probably just sleep it off, but this is the first time Iâ€™ve ever done anything like this in adulthood with proper intent. Iâ€™m working myself into a panic attack over my shitty subpar attempt
