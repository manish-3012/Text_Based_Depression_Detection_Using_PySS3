I'm terrified of other people and feel worthlessI don't see myself ever being able to live on my own. Right now I'm a bum. It's all because I am terrified of other people. I just graduated college but I only went because my parents wanted me to. I know I'm too worthless to ever have a good job and I'm too socially inept. In college they go on and on about networking but I can never do that. I am too scared of people to talk to them and I say the stupidest things when they do. No wonder I have like no friends. I feel so socially off from everyone. Anyway now I'm out. I thought I would feel better. School made me sick with worry and I felt worthless every time I submitted an assignment. But I've just realized that now my life is even more worthless and I have fallen into a deeper depression. I feel sluggish and heavy and sick. I just wish I could be like everyone else. I just want to die. If I wasn't such a coward I'd have killed myself by now. But I'm cripplingly afraid of everything. I haven't been to the hairstylist in years even though my ends are split and disgusting but I just can't deal with the social interaction of it. I'm so desperately lonely. I just wish I knew how to make friends and be close with people but I consistently fail. My life feels so worthless and I want to commit suicide so badly. But I have no good ideas on how to do it. So I probably never will. I'll probably just be worthless forever.
