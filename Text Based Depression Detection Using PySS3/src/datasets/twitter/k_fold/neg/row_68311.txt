Not really feeling it anymore...I have been struggling to keep myself together for quite a few months now. For a couple years now it has felt as if I've been wearing a mask. People always tell me how I smile all the time, but inside, I'm not, nor do I know how to tell them. My family fails to understand my situation and brushes over it by changing the subject. Doing what I used to find enjoying is no longer enjoying. I fail to find happiness in everything I am doing. OCD isn't making my condition any better. I am a first year university student in honors classes which take up all of my day and deprive me of my sleep. I tend to go to sleep at 5 AM everyday only to wake up at 8 AM everyday feeling like it would've been better if I had not awaken. I tend to feel like a burden on everyone on a daily basis and fail to understand the value of my life. Everything I found the least bit enjoying has diminished with university starting. All of classes are extremely weed out, fast pace, and this online format is unbearable. I was also forced into honors classes by my advisor and sibling which has led me to feel even worse by losing trust in those I trust most. I am also not very social which doesn't help. Having self-taught philosophy has only led me to question the meaning of life more and incorporate that with my own. I guess I am just looking for help and I know I'm not the only one going through this.
