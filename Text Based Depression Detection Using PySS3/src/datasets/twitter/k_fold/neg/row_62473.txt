If I had a gun Iâ€™d have done it already.When Iâ€™d kill myself, what the reasons are, or how my family will feel about it donâ€™t concern me as much as how Iâ€™d do it. I have already sat in a bathtub with a knife near my wrist, but I wasnâ€™t sure if the blade was sharp enough and if I would actually kill myself. I want to buy a rope and take a chair out to the middle of nowhere and hang myself. Not a day goes by where I donâ€™t want to kill myself, or when I donâ€™t triple-guess my decision to do it. If I had a gun I would already have done it, itâ€™s so easy and you donâ€™t even have to clean up the mess.
