Getting scared for my safety as bad days get worseHi,

I'm a final year student nurse, I failed my final placement due to anxiety and am waiting to resit the placement.

While that is all well and good, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety related to PTSD stenming from an abusive childhood. I was getting psychogenic siezures reaulting in several a&amp;e admissions, and referred to psych after admitting I wanted to die. I was admitted to a psychiactric hospital a week after occupational health cleared me for work. Obviously I had to tell the university which meant my placement was cancelled. 

I was discharged from the psych hopsital, and have been reassessed by occupational health which are waiting for gp and crisis team reports to make sure i'm fit for work. 

I have good days and bad days, but the bad days are getting more numerous and severe, today I nearly took an overdose, but didn't but I know that if this continues I will overdose. Its more the boredom than anything else, feel so isolated and like a failure. 

I spent the day composing a suicide note, and making sure everythings clean and tidy, I just don't want to tell the university as it will just mean more delays. I don't want to die as such I just feel really really hopeless and low and I am scared for tomorrow and the coming days.
