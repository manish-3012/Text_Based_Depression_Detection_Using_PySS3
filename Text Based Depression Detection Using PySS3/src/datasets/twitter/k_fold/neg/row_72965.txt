I'm want to commit suicide and want tell my motherSo a bit of backstory, I'm 14 years old(male). And recently have fallen into a stage of feeling eternally worthless. About an hour ago I just broke down crying for no reason and seriously contemplated committing suicide. The idea of it scares me because I don't want any of my friends or family doing the same and I'm scared of what the afterlife will look like, my ideal view is just living in a small farmhouse in the middle of a farming area near a small town. Soon I will tell my mother and see if I can get any help.
