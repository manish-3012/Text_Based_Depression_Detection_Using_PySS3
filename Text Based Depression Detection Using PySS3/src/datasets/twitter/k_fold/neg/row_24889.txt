Iâ€™ve posted to this suicidewatch several times and never get any comments/support. This can cause people to become more suicidal/depressed, FYI.Iâ€™m very disappointed in this r/suicide watch.
Iâ€™ve posted to it several times and never get any upvotes or any comments. Iâ€™m not the only one though. Others may be on the verge and having no comments or upvotes can make someone feel even worse about themselves because they can feel ignored and not cared about. Come on people!
