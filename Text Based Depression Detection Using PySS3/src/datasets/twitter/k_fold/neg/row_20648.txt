i just can't handle it anymorei'm a failure.
i'm nearly 20 and i have borderline personality disorder along with an assortment of other crap. 
i moved out of my home country with my family thinking it would be fun but doing the same stuff i did back home. i can't leave the house alone because of my anxiety, i have no friends here, i'm broke, no job or school.. i just wallow at home. i'm heavily medicated on prescribed antidepressants and i honesty don't see myself having any sort of successful future. 
i hate living like this so much.. i hate living. everyday i'm fighting with my our brain and i can't do it anymore? i've been talking antidepressants since i was 12 and it's been getting worse and worse, and the dosage getting higher and higher. i don't want to live anymore.. i really don't. 
i can't seek a therapist because i don't speak the language and yeah i could move back but i'm not comfortable being around anywhere that my mom isn't. it feel like i have the mentality of a child and it sucks so much... i'm an adult and yet i can't even leave my mom to start my own life? it's so sad and pathetic? 
i don't want to live like this anymore... i don't even want to live
