My story ended over three years ago... now I'm just here.Three years ago this suicidal depression hit me and I've barely been able to lift it. There was a year, last year, when I made friends through a shared hobby, but it was unsustainable and I fell back into the darkness and isolated myself.

I've driven to a bridge three times just... staring at it... hoping to work up the courage to jump, but I kept returning home. Each time it took so much out of me. I want to try again, but I'm scared of chickening out. I'm stuck, and I can't get better... I don't deserve to get better.

I just wanted to vent. If you read this, thanks.
