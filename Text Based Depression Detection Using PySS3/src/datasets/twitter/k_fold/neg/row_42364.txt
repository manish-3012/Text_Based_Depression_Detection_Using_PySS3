I ruined the best relationship of my life and I don't know how to keep goingI was an asshole, I pushed him too hard and he left me. No amount of apologising is changing his mind. I'm lost, I'm afraid to go to sleep because as soon as I get into bed I just cry because I miss him so much. I'm full of so much regret and I can't see how I'm going to make it through the next fews days. I thought maybe he just needed to cool off, but he's certain he's done with me. And now I'm done with me. I destroyed the only good thing in my life and I can't live with myself anymore
