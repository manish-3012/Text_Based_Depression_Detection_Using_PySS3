Suicide and why I canâ€™t do it (even though I think about it all the time)Like the title says, I think about suicide all the time, ways in which I would do it with as little pain as possible and with no witnesses (Iâ€™ve never want to scar someone) etc but I know that itâ€™s not going to solve anything. Well me in a way cos Iâ€™ll be dead but itâ€™s going to shift the burden onto the people around me. My amazing boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago and if I did it, I wouldnâ€™t want him to think Iâ€™d did it because of the break up. 

I know that itâ€™s not a solution - permanent solution to a temporary problem and whatnot - so I donâ€™t do it. If I knew that no one would be hurt or affected by this, had no family or friends, I would certainly do it. However I know that my suicide would affect some people so I donâ€™t do it and it just leaves me in a weird middle state, in want of better phrasing. 

I suppose a natural reaction to my last paragraph would be â€œfind a hobbyâ€ and so on. Find something to distract yourself. I agree where thatâ€™s coming from but I do have hobbies and I do indulge in things which give me some escape, some comfort but my mind, plagued with so many self loathing and negative thoughts, just wont let me go. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I just feel like I have to exist now.
