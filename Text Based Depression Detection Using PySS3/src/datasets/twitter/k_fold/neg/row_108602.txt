My Views on LifeWhen I see life, I see nothing but a sentence. You may live happy or sad, or die happy or sad. Charles Manson was praised for his heinous lifestyle, but the people he murdered were seen as mere supports for his relentless slaughter. Who can blame me if I want to take the gamble, and see what's behind death?
