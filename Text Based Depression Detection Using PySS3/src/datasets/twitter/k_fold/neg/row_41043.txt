For whenMom and dad I love you. Mom you are the most selfless wonderful person, and I never felt so loved by anyone and when I was a kid I never felt more protected by anyone. Dad I know you tried your best and I fault you for nothing. I hope to see everyone on the other side and I know that all pain is temporary. To my sister and cousins, aunts and uncles, you are all in my heart always.
