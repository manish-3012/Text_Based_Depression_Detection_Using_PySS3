I'm at my breaking point.I really don't know what to do. I've been hiding my depression for over 10 years but its finally starting to crush me. I don't know how to deal with it by myself anymore. I've been having rage filled outbursts at the people I care about most. I posted about all this once before....things have only gone downhill. I keep trying to suppress all of this and push it to the back of my mind but it just won't stay there anymore.....I don't know what's at the root of all this....all I know is these suicidal urges and thoughts just keep getting stronger and stronger...


It keeps me up all night some nights its impossible to sleep. I fucking hate everyone and everything....it feels like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders and its crushing me to death. I physically and emotionally don't know how much longer I can go on.


Help me.
