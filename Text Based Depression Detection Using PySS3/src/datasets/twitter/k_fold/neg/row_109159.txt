Fucked up royally an considering ending it all...As a note this is a throw-away account...

Earlier this morning (around 12am) while at work i learn from my SO that i have been royally fucking up... (the reasons ive deemed private an do not wish to indulge sorry)

An while trying to accept it ive been fighting a lot of voices in my head... loudest one being to jump off the top floor of my work place....

So far the thoughts have been gut wrenching but that feeling has slowly be fadding...im.hoping to make ot another 2hrs (from time of this post; 4am) to be able to clock out an go home...

I have a long ass message prepared for my SO to just end things woth our relationship only... an a more "goodbye" note on my laptop....

To be honest i want to get help an to do better by my SO but attempts in the past have failed an i dont hold much hope...

As it stands im at a cross road with three directions....
1. End my life...
2. End my relationship...
3. Do better an work harder...

Path 3 is what i want but i dont know if i can actually walk it...

Sorry im so usless....
