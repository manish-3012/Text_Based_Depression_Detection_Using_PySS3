I wake up ready to cry when I realize Iâ€™m still stuck in this shitty world.Iâ€™m nothing if not worthless, but mornings are the worst for me in terms of mood. I cry almost every morning, realizing Iâ€™m still here in a world that is crumbling around me. Whatâ€™s the point of having hope for the future when you know deep down that the future is harder to face than even my past. Iâ€™m a failure at everything, saturated with anxiety and fear. I sometimes force myself to hold on, but it feels like there isnâ€™t anything else to hold on to. If I could get passed survival instincts, Iâ€™d be dead right now. I wish I could get it over with that easily.
