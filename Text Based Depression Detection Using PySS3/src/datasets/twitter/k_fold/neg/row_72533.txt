A titleI feel worthless. I have no discernible live directions or goals, my family hates me, I have no money and I have 2 shitty paying jobs. My mother tried to kick me out the other day. I have barely left my room since. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do. Iâ€™ve been laying in bed wishing I could end it all but deep down I know I could never do it because Iâ€™m spineless and I always have been. I feel broken and that I can never be repaired. Iâ€™m lazy and I canâ€™t do anything right. I always fuck everything up. Iâ€™m disgusting. I just want this all to end. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this every day and pretending everything is fine. Iâ€™m tired of being the happy-go-lucky friend because thatâ€™s not who I truly am. I despise myself. Do these feelings of anxiety and worthlessness go away because I feel like itâ€™s just a never ending cycle that I wonâ€™t ever be able to break away from. I just want it all to go away.
