I feel like the good part of me already diedHey, guys. 

Iâ€™m so scared of myself lately. To make a long story short, I was recently in a relationship. My first serious one, actually. It ended when my ex got blackout drunk and beat me. I was left with a concussion, black eye, bite marks, bruises on my sides and arms, and a split lip. I was also choked. There had never been any physical abuse prior and nothing (that I can pinpoint) set it off. He had been under a lot of stress at work, but thatâ€™s it. It was St. Patrickâ€™s Day and he got really, really drunk (not unusual) and when we got back and were going to bed, it happened. 

I have only told one family member since. I havenâ€™t felt the same since the day it happened. I donâ€™t know if I will ever trust anybody again. Iâ€™ve never been physically hurt so badly in my life. I keep wishing he had actually just killed me. I canâ€™t be happy anymore, I cant do anything. Somehow I managed to finish out the semester and now Iâ€™ve graduated undergrad, but I wasnâ€™t even happy about that. I want to be excited to look for a job and get my life started but I want to die so, so badly. 

The past 2 months have been so hard. Every time I get in the car I want to just floor it into a tree. My family would be devastated but Iâ€™m not the same anymore anyway, and theyâ€™ve noticed. My mother in particular, who just thinks Iâ€™m a frigid bitch now because I donâ€™t talk, I donâ€™t smile, nothing. The best parts of me are gone and I donâ€™t even recognize myself anymore. I feel like I died the night he attacked me, the good parts of me, anyway. Whatâ€™s left is so empty. Every day I promise myself Iâ€™ll do it, and Iâ€™m so afraid Iâ€™m actually going to. I have notes written explaining what happened and why for my family when I do. Iâ€™m honestly just waiting to muster up the courage.
