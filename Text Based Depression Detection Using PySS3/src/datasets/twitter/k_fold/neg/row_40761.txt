Been trying to keep my chin up, but these thoughts of suicide are hurting me.For the past two days, I have been dealing with thoughts of suicide. I have been searching for decent job for the past 2 months. I'm currently working part time and it feels a bit dead end. I have had 3 interviews for the past 2 months, one of which canceled on me because "they can't train anyone in quickbooks". Prior to that, I had to pass up on a job offer that paid $13hr because I though about how travel would be a bit of a nightmare (moving a bit further up north, job has no parking, evening shift 3-11pm with 2 overnight shifts back to back). I'm trying to fight these feelings off, but it's a bit hard. Mid 20's that still lives with parents (even though we love each other and I *do* help out around the house and pay my bills, taxes, car loan &amp; insurance). It. Fucking. Hurts. I'm not super religious, but I wish my guardian angel was physically real so that way I won't feel so alone. I am afraid to tell my parents. I've told them that I was having thoughts of suicide and they started to cry. Especially my dad. My dad actually saw the aftermath of suicide death at his job and he started crying. I'm fighting really hard. I wish I could have applied myself a little bit more. I have been job hunting and I recently been using linked in. I see my former classmates as top tier workers and I try my best not to compare myself, but I feel like at times like a piece of shit. Like all I have going for me is a big heart, earnest nature and nerdy yet friendly demeanor. I have not met a nice girl that isn't a religious bible thumper or overly polical activist. I was thinking about jumping from a bridge but didn't act on it. Part of me wants to die and yet, part of me wants to live. I just want it to stop for Christ sake.
