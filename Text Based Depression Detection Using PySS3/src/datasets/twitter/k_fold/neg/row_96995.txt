I don't know what to do anymore.Suicide feels like my only solution at this point, as it has for years and I feel like I should have just done it when I started feeling this way as a teenager. Things don't get better, not truly. 

I reached out to my husband and our couples counselor and told them both I was feeling this way. I told them both of my plan. I thought maybe they would help me, maybe I could try one last time to be helped, though it has never done anything before. 

They both seemed to care in the moment but it hasn't been brought up by either since. I think they just don't care, they forgot. I don't think anyone really cares, and I don't think anyone really will care once I go through with it. 

Right now, the pain I'm feeling is of being alive still, and trying to figure out the best way to achieve this. It's not an easy task, it's hard to get your hands on the materials needed for the most surefire and painless ways to exit. I don't want to botch it this time. 

They say suicide is never the answer, and to reach out if you're feeling that way. Well, I have reached out, and it didn't make a difference. I was stupid for thinking it might. Suicide is the answer, for me. It always has been, and I've always kind of known that. I have a quicker method that is accessible to me now, but if it doesn't work and I don't die right away it will be very painful and could leave me with permanent damage, and I wouldn't be able to try again. But, it's the method my husband has mentioned to me before and he's pretty smart so maybe I should just give it a go.
