I want to kill myself so badly everyone keeps insulting me no moreI cannot take it anymore. I can't take getting insulted another minute. Dumb ass, loser, lazy, weak. I don't want to live anymore, because I just keep getting reminded what a worthless sack of shit that no one cares about. I am done, no reason to prolong it anymore. I've reached my breaking point nothing ever goes goes right. I was a mistake and now I'm going to fix it.
