so tired of everythingi dont want to do anything anymore. ive got no work ethic and nothing to really care about. have no clue what to even care about or even do. i just want to do nothing and have no worries. so much to ask for but i know im not gonna do jack about it. everything is boring and monotonous. it all just leads to me overthinking. i just want to do nothing and think about nothing . i want to be nothing but i want to be something for someone.  hard to put into words. music is all ive got in this life. all my relationships with anyone feel meaningless. i dont even think anybody even really knows me. im so sick of this pointless shit. wish i could voice this out with someone who actually cared, but im stuck doing it online anonymously. srrsly fuck this existence
