Can't imagine a future and once again I've started thinking of ways to easily kill myself, not there yet though, so no worriesFeeling like I'm a huge burden on everyone is just such an amazing thing, currently made it halfway through school and can't motivate myself to keep going. In a queue to hopefully get diagnosed with ADD, the waiting is getting to me, currently it's been 4+ months I think, but I'm afraid I'm gonna fail school before I can even get help.

Broke up with my girlfriend because I'm just a huge mess and really wasn't good for her, I'm pretty fed up with life in general. I really don't want to die, but I hate feeling like such a waste of potential and a huge burden on everyone I know.

Would be awesome if I just passed away in my sleep, because if I fail school again I'll be wasting away my parents' money and that is something I definitely don't want to do. I wish I had more energy, but I'm feeling so depressed right now, nothing is fun for longer than 10-30 mins, if that. I have close to zero energy most of the time.

Taking medication for generalized anxiety disorder atm and despite what this post may make it seem like, it has actually helped me a lot. Thinking about calling my psychologist about trying out some other medication, but I also want to wait until I know if I suffer from ADD, because that would decrease my anxiety by a huge amount. My biggest wish right now is that I actually dared to die, but I don't, I'm not there yet. I'm very slowly getting there, but I won't die in the next 6 months, maybe if I completely fail at school though :)

I'm sorry that I'm burdening you all with this, I just had to get this off my chest. I'm not sure what to do. Not sure why I'm rambling like this either, I mean, the text isn't exactly coherent. Meh, have a good day, I'll be fine someday :)
