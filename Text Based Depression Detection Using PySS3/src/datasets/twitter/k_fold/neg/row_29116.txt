Gimme one good reasonIt honestly makes me laugh when people give reasons to not kill yourself. Think about your friends and family - umm Iâ€™ll be dead I wonâ€™t feel guilt. Youâ€™re life can turn around if you die it canâ€™t - well first itâ€™s been proven time and again to not turn around and two, it doesnâ€™t matter if it could have coz Iâ€™ll be dead. You are not alone - okay well sucks for them too. I think people use these cliches and empty platitudes to make themselves feel better, family and friends who donâ€™t want you to do it are operating out of a place of emotional self-preservation. Not their fault, just find it funny sometimes, like calling helplines is honestly a joke, I just end up arguing with them. Anyway, was curious if anyone had heard reason that actually made them think and werenâ€™t inconsistent?
