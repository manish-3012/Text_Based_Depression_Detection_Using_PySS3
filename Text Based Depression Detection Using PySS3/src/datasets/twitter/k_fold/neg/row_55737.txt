The Only Good ThingThe only good thing regarding my last post is Iâ€™m not afraid of my biggest fear (airplane n heights), I could care less if we fell out of the sky and crashed. I would just sit there calmly and maybe with a small smile on my face as the plane went down. I drive around a bit sometimes, I used to watch out for Drunk Drivers who fly through the roads and red lights. Now I could care less if I get hit by a drunk driver and it ends me. At the same time as much as I want all that, I want to keep fighting and not die, just for that small chance we end up back together.
