Feeling LostIâ€™m 22 and from the outside looking in I feel like I live a good life. I have a supportive family, loving girlfriend, Iâ€™m in university, etc. However, I always seem to not feel happy. I still laugh and smile at things, but every time I am alone in my thoughts I feel ready to end it all. I just donâ€™t know why I feel like this or what to do.

Iâ€™m nervous to talk with anyone irl because I donâ€™t want to be a burden or make people worry about me. I have mentioned it before to friends when Iâ€™ve been really drunk, but they donâ€™t think Iâ€™m telling them my real feelings because Iâ€™m usually not expressing them outwardly. 

If anyone has any suggestions or thoughts I would be very grateful. This past year one of my very good friends killed himself and I canâ€™t get that out of my head. I donâ€™t know if experiencing that made me have these thoughts more or something.
