I want to be diagnosed so badItâ€™s fucking over.
Itâ€™s fucking over.
Itâ€™s fucking iver.

just want this to be over and be normal. Idk what it could be but Iâ€™ve speculated so many things. Ocd, bipolar, BPD, cyclothemia etc etc

Iâ€™m DONE. My counsellor doesnâ€™t FUCKING listen. My mom doesnâ€™t FUCKING listen. Itâ€™s always â€œnegative thinkingâ€. â€œUr just negativeâ€. â€œMaybe u need discipline and a good routine.â€ 

Please just stop.

Since high school started Iâ€™ve thought of suicide and feltlike life was too much. But since the corona time... Life has been hell. I had my first (what I suspect) OCD episode and I experienced the worst fear Iâ€™ve ever experienced and since then I have not only been scared, but also angry, overly emotional, out of line and SEVERELY suicidal. 
My intense feelings are caused by triggers and they are so unpredictable. Iâ€™ve been so toxic to people that had a right to leave me. I have temper tantrums where I throw and break stuff... but then I have these obsessions that make me REALLY scared (POCD amongst others). 

What got me here is that I walked towards a lake to drown myself and burned myself today because my fwb didnâ€™t have sex w me this weekend. This is not an odd event. These weird feelings and triggers happen ALL the time. The other day I went to the beach and the boy I had a crush on said he had a gf and when I got home I counted out pills for an overdose. Other times I feel numb, and empty and then some times I have half a god complex and get hyperfixation on myself and things in life.

I NEED to make it through the night 5 more hours to call my uniâ€™s psych office and if I donâ€™t I will be damned. I JUST want to get medicated and have this HELLL. Be OVER with. Forever.
