I don't want to write a note, but I want to talk with somebody. I don't want to go out all by myself.I don't know, maybe deep deep down I'm lonely and I really do want help. I don't know how to ask for help. As long as I can remember I've been completely non verbal about my problems, like I literally can't speak truthfully about it in real life, because I was so afraid of it being used to hurt me in some way.

I feel very determined to die at this point, and I have a plan that I've practiced, but I don't want to be alone when I decide to carry out my plan. I know I can't write a note, but I do want to talk to somebody. It's just too hard to say anything to somebody who can see me and act upon me or who has met me.
