Does anyone write out their note, knowing they wonâ€™t go through with it, as a form of catharsis/therapy?Iâ€™ve been very depressed and suicidal lately, and Iâ€™ve thought about doing this very thing without the immediate intention to commit, thinking it could be cathartic, but the thought of it even them still...just really scares me. I feel like I wouldnâ€™t wanna just get rid of it afterwards, that Iâ€™d want to read it again at a later date and reflect on how I was feeling, but Iâ€™m scared someone would somehow find them and misunderstand, and react much harder than Iâ€™d want them to. Iâ€™m in something of a moment of clarity right now and genuine curiosity, mostly just cuz Iâ€™m high at my shitty overnight job, the only time I find relative peace, even if I just wanna be asleep.
