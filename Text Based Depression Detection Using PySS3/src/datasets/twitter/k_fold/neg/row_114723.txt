One week has passed and nothing has changedI can't believe one class could make my life a living hell. I feel so fucking miserable and pathetic. I know it is stupid as hell to feel suicidal over school, it is just school it doesn't matter that much. I am getting good grades in everything but that class. There is literally no need to panic. I know this but I can't get rid of those anxious thoughts. Even though literally all the other students are stressed they seem to be able to pull through so why can't I? Why does my brain have to make such a big deal, I have no reason to be so upset but I am.

 I tried to talk to a counselor today but she mostly just asked questions about me since it was a first session. I only briefly talked about the issues with this class because of this and now I have to wait another week to talk to someone.

She wanted to know about my suicidal thoughts and depression but not the main stressor in my life right now which is that class. I lied and said I had not any thoughts of suicide recently. 

I wanted to talk to someone about it but nobody wants to listen to me. I don't expect anyone to put a lot of time for me but nobody seems to care that I am on the edge of some sort of mental breakdown. I felt like even my counselor wasn't taking me seriously. I tried to talk to a hotline before and they only seemed to care if I was in immediate danger. I feel like I can't talk to anyone unless I am about to off myself then and there.

The only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fact that I might be able to get out of this school and get away. My friend offered me a place to stay for as long as I need and to help me get on my feet. I just feel like he doesn't want to hear me talk about my issues which is fair I just feel so alone.
