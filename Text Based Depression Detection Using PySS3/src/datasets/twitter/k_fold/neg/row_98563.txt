Many failed attempts, many ignored posts, even friends left meJust look at my history.
Everyone ignores me.
My friends left me because no one wants to be near a suicidal girl.

Attempting is tiring. Costed my parents so much money at the hospitals. I need to succeed next time.

I'm empty and useless. Made a throwaway to vent and got downvoted, bashed and attacked to hell. If people really knew me they would wish I was dead.

I'm done with this world. No dreams, no wishes, nothing, only regrets and traumas will be left.

Everytime I dream of a rope or a belt against my neck, I want to feel the pain, I deserve it, I want to feel I'm finally dying, granting myself this luxury dream.

In the end I couldn't make use of the perfect life my parents gave me. I'm a failure.
