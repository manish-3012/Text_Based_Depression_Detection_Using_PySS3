The feeling is unbearableI don't know what to do, I have this feeling of unrest in my chest that keeps getting worse everyday.

I've always hated my life, I don't have any close friends, I mean I know a lot of people but I'm not in contact with any them, I've had suicidal thoughts for quite some time now but I didn't believe I would actually go throught with it.

But lately my life has gone downhill to a point where I don't think I can handle it anymore. It seems impossible to find a job, got scammed out of the only opportunity I had to earn some money and was left with nothing, my country's going through an economical crisis and I see no other way out of this.

I can't stand this feeling in my chest, I want to cry but I don't, I always shut myself off. 

I just needed to tell someone about this.
