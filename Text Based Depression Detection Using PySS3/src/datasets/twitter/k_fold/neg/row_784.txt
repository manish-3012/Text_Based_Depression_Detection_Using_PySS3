I'm losing my sanity. Relativity is killing me.I figured I need to say something about this... For my sake that is. I'm beginning to lose reality on a weekly basis again. I used to lose it for months at a time in a big swing but now its more frequent. I'm beating myself up constantly and purposefully forgetting to eat so I get that much weaker every day in hopes that I die soon. 

Wow. saying that to you strangers is humbling for myself to know that I'm really getting down that low. I'm about 85% certain I'm going to die by suicide in my life. The question is when. How soon. A month, a year?, an Hour?. Knowing that I'm preparing to die is oddly somewhat comforting... cause it numbs the pain. 

AM I pLANNING my death for a areason!? Am I just trying to get people to know that I'm not okk?? I'm just so lonely all the time but I'm petrified to tell anyone that my brain is decaying as if it's already DEAD. Am I just trying to escape a future that I don't want to write and fill with memories because I'm too afraid to get hurt again and take out the pain on myself like I always have. I really don't want to post. I don't want to read reply's but I don't want to not be honest with myself. Dammit I just wanna f'in die... don't feel a need to respond. I don't need sympathy. I need empathy.
