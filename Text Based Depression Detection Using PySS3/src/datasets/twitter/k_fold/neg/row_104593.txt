My life isnâ€™t ever going to get better.. is it?And all Iâ€™m asking for is no abuse. Thatâ€™s all. It isnâ€™t much is it. Something so simple. Just no abuse. Iâ€™d take verbal over physical. Physical and verbal together hurts too much. I hate living I just canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t. I havenâ€™t eaten or drank anything in almost a day because Iâ€™m scared to leave my room. Iâ€™m not a child so no ones going to care as much. My mother always said if I ever told anyone about the abuse Iâ€™m going through, sheâ€™d use my mental health as a way to make me seem crazy. Iâ€™m stuck here. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m stuck here and it hurts and Iâ€™ve been staying strong all day, but after upsetting the only person that loves me unconditionally? I just want to die. Iâ€™m letting it all out. I just want to die. Yet. I have no way of doing it. Iâ€™ve tried swallowing my anxiety pills so many times, yet nothing. Nothing is working. God I wish I was strong enough to stab myself. Physically and mentally. But Iâ€™m not. Just a weak little girl with a plethora of mental issues. And no way out of this hell. I hate myself. God I wish my mother did kill me when she had the chance. I wish sheâ€™d kill me now.
