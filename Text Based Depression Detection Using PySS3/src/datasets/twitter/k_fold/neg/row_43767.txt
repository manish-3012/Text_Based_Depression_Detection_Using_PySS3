April 18thThis is my first reddit post and I'm on mobile. I apologize if this is messed up.

Wife of ten years wants a divorce. Started the morning like every other day. Affection throughout the day. His and kisses. That night she wants a divorce and says she hasn't been in love with me for years. Our marriage had been tough. I'm not easy to love. I told her I'll support her but asked her to not rush. For our kids sake. She agreed. I told her I need get to communicate with me to help me transition. She agreed. I left the house at her request. She has 180'd. At first she thought we could fix or marriage. 24 hours later she wants me gone. She says we can talk. 24 hours later she wants me to fall off the face of the earth. I'm losing my wife and my kids. She won't let me see them. I haven't eaten in a week. I'm going to kill myself.
