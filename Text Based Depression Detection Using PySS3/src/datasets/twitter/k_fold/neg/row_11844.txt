Today was supposed to be the day.This morning I called out work and drove 5 hours away from my home. From my life. At least this way no one I know would be the one to find me.

I sat in my car in a paddock in the middle of nowhere for a couple hours, spiralling further in to my thoughts. Iâ€™d made up my mind.

By happenstance a car happened to drive past. The driver approached just to make sure I was okay. Innocuous. Unremarkable. But because of that I am here. I donâ€™t know whether itâ€™s because it spooked me that I might be found too early. Or if it was just enough of a circuit breaker to delay the inevitable.

Iâ€™m home now, and I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be here again. Itâ€™s disconcerting. The thoughts havenâ€™t stopped. I just need to make it through the night.
