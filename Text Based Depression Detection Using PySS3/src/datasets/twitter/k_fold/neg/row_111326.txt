Iâ€™m alone and I have already planned my suicide, I just needed a little push to end it all, today I got it.I lost all my friends and people I could trust throughout last year and last mouth. I was only left with 2 people that I THOUGHT I could trust. I realized that I couldnâ€™t trust one of my 2 left friend when he told some people about my problems, not hoping to help me, but to make fun of me. Today, my last friend told me that we shouldnâ€™t talk to each other anymore, because I was disturbing her life and being bad for her. I agree...
Now Iâ€™m left alone only with those voices in my head telling me to do it... 
Certainly I will...
