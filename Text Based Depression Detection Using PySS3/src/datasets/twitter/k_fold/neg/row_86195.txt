I can't live this life any moreI recently got a diagnosis of PTSD after being raped multiple times over 20 years ago.  Stupidly, I went on to marry my rapist and have three kids with him.  We separated two years ago and I've been in therapy most of the time since.  

I'm in such a bad place at the moment that I can't cope with the idea of even sharing the same planet with him, never mind living in the same town and having to say nothing when my adult kids go to visit him.  They, and everyone else it seems, think he's a great guy who has lost so much due to his marriage breakdown.

I hate that nobody knows what he did, I hate that everybody thinks he's a great guy, I hate that he gets to move on with his life while I can't escape the pain,  I don't want to live this life any more...... the pain never ends
