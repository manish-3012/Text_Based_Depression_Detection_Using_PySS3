Hitting a rough patch, scared of recurring thoughtsI am in my 20s and going through a divorce. I had kind of a rough childhood, and I think I made a dumb decision in getting married as a shortcut to independence from my parents. 

I am under-employed and finishing my degree online. I am scared because our lease is up in a month and a half, and if I don't get this job I'm interviewing for on Tuesday, I am basically homeless. Even if I do get the job, which provides housing, I'd have to find a place to live for two months. I've lived in my car for short stretches before, but never that long. I feel like shit for not having a decent (or even just steady) job, and not having any kind of useful work experience. My social anxiety is affecting my job performance in my current position, but I honestly don't think it would make a huge impact if I lost that ~$200/mo.

I keep having invasive thoughts about suicide. I don't want to die, exactly, but I feel like I've fucked up any chances I've had. I studied the wrong thing in school, I didn't finish any of the projects I started when I was younger, and now I'm getting marriage wrong, too. I had an attempt when I was in middle school, and it makes me nervous that I feel very much the same way- like, I don't want it, but it beats the hell out of where I'm at now.

 I feel like I'm broken down to very basic functions to keep myself from dwelling on these thoughts, but it's exhausting. What I could really use right now is advice on ways to preoccupy my mind until the worst of the thoughts pass, and how to block out the anxiety/guilt of not doing things like homework or looking for a new job. Or just, like, encouragement, especially from anyone who's been through a divorce right out of the gate. Even just typing this out is a load off my mind.

Sorry for the rambliness. Thank you for reading this far.
