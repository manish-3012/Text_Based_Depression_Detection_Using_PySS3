I'm almost readyToday I bought some really heavy duty razor blades. I keep fantasizing about slitting my wrists(vertically of course) and dying in the bath. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm 14 and recently had to take sometime off high school (I was sexually abused when I was little and it kind of just re-surfaced) I also suffer from terrible depression and anxiety. I feel like everything's falling apart in my head. My cognitive ability and psyche is crumbling. I know that it would kill my parents and everyone around me but I feel so sick when I think about living. I just want it to end, for my consciousness to dissapear at least in anyway that matters in this world. Something is wrong with me and I can't stop it.
