My willpower feels like it's being drainedHi, this isn't the first time I've posted on here. I've sat here deleted and rewritten everything a couple times now. I'm 19 now and am going to college to be a radiology technician. (I recently switched majors from IT) It has been 6 months since I was dumped and that has really been the trigger to how I feel at the moment. I have no real close friends left and my social anxiety has gotten worse, making it very difficult to express how I feel to my family. I attempted to take my life back in September, but ultimately decided I couldn't do it because the thought of my parents and brothers finding me terrifies me. But now I'm starting to feel less and less okay about the idea of living. I really cannot find a purpose to keep on if I'm going to remain unhappy forever. I can't find a point to slogging on through school, work, and life in general. I've been told change something, I just wish I knew what I needed to change. I'm too afraid to tell my parents the way I feel. I just feel so stuck and unmotivated to even help myself. It's pure laziness and I shouldn't even feel this way because I had a good childhood, plenty of friends, and a loving family. I just want to know what the fuck is wrong with me.
