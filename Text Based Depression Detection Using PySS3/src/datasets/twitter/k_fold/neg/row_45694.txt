When you feel like you can't do it anymore I have had attempts in the past but obviously survived. I tired to take a group and did so for 26 weeks. But here I am sitting on a park bench thinking about how I would like to end my life. Is there just straight up life situations in which you can't survive. 
I spent my entire first 19years being abused. I escaped and tried to make a new life. Turns out it doesn't quite work like that. 
I met someone I thought was safe which obviously doesn't take away the other mental health stuff but helps but it turns out they are angry and aggressive and don't understand this stuff and use it against me to make me feel even more worthless. 
I have no friends who reach out or who i can reach out to at all times (welcome to being 26). I never graduated University. I have a shit job illegal job I hate that provides a shit apartment for me and my abusive bf. I am drowning in debt I can't pay back. I can't crawl back home. I have no hope of change. I am more afraid of fucking up a suicide attempt and making things worse for myself than succeeding. 
I think I'm just done. The razor at home is calling for me
