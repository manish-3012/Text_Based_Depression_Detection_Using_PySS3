A brother's viewHello reddit...
I want to talk about my view of suicide, the ways suicide attempts has hurt me and how much of a struggle it is to be a closest relative in these situations.
I am 22 years old today. I am studying in a city of Denmark, about 150 kilometers/95 miles from where my family lives. When I was almost 4 years old, my father killed himself. My mom had been in a fight with him, he had pushed her and she took me and my sister away to live at my grandparents place. 3 days after with no communication, my father was found in his car, he had killed himself with Carbon monoxide(Exhaustion connected to back window of car).
My mother, already having been through a crappy childhood, could not handle the guilt she felt, and subconsciously created an alternative reality in which other people who were following us were to blame for every bad thing happening.
She also started hearing voices that wasn't there, physically at least and she had one suicide attempt when I was 6 years old.

Here I am today, my sister has developed hebephrenic schizophrenia in the age of 19. She struggles with voices all day, she is medicated in every single way she can be. But nothing can take away her cravings for death. Her suicide attempts are getting worse and more frequent. It is starting to take a big toll on me in my every day doings. I feel fear, pain and anxiety of losing, not only in this matter, but also in every other close relationship of my life.

I want to share with you, what I have told her this weekend. If you are struggling with thoughts of suicide I would love to know what you would want your closest to tell you/do for you.

"Hi littlesis.
I am sorry if you think, that I only feel sad for it. I am constantly feeling anxiety and fear of losing you. I feel guilt when you try to take your own life. I also become depressed and tired of living. My feeling of anxiety and fear of losing you is hurting other people, and it also wakes up feelings of our fathers stupid way of ending his own life. It gives me anxiety that mom will die. That my nearest friends will die, which means I never let anyone too close to me. I am afraid and angst of losing girlfriends, which makes me jealous and depressed, and hard for another person to be with. I hope you understand how much you mean to me, how much fear I have of losing you; at the same time I also hope you understand how happy I am to have you in my life, and that I would never trade you for any other littlesister in the world. As afraid and depressed as your actions can make me, at least as comfortable and happy I can be made from your actions. I really hope you understand the magnitude of the consequences of your actions, not just to those close to you, but also the consquences to yourself. I hope you will feel better Littlesis. One thousand hugs - I love you so much, big brother."

TL;DR Father commited suicide. Sister suicidal. What would you want your closest relative to tell you in your situation?
