I give up...I have always lived for others. I could never see myself living in any other way because doing things because it's best for me only makes me feel bad and unhappy. Even my own mom used me as a shield to take my dads yelling and physical violence.
But after years and years of being hurt because of this the only options that is left is for me to change because the trait of wanting to do things for others is unwanted by others, especially because I'm a man. If being a human means thinking about myself first before others I'd rather die.

I don't care what others say. How stupid I sound. I've had enough of that already with people saying i act like an annoying brat and/or I'm only doing this out of selfish reasons. I've never wanted anything from others in return except being treated as a human and not some trash you can throw away.
I have already tried to kill myself several times and I'm probably going to finish the job soon.
There is a lot more to my life than that but people don't care about me and the only reason I write this is because I want to express my frustration about people not ever being thankful towards those who care and do not ask for anything in return.

Sorry for taking up time from whoever read this. If people want to tell me their lies about how they care about me (A person they have never met) go ahead, but I'm probably going to be dead by then anyway.
