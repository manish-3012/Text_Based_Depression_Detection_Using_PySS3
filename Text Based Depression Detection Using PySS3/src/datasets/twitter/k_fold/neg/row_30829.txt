Idk what to doI've been catholic for a long time but idk if i believe any of that any more i guess i'm just too afraid of what hell is supposed to be like if i do it tonight but overtime i have started to think that hell might be better than the lonely and isolated feeling i have i guess i relied to much on the hope of what i believed in that now since i don't believe in it i have nothing

i'm not trying to spread my belief just trying to give context
