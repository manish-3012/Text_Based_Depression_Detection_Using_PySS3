Need advice on how to help husband who is suicidal.Ive been with him for 13 years, hes always had issues with depression, but the last couple years have been really hard, he feels like he cant be himself because my family would disapprove ( he has really dark humor and can be extremely negative at times ) we live with my mother and due to living on the west coast, we cant afford to move out so he also feels trapped here. We have 3 kids also. I try to help in any way i can, but its hard for me because I also have responsibilities in making sure my kids are okay, so im not able to sit with him for as long as he needs me to. He told me today that i dont love him, that i dont help him, that all i do is tell him he does nothing to help me. Im afraid to say anything about how i feel, because he takes it as a personal attack, im just overwhelmed with taking care of my children, working late, doing chores, and being an introvert, not being able to rest and recharge. I also have a problem communicating with him, and when he states how he feels about issues, which are legitimate, i tend to shut down and take it personally as well, because I feel like im doing so much already with just trying to manage the household. He tied up a noose today, and when i said i was gonna call 911, he threatened to cut his throat. Thankfully he laid down and fell asleep. I have no idea what to do, or how i can be there more for him, any advice would be greatly appreciated.
