Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m very sorry I cut myself again. After I promised my parents I wouldnâ€™t. 

Iâ€™ve been cutting with a pair of scissors after my parents and I agreed to hide the razors and sharp knives Iâ€™ve cut with before. Iâ€™m sorry 

Iâ€™ve felt like self harming more after all the blades have been hidden. And I tried to cut open a vein when I cut myself, But I was scared. 

Iâ€™m sorry
