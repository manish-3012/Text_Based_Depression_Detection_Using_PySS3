Honestly, I'm on the fence here.There might be a way. There might be a chance for me to overcome my mental illness and move on with my life. But I don't think there's really a point. I mean even if I go on. I'll always be alone. I know that because no one person can listen to me and stay. I wish I knew the future so that this would be an easier decision. The one thing that I think I could live for is love. I want to meet someone who can not heal me, but love me so that I can heal myself and eventually be happy. I've wanted that my entire life. I don't think it's possible though. Cause everyone always hurts me. Just once though, I was the problem. I regret ever meeting her. She could've probably lived a better life without me. I'm mostly rambling here. I just wish the loneliness would stop. I'm just exhausted from life at this point.
