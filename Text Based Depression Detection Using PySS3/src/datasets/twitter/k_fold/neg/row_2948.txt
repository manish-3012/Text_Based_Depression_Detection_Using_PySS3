god itâ€™s hard to get betteriâ€™ve been in PHP for one exactly one week and god iâ€™ve been trying so fucking hard. like why do i feel like the only one in the world that canâ€™t even do their day to day? this week iâ€™ve been working rly fucking hard on my sleep schedule and no one cares or notices a difference but me. like god why try so hard if no one even cares. my dad yelled at me tonight bc of how expensive treatment is, he said i want worth the money. that sucked a lot. and i got through the whole night without a panic attack and without cutting which is HUGE for me. one day at a time i know but each day is like a full on war then it cools down when i go to bed and then it starts all over the next morning. literally the people in my PHP group care more about me than anyone in my biological family, whatâ€™s up with that? i just feel silenced and hated and unloved........ thx for reading
