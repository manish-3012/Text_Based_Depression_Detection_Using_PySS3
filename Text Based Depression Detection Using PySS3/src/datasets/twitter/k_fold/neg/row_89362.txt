why do people see suicide as a bad thinglike you'd put a dog down if it was ill. why is it not acceptable to do the same to humans? hell, just let them do it themselves? why do people aggressively want humans to live but don't bat an eye when an animal has to be put down? depression is a fucking disease, so why can't i be put down like we'd do to an animal if it had a disease? what's with the double standard?
