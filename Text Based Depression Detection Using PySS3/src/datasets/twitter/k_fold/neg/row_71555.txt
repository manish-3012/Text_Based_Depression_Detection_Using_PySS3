I don't want to hurt my family.Apart from not having access to a firearm, I don't want to hurt my family. Especially not my mom. That is the only thing keeping me alive is thinking about the pain they will go through if I die fucking hurts so much. Even if I think they're much better without me or if they hate me, I just don't want to hurt them like that. It makes me so sad.
