Close Minded ParentsI've been fine for the past week or so, but now I started thinking about how my parents would react if I told them that I was suicidal. And I think what I'd get is probably either "its just in your mind." or a long speech about how I'm doing it for attention and drama, and that I'm sick. And I don't know if I can handle that on top of all the other things that I'm going though, like how my mother still can't accept me as a gay person, and has asked me why I was trying to be so different from other people, that it was only because of puberty, and has offered to take me to a doctor, for being gay. I tried to explain how sexuality works and that it's not my choice but she refused to understand. 2 years after my coming out my friends also unintentionally told her that I was gay, and we had the same exact conversation we had 2 years ago. It just makes me sick knowing that my mother is extremely close minded and makes me not want to tell her(and my dad) about my thoughts. I don't trust them any more and I don't know what to do. It just makes me want to die even more.
