Thank-you everyoneHi. Just want to say thank-you to everyone before I leave. So many of you have helped me through these past few dark months. 

I'm sorry I couldn't help more of you. I tried. I tried very hard to comment or help or listen or at the very least upvote.

Just a few more hours and I will be able to do it. I feel so at peace. For once in a very long time. I feel peace.
