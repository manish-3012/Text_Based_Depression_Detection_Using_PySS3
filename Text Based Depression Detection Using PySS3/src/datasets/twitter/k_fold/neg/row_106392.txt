XReally thinking about it. Iâ€™m probably just moody because I went on a diet and i donâ€™t have food in me. I just want it to end though. Iâ€™ve been this way for so long, and Iâ€™m still fat, sad, broke, and I feel like at this point Iâ€™m unlovable. Iâ€™m losing what money I have tomorrow to phone companies. I just donâ€™t see the point in trying anymore. Everythingâ€™s out of reach. Iâ€™ll delete this tomorrow.
