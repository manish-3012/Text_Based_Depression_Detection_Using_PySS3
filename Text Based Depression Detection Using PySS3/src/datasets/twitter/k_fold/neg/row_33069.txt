Future plansI am planning on commiting suicide in the next few months. I am not sad all the time. I am on antidepresants, work full time, and see a therapist. Knowing my life will be coming to an end helps me enjoy taking walks, working, eating, my family and sex. I have a gun on layaway, paying a little bit a month to the pawn shop. I plan on either shooting myself in the heart or in the head....call me vain, but I don't want to destroy my face.  I lost my daughter two and a half months ago. She was a pedestrian, having a panic attack, who was struck and left for dead by a drunk driver. Due to my verbal abuse, my daughter suffered from borderline personality disorder. When she started acting out as a teen rather then taking her to counseling I declared her an out of control teen and social services took her for three and a half years. She tried to kill herself many times in foster care...but I finally got her back when she was 18.  I was in Colorado visiting my family for three months. I left my younger daughter working the night shift and without a ride. When she was feeling suicidal this last time instead of coming home I sent her money for a phone. A week later I was on the phone with her when she was hit by a car and died. I had a chance to save her life and I did not. She was only 21. The man who hit her and left her to die in the road is only facing probation to three years in prison as punishment. I have lost my sister, and my brother. I am estranged from my whole family. I just can't bear the guilt I feel for leaving my daughter so many times- and how my irresponsibility led to her death...so after the trial, and after paying off this gun I am planning on leaving this world and joining my daughter..whose life I ruined, and whose death I caused. I am okay with this.
