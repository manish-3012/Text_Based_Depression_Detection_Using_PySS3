Feeling hopeless and depressedFor the first time ever, my life was going really well.  I finally had what I wanted in life.  And then the pandemic started.  I am severely depressed.  I have always been depressed, but my depression has gotten much worse (and continues to get worse) since the pandemic started.  I love combat sports, and I was going to compete nationally this year, but these competitions obviously got cancelled.

I don't think this is ever going to end, and I am really feeling hopeless at the fact that my competitive judo career ended right before I could accomplish my goal.  I don't know what to do
