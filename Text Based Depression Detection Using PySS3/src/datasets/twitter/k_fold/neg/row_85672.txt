[UPDATE] When is enough enough?original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/h2rbx/when_is_enough_enough/)

Things are looking up now. Yes, it was a rough 3-4 days, but the funny thing was, I literally just woke up one day and was completely fine. Mind you, it's finals week.. so I should be MORE stressed out, not less, but somehow.. just chugging along and continuing to DO stuff has helped. I met with my therapist, she's still awesome as ever, and I'm optimistic at least about the next year or so.

So .. thanks to you guys for helping hold me up during my low. Your efforts were not wasted. &lt;3
