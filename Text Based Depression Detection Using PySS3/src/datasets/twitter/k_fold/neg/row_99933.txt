Iâ€™m worried about being hospitalizedI have a doctors today after school, and Iâ€™m going to be talking about my self harm, suicidal thoughts, inability to do anything. Iâ€™m worried if he thinks that Iâ€™m lying about having no intent (which I sort of am), that heâ€™ll hospitalize me. I canâ€™t have that happen, my grades are already slipping, and I have a trip in a week with my schools band that I canâ€™t miss. Can anyone offer advice? It would be much appreciated
