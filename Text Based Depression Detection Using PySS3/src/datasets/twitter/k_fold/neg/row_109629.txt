I dont have anyone to talk toi was diagnosed with a serotonin deficiency at a young age. In and out of doctors and therapists office since i was 5. Ive never been happy and i have nothing to justify it. Im 22 now. The only reason ive lasted this long is because i thought things would get better, but they havent. In fact, theyve only gotten worse. Im gay and i live in a country that hates me. Ill never find love. Ill never have a family. Im not even sure those things would make me happy. I dont know anything. I just dont want to live anymore
