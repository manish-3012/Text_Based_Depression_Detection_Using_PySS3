Curiosity I SupposeJust wondering if anyone feels like me and if they overcame it. I'm not going to bore you with my long sob story, i'll just summarize it. All through middle school/high school I failed every class, somehow graduated high school. 13 Went to jail for missing school and went to mental hospital for suicide attempt. Dealt with poverty/hunger but not anymore, I got through that. Suicide has constantly been on my mind since 13. I've always had big dreams and thought I'd be somewhere when I was older, I'm 20, no job, no money, no college, really bad anxiety when dealing with public so really hard getting an interview. I'm surrounded by negativity 24/7, family members and others saying same thing everyday, "Lazy, loser, get a job" and other remarks constantly. For a couple years now I got to a point where I fantasize about death every night. Death seems like a comfortable thought to me now, I have big dreams that I want to see become a reality but at the same time I have this really odd feeling and I want to know if anyone has felt this. I'm tired....Not just physically but mentally and emotionally. I don't know how else to explain it except, "I'm tired". I'm tired of going day by day, tired of the shit life, i'm mostly tired of my mind rapidly thinking "death, death, death, death", I want to shut my mind off..I'm just tired. What are your thoughts on this? Have you overcame this?
