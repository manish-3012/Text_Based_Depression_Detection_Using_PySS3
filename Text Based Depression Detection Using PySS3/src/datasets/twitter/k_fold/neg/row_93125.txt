Even the fucking text line wouldnâ€™t hear me out.I have fucked up so many things in my life. Primarily in the last year. My wife divorced me because of my drug and alcohol addiction and the lies and manipulation that came with it. I kept drinking and using more and more after she asked for the divorce which lead me to getting 2 DUIs and 3 controlled substance charges within a month of each other. I still kept using until I ran out of money and had no choice but to wake up and see that the mess Iâ€™ve made. 

I donâ€™t want to deal with the consequences of these charges. I donâ€™t give a fuck if it sounds cowardly. I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s going to happen yet but I know that I have hell to pay very soon. I canâ€™t get ahold of either of my lawyers and my next court date is Tuesday. Iâ€™ve prepared everything I can but I have no fucking clue what theyâ€™ve been up to. Iâ€™ve paid for both of them in full and I have no idea whatâ€™s going to happen because they got their money and Iâ€™m still left in the dark. 

Iâ€™m doing step one of the twelve steps of NA and everything is becoming so clear to me. I have fucked up so bad and ruined all of my plans for my life. My education doesnâ€™t mean anything like a background check does. I wanted to be an IT project manager. I canâ€™t even manage my own fucking life. I struggle with bipolar disorder and abusing drugs and alcohol made everything so much worse. I will constantly have to be consciously worrying about my recovery for the rest of my life. My life will revolve around not using drugs no matter what. I donâ€™t want to have to change my people, places, or things and consciously worry about myself anymore. 3 guns in my pathetic tiny and overpriced rented bedroom are calling my name and suicide is making more and more sense. 

I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I canâ€™t take the heartache, the loneliness, the happy nightmares, the confusion, the daily struggle of NOT doing what I know best anymore.
