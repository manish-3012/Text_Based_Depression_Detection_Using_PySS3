My dreams are over. I can't see how my life is going to get better, end of the line for me.I applied for a scholarship to study Biology at a university in Japan and I just got the heart-crushing news that I failed the interview and won't be getting the scholarship. I can't try for it again next year because it has an age limit.

I was really banking on this scholarship. To me, it was a ray of light and it was the only thing I was looking forward to in my life. To have that purpose, and that hope be taken away is beyond gutting.

Now I don't know what to do with my life. I have a degree in interior design from a local university, but I absolutely fucking hated it. I only studied it because of my father's behest, so I just went along with it, and it was too late when I realised that I didn't like it at all. So now the only jobs I can get is as an interior designer, but I'd rather jump off a cliff than have to work as one, and have deal with that again.

I can't study locally again and pursue what I like, because we can't afford it anymore. This was why I really wanted to get that scholarship. I spent months reading up about it and preparing for it, and in the end I get nothing. It was supposed to be my ticket to a new life, the life I was going to be happy to live.

Now I don't even have that.

I don't know how I can go on. I don't want to live the rest of my life at a job I'm going to absolutely dread, and with a failed dream always at the back of my mind. I don't think I'm going to like how my life is going to pan out, and if my failure at the scholarship is any indication of how I'll never be good enough, I don't think I want to live long enough to just experience failure and rejection over and over and over again.

I don't know what to do anymore and I don't want to even think about the future. All my friends are already applying for jobs or have started working, and whenever I see them post about it, I just get more depressed as fuck. 

I just don't want any of this anymore.
