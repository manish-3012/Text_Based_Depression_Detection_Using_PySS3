I think Iâ€™m meant to commit suicide. I think it has always been my path since I was born.I havenâ€™t been on here for awhile. Been actually â€œtryingâ€ to make things better. But, everything keeps falling apart. Iâ€™m pretty sure I have advanced periodontal disease and erosion. Which is crazy, because 4 months ago I had perfect teeth. Now, I have new spaces in my teeth and they arenâ€™t white anymore. I went without insurance for awhile due to being laid off from covid. So, I didnâ€™t have the means to go to a dentist. I think Iâ€™m going blind. I have floaters in my eyes. Again, this didnâ€™t start until Covid. I think I have alopecia and basic hair thinning. Again, didnâ€™t start until covid. I use to be gorgeous and now I feel like a monster. Now, my use to be perfect skin isnâ€™t perfect anymore. It took me years to get clear skin. And, now Iâ€™m breaking out again. All on top of trying to get my life together after covid. I donâ€™t talk to anyone. Iâ€™m too ashamed. So, Iâ€™m always alone. And, getting all these things fixed take money that I donâ€™t have. But, I noticed....everything goes bad now. It must be a sign that Iâ€™m meant to not be here. I just wish I could get the courage to just do it. But, I feel like my sole purpose is to take my own life. And, Iâ€™m okay with that. Iâ€™m just afraid to do it. I donâ€™t like pain. And, I know there isnâ€™t a painless way to die.
