I look so ugly it's making me feel suicidal.As a woman, I have the most abnormal nose you will ever come across. I have been ridiculed by it and laughed at as my nose is so long compared to my small face. 

I'm 23 and have no money for a nose job. I feel anxious getting a job because of my appearance. Even if I do get my nose fixed, I get anxious about getting with men that may not have even liked me before my nose job. And what If I have kids that are born with my nose. 

I know you think I'm kidding but I'm not. It just makes me seriously depressed. All my siblings have small, normal noses. Yet I get landed with a freak show in the middle of my face?! Anyone relate.
