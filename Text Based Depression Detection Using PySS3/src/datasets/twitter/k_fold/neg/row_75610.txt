I am undecided whether to wait for my birthday or to commit suicide right nowmy teachers have just contacted my mom to tell her that i miss classes and that i am not doing well in school.  what they don't know is that I'm busy trying to keep myself alive.  Now more than ever, now that my mother knows how things are going I just want to leave and that's it, I have nothing to do in this world. The only thing I can do is make people suffer, I'm useless in all respects.
