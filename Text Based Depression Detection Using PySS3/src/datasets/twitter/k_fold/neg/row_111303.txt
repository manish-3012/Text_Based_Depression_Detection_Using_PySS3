Any support chat group available?I always have suicidal thoughts but I'm not actively suicidal so to speak. I just wanted to know if any of you have or know about any support group that's chat based. I'm already doing therapy but it's not enough, I've tried 7cups but I feel my problems are a bit dark for them
Any reply is appreciated
Hope everyone reading this gets better
