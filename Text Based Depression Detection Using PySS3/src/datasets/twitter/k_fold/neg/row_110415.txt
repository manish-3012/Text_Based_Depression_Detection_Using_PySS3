I want to disappear forever TW: sexual assault as a minorI want to leave. Iâ€™m 34F. There is so much swirling in my head I canâ€™t think straight. 3 marriages, 2 (possibly 3) divorces, 4 children I signed my rights away to, almost been shot and stabbed in the same night, being cheated on by EVERY boyfriend/husband, codependent as a result of 2 narcissistic parents. Both sides of my family tree are dysfunctional and lack proper communication techniques... just gaslighting and belittling. I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and PTSD, although I was inaccurately diagnosed as bipolar for 5 years. I see my new psychiatrist on Thurs if I can make it till then. My husband is a narc and doesnâ€™t get it. I have major PTSD from being molested by cousins and uncles and my parents have never once validated my feelings about it. I know this is all over the place but I am just letting it flow without overthinking or editing... I am honestly surprised I survived to see 34... didnâ€™t think I would be here at 30... the only thing good I have done lately is not smoke cigarettes.. I quit in Dec and havenâ€™t smoked since... I donâ€™t know what else to say... thanks for listening
