FailureMost days, I just want to leave this plane of existence. Everything reminds me of how worthless I am. I am just so angry because I hate myself. I have so much growing inside me. I have no one and I feel so lonely everyday. My family makes me suicidal. My parents canâ€™t understand the pain they have caused me. They taught me being dead would be better than being gay. I hate my disgusting sexuality so much. Itâ€™s nasty to think about but itâ€™s unfortunately what I am. Tried to change it but my brain wonâ€™t let it. I was cursed at an early age, it seems. I have never wanted anything than for someone to care about me without being blood related. Once my family knows about my sexuality, itâ€™s over. I will be going to Hell so what is the point of this? Iâ€™m just so mad at the world. I wish I was born normal. I envy happy good looking people so much. Those who have someone to care about them makes me even more suicidal. I feel untouchable. Iâ€™m tired of imagining myself as other people because the real me is too upsetting to think about. I have many deep rooted issues and they are only getting worse. If my father gave a fuck about anybody but himself he would care. I hate him so much. I wish I born in a normal family. Why did I have to be born black and inferior? Iâ€™m rambling but I just fucking hate myself. Why me? I try to better myself at the gym but itâ€™s just useless. There is no happy ending for me. I feel no motivation to keep going living a lie and never being able to be my true self. All my life I have been trapped.
