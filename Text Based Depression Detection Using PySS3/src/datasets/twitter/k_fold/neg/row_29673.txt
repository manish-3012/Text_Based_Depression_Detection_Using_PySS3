When I die fuck it I wanna go to hellCuz I'm a piece of shit it ain't hard to fucking tell.
Stolen biggie lines aside I sorta feel that. I'm fucking tired of it all. This world's full of shitty people and I'm no different. What the fuck is the point. Why wageslave away until I'm too old to be useful. For what. Why do anything. It's all bullshit. I'm full of shit. Everyone else is full of shit. This whole watery rock is full of shit. We're all liers and manipulators. There's no such thing as a good cause. There's no such thing as a good life. All just lies we tell ourselves and others to make this shitty existence seem worth it. Crabs in a bucket, the whole lot of us. No one's allowed to escape.
