Give me one good reason not to end it allI know the only reason I haven't done it yet is because I'm a wimp and take forever to do things whether I want to or not, but I actually see no reason as to why I shouldn't. Idc if it's permanent because I'd rather feel nothing. I can't live my life just so those who care about me can be happy. I don't find joy or fun in anything. So I truly see no point.
