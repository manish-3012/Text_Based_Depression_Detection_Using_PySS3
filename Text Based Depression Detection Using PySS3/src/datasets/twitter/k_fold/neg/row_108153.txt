My desire to not live is so powerful it hurts to existI don't give a hit anymore. I don't even use a throwaway anymore. Even if somebody irl saw this post they wouldn't give a single fuck. Nobody gives a shit about me, nor have they ever. I have 1 friend and God bless him. If not for him, I'd have offed myself in 7th grade. But he doesn't even know I'm suicidal. Or even that I'm depressed. But I am. And every time I think about how much I want to die I can't help but feel like squirming like a worm in the sun. I know where my road ends. I don't want to do it but anything beats waking up another day and praying to God that I die by some freak accident or school shooter or something.
