human beings are horribleI'm so depressed. 

I can't have a nice conversation here. With anyone. About anything. I keep coming to this website because I don't know where else to find people who have the answers that I am looking for, and reddit makes it so easy with all of the extremely categorized subs, but... people are so shitty and mean about whatever they can possibly find. 

God forbid you quote something improperly or don't source everything that you say or worse, make some kind of grammatical error that you failed to catch on the first pass. 

It's to the point where even bots are talking shit to me and I'm just lonely. I don't or can't trust anyone. Everyone is so judgmental and shitty. 

I don't feel like I should be wrong for wanting to assume that everyone is a well-intentioned adult. 

I don't understand what it is that makes the internet as a whole absolutely fucking despise me.
