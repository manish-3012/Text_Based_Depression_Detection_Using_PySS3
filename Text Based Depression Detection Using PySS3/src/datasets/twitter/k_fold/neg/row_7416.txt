Just scaredFor whatever reason my anxiety and depression have started hitting me hard in December and its close to debilitating me. Some days I don't even go outside or stress over the most minor of interactions(grocery store, drive thru). I started getting anxiety at my old job when there was no problem before and am now starting a new job tomorrow doing ABA therapy. It pays better and is more in my field but i dont know how im going to teach or help these kids and I'm so worried I feel sick. I can't think straight. I dont understand why just going to work is so hard. I've been coping really unhealthily(smoking,drinking,diet restriction) and its starting to negatively impact others around me. I just want to help people but i can't even help myself and i can't fuck things up.
