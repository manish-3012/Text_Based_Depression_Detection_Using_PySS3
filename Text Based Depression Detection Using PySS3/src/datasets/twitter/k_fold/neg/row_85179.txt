Do you think a window blinds cord could strangle me?I don't have any other painless methods available to me, and I looked at my window, and thought maybe if i did it right it could work. It can kill kids as far as I am aware, so maybe I will be too heavy. 
Tonight I untangled the cord and put my head through the loop to test it out and it felt pretty sturdy. I didn't have the resolve to go through with anything tonight though. 
Man i'm just so sick of life I've never so seriously planned anything like I did tonight. I simply can't bring myself to care about living anymore.
