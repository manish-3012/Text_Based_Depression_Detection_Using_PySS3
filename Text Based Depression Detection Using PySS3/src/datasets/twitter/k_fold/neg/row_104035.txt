Not sure what's going on with meSo little background for me. I'm a 30 year old single guy. Last year I had some really bad thoughts after a breakup and went to seek help. I was at work one day and broke down. Cried uncontrollably, and kept thinking of bad things that can happen to me. Before that I kept getting these horrible migraines and I was afraid that there was something wrong with my head. I went to the doctor and explained what had happened and they said it was most likely a panic attack and suggested I get on an antidepressant. 

Fast forward to about 8 months later now. I have been doing much better, I never took the pills prescribed to me, and never went back to the doctor. Not sure if that was the right thing to do or not. Last night my friend and I got into an argument and before going to bed I looked out on my patio and kept thinking what would happen if I jumped? I live on the 24th floor so I know the end result. The thought just wouldn't leave my mind for some reason. 

I do have random thoughts of jumping out in front of cars, jumping off buildings, doing things to myself, just more dark thoughts really. I've learned to handle my panic attacks pretty well, like right now typing this I'm realizing how crazy this all sounds and I notice my breathing has gotten heavier, and I feel pressure on my chest. This is what I felt the first time I broke down, but I can easily manage it now. Is this a normal thing for people to think about, or should I be concerned that this could escalate into something worse?
