Im not sure if this is the right place to post thisI am a 24 year old male. I have done battle with depression and anxiety ever since I was 14. 

I am in a serious down section of my depression currently. I have been off medication for close to three years.

About three months ago I met a girl. I didn't want anything serious at the time and told her so. About two weeks ago she met someone and they have started dating. I spent the last weekend in Tahoe with her and some friends and realized my feelings for her. I am drunk, in bed, and can't stop thinking about her. Also I keep thinking about hurting myself. I have only rarely acted upon actually hurting myself. Suicidal thoughts have been with me since I can remember. I consider suicide selfish and weak and wouldn't act on these thoughts but i don't know how to stop this cycle. 

I am confused, alone, and tired of this shit. I just need someone to tAlk to.
