Intrusive thoughts?!Does anyone else have those?!? They get so bad sometimes it makes me feel so bad for the things I think. Like for some reason I donâ€™t wanna be judged but hurting animals is a intrusive thought of mine, but I have animals and I love them with all my heart and would never hurt them. I actually have never hit any of my animals. But I just sometimes get these sudden urges to oh my god itâ€™s so bad but to kill them, but it makes me feel so bad and awful that I have these thought. Same with my family I just sometimes think to get a knife and just end everyone, but I love them. Itâ€™s so weird how these thoughts just come to my mind and they make me feel so bad and guilty. But please donâ€™t judge me I need to know if anyone else had these type of thoughts so I donâ€™t feel alone and bad about my self. So do you have intrusive thoughts? If so what are they plz share!
