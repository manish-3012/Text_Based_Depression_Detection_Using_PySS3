:lquick post, i want to go to bed

1. Everytime i get woken up by my alarm, i get a big urge of myself jumping infront of a train, but wont do it, because it gets better with the day

2. i fucking HATE school. it just wants me to throw up. and i cant motivate me to do even a single piece of work for it. or else i feel like shit.

3. it hurts so much when i ask something my classmates and they just ignore me like i wasnt even there.

4. their ignorance sucks.

5. i hate going outside. im having too big of a fear im awkward to the others.

6. feeling really lonely.

7. but at the same time, i just want to stay alone in my room forever. its a really bad conflict in myself.

8. thinking about suicide pretty often. wont do it tho. im too afraid of any pain or the extra work my corpse will do to my family. i dont want to be more than a weight im already are.

9. i hate going to sleep, because i know exactly that everything will repeat itself again, every day.

enough ranted. im tired enough. and the thoughts of tomorrow are killing me a little inside right now. cya tomorrow maybe, if someone actually cares.
