Dealing With DepressionI've been suffering for depression for a long time now, among other issues, and I can't even keep a job for more than a month without the depression hitting me so hard I can't get out of bed. I have work in a few hours and if I miss today, I'll lose this job as well. Someone please just talk to me.
