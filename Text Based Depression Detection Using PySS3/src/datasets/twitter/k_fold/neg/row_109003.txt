I am 12 and I want to jump off a buildingMy emotions never really mattered, I am transgender and I hate my body. I have been called a joke, saying that being trans or having depression at a young age is woke or whatever. My grades are falling and I'm so so lonely. I feel fatigue building up just when breathing, I have no friends and I hate my life. I feel dehumanized because I'm called a silly girl going through a faze. I hate myself and I hate my life and I want to die and sleep forever
