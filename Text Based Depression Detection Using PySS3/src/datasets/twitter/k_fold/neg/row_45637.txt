I've been staring at this keyboard for an hour.I want to write out how I feel, but I don't know what to write. I just want to die. Or maybe I want someone to listen, I tried but my best friend ran when I told her, and my friends think suiciders are cowards. 

I'm only 16, people always tell me that I have a bright future and I should live...but why? I self harm but even that doesn't help. I feel like I'll miss life, but I want to die so bad. My friends are leaving me, I'm a failure. I can't do things that other kids do, I can't have fun like they do, I can't do anything because I'm fucking useless...

What's the point...all I'm going to do is let this post get buried and pretend that I'm happy for another month before breaking down....no one wants to listen, they all just run...I'll wake up and pretend until breaking down when everyone is asleep. Everyone else is happy, they have dreams and ambitions and plans. They go to sleep and wake up happy. I can't do that, I can't do any of that, I'm useless...

Dying probably isn't so bad,  I won't have to pretend to be like the other kids anymore. I'll never be as good as them, there's no point. I'm not going to wake up.
