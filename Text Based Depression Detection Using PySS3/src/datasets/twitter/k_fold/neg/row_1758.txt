It's so hard to focusIt's very hard to do school work or stay focused on tasks when I keep thinking that I'll kill myself every few days.  Driving has been  a battle of whether or not I'll purposely crash.  This past Sunday I almost hung myself, today I just stared at a prescription bottle and a glass of water for ten minutes before heading over to the campus library, trying to get ready for a presentation I'll probably fail.  My family knows I've had depressive issues, but I'm scared to let them know it's progressed this far.
