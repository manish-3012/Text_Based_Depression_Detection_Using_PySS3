I function properly but mentally I'm ready to die and commit suicide.I do great at school (despite still struggling in some classes like Algebra 1) people overlook the fact I'm depressed and suicidal because I act like I'm achieving something or I'm productive and smart but in reality I'm nothing

So far, my life is not going anywhere. I'm dead on the inside I'm just waiting for the right time to die and commit suicide.

I don't know how much longer I can hold on... I don't know how many posts I can keep posting. I'm so tired.
