no hope left but too scared to dieIn just a few short months of bipolar mania and psychosis, I ruined everything I had going for me by losing my job and making every stereotypical bipolar mistake on a catastrophic and public scale. I won't recount the details because in my case mania wasn't euphoric or funny at all. The things I damaged can't be fixed, and on some level I just can't believe it all really happened. After three months on medication and back to my senses, my depression is getting worse instead of better because my problems are now all too real (primarily financial, in addition to remorse and shock over the horrible things I did). The worst part is that my family still harbors hope for me, not understanding how badly I actually destroyed my life prospects. In a way, their love and optimism is just more torment because it makes it harder to just kill myself, which seems like the rational choice. The only things that will realistically happen in my life now are negative, so it's the worst kind of suspense. What if things are actually, truly hopeless? That happens sometimes, doesn't it? Am I supposed to just endure it as the aftermath continues to unfold?
