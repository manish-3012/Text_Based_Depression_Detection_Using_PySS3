Iâ€™m just gonna end itI reached my limit, I just canâ€™t do this anymore, thereâ€™s too much to say in this post, so Iâ€™m not gonna say all of it. I hate my life so damn much and Iâ€™m tired of hearing people say itâ€™ll get better, after 8 years I had enough, Iâ€™m not happy, I forgot what it feels like to be happy, Iâ€™ve been to multiple therapists, been hospitalized, Iâ€™m sick and tired of it. Iâ€™m going to end it Sunday..itâ€™s too late to save me, I got so used to the sadness..
