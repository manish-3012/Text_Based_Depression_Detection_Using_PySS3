Does anybody just want to talk?I moved back to my parents in October to get my fourth shoulder surgery. I've been off work since then. I'm 24m. My girlfriend broke up with me a month ago. My best friend died  6 years ago and i was cursed with watching it happen. I wad a drug addict for 3 years after that, opiates, prescription pills, and ive been clean for 3 years now. I've had a ton of flings. Maybe 60 or so different girls. Drugs and sex always helped fill my void until it didn't. I worked on myself, got clean and got a good job. I was feeling  good. I started dating a girl 8 months ago, the first time since highschool. She dropped me like nothing 3 days after my birthday. My mom just caught me crying 20 mins ago, she asked if it was about my ex. I said no it's because I'm just sad and depressed. My mom told me to stop talking stupid and I was mean for saying that I wanted to die. Then she went back to bed.  I'm a 24 year old man, ex drug addict, living eith his parents, layed off from work, debt up my ass from my drug days, crying at 2 in the morning. I'm pathetic and i want to die. Ive got a belt with me. I've put it around my neck and did a test jump from where I plan on hanging myself in the house. Next step is to wrap the belt around the piece of ceiling board at the same time. I've never considered suicide like this. I have, but not to this extent.
