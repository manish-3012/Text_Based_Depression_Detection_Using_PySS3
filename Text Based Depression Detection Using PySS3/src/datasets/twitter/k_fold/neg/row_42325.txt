I don't understand the point of livingAs the title states this whole existence bs is pointless i got born into an abusive household at 4 i was being repeated molested and beaten that went on for a few years then from there it escalated to sensory deprivation/solitary confinement with still the occasional beatings and sexual assault. And that went on till i was 16. I got one year break because of the Foster Care system but i got traded back like a fucking commodity.. 11 suicide attempts later and ive gotten no where i live in an apartment the size of a jail cell.. I have no high school diploma no future.. Basically a waste of space and oxygen..
