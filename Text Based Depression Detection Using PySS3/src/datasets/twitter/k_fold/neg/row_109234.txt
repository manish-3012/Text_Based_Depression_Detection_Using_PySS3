I think I made an attempt a few days agoI think I tried to kill myself on Sunday. I had written a note a few days before and I was just ready to die. I was having a good day, but I was really suicidal for some reason, so decided that I would like to die somewhat happy. I tried to kill myself with water intoxication . I drank about 6 large bottles of water in 15 minutes before I decided to give up. I didnâ€™t plan it, but I kinda regret not going through with it.
