It really does feel like I'm coming to an endThis post was originally meant for /r/depression but to be quite honest I've thought about killing myself years ago, after multiple failed college attempts and string of part time hotel gigs interrupted by depression.  My parents were gracious enough to keep my incompetence under their roof for so long, but they're growing old and tired of my failure to launch.

I turn 29 in a couple weeks.  I have a back full of withered discs, and years out from achieving any level of skill that would give me financial autonomy without physical labor.  This pathetic bed of failure would be perfectly fine to lay in if I could keep my one reason to continue - the love of my life.

I met her in 2015.  I met her by complete chance online, and we planned to slowly pull ourselves together and visit each other every year in the mean time.  It's almost been three years since I met his beautiful, caring woman.  Now she's developed a rare form of a cancer that's progressed heavily.  


If my baby dies, the one person in this piece of shit world that doesn't deserve to win this lottery, I'm just going to kill myself.  I just needed a place for someone to read this - the only other people I have in my life would think less of me for speaking these words.
