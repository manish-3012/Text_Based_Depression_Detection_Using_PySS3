the new way my best friend says "bye" to mei've had depression since i could remember. my best (and likely to be only) friend knows about this, and has been a fucking lifesaver. not in like a "talked me out of killing myself" way - he doesn't even know i'm suicidal - but in an understated way that he knows i'll respond well to when i'm feeling shitty, which has been happening more and more lately.

my main coping mechanism for my depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts/basically all the chemical imbalances in my brain is through a gallows sense of humour, which is something we share. nothing's off-limits for the both of us, and we'd definitely get judged if i shared all the shit we joke about on here, so let's just say we can get pretty dark.

recently, i've gone through a lot of shit. a friend blocked me as a result of my shitty, self-destructive behaviour, and several more followed as a result. i don't have many friends as is, so this really took a toll on me, which of course led to an increase in my joking about suicide, because that's kind of how coping mechanisms work.

my friend doesn't laugh any less than he usually does at these new jokes, and he doesn't seem scared or put off by them - but at the same time, i've noticed a change in the way he says "goodbye" to me when we go our separate ways after hanging out or after school.

instead of a regular ol' "bye", "later", "peace", or "deuces", he'll say "you better be at school tomorrow". he's been doing this everyday for a week now, so i guess he's put two and two together.

i don't really have any meditation on this, or any meaningful comment to add. nor do i have the energy to think something up. i just kinda thought it was nice.
