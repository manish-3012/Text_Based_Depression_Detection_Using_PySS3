I dont deserve to be hereI genuinely think im just not fit to live on this planet. I dont deserve any happiness because it's probably there but I just dont care to go get it. 

I graduated from a group home when I was 18, turned to drugs to ease the frustration of being homeless (where I lived you didnt need money to find drugs it was everywhere, sneak into a concert, hop a fence, steal a case of alcohol from walmart and find a random house party) 

I finally got a job when I was 22, it was offered in a town away and so I took it, spent a year throwing boxes for a shipping plant and quit that because I just stopped caring about my job.

Now im out of work, live in a storage unit and just dont have any want or will to change. 

Nothing ever changes inside. I'm 24, and the past 8 years ive not felt any different about my situation. And now im just fed up, I just want things to end if they arent going to change. 


Honestly ive no idea why im writing this, I dont have any friends on here, or any on the internet, real life, etc. Ive not had friends since I was a small child. Closest thing to a friend ive had since 3rd grade are women, none of which I miss. 

goodbye reddit
