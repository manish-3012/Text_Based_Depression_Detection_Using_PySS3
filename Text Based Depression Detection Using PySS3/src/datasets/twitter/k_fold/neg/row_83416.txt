Highschool student not looking forward to anythingI don't even know why im posting here, its a longshot, at least.

In the past 4 months, ive lost many things that were precious to me. Ive lost my best friend, got dumped by a girl and more.

Ive had many girlfriends in the past months, and i dont even know why i kept on dating. I'm a monster when it comes to dating. I dont know why anyone would ever date me. I dont think ive got anything going for me in the 'looks' department.

I've grown up in a household full of high expectations. My parents, peers, and other people force this idea of high expectations on myself. I'm used to being the top of the class. This senior year, im just barely pulling through with 70% on most classes. Doesn't sound low, but thats abysmal for myself. (By the way, this is Canada, where grades matter, not SAT or such)

Last night was an argument with my (now ex) girlfriend. I 'cheated' on her by flirting with this other girl, who only kept on going on it to log everything i said and present it to my girlfriend.

Even then, i dont know why i did it. It was stupid, and i feel guilty. It's like ive destroyed all of my ideals for myself.

As you can probably tell, my trains of thought aren't exactly coherent, but ill answer to anything you have to throw at me. I started isolating myself from everyone due to my paranoia, but the internet is my home.

I can't bear to hurt all my peers and friends, but at the same time im being pushed into a corner.
