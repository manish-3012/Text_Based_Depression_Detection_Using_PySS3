All time lowSo last night after work i went home after spending some time with friends. On the was home I just keep thanking about how I have been making my life harder for myself, not that I'm the only one. When I got home I remembered that I'm by my self this weekend as everyone is out this weekend. Not wanting to show up to work any more or really anywhere last night I sat in the tub pulled the shower current closed and just cried, herder then I had in a really long time. One of my friends gf is going to therapy for some stuff and I messaged him asking where she went, at this point I knew he was driving home. At this point I'm sitting there crying with my handgun in my lap making a decision, if he responds I get help if he doesn't I shoot my self. Through out me texting him back and forth I keep wanting to do it and a story about this one girl who shot her self in the head and lived keep coming in my head, what if I flinch and just make my self handicapped, I keep looking at my gun to see if there was a round chambered(you can see on the rite side the rim of the casein) with it was but what if it didn't go off I keep thanking. I keep putting it to my head wand wanting to pull the trigger but I just couldn't. He wound up getting back to me and we messaged back and froth for a bit. He called me later that night but I ducked his call as I just didn't want to talk. He didn't know how much influence he had over my decision. I'm not the kind of person that likes help I don't like people knowing about my struggles especially my family even though I know they are supporting. Where I go from here I'm not sure, I don't expect anyone to read this. For some reason I just wanted to write it all down.
