I've tried my hardest, I really have.Where do I even start? My life's been crumbling for about 5 years now. It just seems like whenever I try to do something to be happy or make my life better, it fucks up. Really, I've tried my fucking best... it just feels like an always losing battle. It doesn't help that I'm alone all the time either, I just stay in my room, at my parents house. We've had a big fight which has led me to write this, I'm an only child too. I legitimately have nobody. I've somewhat tried suicide before, I tied something together and remember choking near my closet. I thought, just give it another try maybe it will be different this time. It wasn't. I don't know why I'm posting really, I'm too much of a bitch to actually go through with suicide. I actually don't know what to do, I'm 18 with no friends, parents fucking hate me, I have no job and I don't go to school at the moment, although I'm signing up for spring classes. Part of me wants to again say "hey hold on for the near future, it will be better" but another part of me has been let down by that too many times, too cynical to think that way, thinks it absolutely pointless to live anymore. I'm rambling, I don't know anymore, I might try to get a job but I've got bad anxiety and the two times I've attempted to get a job I fuck it up in the interview.
