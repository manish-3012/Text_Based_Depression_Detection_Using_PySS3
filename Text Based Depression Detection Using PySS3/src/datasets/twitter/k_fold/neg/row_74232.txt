Well. I think I've finally got it figured out.Tonight, once my friends go to sleep I think I will slip out and go to a favorite spot of mine. A parking garage I've always had the itch to jump off, but just couldn't bring myself round to it. After hearing from my mom and dad that my  illness's I've been diagnosed with (depression, anxiety, and a small tumor in my pituitary gland which isn't that big of an issue) are all pretty much a cry for attention. And after getting into a fist fight with my only friend today, I think it's time. I've thought really hard my whole life about it. I've been skipping my anti depressants and I've got no real will to live anymore. I will update if my plans don't come too, but I hope that won't be an issue
