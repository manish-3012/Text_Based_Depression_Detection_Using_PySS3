This doesn't have to be a bad thingI'm just tired of the general consensus being that everyone *must* be saved. For what? Don't those who genuinely hate living deserve the option to check out? If we're being honest here it doesn't make a difference one way or the other. Sure my family is going to be greatly effected, but in the long run it doesn't matter at all. What matters is that I don't have to keep doing this EVERY day, for years and years. What matters is not wasting so much time and energy when there's literally no reason to. For some people this isn't tragic. This is the light at the end of the tunnel.

 I can't even begin to tell you how much more content I've been since setting a 'date'. I'm not crazy. I'm not some tortured soul who desperately needs professional help. I'm just tired and don't want to exist anymore. That's all. This is what I need. I just wish more people would understand, especially my family. The last thing I want to do is hurt them. I wish there were some way to explain this to them, but I don't think that exists. Anyways, sorry for the rant. I've just been thinking about how my parents are going to cope with this and the guilt has been unbearable, so I'd like to hear your thoughts
