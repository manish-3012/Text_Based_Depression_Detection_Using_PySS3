I've been thinking about suicide a lotI think about it daily, I set at my desk at work and just think about how awesome it would be to not be in constant torment. 

I recently got divorced from a woman who put up with my depression and irritability until she couldn't anymore. Now I'm a 30 year old man going home to an apartment alone, with no one to share my life with. Such an odd feeling to know 2 months ago things where fine, great job, nice house, in school working on masters, rocky but semi stable relationship, and 2 amazing dogs...to now coming home to silence. 

The reason I haven't done it is for my parents and brother, the thought of their pain and dealing with me committing such an act stops me in my tracks, I could never do that to them. I hope that I stay committed to them. 

I text with my ex still, things are pretty cordial for the most part. However, she's already started looking for someone. I don't get that, how could you already be looking for a relationship?? I will not act all high and mighty because I have already slept with someone else, but I'm not even close to being ready for a relationship. How is this even reality?? People suck. I tell myself that everything will be ok and I all this will pass, but it's so hard to see that from where I'm currently standing...fuuuuuucccckkkkk!
