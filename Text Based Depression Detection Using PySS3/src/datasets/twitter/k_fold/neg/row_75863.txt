I got to stop F**KING lying to myself.I felt glad that I can go off this subreddit but I really couldnâ€™t. This subreddit is what keeps me off the edge and I thought I was well enough to leave and try the hospital again. GUESS THE F**K WHAT, just like me got annoyed of questionnaires and refused help. Such a me move. I was 8 seconds from death when one of the nurses saw me strangling myself. Because I was in the teen center of the hospital I just get to live in my apartment after the hospital with no anything I can die from. Still trying to get better I really want to but every time a reach up so does the blob consuming me.
