I feel so lost. (rant)I donâ€™t know what to do with my life at this point. I donâ€™t really feel joy in the things I used to enjoy. I do not have any plans or dreams or anything that makes me enjoy this shithole. Iâ€™m not really interested in living to be honest. It feels like an annoying chore more than anything and I hate putting up with it.

I never had any close friends and now that Iâ€™m all âœ¨grown upâœ¨I have no idea how to communicate with people. I have no idea how to live a normal fucking life. The thought of having to work 40+ hours a week just to survive is also really depressing and then getting old.. all the health problems - I do not want that.

I feel so numb, so empty. I havenâ€™t felt suicidal in a while but itâ€™s coming back now. Iâ€™m not scared so I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m waiting for.. maybe just maybe thereâ€™s still a tiny bit of hope but for how long? :)
