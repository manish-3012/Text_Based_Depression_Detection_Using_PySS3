ExhaustedI am mentally and emotionally and physically exhausted. I have been dealing with depression for years and self harm on and off for years and I am just tired. I don't feel like there is any reason to keep going. Life is boring and cliche and there is so little to hold on for. And I think it's b******* to say oh it will get better. Nobody knows that.
