Being homeless is awful but it's not as bad as having the tiny bit of hope you have being crushedI'm staying at a homeless shelter but they do not provide meals. I can use the computer here to talk and post stuff like this, although I'm more of a lurker. Anyway 3 years ago I was having a rough time and talked with someone on this site. I stopped and left Reddit for a while and came back and didn't talk to them for a couple years because I was embarrassed. But I haven't eaten in a week. I'm trying to sell my steam account, which is not working at all, to get some funds to eat. But I asked a favor of thisperson. A couple bucks to get some food. They said sure. They didn't reply for a while and when they did, they said I was stalking them. That they couldn't help me. I have no idea where this came from when the last message from them was "Sure how can I help?" 

Hope in humanity is ruined. Hope in general. I swallow my pride, I do some thing I loathe and ask for help. Then they shit in my face... 

Talk me out of killing myself here. I can't go to food banks because I do not have the right id. Soup kitchens are not close by and I lose my place to sleep indoors if I travel there and back due to time and distance. I can't afford to eat. I have no friends. No family. No one at all. And the last bit of hope was shredded. So what's the point in living if I'm going to starve to death? Why not go hang myself right fucking now.
