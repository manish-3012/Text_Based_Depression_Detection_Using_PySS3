What counts as an alcoholic/nobody thinks i need help apparentlyI'm 19 years old female and for the last year and a half maybe two years I've been drinking heavily. When I say heavily I mean I will buy a gallon of liquor and by the end of the night (often times alone) there's a little less than half the bottle left. When I don't drink I get itchy and shaky and I can't think. This is now but at my worst I've drank a fifth every night for months and when I tried to stop I thought I was having a heart attack and I had a delirium episode where I couldn't think or speak and i was just shaking. Now it's lessened but I still can't go more than one might without getting blackout drunk. I also have struggled with doing cocaine in month long binges until i feel like I'm on the verge of death and i force myself to stop for at least a month. But people tell me I'm too young to be an alcoholic or a drug addict. I feel that it's overtaken my personality so first and foremost I'm a drinker and drug user and secondly I'm whatever person I used to be. I need help and I don't know where to go I went to the er a couple weeks ago for a suicide attempt but got no help and I'm at the end of my ropes i honestly want to end my life. I'm sorry I'm drunk as I'm writing this.
