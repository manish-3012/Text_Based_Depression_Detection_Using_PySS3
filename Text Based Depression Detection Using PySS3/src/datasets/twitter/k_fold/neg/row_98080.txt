I just don't know what to do anymore.Hello, I am a 7th grader thinking about ending my life.

I'm posting this here because I have literally almost no where else to go, all therapy says is to do breathing exercises and other things like that. Recently I have had to put up with tons of drama, and toxic people around me. Many people are probably thinking "Oh it's just middle school drama he'll get over it." But no, it is much much worse. It has effected me so much that I stay up crying, and stressed out, and overthinking because the people I met at the beginning of the year are constantly harassing me now, they hate me for no reason, and I am a sensitive person naturally and they always drop little hints that they are angry or upset with me that makes me overthink massively. It has gotten to the point where I am starting to harm myself with cutting, and sticking needles in myself. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have a HUGE amount of anxiety and *maybe* depression, although I am not going to self diagnose. I've been having thoughts recently that have been getting to me badly and I am on the verge of doing it. These toxic people have ruined my life and my mental health.
