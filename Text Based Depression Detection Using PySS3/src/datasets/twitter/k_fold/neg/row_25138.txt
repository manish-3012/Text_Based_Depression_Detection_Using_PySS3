Life is futile.I'm 22 now (turning 23 soon), and I still haven't accomplished anything noteworthy. I'm enrolled in university and doing fine, but I essentially picked a major that I'll never be able to profit from after failing my law major. The health of both of parents is rapidly deteriorating and once either of them dies, I won't be able to study anymore anyway. I'm already commuting between home and uni as my parents cannot live alone anymore, which in turn seriously affects my social relationships. I basically have zero friends at this point because nobody wants to deal with me for reasons I can even understand: I'm sour, bitter and hardly smile these days. The only person that remotely cares about me also happens to be the one person I have a crush on, but I know for certain that the feeling is not mutual and if he knew that I was gay, I know he'd cut all ties anyway. My brother gives a flying fuck about our family's situation and moved out recently, leaving everything up to me. Hiring a caretaker for my parents would be impossible for me since I'm unable to afford one.

I hate everything about this world and myself. There is no reason to continue living other than taking care of my parents, but I don't want that anymore. I hate myself and this goddamn world so, so much. I wish I could just vanish.
