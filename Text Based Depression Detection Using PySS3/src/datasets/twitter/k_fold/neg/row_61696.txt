I really want to be in a car crash, not for death - but for attention.I want it to hurt, but not enough that it will kill me or cause long term issues. 

I want to be in the back of an ambulance, then in a hospital. So I know I am safe and someone is always watching me.

I don't want my car to stop suddenly, and cause internal bleeding. I want to live. I just want to be in a car crash, I want me car to slide off the road, flip upside down, and be noticed.
