I'm struggling and feeling incredibly guiltyI feel like life slams doors in my face every time I make an attempt to open one. Nothing ever seems like it will work out. 

I have suffered from social anxiety disorder for the majority of my life now. I don't like labels but that's the reality. It limits my every move every day and I can't cope anymore. I have no friends, what is supposed to be my support system is mostly toxic and everything I try to do to climb out of this hole I'm stuck in backfires.

My parents think they help but they don't ever listen when I try to tell them how to help. It's like talking to a brick wall. When I need them in my corner they aren't there. I feel like they're like this because I am a burden on them. I can't maintain a job right now because of the anxiety. They're in a bad situation financially. I just feel so incredibly useless. I'm sorry if it seems like I'm rambling here.

My sister and I don't get along. She treats me like shit for no reason. 

My significant other is the only positive force I have in my life. She's helped me not get to this point the most but it's hurting too much now. I don't want to go on. I want to throw in the towel. My life will never amount to anything worth sticking around for. I couldn't finish school, I can't keep a job... failure is all I have to talk about with my life.

Not to mention I've been sexually assaulted twice and I still haven't quite worked through those like I need to. I just want the pain to stop. I just want my anxiety level to be normal. I just want to get through a day where I have no panic attacks. I need relief before I find a way to permanently get relief. Someone please convince me that life is worth it...because at this point I'm fantasizing about not being here. 

Please help me. Thank you for reading my incoherent rambling. :(
