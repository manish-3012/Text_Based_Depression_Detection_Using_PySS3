what do i do now.i didnâ€™t die. i shouldnâ€™t live. i donâ€™t know what to do. itâ€™s like iâ€™m living a life that isnâ€™t mine. i donâ€™t know what to do or how itâ€™s supposed to work. i tried to leave. iâ€™m trying to stay. itâ€™s like iâ€™m just alive at this point. iâ€™m not living. iâ€™m breathing and functioning but iâ€™m not fucking living. i donâ€™t know what to do.
