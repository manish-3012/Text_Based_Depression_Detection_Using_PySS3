My 2nd Time was a failure too.My[m] fiancÃ©e[f] of two years walked out on me. All she left was a note and my ring.

It all started when I met this girl who needed mental help. We became decent friends because we were coworkers but she told me she planned on killing herself. I helped her get out of that rut. I should have let her die. I should have never reached out. 

I found it when I got home after being fired. The next day I was numb. I didnâ€™t eat and Iâ€™m a diabetic. Iâ€™m slowly trying to make my way to the icy embrace naturally. The day after that, she showed back up with her mother in tow. Her mother then began yelling and calling me worthless, useless, and a waste of space. Now I have to choose who gets the cat and dog. They were mine but now, after being with her for so long...every I look at them I see her and my heart feels even heavier. We weâ€™re so happy. We were perfect. I would do anything to have her back, but I cannot live without her. Iâ€™ve tried to take my own life twice in the past week. I need her. She was my rock and confidant. Weâ€™ve known each other for 6 years and I canâ€™t live without her
