Help me?Hello. I am 14. From Armenia. Since I was 6 I dreamed about moving to the United States of America. Today I decided to check out if there's any way of moving to America...(took 5 hours) I checked out almost everything, all of the scholarships are for colleges, and my family doesn't have enough money even for public schools, but I want to move to America, before going to high school. Because there's this problem, if I stay here I must go to army for 2 years, and army in Armenia, well let's just say there are roaches in the bread. So reddit this is the first time I am here, and I ask for help is there anything I can do? Any scholarship, or anything really... If I am not going to be able to move out... I rather kill myself. Thank you for your time.
