AvalancheWhen you have depression itâ€™s like it snows every day. Some days itâ€™s only a couple of inches. Itâ€™s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. Sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friendâ€™s birthday party, but it IS still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. Probably better to just head home. Your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole. 

Some days it snows a foot. You spend an hour shovelling out your driveway and are late to work. Your back and hands hurt from shovelling. You leave early because itâ€™s really coming down out there. Your boss notices.

Some days it snows four feet. You shovel all morning but your street never gets ploughed. You are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. You are so sore and tired you just get back in the bed. By the time you wake up, all your shovelling has filled back in with snow. Looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are.
You donâ€™t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shovelling. Plus they donâ€™t get this much snow at their house so they donâ€™t understand why youâ€™re still stuck at home. They just think youâ€™re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it.

Some weeks itâ€™s a full-blown blizzard. When you open your door, itâ€™s to a wall of snow. The power flickers, then goes out. Itâ€™s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. The stove and microwave wonâ€™t work so you eat a cold Pop Tart and call that dinner. You havenâ€™t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? Youâ€™re too cold to do anything except sleep.

Sometimes people get snowed in for the winter. The cold seeps in. No communication in or out. The food runs out. What can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? How far away is help? Can you even get there in a blizzard? If you do, can they even help you at this point? Maybe itâ€™s death to stay here, but itâ€™s death to go out there too.

The thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. You get tired of being cold. You get tired of hurting all the time from shovelling, but if you donâ€™t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. You resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesnâ€™t care, itâ€™s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. It carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world.

Also, the snow builds up in other areas, places you canâ€™t shovel, sometimes places you canâ€™t even see. Maybe itâ€™s on the roof. Maybe itâ€™s on the mountain behind the house. Sometimes, thereâ€™s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. A veritable Act of God, nothing can be done. The neighbours say itâ€™s a shame and they canâ€™t understand it; he was doing so well with his shoveling.
