I deserve this. It will be justice when I die.Iâ€™m close to being at peace with ending my life. 

I deserve to die.

Recently Iâ€™ve been having trouble thinking about a previous sexual encounter from a while back. 

Basically I was drunk and went round a woman's house. I was wasted, she wasn't. Didn't even have full sexual intercourse. She gave me oral the morning after when I was sober but that was it.

I think about it every now and then and think I raped her when I was drunk. I even messaged said woman and she said "don't be daft."

My mind is telling me though that she is covering for me because she said "we didn't even make out". And if "if you did anything I wouldn't be chatting with you right now."

But we did, we tried to sleep together but I was so drunk I couldn't even manage to get inside her. I do remember that. 

Why would she say we "we didn't even make out"? 

She is married now, lives in New York. I can't really ask her again. We did speak for a while afterwards, she kept in touch with me when I was going through a bad time. She even sent me a message on New Year wishing me a happy new year lol. I've even talked to my therapist about this and she said don't worry about it.

But this is still hurting me. How can I move forward and accept nothing wrong happened?

I have nothing but self hatred and anger towards everything now. I deserve to be jailed but I can't do anything about it. I want to suffer, I deserve to suffer.

I know I will get abuse for posting this, I know people will tell me to kill myself. Itâ€™s what I deserve but believe me I do feel regret and remorse.

I just wanted to put this out there before I leave the planet.
