hello thereI'm just here to admit, to at least someone in this world, my feelings these past few weeks. I've been struggling a lot but that's not a surprise to me or anyone really.

I feel so trapped by my body because it's just so heavy sometimes and because my mind is as slow as if it were stuck in tar.

I keep having these dreams where I try to kill myself and I keep trying to fall back to sleep to revisit that wonderful relief I guess.

I hate being alive because it's so suffocating and I have just been in misery the past few weeks. in retrospect that doesn't sound so bad, but considering that this pattern repeats itself I guess it makes sense.

I haven't been able to talk to my friends and even talking to some of them trigger my depressing feelings or wanting to sh. It's awful and so hard to navigate interactions with people.
Ive just been in so much pain I really want to die.

I'm using what little energy I have to admit that I hate myself. I don't believe I am redeemable. I don't think I could even live a good life if I were to become happy  because I am still flawed and disgusting. I make other's lives hard and sad. Esspecially my family...
I'm so smart and gifted and I will be going to college soon but I really don't see how anything could make things better for me.

I have a bright future but I don't think anything will change my mind. It feels so bleak and painful going ahead on my path. Again, I am uninspired, irredeemable, disgusting, and I just am not capable of even being good in my eyes let alone another's eyes.
This is just too much for me I really really want to die a nice death. I don't care what it takes or what the consequences are as long as I'm gone
