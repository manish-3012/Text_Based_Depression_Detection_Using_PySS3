My momI think the thing that hurts me the most in the whole world is when my mom makes me feel bad, and when she realizes it, she cries. and hug me and apologize for being her and that she will try to be a better mother. and it just makes me feel worse because if i were not so sensitive to no she wouldn't feel that way about herself
