Can't do it anymore. Is tonight the night?It's been over a decade in the making. The world crashing around me and pushing me harder and harder. Everyone who "cared" leaving one by one. Abandoning me like a worthless pile of dust. I want to die to get out of this. I've been cutting for 10 years. Started taking pills that make me lose weight so maybe someone will find me attractive again. But no, I'm obviously too ugly, stupid, and worthless for anyone to ever love me again. Maybe it was all a lie. Maybe no one ever loved me in the first place. I've been beaten, screamed at, molested, beaten some more, made to feel like useless filthy garbage and thrown out to the dogs, heartbroken and everything in between. I have zero energy left. I can't do it anymore. I just want to feel one moment of peace even if I have to drift out of this world to achieve that.
