Feeling hopelessI don't know why I am even here posting this message.
I don't know why I've been sitting on my floor the last couple hours not doing literally a damn thing but staring at the wall thinking about how much better I'd be dead.

I want this pain to stop. I'm tired of feeling the weight of it all. Tired of reaching out but never getting the pain across in a way that depicts the depths of it. Tired of feeling empty and like my life is pointless. Sick of people telling me it isn't pointless. IT IS!

And so I'm just about done. I've had it.
