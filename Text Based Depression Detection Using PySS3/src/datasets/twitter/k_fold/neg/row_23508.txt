Living is so exhaustingI sometimes think about like oh Iâ€™m going to get better or Iâ€™m gonna feel better and that Iâ€™m going to be okay but then I get pulled back into my default which is just. Constant depression and itâ€™s so heavy and draining, being depressed literally makes being alive or functional a massive chore because you are constantly so drained, staying afloat is literally killing you and itâ€™s horrifying. I keep on entertaining the idea of just ending it all as if my only point is just death, and the only time people will care is when Iâ€™m dead. Iâ€™m exhausted and no matter how many breaks I take, depression always rears its head. I find no enjoyment in life.
