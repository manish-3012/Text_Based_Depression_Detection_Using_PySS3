Suicide hotlines and online chats are bullshit.I'm not meaning to disrespect any of the volunteers/workers who work hard and answer traumatizing calls every day. But in my opinion, crisis hotlines are good for someone having a bad day, or people who just need someone to talk to as a one time thing. And nothing else. These people are not substitutes for a medical professional when someone is having a psychiatric crisis. Ever since I have experienced my first mental health crisis, I have been a huge advocate of going to the hospital when experiencing suicidal or homicidal thoughts, hearing voices, or any other mental health emergency. Not because my experience was necessarily "good", but because its the only option if you can't be safe. I would MUCH rather someone say to me "Please go to the hospital" rather than "Please call a suicide hotline". 

All 4 times I have contacted the suicide hotline, they seemed to read from a script, and guess where I ended up anyway? THE HOSPITAL. The police were called EVERY time. And if I had just gone to the hospital on my own, I would have been spared the stress of being arrested.
