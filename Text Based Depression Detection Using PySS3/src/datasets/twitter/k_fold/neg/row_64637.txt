I can't fucking die, i'm gettin annoyingAlmost every day I mix depressants drugs, sometimes in large amount, and I can't find die. The last time my family found me outside my lips were blue and somewhat they belived my lie besides my history. Yesterday was the most fucked up, I mixed 3 depressants (benzo, alcohol, ketamine) and was 3AM I did a 1 gram and went to a cig and idk but i found my cellphone on my roof but I didn't die. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to my mom found me in pieces after I jump in front of a train. I went to my psych and he just said to think about how my mom would feel if I was dead, but I didn't ask to be here, I never asked to be born, why would do this to me, I know will hurt my mom but just for a few months and after she was see was for the best of us, she would spend less time, money and will dont have to worry about me. I just can't belive in this shit.
