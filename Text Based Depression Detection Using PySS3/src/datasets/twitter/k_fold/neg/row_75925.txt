I can't win.Whenever I'm sad, it's thinking "I just wanna die cause what's the fucking point and I just don't want to feel like this anymore."

But whenever I'm actually happy it's thinking "this isn't going to last, I'm always going to be super fucking sad again, might as well kill myself tonight so at least I can die knowing my last day was happy."

I don't know if I can take much more of this.
