I need my daddy to hate me.He's the only reason I haven't done it yet, because it would upset him. My mum doesn't love me and perhaps would like to see me go. My brother would get over it soon. I brought it up to my boyfriend that I don't want to live anymore and he has been sort of distant- and I don't know if that's because he doesn't know what to do or if he doesn't want to deal with me. He might break up with me anyway. 

I've started doing things that annoy my dad, staying out late, asking for money etc. I feel guilty but I want him to feel less bad when I do it. I love him so much and I don't want to break his heart, but I still can't go on. I feel like it's my only option. I just need him to hate me so I can go.
