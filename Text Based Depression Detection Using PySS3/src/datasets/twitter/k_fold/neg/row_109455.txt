HelpI was in a committed relationship for 9 years (10 next month) we had 3 children together. 
Last month i found out that he was having an affair with someone from work.
It broke my heart &amp; we tried working it out. 
Then i attempted suicide on day 4, he found me, saved me. I nearly had a stroke, but felt peace. 
He held it against me. He said that he doesnâ€™t love me, doesnâ€™t find me attractive anymore, doesnâ€™t care about me. 
He left, saying he needed space but i know that he had no intention on returning. He has made this clear now. 
Ive lost who i thought was my best friend. And i never saw it coming. 
We spent every day together &amp; i never saw a future without him. Our youngest son is only 2. 
When i reached out to old friends to talk i freaked them out, because id been under his control for so long i didnâ€™t have very good relationships with anyone at all. 

I feel empty, hopeless. Ruined. 
Its been 5 weeks, and nothing has changed. 
Nothing has got better. 
Im crying from the moment i wake til the moment i go to sleep. 
I donâ€™t see a future. I donâ€™t see any positives from this situation and i donâ€™t know where else to turn.
