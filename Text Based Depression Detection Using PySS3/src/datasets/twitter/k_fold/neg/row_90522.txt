Hell is not a place, it is a feeling.i am 19yr old male, i have been in an existential depression for as long as i can remember, I first attempted to hang myself when i was eight and readily attemped about once a month after that, i came out about my illness february of this year, college is unstimulating both intellectually and socially, medications do nothing, shrinks are as good as theives, inpatients are prisons, and the only solace is that with the strike of every second is that much closer to the end of my subjective experience.

i am flawed and valueless, my peers are flawed and valueless, the universe is in and of itself not worth emulating and is inherently valueless.
