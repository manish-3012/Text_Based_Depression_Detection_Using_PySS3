confusionI donâ€™t want to live, but I also donâ€™t want to die. Iâ€™m in this push and pull where I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m afraid of living. Iâ€™m afraid of dying. Iâ€™m also afraid of trying. I would just go ahead and kill myself but I care too much about the people around me and those who love me. I donâ€™t want to commit suicide. But I donâ€™t want to just sit by. While everyone I love is out living and loving and being loved, Iâ€™m here. Trying, but not trying. Living, but dying.
