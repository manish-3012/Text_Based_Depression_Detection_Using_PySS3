End of the road.After being raped in the military and told I "should have known" it would happen becuase I was gay I lost the will to live. I will never be the same again two men raped me and I was denied justice and branded a liar. The world has basically told me I deserved it. I don't want to live in a world that empowers rapists and silences me. I don't want to spend every day of my life wrestling with internal hate and shame about what they did to me. I am ready to die and be given the freedom in death that the world will always deny me so long as I choose to live. It's the only way to be at peace with all that has happened. I don't need to force myself to live to validate my strength any more. I can't take it I am ready 2 die before I take my anger out on the world.
