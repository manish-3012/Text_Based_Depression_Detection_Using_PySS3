I'm un my feelings again. Please someone say I'm not litteral garbage.I love listening to music, it's the only thing that makes me feel better when I'm depressed and want to die when I think about my life and how I fucked up before I was even born, but it's a double edged sword cause then I realize my voice is litteral garbage and I can never amount to anything even though music is the only thing I know. Everytime I think of what I can never accomplish I just want to swallow a bottle of pills and stand at the edge of a tall building and hope I don't wake up in this stupid body.
