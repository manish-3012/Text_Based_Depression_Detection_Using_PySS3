Fuck you.It was not nice living this broken life and Im done trying. Fuck you. Fuck everyone on this subreddit who pretends they care but don't. Fuck the people who tell me I'm just crying out loud for attention and that I'm a pussy. We'll see whos the fucking pussy. Im tired of my life being judged by people who don't care. This subreddit is a waste of your time. These people don't care about you at all. I don't care if you dislike this post. And I guess yeah, I did want some attention but I guess I never got it. I wanted attention because I wanted to be heard and I wanted some form of comfort but it seems to me to me that  that will never happen because everyone is the same and will always be the same. People are People. They judge, make fun of, and criticize you for even the smallest mistake. I may not have the strength to just be fucking me but I have a bottle of Advil's here to bring me peace.

This is for my mom. You always said it would've been better if I was dead.

And for the record if your reading this, I think Islam is a fucking joke that has controlled my life for far too long and Mohammed can go suck my 8 inch cock.

See you in hell mom.
