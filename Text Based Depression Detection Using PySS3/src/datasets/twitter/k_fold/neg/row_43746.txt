just stuff I need to get out. sorry for profanity.what am i going to do with my life. there's really no point. if i do well, there's nothing i gain because i'll die anyway. if i do poorly, i'm fucked. society, capitalism. they dont care about us. they just care about profit. and yeah obviously some random person on the train isnt going to give a shit about me, i get that. but i mean as people, no one with actual power to change shit cares. they just care about their fucking money, but not about other people who cant survive.

i'm not even someone who is fucked by this system yet. but it makes me so mad and i cant control it. i cant deal with it. but maybe thats also because i know ill be in that category soon enough. the best salary one can really find with a non-stem degree in the biggest city in the country i live in pays like $30,000 a year. if you're lucky. my boyfriend had some offer him $1800 per month. PER FUCKING MONTH. IN ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE CITIES IN THE FUCKING WORLD. i dont want to be a corporate slave. i literally cant. ill die.

 im college educated, projecting to finish my bachelors in june and then maybe do my schools five-year program and get a masters. but i cant fucking picture my life. and honestly idk if ill even graduate. i havent been able to focus on shit since last spring. last trimester was the first time i failed a class because i couldnt even write the fucking term paper. because im fucking lazy right? not because i cant find motivation because the world will be shit no matter what i do but BECAUSE IM A FUCKING LAZY PIECE OF SHIT, RIGHT? the fact that have life good and im privileged in my experiences and upbringing make it even worse, because it means i dont even have a real struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

i just want to be able to modify my body and appearance. but that would make me unemployable. because appearance matters so fucking much.

i feel like shit. recently i starting thinking about my ex and how we started "dating" when i was 17 and he was 28. i havent ever totally processed it. he wasnt abusive physically at least but i remember him saying he wanted to get married once i finished college. thank god i finally got away from him. ive been no contact for over two years but i still think about him sometimes. was he really a piece of shit abuser who took advantage of a young girl? its hard for me to say. because he had a shitty childhood. and he was a virgin when we got together. and i was the one who initiated sex. and he said he loved me. so maybe i was the one who took advantage of him. maybe im at fault for sending mixed messages like letting him stay at my place when he was on a trip to my city. i told him we were done. but he cried. 

&amp;#x200B;

i dont know why im writing this. im just so angry. nothing makes me happy. i have to fake being happy around my boyfriend (fucking awesome person btw) and my job and kind of my school but im just so. fucking. tired.

i guess there are two positives that im looking at right now. one, my cat. i love her so much. two, i have trichotillomania (pull out my hair) and its been three months since i last pulled out any of my hair. over the summer i was completely bald, like worse than george castanza bald. i had a one or two inch rim of hair from the front of my head near the sideburns to the back. it was all shaved off but still. now i have a full head of hair again, but its just like two or three inches long. so i have that going for me. but i feel like the negatives outweigh the positives.

&amp;#x200B;

i just want to cry and scream and hit my head over and over and over until it dents in because i cant take it anymore.
