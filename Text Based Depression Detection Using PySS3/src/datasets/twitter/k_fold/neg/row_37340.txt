I just cant take it anymoreI know there are people handling their depression and get over it but i think im not strong enough.
I dont know why im posting here, maybe because i dont want to to be totally unnoticed when leaving?
It doesnt make sense to post to random people when your about to quit but i still did it.
Today will be my very last day.
Bye i guess. You are all awesome. Stay strong.
