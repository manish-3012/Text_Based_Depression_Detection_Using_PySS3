My last week of tryingAfter this week I donâ€™t know what to do. If I donâ€™t land a job anywhere Iâ€™m gonna head out and do my thing. Tired of this stupid cycle of trying endlessly only to be rejected even though I have tried my hardest. I donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™ll put on my best face this week and of it fails then I give up.
