ConfusedI've been here for about a week now and while people do help, i feel... rather confused. Sometimes i feel "good" and other times i feel as if I'm about to die under the weight of my own despair...

It's more confusing than anything and while I am able to feign a smile for those around me... It's getting harder and harder to not think about the world being a better place without me around.
Thanks for reading.
