What do they mean?I hate it when people say, "you are only 20, don't kill yourself". So I'm suppose to tolerate more crap just so i can kill myself a few years later? What has my youth got to do with the crap i have to go through every day? The basis for living is being young? I'm not able to be young, whatever that is supposed to look like. I am far to depressed to "live young".
