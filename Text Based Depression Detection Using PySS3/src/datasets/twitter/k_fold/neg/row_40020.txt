I realized I didnâ€™t like my life all along.I realized how much of a huge disappointment I am, not working on the bad experiences I had, and letting myself be a worse person than I could have been, and just letting myself get hurt or damaged in the process. Iâ€™m pretty helpless on my own as Iâ€™m so used to depending on my parents for help, and didnâ€™t make much friends. Iâ€™ve sunk in my thoughts and thought too hard way too many times, it feels like I didnâ€™t try to make my life better than what it could have been. I graduated college, but Iâ€™m just very unsatisfied with what I made out of it. By imagining ways I could hurt myself, I somehow felt awake, motivated, and kind of giddy. Is it possible for me to turn my life wholly around? To make sense of what little I had and become independent and very successful?
