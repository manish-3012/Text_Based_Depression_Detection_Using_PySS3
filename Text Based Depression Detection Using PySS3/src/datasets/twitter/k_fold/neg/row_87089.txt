Well, I'm making my final plans. I'm going to get a haircut, wear my best clothing, and step away from life.I actually decided to end my own life about two years ago - a few months after the death of my beloved wife.

I have no living relatives, and a lifelong struggle with bipolar disorder and substance abuse issues has left me pretty much alone on this earth.

My wife was the Yin to my Yang - I enjoyed six short years of bliss and stability - her love for me and mine for her finally allowed me to be 'normal'.  I'm so happy I had those years, but alone I am both unstable and addicted - I don't do alone very well.

Interesting story - I decided in the Summer of 2015 that the first serious snowfall that required me to get out my shovel would be the triggering moment.  I'm old enough and unhealthy enough that I'm not really capable of clearing the driveway without assistance - and I figured that was the moment to accept my best days were behind me and take the final step.

Crazy thing though - the 2015-2016 Winter was the first winter in recorded history that a tiny swath of Northern Indiana where I live got no appreciable snowfall.  No snow - no suicide.

I pray for the courage to do this.  I've studied and thought a lot about how to take my own life, and I think I have made the right choice.

Only one real question remains - do you think I should wait for snow?
