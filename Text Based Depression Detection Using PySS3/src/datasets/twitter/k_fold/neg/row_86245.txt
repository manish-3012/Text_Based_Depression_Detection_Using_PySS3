Isn't living illogical and irrational? Life is a revolving cycle of temporary happiness followed by subsequent deep depressions, disappointment, and suffering, so why live? Why live a life where things aren't fair, life is hard, and everything you do disappoints and burdens everyone around you? The cruel realities of life will never change, we will all grow old and decay, everyone we love is going to suffer and die, most of our dreams and desires will never be fulfilled; living is chaotic, uncertain, and depressing. Which begs the question: why is it bad if I want to kill myself if I don't want to deal with the realities and constraints of life? I think it is a logical move on my part to kill myself because it's illogical and impossible for me to live in this world.
