My best friend wants to kill himself and I don't know what to do anymore.I've read everything there is on the internet about communicating with suicidal people and as much as I listen and try to be there for him, I'm not what he wants. He wants a meaningful, loving sexual relationship. I can't give him that and he doesn't have the energy to look for it anymore. He has a date set. He has his mind made up. I don't know what to do, I think he slipped out of my hands a long time ago and I just can't fight this. I have six months left with him, what can I do? 

Update: Thank you guys so much for your advice and support, I had a really successful conversation with my friend and we came to an agreement that he will finally see a therapist! I'm still on my toes but I think he stands a way better chance with a professional on his side.
