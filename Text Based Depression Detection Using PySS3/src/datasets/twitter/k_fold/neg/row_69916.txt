The things are just getting worse.I think this is my first time posting here... Whatever, sorry if my English isn't perfect, I'm not an English native speaker and I'm not in the best condition to think of it.

First of all, it's not like I'm depressed (because I'm not. My mother suffers mental illness and my parents hates each others (it's a very strange relationship) I'm not affected at all because of that. I just want to run away from my house, because staying here it's like staying in hell. 

Secondly, I have two best friends who has their own problems. One of them, lost her father this summer and he's in something like a depression but not that bad (he doesn't want to admit it tho) in the last months he told me that he wanted to self harm and I was always encouraging him to not do it, because I self harm but he doesn't know,  and I don't think it's a good idea to tell that to my friends. Knowing that, I also started to smoke some time ago and they hate that really hard (they don't know that I smoke) and today one of my best friends told me that he would kill me if I smoke (obviously not serious)

And, even knowing that, I was thinking always, almost everyday on killing myself, I planned to commit suicide next year. But this isn't new,  from long time ago my head was full of suicidal thoughts, and no one in my personal life knows it. And my two best friends have their own problems, and sometimes suicidal thoughts and they tell that to me. I don't know how to feel because I don't want them to worry about me, and at the same time I'm feeling like such a hypocrite because I always tell them to not do things like self harm or try to kill themselves... Why the life has to be so hard? 

I always try to look happy in front of my friends even if I'm not (almost all the time) because if I'm weak I'll can't protect them before I leave this world. 
Thanks for taking your time on reading this bunch of nonsense, hope you have a beautiful day.
