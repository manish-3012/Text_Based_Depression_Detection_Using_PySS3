I just don't see any other option. Everyone is better off without me.I'm 28 and stuck at a stupid low paying part time job. I've looked for other jobs that pay more but don't qualify for any of them despite having a bachelor's degree. I have no network to help me get another one. I'm 2000 in debt because I sought help for being suicidal. Now my friends and family are forsaking me because I feel sorry for myself too much.

Rest assured I will not go back to the hospital a third time just to plunge deeper into debt. If I'm that bad to everyone around me, then everyone would be better off if I were gone forever. I have a plan in place. It's just a matter of executing it.
