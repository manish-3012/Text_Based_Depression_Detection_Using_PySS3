I feel so unconnectedMy family is Christian and sense the event of my kidnapping and rape story happened I have been depressed and I became an atheist. I learned to see visually and not faithfully. So now I stand here wondering to myself, "God I am nothing to you, you let me fall down then stand back up only to fall down yet again!" If he wanted me around then why did my mother birth a ungratful child? I hate God for what he has done to me and I can't forgive.... but this to me is more then relooks beliefs it is because ever sense the event happened to me I've become someone I don't recognize, I could be a totally new human being. I feel so unconnected from God and from my family and from myself...
