14 days to liveI got scammed by a 'landlord' like a fucking idiot, 2 weeks from when my current lease ends I have nowhere to go. 

I am what corporations have graciously decided to call an 'essential worker' but I know nobody would care at all if I died tomorrow. I make $600 a month, part-time minimum wage, so my only choice in housing is subleasing, where nobody asks about your income.

I made a promise to myself months ago that if I became homeless, I'd kill myself. And now that's only 14 days away.

I want to live but it's fucking hard. I don't know that it's worth it. Why keep living just to be in constant pain? It's stupid.

I have 2 methods: a bridge over a river on my way to work, and the train tracks behind my apartment. Being homeless means the apartment balcony isn't a viable method anymore but I could always end it early, in which case I have my third and preferred method: a dive into the sunset from 12 stories up.

I wish I could die instantly. Right now. I'm fucking sick of life. Of pain. Of hope. This has to stop. This has to stop.
