Don't have anyone to talk toBeen alone forever, never a girlfriend or love interest, never one who returned my affections anyway. No friends except two or three high school buddies I see maybe once every couple of years. No money, no career and the future's looking grim. 

Moved to a college town recently and I constantly feel like I just stepped out of a time machine. In fact I feel just like Doctor Who, I'm really old but no one can tell and decades of solitude have made me really smart and really weird. 

It's becoming obvious that i'm not going to be able to make any friends around here even though there are finally people to talk to that I can almost relate to because even thouh I'm a textbook loser everybody seems threatened by me. I go to a party and I'll be eventually thrown out because some meathead thinks his girlfriend is in love with me. Which is fucking hilarious, let me tell ya. 

Thought I made some friends two nights ago but yep, before I knew what was happening I got punched in the face and chased out by 5 drunk shitheads. I can't even let my guard down around people I know and trust because time and time again they seem to wait for an opportunity to attack me, usually while sleeping. It's getting to be fucking repetitive but I've accepted ther's something about me that brings that out in people. 

And none of that seems serious anymore, what worries me is lately all I see are damaged people and starving animals and just needless pain.  After that guy decked me I really felt myself going over to the dark side. If I had seen who did it (sucker punch WOP!) I think I might have gone back ther and killed him. I can't shake the constant rage and I'm starting to worry about myself. 

Actually after writing this I already feel much better,  I'm going to be alright. Pardon the spelling, I'm typing on a phone. I just wonder how much loneliness a human (?) can take. 

Ha ha the captcha is asking if I'm human
