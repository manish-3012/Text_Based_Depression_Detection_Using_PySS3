Summer remembers another reason I want to kill myselfI[M25] hate the summer and not only because of this stupid hot weather. Friends are starting to make summer plans, which 80% includes going to the swimming pool or beach.

I do not dislike the water, but I hate my body. Not only I am ugly but I have a weird/disgusting body. I am white, like sick white(people even ask me if I have some kind of illness/cancer). I have weird feet with the toes in the shape of a claw. I have a bit of "pectus excavatum". And a lot of more things...

This is not the main reason I have suicidal thoughts but it increase them. I want to be able to enjoy like the others, to not lose friends because of my insecurity... It makes me remember that I wont be ever be a normal guy and that hurts a lot, I just want to be normal.

If you think I should just accept myself, you have not experienced to be criticized by others, the looks of pity and disgust...
