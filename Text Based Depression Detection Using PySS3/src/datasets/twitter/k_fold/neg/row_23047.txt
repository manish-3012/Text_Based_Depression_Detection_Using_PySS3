Do you ever feel like you donâ€™t matterLike, in school thereâ€™s a bunch of people saying their depressed. Being in a mood 24/7 because â€˜something bad happenedâ€™ but they donâ€™t tell anyone. And then thereâ€™s you, who try to talk about depression or wanting to end your life and people just say same? The people who donâ€™t listen to others problems because they believe that them feeling slightly upset about the smallest thing is more important than being suicidal? That happen to anyone else?
