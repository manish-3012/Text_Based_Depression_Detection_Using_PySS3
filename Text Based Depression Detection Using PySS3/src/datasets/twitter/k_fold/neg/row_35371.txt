Ideation without intent, suggestions?I have pretty frequent suicidal ideation. Like, contemplating the logistics of how I would kill myself and considering that I would like to, but without a serious drive to do so. Ideation is becoming more and more frequent - it used to be only when I was very drunk, but now pretty much every time I have a beer I'm thinking about it, and sometimes when I'm totally sober too. I would very much like to not be alive anymore.
