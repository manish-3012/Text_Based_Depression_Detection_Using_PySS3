The people that are telling me to go on living are the same people causing me to kill myselfI'm talking about my parents, i mean they aren't abuse or anything like that it's just i care too much about them. They definitely have they're flaws and thats it, my mom constantly screams at me telling me to work and of course i can't cause of my severe anxiety and my dad doesn't care or he just doesn't want to deal with me. Fuck my life I'll just end it as soon as possible, anyways I'm sicl of being human.
