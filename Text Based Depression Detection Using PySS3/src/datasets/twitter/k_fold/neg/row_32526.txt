I need to vent. I just NEED to vent!I not too long ago had a crisis line tell me they had to attend to people who genuinely had a crisis 

Well fuck off

I was ranting about how shitty my life was and why all of a sudden I am hating myself 

I liven a shitty home with shitty people, was abused all my life, sexually assaulted, bullied, and recently came out of a horrible relationship 

And then by this crisis line I am treated as if I have a case of vicim mentality 

Even my therapist feels the same way 

I am just done 

I cant do this anymore
