too weak to commit suicideI'm 17 and I've neglected my mental health so much over the years it's gotten to the point of me having severe social anxiety and depression. I don't feel like I deserve anything and I don't even want to try anymore but I know I am too weak to kill myself. I can't have a single good day without feeling anxious and unsure of everything. I have a wonderful boyfriend and I'm living with a constant feel of me not deserving him and I'm pushing him away like I sabotage most of my friendships and relationships. I really wish he found somebody else better than me, because I know for sure that his friends are more fun and interesting than I am. I don't want to try anymore, I wish I could finally end this. I don't even want anyone to feel sorry for me but I really need to vent
