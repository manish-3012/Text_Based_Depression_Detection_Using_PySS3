I'm a murdererI'm a murderer

I killed the girl

that I used to be,

&amp;#x200B;

The girl that used

to smile all the time,

the girl that used to

have a lot of friends,

the girl that I used to

see in the mirror,

&amp;#x200B;

Now she is dead,

her eyes are a

darker color,

and she rarely smiles,

and she doesn't believe

the compliments

that she receives,

because she believes

that they are just trying

to make her feel better

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a murderer

I killed the girl

that I used to be,
