I think I might end itNothing ever changes, nothing gets better and no matter how hard I work at bettering myself and bettering my life, all the fucking people I know who spend their day begging for money online or using their friends to get by or are just plain fucking assholes still live better than me. I used to weigh 460 lbs, I lost over 200 pounds and now weigh 220 and Iâ€™m still loosing. Iâ€™m still ugly and have a ton of loose skin that makes me look much larger than I am so I still get off handed comments all the time, even by family and friends who know how hard Iâ€™ve worked over the past 2 years. Iâ€™m legally blind, I lost my ability to drive and spent 4 years just trying to get ssi. I barley make enough to get by and just feel like an incredible burden to my gf and family, I have very sensitive eyes so all the treatment options didnâ€™t work for me initially or just were not covered by insurance, Iâ€™m trying again, I have another appointment on the 13th but I doubt itâ€™ll change. Iâ€™m ftm transgender and Iâ€™ve actually already started T and have moved forward to legally change my name and gender, Iâ€™ll get the decision back at the end of February but that still doesnâ€™t stop people from calling me,â€she,â€ or using my dead name. Nobody ever opens up to me and for the most part, all of my friends rarely talk to me unless thereâ€™s something I can offer them.Iâ€™m going back to college but idek what I want to do in life and Iâ€™m 26, so it feels like Iâ€™m just filling my time with useless pursuits and tbh, if the treatment for my eyes doesnâ€™t go through, my options are pretty limited. People always tell me that Iâ€™m making excuses because,â€blind people overcome obstacles all the time.â€ But I try, I try so fucking hard and nothing changes. I have severe anxiety, major depressive disorder, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, and it feels like the cards are stacked against me. I didnâ€™t want these things, I didnâ€™t ask for them, but they legit affect every aspect of my life and yet,â€Im an attention seeker who uses my illnesses as an excuse.â€ Iâ€™m not making excuses, Iâ€™ve done everything Iâ€™m supposed to do. I lost the weight, Iâ€™m working on treatment, Iâ€™m going to college, I transitioning, Iâ€™ve done every last thing I can do to be better and Iâ€™m still a poor, useless, ugly, pathetic nobody who burdens everyone around them. I wonâ€™t say people would be better off without me, but my death would legit have no impact on the world or in peopleâ€™s lives as a whole. I really just donâ€™t see the point anymore.
