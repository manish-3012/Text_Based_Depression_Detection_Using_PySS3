Even if ur getting pleasure from life - why live it? Youre playing a game that youre going to lose at eventually (its called death). We are all gonna die anyways so why put in the effort to sustain life?Im too tired to be doing this shit everyday. Even if im in a good mood i dont want to keep living. I know what my future holds: get a job, work for years, find some hobbies and interests, make some friends or a relationship, and so on. And my question is: whats the point? Were all gonna die anyways, and i dont wanna live til im 70,80, or 90. Id rather die young, until at least the drugs kill me. 

Im not playing this boring game called life. I want out early. I didnt ask to be here. I was forced to stay alive on planet earth. Whoever made all these planets and solar systems, etc. Clearly whoever made humans and life, they wanted us to live here. But im not playing by the rules, Iâ€™ll kill myself to teach god or whoever made this â€œrealityâ€ that your game of life is shitty. Fuck these clouds, fuck these mountains, fuck animals, fuck everything because all of these beautiful things are simply distractions from our true reality which is death.

Im not going to be distracted by consumerism, materialism, and all these bullshit things called â€œhobbies and interestsâ€ - i simply call them distractions from the truth.
