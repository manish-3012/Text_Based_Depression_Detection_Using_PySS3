My world is crumbling down, anyone wanna talk?I'm not suicidal but I'm pretty emotionally wrecked. Today through painful detective work I found out my girlfriend has been cheating on me for months and hasn't admitted it all she has done is deny it. This isn't the sole reason why I'm upset but for someone finding it out recently it's all on my mind. I know what suicide attempts are like, I have a scar on my arm from trying my first time and I was Baker acted the second time for trying. But let's just be clear, I just wanna get my mind off what's been happening in my life I'd rather not have someone talk to me solely because they're afraid of me killing myself.
