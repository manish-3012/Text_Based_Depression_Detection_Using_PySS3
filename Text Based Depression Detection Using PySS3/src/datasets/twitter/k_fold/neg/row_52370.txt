How am I supposed to ask for help if I don't want it?I'm very confused. I want to get help but I don't want to burden people with my problems. I want to be happy but I don't want people to think I'm weak for being sad. I don't want people to look down at me because I think about suicide. I just want to be happy. I just want to drink a magic potion and everything will be okay.
