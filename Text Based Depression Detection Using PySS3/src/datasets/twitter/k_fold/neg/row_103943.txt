My life is trashI literally hate everything about my life. I am lonely everyday and have nobody to talk to. Everyone I talk to and feel like we are connecting, ends up either ignoring me or just becoming a ghost and never responding again. It fucking sucks to feel so worthless to everyone and to have no friends or any relationships. I just wanna die
