I fear pain but I MUST die one way or anotherI lack the courage to kill myself, but I live every say with chronic breathing difficulty from a horrid, unsung reflux issue. It has cost me my independence, career, family standing and all possible quality of life, equally affecting me day and night. No cure is available to me; I have exhausted all treatment options after years of trying. Surgery may have helped, but 4 doctors have refused to treat me; they're now spreading the word cutting my only chance of being normal again away from me.

I have other problens too. I'm socially awkward, talentless, idiotic, selfish, evil all around. None of these would prompt me to want to die though - the LPR alone is enough. 

PLEASE teach me how to muster the courage to die! None of the nonsense about there being hope, there ISN'T ANY HOPE. I promise you that. I've been searching for a simple, painless way to die for 3 years now; I refuse to not ask for help any longer. I must die today. PLEASE teach me how.
