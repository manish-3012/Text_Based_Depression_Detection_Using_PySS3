Down to one person I have to live forFamily is gone now. They're alive, but I've cut off all contact with them.  


Friends are largely off on their own. They seem to be doing okay except for one. She's the only reason I haven't left yet. I'm hoping that she gets better (depression, she's had a tough run of things these past few years) so that I can finally think about going.  


Dying isn't so easy, even though we all do it eventually.
