Human instinctHello friends, itâ€™s been very difficult coming to terms with life. The world is very grim and it seems that there is no escape from the immense feeling of hopelessness and shame. I am nothing but another 21 year old man who is struggling to survive in this world. I really just want out.

I have used medication, talk therapy and Iâ€™ve even been put into a psych ward. I donâ€™t believe that we we all meant to be great. I happened to be one of the mediocre average people who have nothing going for them.

The only thing holding me back at this point is human instinct. I donâ€™t care for my family and I donâ€™t care for any â€œfriendsâ€ I might have. My only goal in life at this point is to overcome human instinct and get it over with. Iâ€™ve attempted seeking help but it is clear that no matter what I do it is all in vain. 

I hope to end my life one day. I really want this. My brain will try to rationalize that I should continue and suffer but I donâ€™t want it to. Iâ€™m ready to go. I just have to overcome this last obstacle.

Thank you for reading. Take care.
