I'm drowning in apathy.I dont care. Nothing makes me happy.  I even went zip lining (I get vertigo and am afraid of heights) and felt *nothing*. I've been faking it for my wife and kids, but I don't feel anything positive any more.  I don't want to kill myself, but the thought of enduring for another 30 or 40 years seems insufferable. 

I never wanted to see 30. Not that I actively tried to kill myself, but I definitely put myself in situations where meeting the reaper was a real probability.  Instead, I met my wife, traded in my adrenaline junkie card and focused on those things that are supposed to be fulfilling, and I feel nothing but tired, empty and over it.

If it weren't for my family I would probably be involved in a fatal car wreck or accidental overdose within the week.
