I am a useless person who sits in their room playing games all day or goes out drinking with friends and doesn't get a jobAt least, that's what my family have told me. I spend my time endlessly applying for jobs whilst covered in flea bites due to their poor ability to take care of the household pets. And now I'm told I'm untrustworthy, when all I do is spend my time running around for them.

Recently in my area stabbings have increased dramatically. I hope I get stabbed so I don't have to do it myself.
