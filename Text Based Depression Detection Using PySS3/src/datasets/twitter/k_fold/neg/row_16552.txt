Debilitating anhedonia, social anxiety, and social akwardness is making me extremely suicidal.I only have one true friend that I can trust and he doesnt judge me. I barley get to talk to him though. Talking to family is fine, but other then that its terrible. Talking to anyone else is a nono. I cant feel any pleasure and my perceptions moment to moment feel so messed up, I dont know what to do.
