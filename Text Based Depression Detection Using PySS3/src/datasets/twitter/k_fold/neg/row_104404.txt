My mom called me a hoarder, but Iâ€™m not. I just donâ€™t want to take care of myself anymore.Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was 7 years old. Iâ€™m 21 now. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for that same time as well. Iâ€™m still living at home because school is my first priority and my mom is â€œniceâ€ enough to let me stay until I can graduate and get a stable job.

My room is not kept. Itâ€™s messy. I donâ€™t have the energy to take care of it because I hate myself just as much. My catâ€™s litter box pushes out clean litter (itâ€™s one of those self cleaning ones that pushes it to a different compartment). So I took my detachable vacuum to it to suck up the litter crystals that fell on the floor. My vacuum wasnâ€™t working. It wasnâ€™t sucking up the litter. So I texted my mom to see if she could get it working again. I was actively trying to clean my room. I have been trying for the last few days. But I have no drive. She doesnâ€™t understand this.

She busted into my room and angrily took the vacuum from me. She looked at his litter and said â€œthis is fucking disgusting. Does your boyfriend know you love like this?â€ He does. Becuase I tell him about my depression, lack of eating and drinking water, and lack of cleaning my room. He knows itâ€™s a problem. But heâ€™s never mad at me because of it. He has depression too. He understands. She keeps screaming at me about how disgusting I am and how Iâ€™m a hoarder. Iâ€™m not a hoarder. I just donated 2 overfilled bags of clothes to good will a couple days ago. I put new sheets on my bed. I washed all of my clothes. I have a big bag of trash that I was going to take down to the garbage can with the old litter I was replacing.

I started to cry because I hate being yelled at. I break down. I was in an abusive relationship last year and so whenever anyone yells at me, I donâ€™t know what to do. She did â€œStop that shit. Knock it the fuck off. Youâ€™re a hoarder and thatâ€™s disgusting.â€ Iâ€™m not a hoarder. I promise Iâ€™m not a hoarder. I just hate myself too much. When I have the drive to clean, I do. But she never notices.

When she left my room, in order to not hurt myself like I usually do when she yells at me, I called my boyfriend so I could calm down. I told him â€œI have to be quiet. Sheâ€™ll hear me. My mom just yelled at me and I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m in the right state of mind right now-â€œ and then I jumped when she opened my door. She said â€œDonâ€™t be a fucking snitch. Donâ€™t be a fucking tattletale. Clean up this shit right fucking now. Does he know you live like this?â€ The only thing I could think in my head is â€˜yeah, he does. He knows itâ€™s bad. But he knows Iâ€™ve been doing good these past few days in trying to clean itâ€™.  But I knew that if I told my mom this, sheâ€™d get even more angry at me.

When she walked out again, I hurt myself pretty bad. I couldnâ€™t deal with it. I was harm free for a few months. The last time I hurt myself was in early July. I was doing so well. I didnâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m currently locked in my room and the thoughts are really intrusive at the moment. Itâ€™s been an hour but I still canâ€™t calm down. Iâ€™m panicking right now.

I have Touretteâ€™s syndrome and she would yell at me when I would tic uncontrollably. I learned to suppress it so she wouldnâ€™t be mad at me anymore. When I tell her about how I hurt myself or that Iâ€™m suicidal or have depression, she says â€œcall a therapist and set up an appointmentâ€. I donâ€™t have health insurance now so even going to a therapist is out of the question... She never offers words of encouragement. She doesnâ€™t tell me things are going to be okay. She doesnâ€™t know how bad my depression has gotten or how long Iâ€™ve been depressed for. Being depressed for 14 years... she wonâ€™t believe it because I act happy around her. She gets mad when I tell her these things. The only reason Iâ€™m alive right now is that Iâ€™m too scared to die and I care about my boyfriend too much to leave him. Itâ€™s really bad. Iâ€™m not a hoarder. I just hate myself too much to live well. Iâ€™m trying to calm down as best as I can. My room is still locked so she wonâ€™t come in. I donâ€™t know what to do right now. I donâ€™t want to be a burden on my boyfriend. But now Iâ€™m overwhelmed with my room. I took down the trash, took care of the litter, but now I canâ€™t vacuum because the suction isnâ€™t working. Sheâ€™s going to be so mad at me. I really want to leave, but I have no money. And sheâ€™ll get mad if I go to my boyfriendâ€™s house to get away from this and calm down...
