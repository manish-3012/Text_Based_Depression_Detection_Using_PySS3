wish it'd end soonerits getting slightly rougher rn. im kinda back to even cutting. I had thought of how I'd give it all up, and even expected suicidal thoughts to vanish...sorta. It was pretty stupid to think that way. I have nothing wrong happening in my life. In fact, from an outsider's perspective it might look good somehow idk tbh. But I still keep getting these thoughts. I'm overwhelmed. It's all so tiring, I have zero motivation to do anything. It's really important that I study these days...but I'm just rotting around doing nothing. I'm so ashamed of myself. I really hate myself. For the shitty guy I am, I probably deserve a much much worse life. I don't feel like facing my parents, who have so many expectations from me (for understandable reasons tho). I wish it'd all end soon. I don't know a thing that makes me feel genuinely good. I couldn't laugh even if I tried. Sounds crazy right? I probably deserve this tho. I've been quite a fucking dick in the past. If I suffer more it should be fair. still can't wait for the day when im allowed to cut my wrists open and fucking end it already. Yeah I'm a fucking attention whore and you can probably call me one rn too. and what the fuck is the point of this post? probably my retarded attention whoring ass looking for pity. I'm simply pathetic. I deserve lot worse than what I got. 

so well, my post deviated off tangents plenty times forgive me. It probably even gets contradictory many times, you can probably say its my rotten head causing it. sorry
