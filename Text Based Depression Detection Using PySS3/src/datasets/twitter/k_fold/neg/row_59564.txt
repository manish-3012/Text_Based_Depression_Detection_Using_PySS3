Too Bored to Live...I dont know what im even doing on this sub - reddit.I am a student in US. I was just searching up some new ways to get high off otc medication....  I dont know what is wrong with me. My mom had a stroke a couple of months back . She was a fun out going sort of person. It totally changed her.Enough about her. I cant seem to get myself to care about her well being.  Like i don't feel like calling her.  I have lost interest in all things that used to like. I am just plain bored with life . I mean for fucks sake i blew my college tuition on drugs. I don't know why i am so self-destructive.  I think i am doubting my sexuality too. Phew i have finally said it out.
Tl/Dr Too bored to live. Confused sexuality.
