I feel like my lifeâ€™s been leading up to me committing suicide but Iâ€™m to stubborn to go through with it.Iâ€™ve never posted on here, mainly because my writing skills arenâ€™t the best but Iâ€™m at the end of my rope, but here it goes. It was back in 2009, I met this girl on MySpace. I was an extremely awkward 17 year old and wasnâ€™t the best with girls. I dealt with depression since I was about 13 so that didnâ€™t help either. Anyways, this girl was beautiful, funny, and most of all easy to talk to. We hit it off well until I found out one thing. She was already talking to one of my friends. They werenâ€™t dating yet so I didnt think too much about it, I even let my friend know and he was fine with it, probably because of my awkward nature. Over time it became very clear that her and I had feelings for each other, weâ€™ve hung out a few times as friends and talked most nights, I didnâ€™t feel good about myself because I knew my friend liked her too but when youâ€™re always depressed and someone makes you feel worth something itâ€™s hard to just turn that away. One night after we hung out I walked her to her door and she kissed me. I was so happy that I didnâ€™t even think about my friend. Obviously that caused a rift in our friendship but Iâ€™m going to skip all that because we are absolutely fine now and thatâ€™s not the reasoning for this. We chose to not date at the time because I didnâ€™t want to be that guy to my friend anymore and they ended up actually dating so I left it alone. Jump to March 2016, her and I still talked and flirted every now and then, keep in mind that her relationship with my friend had been over for a little while now, and one day we decided to give it a try. She was living with her brother and his soon to be wife and I was living with a friend in the same town, at first it was perfect! My depression disappeared and I felt like I would never go back. We made the stupid decision to move fast because we thought that since weâ€™ve known each other for so long we would be fine so I moved out of my friends house and lived with her at her brothers until we got our own apartment a couple months later. She ended up pregnant less than 3 months after we started dating and now I have an amazing son but the problem was, when he was almost born I was terrified. I admit that I was far from the best person at those points in time, always stressed and my anger was getting worse, it didnâ€™t help that she was Mint the cleanest person ever but I knew that going into the relationship. Not long after I found her talking to another guy so I started working on my anger and I managed to get it under control (keep in mind that I never once hit her) but even after getting better I caught her talking to her another guy. Fast forward to about a month ago. Our landlord sold her property and so everyone living there had to leave. I had the choice of moving in with a friend or moving in with my dad, which is a place I never wanted to go back to. I love my dad but we have a horrible history when it comes to living together. She was going to live with her brother and his now wife so that we could have a â€œbreakâ€   But they ended up telling her nevermind within a week or so of needing to move out so against my better judgement I decided to move in with my dad so that she could come with me and would have a place to stay, my friends wouldnâ€™t let her come because as of that time I caught her talking to around 15 guys and they didnâ€™t like me being with her. I tried and tried to do better but everytime things seemed to be going well there would be another guy I catch her talking to and Iâ€™d slip further into depression. She left me three weeks ago out of nowhere while I was about to get this nice job that would have changed everything. Now Iâ€™m stuck at my dads with no car because she had the only one after mine was totaled, I couldnâ€™t take the job due to having no car, and the town I am in has very few job options and the one Iâ€™m at has no opportunity to move forwards. In other words Iâ€™m stuck. Luckily income taxes are coming in soon but that doesnâ€™t help my depression. I have an almost 2 year old son and his dad is living with his dad with no car and barely any income. I feel depressed and I wonder why it still hurts me that she left even knowing all that she did to me. I just wanted a family to take care of and come home to but I feel like life has always been pushing me to suicide and Iâ€™m to stupid to go through with it. I love my son but I feel like heâ€™d be better without me. Someone please say something thatâ€™ll motivate me to do right and stick around, Iâ€™m tired of doing nice things only to be screwed over and as much as I feel like suicide is the right choice, I donâ€™t want it to be....
