Second Update:Birthday Sunday i'm going to kill myselfAfter spending 3 days in the hospital the psychiatrists there sent me to a adolescent mental hospital where i stayed about a week. They helped me a lot and now i'm on a couple different meds for anti anxiety. I was just discharged yesterday and though i would update. My parents and I are getting along so much better, if i would have just spoke about my feelings i wouldn't have had to go through this mess to reach this relationship with my parents. Thanks everyone for supporting me!
