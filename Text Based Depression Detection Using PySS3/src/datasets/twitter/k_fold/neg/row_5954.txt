This is just...why do they do this.So, hereâ€™s the thing that is just hurtful. 


Have you ever been sitting there, next to your two most trustworthy friends ( or anyone at all ) and they start talking to each other? To where you have to to a reverse Micheal Jackson and lean back? If so, you know what Iâ€™m talking about. 

Tip: Donâ€™t fucking do this. This hurts so bad when you do. Iâ€™ve personally experienced this, and almost cried. 

Just saying, for friends of anybody who doesnâ€™t want their friend to die, donâ€™t fucking do this.
