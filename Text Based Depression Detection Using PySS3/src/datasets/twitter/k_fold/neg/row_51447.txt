It's not worth itIt's just not worth it anymore. I have nothing to offer. I don't have the means to do anything with my life. And I absolutely dread waking up every morning, so can someone please tell me why the hell I should continue doing this every day? Just because one or two people will grieve for a short period of time seems like a pathetic excuse if you ask me. I had to drop out of college because I can't fucking afford even the shittiest of colleges and I would rather blow my brains out than live with my parents for another year. I have every reason in the world to kill myself so I'm going to suck it up and actually follow through with it this time.
