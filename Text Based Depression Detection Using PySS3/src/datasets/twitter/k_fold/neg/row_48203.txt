I can't handle living like thisI'm going into my junior of high school and if everything is already so horrible right now, I don't know him I'm going to live the rest of my life out. 


I'm depressed, I have a small group of friends but I am 100% that thy all hate me. If I'm ever sad, I know they don't really care (they make it very clear). My parents have enough to worry about, and I know I am just a burden to them and everyone I know. I only being sadness and pain to people's lives, I'm sure of it. I have no self-esteem and I'm annoying, so I know people don't like being around me anyway. I have paranoid personality disorder, and it's only gotten worse. I always think that someone is trying to say or do something that's against me, and even when I try my best, I can't help but accuse them. I know I'm a horrible person, and I can't imagine living like this and feeling like this for much longer. I know this isn't going to get any replies either, so cheers to anyone who has to deal with this post sometime tomorrow.
