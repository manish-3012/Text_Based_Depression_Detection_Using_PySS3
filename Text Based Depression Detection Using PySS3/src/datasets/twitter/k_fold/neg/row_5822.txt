I Can't Do This AnymoreIn 2 hours the deadline for submitting outstanding work on my course will pass, meaning I automatically fail 3/4 of all the credits I've done this year. My tutors have been very nice and one of the two pieces of work was due in about a month and a half ago but had an indefinite extension, but that can't go beyond 5 (GMT) here. So I've totally fucked up.

I've been depressed since I was 8 and it's got worse every year - before I could at least do academics, now I just can't anymore. I ended up in hospital for a suicide attempt last year. I hate my life so much, and I know that only i can change it but I'm too fucking weak/lazy/whatever to do anything. I do a useless degree anyway and have no prospects of employment once I leave, I'm 22 and never had a job for fucks sake... and now I've fucked up my education, so I'm about Â£23000 in debt for that plus about 3/4 of that given by my parents that I've wasted.

Add to that a big problem with computer use (that I'm ashamed to admit because what kind of fucking loser ends up like that instead of something actually addictive like alcohol or drugs?) and I don't know where I am. It would be one thing if it was just me but I'm disappointing a lot of people including my family and boyfriend (who I love but we never have sex because I just don't ever feel like it)

Thing is I know I'm actually not much of a suicide risk because a) I wouldn't want to do that to my family and friends and b) I don't have the guts to go through with it.

I've had plenty of support from family, friends, whatever. I'm on medicine, doesn't seem to do jack. I'm to blame, end of.
