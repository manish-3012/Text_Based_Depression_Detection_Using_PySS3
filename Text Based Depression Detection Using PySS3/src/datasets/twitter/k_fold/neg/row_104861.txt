I want to overdose tonight, nothing left to do.Hey, no clue why I'd even type this out. Maybe I want help, I have no clue. But i'm trying to overdose and end my fucked life. Finding out the pills i've been stockpiling can't kill me. I'm crushed at this point, thinking of just walking out into traffic and hoping for the worst. 

I have no point of living anymore, the anxiety attacks have been going on the last 4 hours straight. I tried playing games and skyping with friends, but it didn't help. I really want it all to end tonight, and fuck it needs to. It hurts to even be alive, and I have no clue what to do. I've been to doctors, i'm on pills and therapy. They tell me things will get better, but I doubt it. I'm so lonely, i feel so selfish. I just need to die and stop all of this, as stupid as it sounds. I really just want to die, even while being scared of death for years.
