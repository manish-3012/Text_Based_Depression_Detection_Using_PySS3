I'm tiredI don't want to try anymore. I don't want to fail anymore. I don't want to be hungry anymore. I don't want to beg on the street to eat or get my meds. I just don't want to do anything. Nothing works out and nothing makes me feel better. I don't have any family or friends. Im just a fucking loser with no job or anyone who cares.
