I need someone to talk me down. Or just talk. PleaseI am a 25 year old mal-adjusted woman. I have been fighting for my life for 20 years. I truly believe that I am not worthy of living, and for that reason I spent the last 7 years in an unhealthy relationship. I'm not thinking rationally right now. But I just need someone to talk to. I'm On the verge and I can't fight any longer. Someone please talk to me
