I have weird fantasies of getting high off heroin then going on top of my roof and shooting myself in the head with a revolver.I donâ€™t know why I keep having this weird fantasy. I kind of enjoy some things in my life but itâ€™s a drag. I donâ€™t really enjoy living entirely. Father is a drug addict who only takes from us and is nonexistent. Brother is really close but way too selfish. Sister hates me. Mother strongly dislikes me and treats me poorly because I look like my dad. I have no friends. The only thing I have is a girlfriend and I love her to death but I think she just makes my life worse. She claims she loves me and weâ€™ve lost our virginities to each other but I think it was a mistake. I thought we both would love each other a lot but after we had sex she said it hurt and I jokingly said â€œdammit if the next time itâ€™s not better weâ€™re over.â€ she actually agreed and said yeah no kidding. That kind of made me want to run away. sheâ€™s gorgeous and I love everything about her but maybe she has different thoughts about our relationship. she said sex is important in a relationship and idk. but besides that iâ€™m just not happy.
