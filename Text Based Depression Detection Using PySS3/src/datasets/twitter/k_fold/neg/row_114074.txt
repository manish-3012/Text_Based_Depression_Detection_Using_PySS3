I'm tiredMy girlfriend and I of nearly five years split this month, I buried my grandmother last week, i'm failing in a PhD program I hate, Im thousands of miles away from another family member, my dad is on disability due to brain cancer.

I always thought growing up that 25 was going to be one of the best years of my life for some reason. Like i was going to peak. I turn 26 at the end of this month and i have peaked, at an all time low. Im lost, i'm broken, I'm tired.
