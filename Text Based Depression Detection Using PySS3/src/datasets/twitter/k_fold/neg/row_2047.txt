Holiday freakoutmay need to post a TRIGGERWARNING here, will mention things that may be triggering to some.

So, i'm freaking out abit. I have been almost fully clean for a year soon (on january 1st) but, the hardest day each year for me is new years (christmas isn't great either but i get to eat then so meh i can cope). Last time i "attempted" was 23.20 december 31st 2018, and i don't know how to cope with everything this time around.

So please, if someone out there shares my struggles with new years please let me know what you do to stay clean.
