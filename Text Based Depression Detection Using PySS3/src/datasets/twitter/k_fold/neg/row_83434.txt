WaitingWaiting for a nurse to call me back after calling the crisis team today.
I was in the hospital yesterday and told them I didnâ€™t feel safe with myself and they sent me back home anyway.
My mums just threatened to leave me for good during this because Iâ€™m trying to get help and not in the way she wants me too and then gets upset if I call her out on it. 
Iâ€™m so drained and tired but so disheartened after being turned away from hospital yesterday. 
Iâ€™m so scared that once I feel like there is no help out there Iâ€™m just going to down my medication. And I have a lot of medication. I also told them this. 
I donâ€™t know what to say to the nurse in the phone because every interaction with them makes me feel stupid and helpless. 
Iâ€™m so scared for my life and my resolve to try and stay alive is slipping away. 
I want help but I donâ€™t trust myself to go get it in my darkest hour.
