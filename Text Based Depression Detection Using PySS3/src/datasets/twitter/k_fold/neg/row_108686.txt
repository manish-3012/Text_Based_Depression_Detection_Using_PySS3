i don't want thisI'm a pianist. I've learned to play piano for 6 years now. when i was 6 my parents forced me to play piano whether if i like it or not, my parents always mad at me if i don't play the piano perfectly, they even slap me. Now everytime i play the piano, those memories keep coming back at me, making me feel sick and angry but also hopeless. I stopped playing for over a year. And when i started playing again, my parents called a new piano teacher. I want this to stop. I told my parents that i don't want to play anymore. And they said "the piano is all you have, you don't have anything else, you're not smart, bad at sports, and a crybaby" from that moment, i started feeling i don't want to live. I don't want to suffer anymore. I want to kill myself.
