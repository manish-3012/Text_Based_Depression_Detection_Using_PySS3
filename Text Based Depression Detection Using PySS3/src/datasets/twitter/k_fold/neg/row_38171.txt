I'm lossing my mind, I'm scaredIt's been a slow decline in my mind. words are starting to be jumbled. I'm struggling to understand things that used to be easy. I dont know if this is all in my head or real. All I know is I cant go on like this. I got a bottle of anxiety pills left. I can't afford any more. No insurance sucks. But if I start declining any more I'll post one more post. Saying good bye. Sometimes suicide is the best answer.
