I didn't do itMy plan was to commit today but I didn't. And I also (after my ibsf convincing me)  talked to someone close to me about it. She was upset but also comforted me, and I felt worse. Talking about it all just made me cry so hard, i have not been able to get my feelings out like that in a while. I've obviously had several urges today to commit but i have not. I've regretted that i didn't as well, I'm just focused on getting through today. I thought i would share, as I spoke to some people that may think I killed myself today.
