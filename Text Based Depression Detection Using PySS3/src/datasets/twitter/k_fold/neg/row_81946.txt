Drowning people need saving.. right?Me and my S/O got into it tonight, about something little I will admit... but we fought and now I feel so fucking terrible... I literally want to injure/beat myself to death.. I feel like he doesn't listen, like really really listen. I feel like he tells me shit he thinks I want to hear all the time and otherwise I get ignored. I think my feelings 90% of the time ultimately end up shoved off until i apologize for being how I am.(My depression, Amount of clinginess, My B.D.D/B.E.D, and my self consciousness.(result of b.d.(e)d.)  I get told constantly to work on my self and my own feelings in things, but how the fuck do I do this when I am literally DROWNING in my feelings. Someone that is drowning needs help, they're drowning, not purposely holding themselves underwater trying to die.  I am struggling, I need a lifeguard and yet I have nothing. I'm tired of feeling alone in this, I'm tired of being repetitive and saying the same stuff to even you guys.. I'm sorry.


I'm sad, seems my posts are getting closer together... Eh..
