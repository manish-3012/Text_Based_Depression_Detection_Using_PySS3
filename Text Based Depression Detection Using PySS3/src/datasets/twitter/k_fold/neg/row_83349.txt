I have nothing worth living for anymoreI drove away all my friends that matter to me and I can't ever get them back and ruined the life of the girl I love. I'm also slowly fucking up my relationship with my mum because of how depressed Ive been and she's the only thing I have left to live for. I don't know how much longer I can do this
