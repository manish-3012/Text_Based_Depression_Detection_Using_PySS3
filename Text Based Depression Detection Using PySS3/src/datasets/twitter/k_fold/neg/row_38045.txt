Can't fathom making it to 2018I'm sorry this won't be very coherent. I hate my life. I've made so many bad choices. I've done so many things I regret. I want to help others so I can justify my existence but I am so socially awkward I try to hide as much as humanly possible. Im 32. I could easily live another 32 years. Wtf am o going to do with all that time? I pray everyday that I'll die in a way that doesn't cause any one excess pain or burden. My family and my boyfriend would absolutely lose it if I killed my self. My sister would not ever recover. So I keep waking up. But this can't go on. I'm uninsured so meds are out. I starting taking some herbal shit but pretty sure it's useless. I'm sorry this post is so generic and just an echo of what has already been posted.
