I'm running out...I'm running out of something but it isn't patience or chances or choices. Something is being taken from me every time I am disappointed, every time I am reminded that my life is in shambles and there is very little I can do about it. I've been holding on to what little I've had of it since I graduated high school. You see, school was a distraction. It kept me from thinking about it. I tried to further my education but my parents couldn't afford to pay and neither could I. Working distracted me as well but now I only work a few days during the week and no one else will hire me. I have too much time on my hands. No car to take me to distractions and the television just numbs my mind. No friends. Nothing. All I can do is watch what little I have of it be taken away. I don't know what 'it' is and I don't know where to get more. All I know is I'm running out it and I'm afraid that when I do there will be nothing left for me. I will be gone. Everything and nothing will change.
