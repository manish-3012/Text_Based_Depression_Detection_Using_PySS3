My ridiculous fear and selfhate are a selffulfilling prophecy of failure and sufferingBecause I'm afraid of failing, I don't want to try.

Because I'm afraid of losing my girlfriend, I want to ghost her.

Because I'm afraid of being a toxic piece of shit I become so insecure that I'm the definition of toxic.

Because I hate my selfhate so much, it causes more and more, knowing very well that it will destroy everything dear to me.

Because I'm afraid of losing people important to me, I want to kill myself and seal my faith.

Oh how ironic.
