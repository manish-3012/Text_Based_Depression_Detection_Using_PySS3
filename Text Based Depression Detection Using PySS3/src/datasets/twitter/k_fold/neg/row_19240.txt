My depression has gotten worse.I can't hold back my depression anymore. I start spontaneously crying in front of my dad sometimes and he asks me whats wrong and I can't even tell him anything. I can't help it but cry a lot. I just sit there crying until I stop crying and I don't even tell him anything afterwards. It worries him but its so hard to talk to him about my depression and anxiety. I don't want him to know I want to self harm again but I can't hold back my feelings as much as I used to. I don't know what to do.
