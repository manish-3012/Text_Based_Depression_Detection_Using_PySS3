I need someone to convince me to kill myselfI (22f) have been dealing with depression since I  was about 11. And Iâ€™m honestly just tired and feel that I just burden everyone in my life. My family, my friends, my boyfriend. Iâ€™ve cut myself so many times, but am always so scared to just do the deed. 
Someone convince me please.
