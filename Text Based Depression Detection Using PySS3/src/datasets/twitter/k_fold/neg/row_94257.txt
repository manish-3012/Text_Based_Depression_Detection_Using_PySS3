I hate being trans.I just want to die. I don't know where else to post venting stuff like this so sorry if it's in the wrong spot. 

My family doesn't support me transitioning or even wearing a binder, at least. I can't even use men's deodorant without someone saying something. I can't move out because I'm medically dependent on my family, I have too many genetic diseases to get a full time job successfully while in college. 

I want to go on hormonal therapy and get testosterone, but it doesn't seem possible at this point. I just want my family to accept who I am and move on. 

I just want the pain to end and some advice.
