I donâ€™t know.Hello. I donâ€™t know how to describe what I feel, my head is a complete mess these last days. I donâ€™t know what to do with my life. Donâ€™t know what do do and think. Sorry if this writing is a little long, you donâ€™t have to read it all, but thanks if you do. Itâ€™s just a relief for my self to write something down and share, I donâ€™t know hopefully Iâ€™ll feel a little better then. English isnâ€™t my first language as well so sorry for that too. 

I just feel completely empty and lonely. Even though I have people around me who â€˜careâ€™. I donâ€™t know where to start but let me say, I have been feeling different for as long as I can remember. As a young girl is was afraid of others, crowded places and to be judged. I can remember a moment where I was like 5: there was some kind of a celebration at school I didnâ€™t wanted to attend to because I was afraid of other people (?). Mom let me stay at home. My childhood and teenage years are a blur, but this is what I remember where it all started. If I was afraid of something, my parent let me decide what to do. That caused that I am always on the background, even for now. I was thinking about suicide when I was probably 17/18. Wrote many notes. At that moment I didnâ€™t even wanted to turn 18 and just wanna die. Leave the world, because no one will miss me anyways. I went to collage, didnâ€™t felt at home. Had to go with the bus everyday, feeling so damn insecure and wanted to die so bad. Cried myself to sleep so many times. I couldnâ€™t compare myself to others. Still donâ€™t. I (somehow) finished school. Havenâ€™t got a driver license bc I thought I wouldnâ€™t be here for long so it wasnâ€™t needed. I didnâ€™t had the money as well.

Iâ€™m 27, and still here. Nothing changed in those years. I feel ashamed. Old school friends are getting married and having children .. this voice in my head says I donâ€™t deserve this so why comparing myself to others. Itâ€™s the only thing I know. I went to a psychiatrist a few years ago, didnâ€™t helped at all. They kinda forced me to be in this group with other people I didnâ€™t feel comfortable with at all, I had nothing in common with them. I was mad. Still taking medication which also doesnâ€™t help imo. Iâ€™m so disappointed in my self. Why didnâ€™t I take my life away when I was 18!? Ten years later: Iâ€™m not living but surviving life. Escaping reality.

I absolutely never know why I felt this way. Those talks with the psychiatrist didnâ€™t help because I myself even didnâ€™t know what happened in life that make me feel so disgusted about myself. About a week or two ago I came across an article about emotional abuse/neglect. I felt like my heart was sinking and at the same moment everything felt in place. My parent didnâ€™t support the things I did, never took me serious when I was afraid of things that seemed to be normal, or the things I was excited about. Never focused on the things I found difficult at school or helped me with that. This has lead to so many things as an adult, I feel stupid and unneeded. We never went on vacation as a family, they were always focusing with their own business. I still love them, donâ€™t get me wrong. Iâ€™m just disappointed and wish I could do this all over again.

There are so many more things I wanted to write down, but I feel like a burden and donâ€™t want to bother you all with my stupid words. Iâ€™m sorry. I just hope Iâ€™m not the only one. I hope thereâ€™s one person who reads this and thinks: finally, Iâ€™m not the only one. Who experienced the same, and I want to tell you that I love you and Iâ€™m proud youâ€™re still here. Because living this life when you feel you donâ€™t belong, I canâ€™t tell you, itâ€™s not easy.
