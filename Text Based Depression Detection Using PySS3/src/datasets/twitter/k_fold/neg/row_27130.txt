I'm ready to be free. I'm not ok.Free from all the abuse I've had to suffer in this short stupid life. 
Free from the paranoia circling in my brain for the past 7 years because of the 4 men that held me down and raped me.   
I should be over it by now.   
And for some stupid reason I'm not.   
And for some stupid reason I haven't been able to say no to people since. I'm afraid that they will hold me down and beat me until I can't fight them anymore.   
So you want to call me a slut. I guess that's what I am.   
  
My roommate climbed into my bed last night while my fiance is on a business trip. He climbed into my bed and initiated something I didn't want, but I was too afraid to say no.   
Because I'm a fucking coward.   
  
I called to tell you what happened. I cheated. You want me to leave.   
  
I'm not ok.
