Trans woman who hates herselfI absolutely hate everything about being trans. From a young age I never understood  the segregation of the sexes and why I couldnt just be with my girl friends. why I couldn't be with my best friend in gymnastics, why I couldn't figure scate and was forced into hockey. I never fit in as a boy and they wouldn't let me be a girl. I can never be a man or a woman I've tried both It doesn't work I'm just an in the middle freak in a society of low brain function. 

Every night I have to go to bed and take a shower in a body that I absolutely despise that does not fit how I feel at all while half the world tells me I'm crazy.

All I want is to be buried in the ground and return to the earth I don't want an afterlife I don't care for religion I just want to be turned off and my body to decay.
