I ruined everything with the person I loveIt all happened when we were on vacation from college. She had an argument with her mother and her mother took her cellphone, so we weren't able to comunicate. After some days, I thought she was just busy, and only sent her 2 messages. But, after a while, I began to think that she didn't want to talo with me anymore, and I started feeling depressed. I didn't have anyone to talk during vacation, because my best friend was really busy(and she got even busier later, so I just spend all the time I'm not at college in my room), so we didn't talk at all. After a while, I just felt horrible, each day that passed made me wanna die more and more. After some time, she appeared and told me she was without a cellphone, and disappeared again. By the time she told me that, everything had lost its charm to me.
When we returned to college, she was acting really strange, she was ignoring me, and broke up with me. After that, she blocked me on everything. By each day that passed I was feeling more depressed, I started really hating myself, and I didn't even feel any pleasure from going out with my friends anymore. I can't concentrate on classes anymore, and everytime I tried to talk with her I just wasn't able to see what I had done, as I was feeling really confused. Everytime I see her, I wanna talk with her, but I just feel paralyzed when I try. We see each other everyday. It has been 2 months since we broke up, and I really can't take it anymore. I just plan on ending it all on the weekend, but I wanted to at least apologize first...
