I just broke up with my partner. They told me they are suicidal. What to do?This isnâ€™t about me, and I wouldnâ€™t be posting here if I didnâ€™t feel like I was totally out of ideas. Really sorry about this, everyone. 

My (now ex-) partner and I have been having an increasingly rocky relationship, and tonight I decided to end it with them. Weâ€™re both college students, and I came to their dorm to talk about it and break the news. We sat here crying for a while, and eventually they let me know that theyâ€™re not sure that theyâ€™re going to stay alive when I leave. So, Iâ€™m not leaving their side until I can figure something out to ensure that theyâ€™re safe. 

Theyâ€™re a freshman, and they donâ€™t have any close friends here at school. Theyâ€™re from across the country, so any close friends or family are a couple time zones away. Iâ€™m by far the person here who is closest to them. 

They also donâ€™t have any money, so a hospital stay would put them in a lot of debt that they likely couldnâ€™t repay. Theyâ€™ve begged me not to do this. 

They have a really bad relationship with their parents, and their mom has been abusive their whole life and has routinely denied that they struggle with mental health issues. Their dad is better, but always ends up reporting everything to their mom and then they have to deal with their mom anyway. They donâ€™t feel at all like they can talk to their parents, and if they end up in the hospital, they donâ€™t seem to think their parents will pay for it. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m not leaving them until I reasonably believe theyâ€™ll be safe, but Jesus fucking Christ this is hard for me. Any suggestions??
