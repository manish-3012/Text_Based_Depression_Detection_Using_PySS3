I recently got the news that a guy that I went to high school with died.I wasn't particularly close to him; he was more of an acquaintance than anything. He just dropped dead suddenly and unexpectedly while he was at work. He was only in his late twenties, the same age as me.Â 

A few of my friends from high school texted me about this guy's sudden passing. All of them said things like "This is really an eye opener about my own mortality" or "This really goes to show that you should live life to the fullest, because you never know when you could just drop dead suddenly".

All I could think was, "I wish it had been me that died instead of him."

I have a beautiful wife and an adorable dog and a great apartment and yet all I can think about is how much I want to die.
