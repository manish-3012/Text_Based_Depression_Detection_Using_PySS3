Iâ€™m just over itI feel like I continually am dealing with blows to my well-being and Iâ€™m honestly just so tired. Iâ€™ve lost so many people close to me. I have an incurable STD, I feel like no one will ever love me and that Iâ€™ll never truly have any form of happiness or success in my life. 

Thinking of taking a ton of sleeping pills and going to the river and just float away.
