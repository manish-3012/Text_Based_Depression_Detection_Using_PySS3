I don't want to do this anymore.I don't want to be alive anymore. I know I only have to make it another month before I can get help, but I don't think I can do it; I don't think I want to do it. The reality of taking my own life seems more than a choice; It seems like the only possible end result and the thought of it doesn't even bother me. I don't care that I have family or friends; None of them care about me anyways, and even if they were to be upset over it, their sadness wouldn't last for long. I'm failing college because I'm entirely too depressed to get out of my bed and get my ass to class most days. My parents' anger over my GPA means nothing to me. Actually, I don't think there's one thing in my life that matters to me anymore. I don't know why I'm posting here. Maybe it's because I don't plan on leaving a note. Whatever.
