Anyone feel like they aren't in control?Does anyone feel like they aren't the one in control of their suicidal impulses/ideation? Like it's not like I have been so depressed for so long and have just finally decided I cannot go on (although I have been dealing with depression on and off for about 18 years), but more like I am suddenly taken over by an intense urge to kill myself and I am not really in the driver's seat? This has been happening more and more to me and especially when I had a bad med reaction mixed with hormone issues, felt like I could barely control myself, didn't really care, and then when it passed looked back on it as strange. I wonder if at some point I won't be able to stop it, because it is not even me when it happens.
