Need Help Dealing With Sertraline WithdrawalI recently stopped taking Sertraline because I have had no libido for 8 years, and I am now nearly 28. I fear if I remain on it I will be alone forever and that terrifies me. 

I live in Florida currently because I moved here two years ago - I wanted to make my hobby a career. Somewhere sunny that I can be outside all the time really appealed to me. 

While I was here i met a girl at my office who I really liked and admired, but she is moving away now. I never hit on her because I didn't want it to affect my job and the support it provides for my yet-to-launch business. 

When I heard it hit me hard, because I have quit smoking, hit the gym, started talking to other girls and improved my hygeine. 

Now that she's going, I feel like I will not meet another girl like that here. Now that I am more interested in sex I have been less interested in fishing, I guess it developed as a coping device because I started taking the medication when I was barely in my 20s and I guess fishing became an obsession the way sex is to normal people. 

All I know is I am 28 and have sunk the majority of my life into something that I don't even want anymore. The person who gave me the courage to turn my life around is gone and I am not willing to go back on medication.

I have been considering suicide very strongly and the only argument I can come up for why I shouldn't do it is because it will make my parents sad. They will be dead and gone in 20 years, so I can do it then, but I don't want to live through this pain for another 20 years.
