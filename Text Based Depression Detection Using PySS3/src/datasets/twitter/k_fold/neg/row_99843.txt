I wonder if I die, will anyone come to my funeral?While I'm still alive. People never love me unless I provide something to them. They always ignore me, leave me, reject me or expel me from their lives. so I just wonder if I die, is anybody coming to my funeral? or will I just being left to died alone and maybe it takes several days until police officers found my dead body and people l finds out that I have died.
