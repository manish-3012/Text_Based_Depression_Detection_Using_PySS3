I'm okayEverything is fine, if I miss her or if I'm anxious I have to sleep.. But I just woke up, I can't sleep, I can't eat it feels like it's gonna make me vomit, people here comme because they still have a little flame of hope, right?

My new girlfriend doesn't wanna hear the story about my ex, about how I fucked everything up, about how I loved her more than I love my new girlfriend.

I'm anxious, no i'm okay Actualy, I just have to sleep, but I just woke up, but I need to sleep otherwise I'll do it again, I can't breathe, I can't breathe, Ian breathe, I can't breathe

I feel like my problems aren't enough for someone to give a shit, people only talk about them like selfish, and i feel selfish for doing this right now i don't have the right to our my problems on some face of people who have clear problems, bigger than I have. I need help but I don't because it's not enough for someone to finally help me. I don't have money for a therapist, I can't talk to my new gf she's happy and I don't want to be selfish and ruineverythinng again with my anxiety

I'm okay, I'm gonna sleep, but I just woke up, but I'm okay, I can't breathe
