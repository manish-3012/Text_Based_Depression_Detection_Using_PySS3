My friend killed himselfWhat the fuck am I supposed to do? I'm baking cookie brownies for his family and I'm going to make art of him. But how am I supposed to feel? I cried a lot last night, and we weren't that close but I saw him every morning when we were in school. I gave him rides. We were friends. He was my friend. What the fuck could I have done? What can I do now? How am I supposed to deal with this?
