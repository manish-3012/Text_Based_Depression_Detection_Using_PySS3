I'm giving my life one more monthThat's it, if my doesn't get better in one month I'm ending it all, I've tried to kill myself before and it hasn't worked out, but one month from now I will make sure I am dead so on may 5 2017 if my life doesn't see any positive improvement I'm going to kill myself, I am incredibly useless, unimportant, unlikeable, unattractive, untalented I'm everything negative in a person so I don't see a point in continuing
