28 year old KISSLESS virgin I constantly dream of suicide tell me i'm not so bad off please...Hi there fellow redditors,
As the title question suggests, this is what my life has come to [note: I don't feel the need to use a throwaway for this because I've already mentioned in a previous post on another sub that I am 28 and never had a life of my own] Anyways...due to unforseen circumstances my Grandparents home no longer has guns in it, [sold for money we really needed] and since I don't have my own money, I wouldn't buy one for this even if I wanted to...I'm so fed up and frustrated with life but I could never make the drive to my nearest city [I'm in East Texas so whichever city you think that is I'll just let you all guess.] with a large enough building! I would die on the way just driving over there! [note: I am a very crappy driver due to my circumstances] I somehow need enough money to drive JUST outside of this city and then pay someone to take me the rest of the way to said largest building! Redditors, please tell this old man his situation isn't as bad as I think...otherwise i've really decided to do this...I just need (roughly) forty dollars of my own free and clear money. BTW; this thread https://redd.it/1cbs9e pretty much confirms everything I feel.
P.S. My pattern baldness/uncut penis/annoying voice are the primary reasons for me wanting this.
tl;dr - don't own guns and gun based suicides are unreliable. I also don't have the money to even pay someone to drive me to a tall enough building...but I desperately want out of this life!
