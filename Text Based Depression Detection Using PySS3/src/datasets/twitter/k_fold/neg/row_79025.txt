My marriage is failing, my life is overI told my husband I wanted to kill myself and he went and told everyone he could. Iâ€™m ashamed and embarrassed on top of the hopeless and lost feeling I had already. Idk what to say. Iâ€™m at my parents now and I feel badly about wanting to die here but I donâ€™t want to wake up tomorrow.
