Don't even care anymore. Advice?So yeah. I've pretty much grown tired of it all. The constant questions of what if? whenever I think about what would happen if I just upped and shot myself - would I go to the big paradise in the sky, or what?

Anyway, I've never really found it easy to make friends. Always tried, but my social anxiety and my tendency to overthink things and panics just leaves me in such a bad state. And then, I decided to see if some of my old friends were doing great. They were, and here I am, struggling to maintain basic connections with any of them, while they have tons of people to rely on, and to support them.

But after my immediate family goes, I'm screwed. No one will miss/care about me, so there's no real point in trying anymore.

So yeah. I'm incredibly sorry about bothering you guys with this, and hell...maybe you can convince me to wait until it's my turn to die by God's terms, and not my own. (I'm somewhat of a Christian - so again, please do forgive me on that end.)
