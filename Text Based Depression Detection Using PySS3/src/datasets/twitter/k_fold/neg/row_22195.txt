So many times I would have wanted to end it but I just can't(sorry if this doesn't belong here)

There have been so many times I would just feel like killing myself but I just won't be able to do it myself  because of my mum. I can't seem to think of her being lonely or crying for me. 

Right now, I don't care what happens to me. If something were to happen that kills me, I wouldn't even care.

I don't even know why I'm alive.. I'm probably just living for the sake of others I guess.. I don't know.
