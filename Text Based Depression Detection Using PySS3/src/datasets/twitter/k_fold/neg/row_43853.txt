I don't know what is wrong with me.I wish I knew what was wrong with me. 

I used to be so happy, I would laugh and smile all the time without a care in the world. Now I am almost always depressed. I have no motivation for anything anymore, even for things I used to love to do. I don't hang out with friends anymore. 

I have a girlfriend but I am too much of a pussy to do anything about it, I don't go on dates with her on kiss her much, I want to but I just lose my courage when I am around her. I just couldn't handle anything else in my life going to shit. 

I would always get all A's on my report cards when I was younger I wouldn't even have to try now I barely pass any of my classes. 

I have no good skills, I am a useless piece of shit that is wasting oxygen and food.

Edit: Upon further thought I honestly can not think of anyone that would care if I killed myself.
