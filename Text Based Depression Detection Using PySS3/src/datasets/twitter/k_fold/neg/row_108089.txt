Hi, I'm SuicidalI'm afraid to admit this to anyone I know in real life as I don't want to worry or scare them. It's not like I have a plan to kill myself in the near future, but I've been struggling with suicidal ideation since I was 14 (F19). I consider myself as someone who has a good life--which makes me feel so bad that I have mental illnesses. No matter what pleasures I have access to, life feels meaningless and I don't value myself. I feel like I am alive for the people around me who love me. 

I sincerely hope that if you're reading this that you start to feel better. Suicidal ideation is some of the worst thoughts ever and I send my love to you. I'm just posting this to get it off my chest and maybe find some support/community.
