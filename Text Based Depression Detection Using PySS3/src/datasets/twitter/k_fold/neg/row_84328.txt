âš ï¸ TRIGGER WARNING âš ï¸i donâ€™t know if there is a point to putting a trigger warning but just in case it stops a person from being triggered then i will do it anyway 

iâ€™m going to kill myself next week. thursday to be exact or at least i think it will be thursday i guess i wonâ€™t know until i get to that day. iâ€™m f17 and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on what i should do with my last week? iâ€™ve already had my favourite foods and iâ€™ve made an instagram of all my memories and experiences so that they wonâ€™t all be for nothing and other people will be able to remember who i was. 

i need to clean my room but itâ€™s such a mess itâ€™s overwhelming to even think about starting to clean it but i know i must because otherwise my family will be left to clean it up after i am gone. 

iâ€™ve already told camhs (a uk mental health service) and my school about my suicide plan. camhs havenâ€™t done anything i havenâ€™t really heard back from them since i told them and my school introduced me to a safeguard person but thatâ€™s it. i just thought i would add that so you guys know that iâ€™m trying to get help before i die if only just so i can say 100% confidently that i tried. 

anyway i donâ€™t want to be depressing or cringey i was just wondering if there is anything i can do to make my last week exciting? i suppose? basically just a bucket list of things to do before i die :)
