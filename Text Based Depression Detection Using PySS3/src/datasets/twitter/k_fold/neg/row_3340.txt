Obsessional thought patterns over my own stupidity leave me no optionI  posted anonymous pictures on a nsfw sub under a different name when I was in a horrible place mentally, came to my senses a few months later and deleted all the pictures and deleted the account. Like a complete fucking idiot I didn't realise Reddit archived everything that is put on here. Including deleted nsfw content. I've contacted Reddit and they've been great and told me they did something behind the scenes and things should be gone from Google, but they aren't. It's all still there. Everything. Google won't or can't remove it saying it's on reddit.

I'm now seeing the only way out is to end my life, it's become all consuming and all I think about when I'm at work, when I go to bed, when I walk the dog, when I do anything all that's in my head is those photos and how they're going to screw my life up and stop me getting a job stop me getting a partner stop me having children. I have got fixated on how the more I chase for removal the higher the likelihood is they will get bumped up the Google rankings or into the public sphere and leaked out to people I know. I've had therapy and it hasn't helped. There is nothing that will stop me ending my life now.

So I've decided once I've set everything right here tomorrow I will go to the train station and step off the platform.
