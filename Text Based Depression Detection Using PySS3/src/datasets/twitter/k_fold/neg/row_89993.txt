Why should I just keep silent and stay bullied?HR reached out to me this Thursday wanting me to sign an agreement so I can leave the company. The whole reason is just I don't get along with my boss. But I got I go in the company first and didn't do anything wrong! While in the other hand, my boss has been bullying me and other team member since he got here!
