Tomorrow Night's the NightMy last therapy appointment will be by phone tomorrow. I owe myself that, I guess. I owe my family that. After this useless gesture? I have a date with a local bridge. And the pavement below it.  


This quarantine has just highlighted everything wrong with me- I could have all the riches and luxuries in this world, and it still would not be enough. This flesh, this human body, is too much. I can't fucking stand it. Everything is wrong. This flesh is wrong. I want to be gone, to cast off this shell of meat and be free of this crushing dread, of all these expectations. I fucking hate this world. I want to be anywhere but here. I want to be anyone but me. I'm tired of living for fleeting distractions, for the next video game or episode or movie. It's a temporary anaesthesia for a gaping wound that's been festering for a decade. I don't know why I'm like this. Maybe I'm just crazy. I'm tired of disappointing people. I'm tired of this body. It's too much.

I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry, Dad. I wanted to be good.
