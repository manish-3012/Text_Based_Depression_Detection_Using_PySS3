I'm DoneI give up. Im fucking done. I'm done not being listened to. I'm done being a burden. I'm done getting yelled at, called a cunt, having everything thrown in my face. My husband fucking broke me and now I'm a bitch for not fucking being stable. Fuck this. Fuck it all. There is absolutely nothing that I'm doing that someone else can't do better. So why even stick around and try.
