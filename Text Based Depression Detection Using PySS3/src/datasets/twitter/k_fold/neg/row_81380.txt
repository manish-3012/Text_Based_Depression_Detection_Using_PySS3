I'm going to start writing my suicidal fantasies on Google docs. I'll just share this one and any other good ones I have.I can't tell anyone I know because they'll tell my parents who'll make me move home and that'll make me far more depressed. Even if I could trust anyone to keep it secret, I feel like enough people are tired of hearing my shit. 

Anyways, I was laying in bed for a couple hours, and I came up with a scenario where I end up killing myself. The background is that I've already become a very successful, altruistic person. I've led humanitarian efforts, but people dug things up from my past that make me a laughing stock/pathetic. Nothing violent like rape or murder. Just petty shit that's embarrassing. 

Because I'm really rich, I can hire assassins. We walk up a hill with a tree on top in the middle of the night. They set up a livestream, and one of them films the other one mutilating me with a knife. I keep screaming "Never forgive me!" and right when it looks like I've had enough, they ask me who it is I'm trying to spite. I, with blood streaming down my face, just scream with full sincerity "I HATE ME" and she finally slits my throat.

EDIT: I'm not a good writer. The visualization in my head is pretty wicked though.
