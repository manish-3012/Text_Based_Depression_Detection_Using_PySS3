What to do what to doWell let's start this off by saying. I have been staying at home this Christmas alone Watching TV, hungry because I have no money for food. Staying on my ex gfs couch because I owe her money before I move back to Washington on Friday. I owe her money because when my dog of 5 years died of rat poison ingestion I did not have a job to pay for him cremation... I haven't seen my family in two years. My father thinks I'm a failure. I don't drink I don't do drugs.... I just prefer to be alone... almost always... my mother passed when I was young and I'm just listing things idk what I'm even putting anymore. Can't afford therapy and no insurance. I make close to nothing at work and find my anger out of control almost always... I guess I'm asking what are some ways I can pull myself out of this 5 month depression... because I don't think I can take this anymore....

This is not my first Xmas alone... this is my 6th year by myself and I am sick of it
