I don't know if this is normalI've noticed it even more recently, twice today even, sometimes when i look at things i imagine how i could use those things to harm myself. For example, in my school there's this place really high up that isn't really locked off from students (i'm not good with descriptions bear with me) anyways i looked down it today and i sat on the edge and i just imagined how it would be if i jumped from that place down, or if someone pushed me off and then today i went for a walk and i looked up at this high place and again i imagined climbing up to the top and jumping down head first. When i'm with blades or knives sometimes i'll cut myself other times i'll poke myself with the tip of the knife and just imagine running myself through with it. Is this normal or is it a cause for concern? Also i'm not averse to dying, if i had the option to die this night i'd take the chance. I don't see a reason to live, in this world where the future seems bleak.
