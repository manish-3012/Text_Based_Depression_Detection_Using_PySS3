Continuing life....First of all, I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m here, usually I just kept everything to myself, but now this thoughts is just keep coming now, and internet no longer provide me answers or motivation.
And I believe talking with friends or family isnâ€™t helping but make me feel worse. So I avoid my social medias. They may know my username which I usually use for games, but doubt they use reddit or even here in this subreddit. So here I am with you guys, good strangers.

Now, what am I ? I canâ€™t even describe myself. Iâ€™m scared of people, scared to try, scared to communicate, pessimist, feeling worthless because I canâ€™t do anything properly in life.

Iâ€™m at the age need to find jobs, but with social anxiety personality, I canâ€™t even talk properly, every interview end up bad, and every new interview always remind me of how all the previous went, and fail again. I tried but always chickened out, ending up scared to even trying anything new. 

What worse of all ? Iâ€™m a man ! Do I even have future ? So far I donâ€™t dare to even look for girlfriend because
1. I feel I know they will left me when they get to know me better, and end up gossip behind me and destroy my image in the community. 
2. With slightest small possibility I found one that wonâ€™t left me, that make me think I destroyed someone daughter future. They deserve better life being other normal men than being with me.

So what to do.... I just lost my father last month. So the only one keep going in life is for my mother, I want to make her proud, want her to be happy, donâ€™t want waste her sacrifice for me, but I seem failing endlessly. Iâ€™m feeling terribly sorry for her hard work raising someone like me.

Iâ€™m tired living like this. Feeling this way. I could no longer find any enjoyment in this life. I usually play games to shake off this feelings, but now I canâ€™t even get myself to play games, nothing seem entertain me now.
