GoodbyeI've decided that I'm doing it tonight. My first day at my new job and realized that I can't do this anymore. I don't wanna jump from one retail job to another. This isn't what I want my life to be. This doesn't make me happy. I've accepted that I don't really have a purpose and I'm fine with letting go.
