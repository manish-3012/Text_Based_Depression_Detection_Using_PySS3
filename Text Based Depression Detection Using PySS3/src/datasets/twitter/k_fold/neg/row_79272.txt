I'm thinking about killing myself and I just want adviceI have been wanting to kill myself more and more and currently I am 10 and male tbh I just want someone to talk to and I feel really bad for posting this because compared to what you guys are going through I have a perfect life.because I am 10 I really can't contact a hot line or get set up with a therapist without my family knowing and my dad would probably just tell me to man up,my mom would try to help but would have tons of anxiety due to my little brother also talking to my mom about suicidal thoughts so I don't want to talk to her,and my little brother can't keep a secret,and my older half brother left when he was 16 or 15 maybe 14.I just feel like a failure because my dad and mom and brother always made me seem smarter than I am and they have really high expectations for everything my dad expects me to be some genius super strong bodybuilder who is going to live to be 100 and pretty much all my friends are just my friends because I am fat and they can crack jokes about me.
