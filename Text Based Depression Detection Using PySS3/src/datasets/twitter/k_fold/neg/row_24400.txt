I have to go soon.I've had lots of issues.  Depression since I was 8.  Anxiety since I was about 11.  Maladaptive daydreaming that steals my time and makes working very hard my whole life.  I have CPTSD.  I have signs of a lot of other issues as well.

My mother is a narcissist who is mentally/psychologically abusive and emotionally neglectful.

All this has made it so that I can't feel really happiness, just a distraction from the sadness.  I won't believe any positive things anyone says about me, and I feel like no one will ever actually like me for whoever I am at the moment.  I have insane pressure on me and I tend to be short with people who I trust and I'm comfortable to be honestly stressed around.  But then people will hate me for being such a burden.  I want someone who just likes me and loves me so much, but no one will ever want to be with a person like me.

I'm in high school and I have no hope of ever being loved.  Just loved for whoever I might be, even if I don't know who I am.
