I hate being a lesbianI hate everything about it. It has completely destroyed my life and makes me feel even lonelier than normal. Knowing there's something wrong in the way I'm wired, that I'm fucked up compared to everyone else, the fact that women aren't meant to be attracted to other women. 

I hate that lesbians barely exist as it is and the ones that do aren't attractive. They either look like men or are sjw's. I'm only attracted to straight women and it's fucking torture. Knowing i can't ever have kids with the person i love, that i have to chose a sperm donor or adopt is fucking pathetic, knowing male/female relationships are the balance of nature, are the most normal combination there is and it makes sense. Ive never had a girlfriend or had my first kiss or had sex. Even if i had sex with an woman, I'm still considered to be a virgin by the vast majority of the population. I'll most likely never have any real intimacy or a relationship because there's no one out there for me, simply statistically. I'll always be alone.

I hate that there's something fucked in my head. That i have a vagina and boobs, which are meant to be for men. Why am i like this? I try so hard to be attracted to men because that's the way it's meant to be. But it doesn't work. I don't understand why I'm so fucking up and can't be attracted to the sex i was born to be attracted to. 

It has taken everything away from me. My chance of love, a real biological family, happiness and normality. It has stolen everything away from me. I have no future, nothing to look forward to.

I will kill myself because of it.
