Wrote my suicide letter to friends. Don't have the will to send it because it won't save meI need a miracle. My brain is such a mess. I've tried all I could.

Guess it's just my end.

Please someone save me. I really mean it. Too much people have tried but... nothing had worked

I don't want to meet the end. But if I want to be safe and at peace...
The psychological pain is endless. My life is not important.
