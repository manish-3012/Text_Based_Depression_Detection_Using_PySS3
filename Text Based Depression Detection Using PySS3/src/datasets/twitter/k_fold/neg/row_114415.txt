Hi, I'm from Czech Republic and feel like I am walking on edge of cliffBroken English allert 
I do not have "true" depresion anymore, but sometimes I start shaking :(
I wanna try get drunk and lie on snow, that sounds easy.
I really trying get my mood up by watching .. anything entertaining. But meh
It keeps coming "Look a train, now you little bub!"
I am kinda angry on myself cuz now I am not even trying to have social kontakt, my brain probably protect himself from depresion triggers.
I have some social anxiety, and skeletons in wardrobe. Whatever
But I got better, even learned how to act in public. ^^
I tried go to local "Nerd" comunity, but they weren't very nice, just some rich kids. No idea what now.
I have one online friend, but we can't go out :\ (too far, etc etc)
Fuck, I just I want someone to like me.
10 years is  good score for staing alive alone. I hope I do not find poison.
Not gonna speep today.
