every day i trick myself into thinking it's okaybut when i'm left all alone and everyone is asleep it comes rushing back. nothing has changed. i delude myself with distractions but i'm still as fucked up and repulsive and traumatized and ruined as i always was. my life is still worthless. i'm still a failure. i'm still empty. i don't know why i try. i wake up every day thinking things will be different but they never are. they only get worse.
