I don't care anymoreI don't care about my health, about my well being. I really, truly, couldn't care less. I don't want to get better, be "cured" of this shit, I want to die. That's all I want, and I don't care about anything else tbh. Fuck thhis. fuck trying. I'm not doing this anymore, I'm sick of it. I don't even care that it's my birthday in 4 days, that my mum wanted to get me a present I've been wanting for ever since I was a toddler, that my parents have planned things for me, have tried their best. I don't care anymore. I want to go. I want to leave this place. And I will. Not when I'm supposed to, but when I want to. I'm a horrible friend, I'm a horrible daughter, I'm a horrible sister, I'm a horrible person. I deserve death, and I want it too
