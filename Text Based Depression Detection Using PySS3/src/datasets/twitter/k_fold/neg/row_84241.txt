I could do it right nowI hate feeling like Iâ€™m not at all conducive to being a part of the world, but itâ€™s the truth. I donâ€™t know how to go on as the person I am and at this point I donâ€™t really want anything to get better. Iâ€™m only 19 but I know that Iâ€™m only fulfilling the prophecy that nothing will work out, and nothingâ€™s going to be easy. Thereâ€™s a knife in a drawer in my house and if I didnâ€™t care about hurting the people in my life Iâ€™d take it in an instant.
