I don't want to die but I don't want to feel like this anymoreIt's not that I necessarily want to die but I can't take feeling constant hate and misery anymore. I feel nothing but hatred towards everyone else because I feel like they turned their backs on me and gave up on me. Like I'm not even worth the time to even look at, I don't exist to any of them not my classmates no matter how loud I speak I'm drowned out is ignored,  teacher's probably don't know I'm in the room half the time and the times they do they see me they look but that's it they'd rather engage with students they find more "interesting" and less of a lost cause. I know one particular teacher that I think that I'm a lost cause this one doesn't even bother with me anymore they only notices when I've done something wrong I know they can't stand me. Not even my friends care anymore not like I had much in the first place. But as much as I hate everyone else it's nothing compared to the hatred I have towards myself. if you were to put all the useless and unwanted qualities of a person and make one singular being out of them it'd be me. I'm just wrong, an error if you will everything about me is an abnormality from looks simply down to the way I talk is wrong. It doesn't help that I'm autistic either I've noticed that even my childhood was wrong compared to other people's I never got to do half the stuff they did. My dad died before I even met him so there's another thing I missed out on. Sometimes I resent my mother for bringing me into this world just to satisfy her own selfish needs. I don't want to feel this way anymore and I'm starting to think death is the only way out. I can't get help for this because I know no one cares and even if they did they can't help me.
