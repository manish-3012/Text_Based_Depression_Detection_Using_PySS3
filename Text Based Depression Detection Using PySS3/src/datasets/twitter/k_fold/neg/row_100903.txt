ComfortI must say that this forum has become a comfort to me.  Is that strange?  It has made me realise that these feelings are normal and that I am not alone.  I haven't interacted much, as I've just joined.  I have tried to comment where I can and will continue to do so.

I initially came on here for some suicide ideas; I was wanting to be convinced or, rather to convince myself to do it.  I still have feelings of ending my life but it seems less likely while I am visiting here.

If anyone wants to talk about anything at any point then feel free to message me and I will happily share contact details.  That's not one of those ideal gestures or messages of comfort either; it is genuine. We have each other.  

Thanks.
