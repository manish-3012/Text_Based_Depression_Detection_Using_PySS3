I used to be such a nice person I hate my life. None of the friends seem to like me. I'm not sure their even my friends anymore. I just keep getting the urge to jump into traffic, in front of trains, off of tall buildings. My life seems so pathetic. I look like someone who has it together, but I'm not. People always tell me I'm a funny, relatable, smart guy, but I'm really lonely. Unbelievably lonely. The last person I opened up to ended up moving half way around the world when her own world crashed around her. I can't be help entertain the idea that that I'm the problem. It feels almost as irrational as the thoughts that keep telling me to kill myself. That when it's over I will no longer feel anything. Every facet of my life feels like it's filled with disappointment. When things are supposed to happen they don't, and when they're not supposed to happen they do. I feel like every time I'm in a situation where I could die, even remotely I wish it will happen. I'm so tired of being alone, and sad. It seems so juvenile, I just want to vomit out my soul. I find myself grinding my teeth and wishing it'll just end. I have a bottle filled with Valium, I just want to sleep.
