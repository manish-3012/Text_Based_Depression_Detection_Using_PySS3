Im tired of my anxiety pounding at my chest and my mind constantly running. Iâ€™m done.Im just tired. Im tired of losing people in my life, im tired of betrayal and im tired of opening up to people just to be left alone. And im tired of how my mind drags me in and works like a blender, tearing me up w/ over analyzing things. Im gonna end it tomorrow because theres no one left for me to trust and the anxiety is too much. medication makes it worse and i just want the noise in my head to stop. I want peace and silence
