My life doesn't suck, but I want to kill myself anyway. Why does this bother so many people, and if it's wrong how do I make life worthwhile? [X-post from /r/AskReddit][Link to the original](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ulrtx/my_life_doesnt_suck_but_i_want_to_kill_myself/)

Wanna get this out of the way first - I know it sounds like I'm attention-whoring (and maybe I am, a little, I dunno), but I genuinely feel this way.

**TL;DR:** I'm in love with my best friend who thinks of me like her brother, I'm technically going to college but literally couldn't muster the drive to go to class a single time this term, I've got no idea what I'm doing/going to do with my life, and I'm starting to realize that I'm not nearly as special as I kind of relied on myself being.  I don't see any point to life and I'd love to commit suicide, but that freaks people out - why, and what can I do to make life seem worthwhile?

**The more detailed and whiny version:** I'll address these in bullet format, in the order I just listed them.

* **The Girl Problem** - I'm 21, and living on my own for the first time this year.  My roommate is my best friend of 7 years (I'm a guy, she's a girl).  I love her literally more than life, but she thinks of me like a brother.  I really had/have a hard time with this, because I firmly believe we'd be perfect together, but I truly want to respect her wishes.  The thing is, I can't imagine ever feeling the same way about anyone else - I know it will probably happen eventually, but I can't emotionally comprehend the fact.

* **The School Problem** - As you may have guessed from the above, this is my first year away at college (I transferred into school as a junior after receiving an associate's degree from a community college).  I simply don't feel any motivation - for the first two terms of this year, I got a few Bs but mostly Cs and a couple Ds and Incompletes, and this term I couldn't even bring myself to go to school period.  Instead I lay around the house and go to work, and that's pretty much it.  I've got almost no social interaction outside of the retail experience.

* **The Life Problem** - This one's a little weird, but here goes.  I kinda feel like I've always known exactly what happens next in my life, but recently I feel like I've got no idea what the next step is.  When I was a kid, I actually thought I was going to kill myself before I turned 18 (I've got a small army of depressive illnesses), but by the time that rolled around I was already in college.  For a while I thought I was going to just do the whole school thing and immediately jump into a job, but I'm seeing now that this is kind of a fairy-tale idea.  I just feel lost in general.

* **The Suicide Problem** - Like I just said, I've got a bunch of depressive issues ([Major Depressive Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) and [Disthymia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disthymia) being the biggies), and I've thought about suicide since I was little.  In a weird way, it's actually kinda comforting, I think by virtue of the fact that I've done it so long.  Lately though I've noticed that I've been subconsciously making plans (like what building to jump off of, where to get a gun, etc.), and I'm OK with this.  It's freaking people out, though - I understand that it would be the most selfish decision I'd ever make, but I really can't bring myself to care about other people's feelings in regards to this matter.

**The Reason I'm Posting This** - I'd like Reddit to either explain to me why I should care about living, or to give me advice on how to improve my mental situation.  **I'm not planning on killing myself right now, so nobody needs to whiteknight and get police involved or anything, and I'm working on seeing a shrink** (it's harder than it sounds when you live away from your insurance holder).  The reason I posted about my life instead of just asking the question is because I feel like these concerns (among others) are the major reasons I'm thinking about this even halfway seriously.

And holy shit that is a wall of text.  I'll be shocked if I get more than one or two replies after that o.O

**EDIT**: Doesn't look like this picked up a whole lotta steam anyway, but I'm going to bed.  I'll respond in the morning if anyone feels compelled to say anything else.
