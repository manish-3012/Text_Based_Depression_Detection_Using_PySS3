My gun is pointed at my head, on fire and round in the chamber.Just found out that I killed a kid a few months back when I shot a burst of rounds at what was confirmed to be a Taliban mortar team, didn't know one of them was a 14yo kid, all i knew was that they were the bad guys but I feel like the bad guy now and I wanna die every Second of everyday
