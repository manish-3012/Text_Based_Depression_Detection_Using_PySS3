I wanna die but unable to act, what a horrible feelingFor 2 years I have had anxiety and for 1 year I have been depressed and suicidal. I drag big trauma. I had a good youth, I have a few friends and a
quiet job. I don't want medicine because I do bodybuilding. I don't like my life. I am too sensitive and always the only thing that makes me happy is the affection of the girls. But I miss it all the time. I like girls, I get hit on but I always do a damn bullshit, I ruin everything before concluding. Too nice, too simple. Recently I missed out on a girl who I really liked. It's been 3 weeks and I'm sinking more and more. I went from the very top to suicidal. I'm tired of these fucking paradoxes. I am unable to do anything but ruminate, unable to read or watch a video without picking up in 5 seconds. I want to die so badly but I don't want to die hanged and traumatize my mother or seem like a loser. I'm a shit. I don't know how it will all end. I don't even know why I'm posting this.
