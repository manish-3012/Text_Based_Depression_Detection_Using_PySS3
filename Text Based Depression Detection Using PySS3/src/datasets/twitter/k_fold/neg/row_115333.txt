I really tried.I tried therapy;
I tried venting here on reddit;
I tried talking to relatives/friends;
I tried medication;
I tried treatment at a mental ward;
I tried being social more active;
I tried art;
I tried music;
I tried coping;
I tried crying;
I literally everything available and still it hurts way too much to cope.

I even told my parents that I want to off myself tomorrow, which is kind of a miracle since I'm too anxious to talk most of the time; they can't do anything about it.

It feels like someone is stabbing me, I'm going insane, and I don't care. If I really have to go to school tomorrow, it'll finally stop. Thanks reddit for all the support, I wish I could've repayed it somehow. I don't even bother to write a suicide note; goodbye

EDIT: Well, I'm too much of a coward to do it, so I'm going home; Thank you all so much for caring.
