who I am ?I've lost everything in my life.

In the past I was ashamed of my situation so I stopped talking to people and I lost all my friends. And what little relationship I had kept my disappointed or betrayed...

Recently I also lost two important things.

My girlfriend after 8 years of relationship. 

And my sanity... I'm literally going crazy. I'm losing control of my life to a point where sometimes I do things without any memory of doing them. And that scares the shit out of me.

And I don't even mention the panic attacks and the anxiety and all of that bs...

The only other relationships I have today are 100% virtual. And I want to stop every one of them.  Why would I do that? 

Because I don't want to become the "depressant guy" for the people I like. Or the person who pulls people down. Because it's not like me. I like to provoke laughter and smiles out of people. And I don't know how to do that anymore.

I've always destroyed everything I've built in my life. Now I feel empty. And I spend my nights dreaming about my death or crying. I can't take it anymore, I just want to get out of this crazy world. I don't feel like I belong here anymore and I don't recognize myself.

In writing these words I don't expect any kind of help or compassion from you. I wouldn't know what to do with that. I'm so confused that I don't even know why I'm telling you this.

I'm sending this message like a bottle to the sea, as if to say goodbye. Anyway, I'm already dead inside...
