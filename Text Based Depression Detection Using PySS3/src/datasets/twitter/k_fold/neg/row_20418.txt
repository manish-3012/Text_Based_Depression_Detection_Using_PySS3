Just kind of tired.I am not the type of person to get down or stop trying to improve myself, but Idk. Probably not going to commit suicide, might commit death by homelessness and poverty. Die a slow death, because I am to proud to commit to a quick one. Went to work today, realized I shouldn't ever tutor. People come to me and learn nothing I guess. Can't really survey to figure out the problem. Might just get fired. Then it is a slippery slope backwards to a deeper depression than before. Doubt I will give up. Doubt I will succeed. Keep walking even if it's toward depression I guess, just hope I get over it.
