it never fucking endsi've been suicidal for my entire life because my life has been shit and i've been traumatized.   


my best friend fucking killed herself last week. she had trauma. worse than you can possibly imagine. worse than i ever went through. but she was so well put together. she really tried. she put on  a brave face. she was always so kind and bright. she was an angel.  


i've always been a miserable piece of shit, an emotional vampire, and i'm fucking **angry**. i'm angry at myself for still being alive. she was supposed to outlive me, but i guess that would've just been another trauma breaking her heart. i'm angry at her for leaving without me. i'm angry at her piece of shit boyfriend who is 100% responsible for this (that's a whole other awful story)  


i just fucking hate myself and i wish i could go back in time and prevent myself from being born. it's bullshit that i can't just go. because now i know how it feels to lose someone close. i know how much it affects everybody. i just don't want to fucking hurt people anymore, and killing myself would cause so much more pain. but i'm so broken and i don't know if i'll ever be okay. i should honestly just fucking run away into the woods and stay away from everybody because all i do is make everyone sad.   


i just want her back. i'd give anything. i'd go back in time and prevent us from meeting if, somehow, she absorbed some of my darkness and that planted the seed for her to do this.   
the world is so much darker without her. even worse than before.  


i hate going to bed and i fucking hate waking up and having to do it all over again. i hate being around people because i loved her and she's all i can think about right now and it makes everyone sad. i'm not brave at all like her. i hate myself for being such a pussy. i hate myself for being so weak. i hate myself for not killing myself when i was way younger and didn't know as much as i do now about life. i hate myself for being ugly, incapable, tired, sick. i hate myself for not just being normal.
