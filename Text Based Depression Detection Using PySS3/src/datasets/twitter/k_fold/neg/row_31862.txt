People don't have empathy for you when you're wealthyIt's like my problems don't fucking matter. Constantly people tell me that I don't know the real world/I live in a bubble/I can't have problems because my life is awesome and I am always so *happy*. Ughh. 

I've been struggling with depression for years. I can't help my family is wealthy. I try to be a good person. Why can't people care about me or believe that I'm dying inside? Why do I feel like less of a person for having money? Shouldn't it make me happy? I can't take this any more.
