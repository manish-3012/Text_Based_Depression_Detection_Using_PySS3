Rock bottomI cant get out of this rock bottom. Its been 2 years since I left high school but all I did was stay in my room and do nothing productive. Two important years Iâ€™ll never get back. The past 3 weeks made me literally suicidal, I asked for advice wherever I could. 

I watched motivational videos to get pumped up, I biked to get my blood flowing, I wrote down some advices I could use. So why? Why Im in the same place I was last month?

In the last couple of years Ive gone to therapy, I tried hobbies, I tried getting a job, I tried working out, I tried talking to people.  

My life flew by so fast since I got out of high school. Im still mentally a teen. 

I feel like I just hit rock bottom. I fucking need a miracle to get out of this. Nothing I do has any effect.
