Is it selfish to kill myself on father's day?I don't want to be alive anymore. My parents say things that hurt me over and over and over and I want to die. One of the hardest and most embarrassing things I ever opened up to them about was that I experienced gender dysphoria and was considering transitioning in the future. I told my parents and made myself vulnerable. They didn't offer me support or compassion for what I was going through. Coming out to my parents was the biggest mistake of my life. I think that I could handle the comments and 'jokes' about gay and transgender people if I could pretend my parents wouldn't saying them if they knew how I felt. But because I came out and they still say those things, I know that they don't care about me and don't respect me.

Its the little comments everyday that wear me down. My mom and dad make jokes about transgender people constantly in front of me and my little brother. Its indescribable how it feels to be rejected every single day. Even my brother has started making the same comments about gay and transgender people. My parents love him so much more than me and its so painful. I'll admit that I act out more than my brother which just further puts me in the role of black sheep because they can all gang up against me and taunt me even more when I'm upset. I get so frustrated and upset from keeping everything bottled up I loose control sometimes. I hate how angry and bitter I've become.

I want to be loved and supported but instead I'm all alone.
