Question about possible hospitalization after suicide attemptBeen thinking of killing myself these past few days. With such an intensity that i've never felt in my life. I think about it/plan it and my heart just races. The thing is, I'm worried about the outcome of an unsuccessful attempt. What would happen if I slit my wrists and didn't bleed out quick enough before my roommate found me and took me to the hospital? How long would I be kept at the hospital and would i be forced to stay there? What would happen to me while i was there? Would they try to contact my family? I'm a legal adult by the way and have no family in the area.
