I want to dieOn my day back from the university i just sit there thinking i will jump today. I don't know why i think death is freedom. My life is so shitty to be honest. I just want freedom. I don't even know why i am posting in reddit the suicide section and telling this to random people who don't care. People who don't even know me.
