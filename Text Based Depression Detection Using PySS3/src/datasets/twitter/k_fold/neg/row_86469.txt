It's never getting any better.It's been 390 days today since the phone call that ended my relationship with the love of my life. She kept me around for a couple of months, checking in atleast once a week and that fucked me up even worse because it gave me hope, you know? Our relationship wasn't very good, alot of abuse, cheating and so on from her but i kept telling myself it was gonna get better but it didn't... But that doesn't matter, the love i feel is real and no matter what friends and family tell me it just doesn't get any better.

Soon it's Valentine's Day, i bought her a gift last Valentine's even though we were on a "break" and i thought if i showed her that i really cared and how much i loved her she would come back... A month went by and she was over me. She had me around so she could move on, giving me false hope that it would be us once again, but as soon as she was over me she turned and told me to fuck off and never contact her again and since that day i haven't heard a word from her... I see her sometimes when out and everytime it's like a knife in my back and i can't handle it so i just go home and drink and drug myself unconscious. 

I can't see myself with anyone else ever again and it kills me because deep down i know she wasn't good for me but i just keep thinking that maybe if i did some things different everything would be as good as they were when everything was good and i'm willing to do whatever it takes for a chance with her again... I pray to Gods i don't believe in, i wish and hope and nothing helps... I just can't take it anymore. 

I love her. 

I'm sorry.
