WOMEN will be the death of meI might seem so stupid to lots of people on here. But I seem to be depressed alot over women. Like I cant seem to get one in my life to save my soul. They just all are stuck up snobby people. They rather mess around with the guys that are bullshit. And then look down on the individuals that are truly good people at heart. They just ignore me look at me stupid or in disgust. Always getting friend zoned never in life have had a chance to be happy or have someone in my life. I'll be at work and all the beautiful women who work with me. It hurts knowing I will never have a chance with any of them. Or just on the street. I am 30 years old still single no kids and only had sex a hand full of times. I am really just ready to purchase me a pistol and blow my brains out. I am sick of being a joke.
