Noone knows how to help me...You know that really used clichÃ© of : "you need help" or "go see a counselor" or even "have you tried antidepressants?". Yeah, I'm doing all of the above but nothing ever changes.. at least for the best...

I know that some meds might not be compatible to my case but these are the 10th type of antidepressants that I try.

What am I supposed to do? Where do I go from here?

Noone knows.. believe me, I've already asked and there is no one that knows what I'm supposed to do.. they just tell me to "hang in there" but for what? Just to live more excruciating years of suffering? Do they really want what's best for me by telling me this?

Why can't they help me? Why do I always have to be the one excluded, isolated, rejected and lost, in all of this?

Alone.. I'm tired of being alone. What can I do to not be? Do I need to force someone to be my friend? Do I need to point a gun at someone just because I want a hug?

I can only hear virus virus virus.. and people are forgetting about the aftermath of forcing so many people that have no friends and no one to talk to.. and now, also having no other option but to not see or talk to anyone. The suicide rate has already increased. The domestic violence cases have also grown. Are we really saving lives with these quarantine measures?

I just wish I could have at least one person to stay by my side and comfort me and make me feel less alone. It's easy to be on the other side and just tell me to "hold on", but what about my needs? 

I don't like living.. so why should I keep on doing it? 
It's sad.. my solution seems so easy and apparently so obtainable and yet, for some reason, it's incredibly difficult for me.

Don't even bother digging a hole for me.. cause I never felt like I even really existed.
