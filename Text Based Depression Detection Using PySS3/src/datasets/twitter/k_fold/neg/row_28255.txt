So tired just need to find my wayI'm so sick of reading thing will get better posts. Like it's been year after year and things still suck. I feel like every time I see that It's the same cliche thing to say. At this point it's like the boy who cried wolf and I just don't believe it anymore. There's a lot of thought that goes into suicide but at this point I think it's pretty much a matter of when and not how. I think I'm going to go the carbon monoxide route but I haven't really figured out all the details yet. All I know is sooner than later I want to just be at peace. It's a shame that I would rather die and fade into oblivion than to even try to continue with life anymore. I would rather just not exist than to have to drag myself out of bed and pretend I'm happy with the fake smiles and fake happy conversations. Sometimes I wonder what happened in my brain differently from everyone else that makes me so different. Sorry for ranting but this is the only place I can really let my true feelings out and it has made me feel a bit better right now but don't worry, by tomorrow I'll be right back to trying to figure out my suicide method.
