Planning to kill myself this or by next week.Existing has become a pain. I cannot imagine to exist in this world as the alien I am. Have nothing going on in my life, and being an INTJ I know I am doomed to lead an empty lonely life, that is below the standards I consider worth living for.

Please wish me luck. It will be a very difficult thing to do but the fact is that it is the option that will set me free from the shackles of this world and my pitiful life.

I care for my life and wish they will get over it. I hope my brother will make the best of his life, something I could never do.
