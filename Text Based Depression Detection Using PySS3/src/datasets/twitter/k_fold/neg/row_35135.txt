The strangers that careI haven't posted here and hope I won't get to that point. However I do read the responses from all of the people who genuinely want to help those that are suffering and take time out of their day to respond and try to get to know those that are having a hard time. You all are amazing. Thanks for taking the time to listen, giving advice and for making the difference by caring and helping people when you don't have to.
