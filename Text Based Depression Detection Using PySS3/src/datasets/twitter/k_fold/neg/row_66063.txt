I cant take it anymoreI just fucking hate this life. Because of having to live by myself and sometimes with grandmas whos "supposed to take care of me" I cant fucking study because im taking care of her. I already feel like failing and I'm just so fucking stressed and I have no one to talk to because everyone else is busy

I have never felt more suicidal than ever before but I have reasons to keep on going, but apparently theyre not strong enough and they dont even seem reachable, it fucking sucks, I want to kill myself...
