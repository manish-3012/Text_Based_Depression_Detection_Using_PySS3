For the last timeI'm done. Every time before Ive been here I thought it was it then but this time I know I don't have anything left to live for

I'm disabled and can barely work/study 

I can't live with my parents they're toxic

I'm trans and my friends won't even acknowledge it they're my best friends in the world and they still think I'm sinning 

I think God has abandoned me and I don't know why 

My one thing that kept me alive for impossibly long which was writing music about my struggles is coming to an end I can feel it. No one's ever going to hear it. No one's ever going to care. I don't have money to record it and the only thing stopping me is that it will die with me 

I'm a worthless failed human being. There's nowhere I feel safe and loved and it's only gotten worse as I've gotten older. I used to believe a miracle could save me but not any more

If anyone wants to try to talk me down go for it but I don't think it's gonna work. What can you say that I haven't already tried on myself?
