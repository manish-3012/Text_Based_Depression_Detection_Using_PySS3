Schizophrenic with anhedonia here. Just feeling really down.I started feeling very tired when I was 16. Now I'm 24, and the fatigue and anhedonia are as insane as ever. It's hard for me to think, let alone write this post.

I just wish there was a way out for me, but 8 years in is a long time, as you can imagine. I've been to 2 psychologists, 4 psychiatrists, on 20 different meds (I have a list in my Google Keep), including anti-psychotics, SSRIs, 2 supplements, benzos, and other meds, including heart and blood pressure meds, which I'm on currently too. There's no way out of this hell. I'm currently on aripiprazole 15mg, tianeptine 12.5mgx3, betaxolol 10mg, and rilmenidine 1mg, and I'm considering taking the supplements, sarcosine and NAC again.

The last thing that has been helping me feel good lately is Minecraft on my laptop, but even that is giving out now, and I'm back to point 0 again. But I keep trying to play, but it just doesn't give the same level of satisfaction.

Another issue is that it doesn't feel like schizophrenia to me, it just feels like anxious depression with brain fog and fatigue. I don't know how they're diagnosing me.

I live with my parents, but I don't talk to anyone. Even they don't know how I feel, they probably only know the diagnosis and think it's great and everything for me, because I'm on disability.

I wish I could go out to work, but I think I'll just settle on playing Minecraft until I die. Even if I did went out to work, it'd be so I'd have just enough money to stay home, alone, and to play Minecraft. There's nothing I want out of life. I used to want so much before the illness, but now it's all gone.
