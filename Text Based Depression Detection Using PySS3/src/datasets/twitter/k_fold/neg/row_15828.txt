waiting for an answerthis is... what, my third time coming back here? everybody must think that i'm not taking their advice or anything. i'm trying to the best i can, but it's so difficult to even try to get myself back on track from where i am now.

i've finally decided i needed to go to a mental hospital-- which might sound great in theory, but as a person with anxiety that knows that both of their parents have anxiety and worry about me a lot, i just worry about how they'll react. both of them will be worried-- which i don't want them to. even if i tell them that it's okay, i *know* they'll be worried about me.

i don't want them to be worried. not at all. i know i have to do this for myself but they're one of the few people who legitimately care about me. the only other people are on places like this.

another problem is my lack of motivation to do anything. i don't know why but my will to live had dropped significantly over the past few months. i don't even go outside anymore. i don't have any motivation to go and do things that provide a better environment, and i don't even know why.

i feel hopeless, and on several occasions, i've imagined an entire plan of how i'd kill myself. i know how people would react. me and my struggles would be forgotten in less time than people erased me from their minds ever since middle school. i've never existed since then to anybody at all

i can't even fix myself
