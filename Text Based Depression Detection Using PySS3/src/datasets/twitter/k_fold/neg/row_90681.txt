There's nothing left.I've lost everything this year.

My mom is dying from cancer. I was fired a few weeks back. I'm dirt poor. I have almost no friends and am barely passing my courses in college. I stupidly lied to my parents, and now my dad, who was my best friend in the entire world, won't speak to me. We used to talk every single day but it's now been a week and he won't even look at me. Consequently, I've been kicked out of my house because of the lies. I really thought I had hit rock bottom.

Then today my boyfriend of almost 3 years, and the one person who actually understands and loves me for who I really am, finally got sick of my shit. I can't blame him, I'm more than a handful. It hurts so bad to be truly alone though. I just can't carry this weight anymore. I can't deal with who I've become. I've got nothing left to live for.
