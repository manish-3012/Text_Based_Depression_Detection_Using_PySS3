Depression/Anxiety as a College StudentI'm a college freshman and I was first diagnosed with anxiety and depression my freshman year of high school. A lot of my anxiety stemmed from academics so I feared experiencing everything at a full intensity again. Now it's my third quarter as a STEM major/hopeful pre-med and I'm falling apart. I've had frequent breakdowns in the past quarters but now I'm experiencing it all but at double the intensity. I want to OD multiple times a week and the thoughts consume my day. I'm falling behind in my classes despite having exams at least once a week (not to mention my 3 midterms next week). Instead of watching my lectures I cry and sleep through the day not wanting to wake up, and I don't know what there is in life to look forward to anymore. Any university students have advice?
