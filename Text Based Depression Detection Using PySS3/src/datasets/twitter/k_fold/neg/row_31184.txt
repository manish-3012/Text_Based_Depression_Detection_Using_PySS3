I cannot find the will to go on.After 4 months of job searching, i finally found a fucking job... a 2 month temp position before im right back on the hunt. Im trying to hype myself up about it but the more i think about it the more miserable i get. im watching everyone else I know grow and succedde and im not doing anything with my life, no goals, no aspirations or even really any wants. Nothing is satisfying any more. I can barely get 1 or 2 things done most days

Everytime I tell a therapist im on the spectrum they immediatly try to take away my agency and get me institutionalized... i wish I was allowed to exist and get help. But i can only have one or the other. Nothing makes me happy any more I just want to be happy. Thinking about cutting a big chunk out of my arm and getting hospitalized so I at least have an excuse to stay in bed all day and be miserable
