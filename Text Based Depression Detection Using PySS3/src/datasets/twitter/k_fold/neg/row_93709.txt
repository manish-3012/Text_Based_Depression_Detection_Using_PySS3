Not yet but soonI think I want to give my family one more Christmas with me and get to spend it with them, finish my semester to make them proud, then kill myself after.

Whenever I start to truly plan it out I think of how devastated my family would be and I canâ€™t bare to do that to them. But itâ€™s so frustrating. I canâ€™t take this anymore I donâ€™t want to wake up anymore. 

Iâ€™ve been looking for pills I could od on maybe in my sleep? Iâ€™d rather not feel pain I want to sleep and not wake up again. Death isnâ€™t so scary. Iâ€™m not there when Iâ€™m sleeping, I wonâ€™t be there when Iâ€™m dead. Same thing.
