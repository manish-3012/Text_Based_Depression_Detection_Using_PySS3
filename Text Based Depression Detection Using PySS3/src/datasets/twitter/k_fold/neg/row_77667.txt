I Just Want to End It. The only reason I canâ€™t is because I have 3 nephews &amp; 6 nieces who have already been through hell. The last thing they need is an aunt who shot herself in the fucking face on top of everything else.I still think about it all the time; all the different ways I could do it. I have lost count of how many therapists I have been through or how many meds Iâ€™ve tried. Nothing works. Is this really all there is? Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression &amp; anxiety since childhood. Thatâ€™s all. I just wanted to shout it out somewhere. Thank you.
