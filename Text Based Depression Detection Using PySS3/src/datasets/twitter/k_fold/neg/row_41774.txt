i dont need to be here anymoreI have so many issues... no matter what i do everyone leaves.  i watched my friend commit suicide 7 years ago not knowing at the time what was happening (i was 9).  his girlfriend went feb 3rd the next year.  im already unstable then i found 2 people when i moved back to moms.  nice girls, have issues but not the same.  held each other up, but now one wants nothing to do with me and the other i dont even know anymore.  its been 2 months since i've tried and about 4 days since i last self harmed.  im scared that the 2 month streak will be gone, permanently.  the only reason it didnt work before is that i didnt take enough.  i have a full bottle in one hand and my knife in the other.  what the hell do i do.  i dont want to be here anymore, thereapy hasnt helped.  the damn hospital visit didnt help, and i was in for the attempt.  im so clsoe to ending it now, i cant find a reason not to.
