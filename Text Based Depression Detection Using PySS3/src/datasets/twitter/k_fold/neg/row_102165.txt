I'm so behind in lifeI created this account to write exactly what i think without worrying if someone will see it.

I fucking hate my life, 24 years old. No job, didn't go to university when i should, no career direction, that I like or that is viable. I've never had a girlfriend, never really had a friend i could connect with. I've always resisted.

when i was 13/14, cant remeber, my sister caught me watching porn and i became really embarassed at how it played out, i couldnt talk to girls until i went to therapy like 2 years ago.

I haven't had any life expereinces, no money, can't go on holiday.

No job experience, no education... everyone i knew in school have moved on, i have no friends. I don't talk to people in my school.

Feel like i have to constantly catch up. 

hate living with family at home.

I'm not suicidal but... there's just  a long terrible road ahead and i dont look forward to it.

Nothing is going to bring me any relief or happiness.

Sucks being unemployed.

I try to combat these thoughts by exercising regularly, cut down on sugar and salt a bit, sleep well, wake up early...but i have no purpose in life. Sometimes i just have sit in silence.

There's too much i want to do, so little time, i have to focus some time into fidning a job, but my mind isn;t there. The only jobi can get is a retail job, i dont wanna talk to people in my current state of mind.

I wanna be around people who share the same goals i do, i wanna be around people who have goals and what to be somene in life. Who have ambition... Who are a bit like me. 

I get envious of little things, feel threatened. When i see someone on instagram doing something fun, i immediately have a suicidal reaction. If i see someone doing some cool art shit, i immediately feel threatened.

:C

I want to go to therapy but i find it hard searching for a place that does long form therapy where we talk oncea week, i dont like CBT.
