I am so tired of dealing with problems nobody understandsI wish I was normal. I wish I had normal problems. Like relationship struggles or not liking your job. People can understand that. Nobody understands the shit I talk about. When I talk about dealing with trauma from religion or issues with my racial background, people think I'm exaggerating or they just tell me to accept it and move on. Where other people get a ton of understanding and support, I get nothing. I get "life isn't fair" and "be grateful for what you have". And nobody gives a shit because it's not real to anyone else. Everything that makes my life hell is completely foreign to everyone around me. And I can't live like that anymore.
