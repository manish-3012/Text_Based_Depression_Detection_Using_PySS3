All I want to do is be on my own.Being 16 is enjoyable, getting older and being an older teenager is good, but I just hate being around people, but am almost always forced to . Whether it's not having anyone I can express my misery to or barely coping in a social situation without going to the bathroom and scratching myself since there is almost no access to any sharp items, all of it is just irritating. I'm saving up money and am planning on leaving this city and escaping as soon as possible.
