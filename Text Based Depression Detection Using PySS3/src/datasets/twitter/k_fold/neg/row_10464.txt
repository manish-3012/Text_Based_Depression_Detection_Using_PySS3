I am already deadA long time ago, I died. I died, but I'm still in a living shell. I cannot take it anymore. The only way I'll find peace is by letting go. I want it to end, I tried to make it end, I couldn't make it end. I feel as if I am simply drifting towards nothing as people are living, as people are thriving. I am a waste. I am a waste of oxygen, I am a waste of food, I am a waste of water. I am useless, and I want to make myself end.
