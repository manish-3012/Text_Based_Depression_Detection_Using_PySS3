Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to end it one day.Iâ€™ve no plan on killing myself anytime soon but... Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to at some point. Iâ€™ve had my highs and lows throughtout my life but I cannot take this anxiety and depression any longer. I hate what it does to me and the way it makes me feel. Iâ€™m so afraid of being alone, you have no idea. If Iâ€™m left alone with nothing to do or no one to hang out with, not only do I feel unwanted but I also overthink like crazy and end up having an anxiety attack. Like thereâ€™s always something on my mind that is so insignificant and distracting myself from things that actually matter in life. Iâ€™m so sick of it and am tired of having to use drugs to escape this feeling. I mean shit Iâ€™m practically killing myself already with the amount Iâ€™ve done. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m tired of this feeling always coming back. The only reason I donâ€™t want to end things now is because Iâ€™m starting college at the end of August and moving into a completely new location where hopefully I can make some new friends.
