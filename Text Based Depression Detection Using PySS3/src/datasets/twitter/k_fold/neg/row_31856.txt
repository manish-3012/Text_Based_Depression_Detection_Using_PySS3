I can't find it in me to care about anything anymoreI have a loving mom and boyfriend who will be devastated but I'm really tired and don't want to be alive anymore. I don't even feel terribly sad just an overwhelming numbnessand exhaustion and apathy. I want to feel bad about leaving loved ones being but i just don't. I've tried several medications and numerous doctors and therapists over the course of 6 or 7 years and over never made any long term progress. I don't see a point in continuing to work hard and get my hopes up to eventually spiral back down even worse than where i started. I have a few things i need to clean up before i go and maybe I'll change my mind again but i figured i should try to get my thoughts out.
