I'm not sure where to start fromI've had 3 days of fear and doubts after I argued with somebody and I feel guilty but I just don't think I have done something wrong, I actually did everything I did because I love her and I don't want to lose her, I lost food appetite and I keep crying whenever I'm alone, sometimes I have even tremors and fever, but today I started having negative thoughts about myself and I'm afraid this will turn into something bad, I never had these kind of symptoms before and I want to do something about it before it worsens.... I don't want to talk to anyone besides that person about it, I'm trying to hide these feelings when I'm not alone, but if I'll talk to the person I argued with I'm afraid they'll leave me thinking I'm crazy or something and that's exactly what I'm scared of, what should I do? How do I stop this anxiety, how do I make things better? How can I talk to this person and make her understand what I truly feel and why I did what I did? I don't want to hurt or kill myself, but at this point I just feel like I'm worth nothing and I am afraid I'll lose everything I have..
