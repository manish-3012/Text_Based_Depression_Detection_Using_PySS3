I can't keep goingEveryday just hurts more and more. Emotional pain that won't go away. I've been depressed for years. I've sought help, tried medications, tried therapy. It's all just useless. I've known for a while that someday I'll die by my own hand, I intended to wait until my mother passed as she is the only one that would truly be hurt by my death. So I'm stuck here wanting to kill myself but unable to follow through because of how much I care for my mother. I'll be 30 this year, I've only had a 2 week long online relationship with a girl and nothing more. She left and ghosted me. I've never been on a date because I just get ignored or ghosted, I guess I'm boring or unattractive. I only have two friends that are long distance friendships. Oh and I still live in my parents basement but I do have a job but I don't really like it. I feel so alone, like a failure and a burden that no one wants. I just want it all to end, I want to go to sleep and never have the misfortune of waking up again.
