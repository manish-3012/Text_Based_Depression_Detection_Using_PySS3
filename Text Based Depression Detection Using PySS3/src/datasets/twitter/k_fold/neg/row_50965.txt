itâ€™s not worth it.iâ€™ve been told a few times â€œtry to find a reason to live and hold on to it.â€ i have. for over a year now. first it was musicals, then it was my books, then my studies. but whatâ€™s the damn point? why should i keep forcing myself to care about things? why should i live if the only reason iâ€™m alive is because i keep grabbing into scraps and hoping itâ€™ll make me feel okay for a moment? i donâ€™t inherently want to die, but this in between shit is worse. yeah, iâ€™m alive. iâ€™m breathing, my heart is beating. but past that there is fucking NOTHING. thereâ€™s no personality, thereâ€™s no people, thereâ€™s no talents. this is hardly a life, and itâ€™s certainly not worth living.
