=/I've been feeling down for the last few weeks and I just feel like I'm losing sense of my identity, I'm not really sure who I am anymore and I really don't know why. I live a normal life and have a normal job but recently its been really hard to stay positive and put on a brave happy face whilst inside I'm having some sort of meltdown. I don't think I'm happy with the way I am and the way my life has turned out. I don't have many friends and I find it hard to connect with people. Being in my early 30's its hard to find people to talk too on here as most are just teenagers and/or have their own problems to deal with.

I just feel helpless and hopeless and I'm even finding it hard to find the words to express how I feel, its just like a wave of sadness that doesn't seem to be going away. I just feels like my life has passed me by and now it too late. I feel like the majority of people, including me, just suffer in silence... sometimes it just gets to much to handle and I am struggling atm.

It feels strange doing this, I'm expected to just "suck it up" and stop being a snowflake but its not that easy you know? I feel like I'm falling down a really deep hole and even now I'm in half a mind to not even post this.

So, yeah, thanks for reading, I don't really know where I'm going with this but I just had to post something somewhere on a throw away.
