no reasons to live (please excuse the unoriginal title)hi lovelies. 

I have nowhere to turn and found this community. My life is a dead end. I'm 26 and have not built anything for myself. I have no partner (I've never even had a boyfriend because I'm just a loser), I don't make a lot of money at work even though it's a professional job that requires a college degree, and I have no friends. All I do is go to work then go home and sit alone. I am so upset that I allowed my life to become this. Additionally I just feel like there is no point to being alive. I have nothing to offer work. I have nothing to offer men (like seriously what guy would want to date someone my age who hasn't even had sex before, that's embarrassing.) so I feel like I have no other options but to opt out. If you read that thank you so much I'm just in a very dark place and this is all I have.
