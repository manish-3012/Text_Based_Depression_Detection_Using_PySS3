Wanting to feel human again.Whoever is reading this, I am sure that we both have our story. Meeting, it means that we know tragedy best than others. However this time I hope it is not what we keep on the pedestal, and I hope it is hope itself what leads each other. I'd like to be open for once, instead of falling back into a loop where hurting myself in whichever way that I can find becomes my only relief. I'd like to share the little things again, with someone. Would you take a chance with me?
