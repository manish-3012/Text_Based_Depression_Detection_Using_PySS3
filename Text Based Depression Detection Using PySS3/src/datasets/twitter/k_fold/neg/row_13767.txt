Thanks for still being here, SWThis is my throwaway account for personal information.  I want to thank everyone here that takes time help out people in this subreddit.  I was going through hell for awhile and it was really helpful.  I decided to move out of the country because my mind/thoughts was/were getting darker and darker.  I needed a serious change because I wasn't sure what I was going to do to myself next and it kind of scared me.  I was thinking tonight how much better I am doing now and remembered all of you.  I'm not anywhere close to the person I used to be, but I think i'm progressing.  I had forgotten this subreddit somehow over the past few months, but I want to say now, Thank You.  The people who take time out of their days to give a shit about others gives me joy and hope.  Thank you.

(I'm tired and I'm aware of how jangled my writing is.  I apologize for that.  I just didn't want to forget to do this)
