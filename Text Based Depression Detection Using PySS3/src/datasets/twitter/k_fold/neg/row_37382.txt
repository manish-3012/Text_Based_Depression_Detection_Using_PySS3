I always reflect on my school year and realize how pathetic I amI have made zero improvements this year. My grades were mediocre. I made no friends. Almost all interaction was because of schoolwork, other conversations didn't matter in the long run. Everyone around me, online or in real life, has something to cope with. I hate everyone around me. I hate the people that I envy the most. These reasons for envy make me sound toxic and spoiled, and that's exactly what I am. A toxic person like me is better off dead than bringing others down, and I know I can't change even if I tried. There is nothing I have that makes me happy, so if I have nothing to cope with, I may as well look for ways to end my pathetic existence.
