I want to stop experiencing my lifeI'm not really sure why I'm posting this but I need somewhere to vent. I'm so fucking empty and tired. I know science says that the more effort you put in the easier something gets but I don't feel as if it's true. eating is so much work when I'm this depressed. I try so hard and fail continuously. I have school tomorrow, and once again its almost midnight on a Sunday and I have to choose between getting enough sleep or getting my work done, and the trick is I can't do either. I haven't slept well in a week, and everytime I think about work I feel so anxious I literally cannot make myself do it. on top of this I'm just empty and numb and bored all the time. when it was summer I thought the structure of school would help me but it really didn't. I just feel bad about myself considering my entire education has been a waste as most days I'm too depressed to remember anything, and my past depressed years have made my GPA so low that this year doesn't matter at all. I've been in an out of disassociated states for the past few months and nothing has any meaning anymore. it seems, even from a non depressed perspective, most of humanity is stupid, shallow, and boring. all my friends and people I've dated just bore me, maybe because I'm depressed but also because I feel they're painfully inexperience. I'm not interested in any one or anything, I'm too anxious to leave my house and too depressed to override my anxiety most of the time. my parents were completely negligent when I was a child and I now have no sports hobbies or communities I'm in. I don't see myself ever not being super depressed. i hated the medication I tried and I'm too tired to try another med out for a month and experience terrifying side effects. I don't know how to fix my life but if it stays like this I don't know how long it will be. I'm not planning to commit suicide but I seriously need help.
