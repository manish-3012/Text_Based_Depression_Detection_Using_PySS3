It's all too muchI'm trying to keep my family together but I just don't know how.
So much to say but I don't want to go into detail firstly my mother hates my dad and my grandma for so much they did in the past.

My poor sweet grandma is sad upset and she's going to leave and go to her home country she's where she will be happy however she has to leave her home of many decades.

 This is wrong and I know it but I don't know what to do my mother is irrational angry she says she hates my dad and my grandmother and she makes my grandmother so afraid she often stays locked up at home in her room afraid of saying anything that will and when my mother or rather anger her.

Why does she have to leave I don't want her to. At least she'll be happy in her country but she will always feels sad because she loves me and my brother so much.

  This is one part of a very big problem and I thought I just share this because trying to keep this family together makes me want to die so bad I'm begging to die to escape this I can't feel any more pain I know I can never take never make them happy I just want to die so I don't have to deal with this anymore. I just want to die so badly, why me all of it why me. 

I've only told a very small part of the story but this is the part that just makes me very sad sorry just one part that really makes me sad. If can be honest altogether it's unbearable. All of the injustice.

I haven't gotten into my life passed my home life but that's another story. For now I'm crippled by my sadness of my grandmother feeling afraid and feeling she has to leave.

Why does my grandmother have to go through this. At least she will be happy in some way. I swear Im atheist but I hope so bad there is an afterlife for her and my father. They have had such a hard time with my mean mother I want to know they can have peace one day and be happy. I'd gladly go to hell for them to live happy. I wish I could.
