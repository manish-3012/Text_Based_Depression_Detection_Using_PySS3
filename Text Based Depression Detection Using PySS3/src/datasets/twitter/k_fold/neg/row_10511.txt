Life with High functioning autism isnâ€™t worth livingI hate this shitty disorder people with Aspergers are less likely to be employed and less likely to be in a relationship. I couldnâ€™t join the military because of this disorder and it was all I wanted to do since I was small kid. The only good thing is I have a six pack from training and I was so excited but I didnâ€™t even get to try. I wish I was neurotypical, 

You people are so fucking lucky i can pass off as NT but itâ€™s exhausting, society hates people with autism I really want to kill myself. The only way to succeed with autism is if your special interest is in STEM. I like learning martial arts but because of autism I learn slower than NT people Iâ€™ve been doing it for 2 years but people that have done it for 6 months can beat me in sparring Iâ€™m useless.
