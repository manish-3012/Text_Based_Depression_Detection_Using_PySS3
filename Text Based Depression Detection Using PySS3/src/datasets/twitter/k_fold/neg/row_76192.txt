I don't have that will anymoreI've found myself in a dark low after doing so well for the last few months. I'm bipolar II and BPD. I have so much stuff running through my head, so much dark ideation, that I just want the lights to go out. I have my razor nearby and I'm screaming arguments in my mind with debate. I have no irl emotional support. I'm chatting with the crisis text as I type this. I just don't know how to live life and I don't think I want to attempt it anymore.
