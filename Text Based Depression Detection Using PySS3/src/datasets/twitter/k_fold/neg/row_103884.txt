AntidepressantsWhat happens if you take all your antidepressants at once? I honestly hope itâ€™s enough to end me. Because Iâ€™ve had enough. Ive been abused and broken too many times. The world has rejected me and I really think itâ€™s about time I rejected the world.

Iâ€™m a social disaster, Iâ€™m awkward, Iâ€™m weird. Im not particularly attractive, and no matter how many times I try to help people, I always end up making them turn against or away from me.
