funny how one can be so numb to the world yet so hurt by everything at the same timeiâ€™m honestly slowly starting to lose faith at this point. i keep trying to set tiny goals for myself so i could feel even a little bit accomplished. itâ€™s always things like oh, iâ€™ll try to keep up with my skin routine so iâ€™m not so upset with how my skin looks, or maybe i will try to improve at something so i donâ€™t feel so worthless or i will just simply try not to be sad today, iâ€™ll try to not be so moody today and things like that, but it barely ever works. i mostly end up trying for a little while then i fall down that endless pit i dug for myself throughout all the time iâ€™ve felt like this and i stop doing everything and anything. i genuinely donâ€™t know any human being that is as worthless and useless as i am. not good at absolutely anything including socializing. no friends except the two people i speak to online. i donâ€™t go out. itâ€™s really just kind of pathetic how i donâ€™t have a single thing i could hold on to. wholeheartedly not sure why iâ€™m still here. not sure why i feel like anyone would miss me if i disappeared. just wish people never knew me so i could vanish without worrying about anything. i donâ€™t like living like this. feeling like iâ€™m a burden to everyone and not having a hobby that iâ€™m even decent at. maybe i just donâ€™t know how to try. and i keep telling myself iâ€™m used to feeling like this because it has been this way for years but thatâ€™s just because iâ€™m too scared to admit how hurt i am. this never-ending feeling got me at such a young age and i couldnâ€™t hate it more than i already do. iâ€™m so scared of where itâ€™s all leading to but iâ€™m way too big of a coward to try and end it. hope iâ€™m not so lonely and hurt next year. or maybe the one after it. weâ€™ll see as long as i am still alive.
