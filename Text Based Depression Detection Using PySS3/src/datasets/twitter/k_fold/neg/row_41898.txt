Disabled with Alcoholic SpouseI have been sick since I was a child and have not been able to find truly effective treatment.  I am not dying, but I am disabled.  My spouse is an alcoholic.  I have recently realized that my spouse has no intention of quitting drinking.  I feel like my marriage is a lie. My spouse refuses me affection and sometimes berates me for things related to my disability.  The thing that makes me happiest in the world is the home we own together which I will not be able to afford on my own, after paying for my medical costs by myself, on a single income.  It feels easier and better to go to sleep and never wake up sometimes.
