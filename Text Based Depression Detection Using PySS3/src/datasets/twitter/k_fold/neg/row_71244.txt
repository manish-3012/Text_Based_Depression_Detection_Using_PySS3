HelpI talked to my dad today. He wanted to FaceTime and I've never done that before. All I could think the whole time was how ugly and scrawny my face looked during it ðŸ˜ž I am struggling with bulimia, for 20 years on and off, depending on my mental state. All I could could think of during our call was how my face looks old and gaunt. He said I looked great but I have trouble believing that. I moved across the county 5 years ago so he doesn't see me except for random pictures (which I also hate) If he knew I had purged 2-3 times before our call he would be so sad... I feel like such a shit daughter. Shit mother, shit wife. Why do I hate myself so much and why did talking to my dad trigger such pain and self hate?! ðŸ˜ž ughhhhhhhh
