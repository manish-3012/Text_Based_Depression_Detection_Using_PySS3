Sociopath depressionBeing numb to both  life and people is pretty pointless. I wish I could be done with it all sometimes but I think that people who commit suicide are weak so ergo that would make me weak. Maybe that's an asshole comment to make but that's probably the only reason why I don't do it.  I don't want to fail.
