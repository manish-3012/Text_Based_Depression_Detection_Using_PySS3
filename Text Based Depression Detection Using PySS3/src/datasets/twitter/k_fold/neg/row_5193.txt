I've failed at everything lately, meds ruined me even moreCurrently I'm on sick leave due to not properly functioning. Meds for anxety and depression havent made much effect - only side effects.

Right now im on terrible negative mind set where I failed everything.

Due to meds/or side effects or i dont know what else i barely walked 1 kilomere. I wanted to go to my doc because i felt like i was about to pass out and die. 
I cant even work, going to grocery store is painful hard and dizzy.

Every last trip i had was terrible i cannot function Like normal human beign.

What should do i cheer on my life?

I have damaged brain from meds...
Why should i wait years Like disabled to get a Bit better?
