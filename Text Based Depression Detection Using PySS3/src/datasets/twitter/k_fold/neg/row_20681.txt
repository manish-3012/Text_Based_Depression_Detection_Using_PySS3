My life is just one vicious cycle with only one way to break itI've had depression on and off for as long as I can remember. More recently I've developed some other issues as well. I always end up at the spot I'm in right now; just living in a state of absolute misery that never truly leaves. I've been thinking about the value of life a lot and if there's nothing before you're born and nothing after you die, then what's the point of any of this? I guess it is truly impossible to know what comes next and it's a fear of it being unpleasant that keeps me here sometimes. I didn't ask to be born. 2016 has been the worst year of my life and has just boosted all of these feeling to the most intense they've ever been. I'll be going to a college in the city soon and jumping off a tall building crosses my mind a few times per day.
