Spiralled today because of work. I want to end it. Wish I could today.I'm not able. To function . I can barely type this. Am really scared and humiliated as I got scolded at work . This place is so toxic but I really need the job and can't get another right now. I'm very scared. I really want o end it. I can't sleep and eat or anything else. 
I've put up with so much abuse from supervisor and I'm so humiliated and tired. It's made me not want to live and triggered my anxiety and depression
