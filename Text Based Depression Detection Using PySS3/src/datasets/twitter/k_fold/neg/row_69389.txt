Thinking about handing over my od drugsI've spent years studying this and managed to put together a reasonably surefire fatal cocktail (not going to say specifically but opioids and others) the temptation is killing me and I can't think about anything else.

I want to give them to someone I trust so they can take it away from me but I'm worried I'll regret it if I \*need\* it?
