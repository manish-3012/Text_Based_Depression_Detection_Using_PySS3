Life isnâ€™t doing it for me anymoreI feel so lost in the world. I wish it was all over. I wish things would just go away.  I hate feeling like this. I want help and trust me iâ€™ve tried. So many meds doctors and more meds. Itâ€™s been three years. Still nothing the only thing iâ€™m left with is a prescription stimulant problem. Which fucking sucks. It eats me inside and i have such a high tolerance. I donâ€™t know life just doesnâ€™t do it for me anymore. The highs arenâ€™t enough. I want out but i donâ€™t want to tell my parents. Iâ€™d rather them have to deal with my death then see there faces if i came out about any substance problems. My life revolves around getting high/drunk. I hate this i hate this so much. If i donâ€™t have something to live for in the next 10 or so days iâ€™m putting a gun to my head. Iâ€™ll find a way.
