My mother is crazyDue to mental illness she has become crazy. I often think how my inevitable suicide will affect her. It might cause her to die or worse be paralyzed. But if the latter 2 doesnâ€™t happen then I donâ€™t think it will worsen her because she is already at rock bottom. What ever will happen to her I will probably not going to see it. Iâ€™m open minded to anything happening to death but in high probability wise I think nothing is going to happen. Itâ€™s comforting to think nothing is going to matter to me when I die. Like I said Iâ€™m open minded but I really hope itâ€™s nothing.

Iâ€™ve 2 siblings and although they will be negatively affected Iâ€™m confident they will quickly recover.

If Iâ€™ve the power to make my family not suffer by my suicide I would do it but itâ€™s impossible. Iâ€™m not going to live a miserable life so ppl wonâ€™t be saddened. This is my life and I shouldnâ€™t feel guilty for giving up.
