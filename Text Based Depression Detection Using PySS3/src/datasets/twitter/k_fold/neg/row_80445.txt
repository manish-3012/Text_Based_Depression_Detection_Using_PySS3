I want to kill myself over a girlI thought she was my girlfriend .  we talked a lot on Facebook for two or three weeks. then one day I called her a sweetheart then she said I am not your sweetheart . I was confused I asked her what,  she replied I am not your girlfriend. I felt really upset I was crying a lot. i felt so depressed from then on.i also daydream about her alot. I always wish to feel her body.she was my neighbour too she live beside me.I also had a dream that I was hugging her once when I woke up then I said it was just a dream. she also said I don't know why you like me but it would be unfare for me to hide it but your not my type i like completely different type of you once she said that then I decided to do what I would never want to do. I bought a pack of cigarette and i started smoking in order to end my life in an easy way. I tried other things too like stabing myself with a knife and other things. once I even think about this thing it makes me want to smoke. so then I found out easiest thing is smoking. I need someone to talk about this
