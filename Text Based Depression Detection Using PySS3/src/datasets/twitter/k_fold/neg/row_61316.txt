This feeling when you're ready to do it.A few months ago. I carefully planned my suicide, I planned to go to a forest, slit my wrists and bleed to death. I cried when I wrote my suicide letter to my family but when it was time to do it, my brain was on automatic mode. I was always afraid of driving, I'm super anxious when I drive and I take my car only when I really need to and there's no other ways but this time I felt nothing. For the first time in my life, I drove my car without feeling anxious about it.The car was just a mean to an end. My plan was ruined because my mother noticed something was wrong, followed me and went in the car with me.

Now if only I could experience this state of nothingness again instead of being a coward and afraid to die...
