im so tired of livingif i wasn't on medication right now, i would've been dead a long time ago. my medication isn't working well anymore. im so tired of my past and memories and trauma of whats happened to me, if there was a magically wand that made me forget everything that haunts me maybe then i'd live a happy carefree life. i want to go to sleep and never wake up, im never going to get rid of these thoughts
