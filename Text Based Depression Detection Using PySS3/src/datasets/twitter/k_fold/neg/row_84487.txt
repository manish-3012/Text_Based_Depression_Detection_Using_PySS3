I give upThe only person I feel love towards wonâ€™t even speak to me. Wonâ€™t even tell me why. Iâ€™m tired of suffering. Anytime I become happy everything just shits on me, worse than before. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I almost downed pills yesterday. But today... I havenâ€™t taken my meds I need to keep me alive. Maybe Iâ€™ll go into a coma so the family I have will be happy Iâ€™m at least alive. But I just canâ€™t take it. The only thing that has been keeping me here are my dogs because I donâ€™t want to leave them. But Iâ€™m just a burden to everyone. Iâ€™m better off dead.
