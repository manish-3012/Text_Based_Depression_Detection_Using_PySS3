21 YO engineering dropoutHi ,I'm a 21 YO engineering dropout. I haven't told my parents about the drop out tho. I'm really scared how they'll take it. If I enroll back in engineering I would get a year drop. I don't really know what to do anymore. Everyday I feel like I should kill myself, but I don't want my family to suffer. Please help
