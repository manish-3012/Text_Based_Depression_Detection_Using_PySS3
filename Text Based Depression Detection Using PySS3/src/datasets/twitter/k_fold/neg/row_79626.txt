Anyone in their 30s or older?I was just asking because most of the post I read are from people 18 to mid 20s. So I just wonder if this is a phase of life I should be over by now? Do people get older and not think that way anymore? So maybe I'm just immature for my age. I have been wanting to commit suicide seriously since I was around 16. I am a single parent and my son is Autistic and so he needs me. It doesn't feel good living miserably everyday because someone needs you. I am severely depressed and have been thinking about suicide everyday now. I know if I do it, it won't be an attempt. This is my first time telling anybody about this.
