Why do anything.Everything I try to do in life I get torn down by my family. As I live out of town they are all I talk to. I dropped out of school because I thought if I kept doing it I would eventually kill myself. Little did I know my parents would hold it over me until I became so sad that I now sit for 12 hours and sleep for the other 12 in a day. I don't know what to do. I can't push through this. The only people I talk to in person hate me. I have a learner's so I can't even drive to town and my parents are always to drunk to take me anywhere. I fucking hate this. Going back to school wont solve anything as even when I was there I barely did anything and now I feel worse than I did before. It'd be a lot easier to die than live this awful life.
