Been a while since I posted on hereA lot has happened since I first went to the hospital. I got diagnosed with some things I'd already suspected &amp; got released with meds that would basically fuck with my head if I missed them once. The thing is, despite my release, I still have had no real lust for being alive. I probably wouldn't hurt myself, but at the same time if something or someone threatened to do me in I probably wouldn't be that phased by it. I have no family, no friends aside from my roommate, no ambitions or aspirations. I have no real plan for the future nor do I entirely care. My options and interests are fading away but it doesn't feel so bad. I have nothing to worry about missing out on or being disappointed by. All of the days and nights just blend together, constantly tired and unmotivated to do anything. But I'm still alive so I guess it all worked out maybe.
