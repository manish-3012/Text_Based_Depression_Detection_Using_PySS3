HelloIm 23 male from Poland so at strat im sorry for my sloppy English , 
I donâ€™t know where to start.
Like six years ago i was the happiest person on earth I would say , I have a girlfriend I wasnâ€™t fell lonely for the first time in my live , but I started act like completely moron due to fear of loosing her ,that was completely irrational adding to that I didnâ€™t want  sexual relation I was scared of that looking from my position now , but then Iâ€™m find asexual community and have that as excuse for that , she even accept I wasnâ€™t ready ,but I get so jealous after everything, after 2 years we broke up i was self destructive in drinking and smoke a lot of pot , I was sure that will end my sadness-never did .now Iâ€™m 4 years sober from alcohol and pot I never have any problem with stoping I love looking at world sober .She also has really difficult childhood, and disease that could kill her , she was pretty ambitious, me opposite I like write poems etc. she also have couple suicide tryâ€™s due to disease I handle it very badly . Probably then i began to be so jealous about everything. I think Iâ€™m borderline and have fear of sexual relations, I was positive that I can make it out from this situation and found someone with who I can develop so deep and intense relation . But I never find .Iâ€™m probably hide from my problems in work now Iâ€™m over 70 days in work in a row, in couple days I will have free almost all month Iâ€™m really scared of that , I love work because I can pay my debts and my parent debts thatâ€™s like my meaning of my life.
In times like that I fell very hopeless, I love life but being lonely for such a long time itâ€™s devastating, when Iâ€™m working Iâ€™m fine even happy but when Iâ€™m alone Iâ€™m suffer.
Now Iâ€™m working couple hours less than last month and I start to think again , I never gonna find a women cause my bad behavior, Iâ€™m bad man or really sick , I never have sexual relation witch make finding someone new almost impossible.
Yesterday I have a nightmare I decide to send message to my ex , Iâ€™m pretty sure that what we experienced was love in bad and in god, we got trough really bad things, donâ€™t want to bring them here but they will outgrow even adults .Iâ€™m not even want to get back to her , I just want to know she is alive and doing well she has social media but no single post since we broke. I message  her couple years ago when I was devastated and have to go back to home town from university cause my parents financial problems but she no respond:( she read my message this morning but still not respond and probably wonâ€™t respond ever . Iâ€™m just hopeless I never think love from high school can be so influential in all adulthood, I was first time contemplating Suicide from very long time of course I will not do anything stupid to time when I pay off all parents debts so like year or so I hope Something magic happens in mean time 
Thanks for possibility to drop it of my chest I have no one else :) and I admire if someone read this all :)did Iâ€™m really weird person ? and again sorry for  bad English 
Thanks :)
