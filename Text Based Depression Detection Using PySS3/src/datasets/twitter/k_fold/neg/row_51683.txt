I don't understand how some people are ok with the fact that "This is it"To elaborate, i don't know how people manage to wake up everyday, waste 10 hours of their life to go to a job they couldn't care less about, just so they can scrape by struggle to live. for what? 2 days off on the weekend? whats the point if im too exhausted to even enjoy those 2 days off?  


Sure I can save up to retire, but by the time I can retire i'm gonna be to old to enjoy it. Its the weirdest thing knowing that I'm a complete fuck up and that death is my best option, but no one is willing to except that, so instead of living for *Me* im living for everyone else.  


Life isn't for everyone, and i feel like i'm one of those people. Im not special. I have no talents. I understand that my life will be decent at best. Whatever job i get wont matter cause most likely its going to be some cubicle job for some obscure company thats most likely gonna go down in a few years.

What i dont get is why i was brought into this world as a drunken mistake, and now im expected to move on with life as if im ok with it? as if im just suppose to be ok with the fact that im going to work until i die and never fully get out of life what i want because its literally impossible unless i win the lottery.
