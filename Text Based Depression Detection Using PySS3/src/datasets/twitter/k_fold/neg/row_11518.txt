The past, present and future all seem to suck.I'm transgender I suppose you could say but even applying it to myself leaves with me a bitter taste, I'm not trans-anything. I'm just my gender and labeling me as trans is only adding a bit the wrong gender into my actual gender.

My past sucks because it's filled with dysphoria and missed opportunities to start earlier. The present sucks because I'm depressed, in a constant state of fear of being "discovered" by strangers, people I talk to, everyone. And constantly second guessing my appearance. I know everyone feels self conscious about the way they look, but at least no one is actually going to think they're disgusting if they notice their imperfections. And the future sucks because it's filled with surgeries a life time of upkeep and secrecy and dealing with the fact that I may have the most undesirable trait for finding a partner.

I don't think I'll kill myself, I tried before and it's surprisingly hard, but I wish things were just better. Feels like I drew a totally junk poker hand and I just want to fold.
