Iâ€™m ready and donâ€™t see anythingI donâ€™t know how or where to even start.... just it seems everything crashes down on me and my entire life. I lived with my mom as a young kid and she was always out of her mind on drugs and always sleeping and the men she kept around just contribute. I felt I was always running everything and at the same time trying to deny what was going on to protect her. As a teen I lived with my father and all the things that were entailed with my mother had a great toll on me, she asked me to kill her and me so we can be happy multiple times very young. But living with him I never learned to open up or talk about anything. He never tried to talk to me and when he did very rarely I closed up even more because it was always after a disagreement. I sit here day to day still never talking or telling any soul some of my life and will never, but I think about letting go and being accepting of my life, just donâ€™t want to hurt the ones I love and wish I could see them grow and see their lives continue.. Iâ€™m so lost I donâ€™t even know.. I shouldnâ€™t have wrote this but itâ€™s too late now and why delete it... I just want peace and maybe Iâ€™ll find it...
