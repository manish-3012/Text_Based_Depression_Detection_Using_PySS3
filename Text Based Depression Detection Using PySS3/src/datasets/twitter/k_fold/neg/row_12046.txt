I fantasise about my own suicide.Anyone else do this, I would be just in the shower and then think what would happen if I just went outside and jumped off a bridge, how would my friends/family react, what last message would I send to who would my school have a memorial? I do this pretty much at least once a day and it makes me appeal more to suicide as an actual option instead of a last resort.
