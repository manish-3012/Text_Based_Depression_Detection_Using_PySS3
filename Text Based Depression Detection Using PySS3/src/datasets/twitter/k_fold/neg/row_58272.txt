My best friend just tried to kill himselfHe called me first, I talked to him for like 30 minutes, he hang up once I called him back, told him there a lot of things he hasnâ€™t tried, that thereâ€™s other options. I tried to change his mind on the idea that killing himself would be better for everyone, I told him that his daughter needs him. I even tried to tell him he was a coward to do that because every time I give him a way out he was irrationally going back to suicide. I tried a bunch of stuff then I called the cops. 

I think he missed himself, maybe it was just a call for help and he didnâ€™t want to do it, but I donâ€™t know how to change his mind and I fear it just push him further next time.
