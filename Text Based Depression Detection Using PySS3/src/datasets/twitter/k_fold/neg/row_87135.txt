Iv decided that Iâ€™m most likely going to do it but I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s holding me back and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s getting any betterI donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the fear of what happens after.
 the fear of the pain that going through with it would cause.
 
the pain it would be on my mom 

or the false hope I try to convince myself of that things can get better even though they never have 

I just donâ€™t think I can live like this
