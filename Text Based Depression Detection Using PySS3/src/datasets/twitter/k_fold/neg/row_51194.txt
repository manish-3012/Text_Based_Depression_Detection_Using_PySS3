This is the 3rd time I'm trying to kill myself half-heartedly. Tonight, I want to die, but somehow I'm still scared.LONG POST

Background: I have been a victim of my narcissistic/toxic mom's emotional and verbal abuse for as long as 10 years. I'm 21, F, and it's illegal in my country to commit suicide. I'm a soon-to-be english major in university, will be starting school and living on campus in August.

The problem is, I'm extremely depressed. Never seen a psychiatrist because I don't like being psychoanalysed and don't want to pay tons just to talk to someone. Don't want to be a burden to my family too. 

Today I just had lunch with my ex-teacher who also happens to be my favourite. I've wanted to go to her wedding since forever. She was there during my toughest moments in junior college/pre-u. Unfortunately it clashes with my trip with mom. So I decided to cancel the trip (but my mom already paid $4000 for the deposit and can't cancel) My mom said she hates me and that I'm crazy for doing this and has blocked me. She tells me she hates me every day and that I'm a disappointment.

 I've tried to kill myself but the thought of it has never been stronger. Tried to OD in 2015 but only got to 400mg of some acne medicine. (didn't know it didn't work)  Wanted to jump off from a 4th floor balcony in 2017 but didn't have the guts to. 

If it takes an attempt to properly try to kill myself to know that I don't actually want to die, I'll do it. And that's tonight. I'm choosing to tie a plastic bag around my neck.

I don't have anything else to live for, you know? I just want to be financially independent and not be controlled by my toxic mother with money, but that's going to take another 4 years and I don't have the strength anymore.
