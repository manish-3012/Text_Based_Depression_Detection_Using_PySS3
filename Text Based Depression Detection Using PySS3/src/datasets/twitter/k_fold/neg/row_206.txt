I demand validation like a child.My problems are insignificant, I'm just a weak fucking piss baby. I'm posting here but I know I'll never really kill myself because I'm such a big bitch. I've always been a pussy about pain, I always given up or taken the easy route when the going gets tough. Half assed attempts in the past, they're right when they say it's for attention, at least in my case. A cry for help, but what the fuck do I need to be saved from? I've got it so easy I don't even know. Am I just every fucking teenager or what? 19 or 18 now, I've actually forgotten, but it's been like this since elementary. Why can't I just be fucking happy? Why do I have to feel like every day is like pulling teeth? I've tried so hard to just pickup my bootstraps, just fake it till you make it. I feel like at some point "grin and bear it" turned into "bear it like you're fucking Jesus dragging the cross". I'm just wasting everyone's time. I've always hated reading other people's long text walls of woes because it always seems like, "what the fuck can I contribute? This person is in such a worse place than I am, what advice could I give other than platitudes and bullshit?" I've never posted anything like this before, but I always come back to the sub, read posts, debate commenting, and think "why?" I always figured I was just some fucking kid with nothing of value to contribute, no reason for even stating my ego inflating opinions. Why should I contribute my say? Who would care? I'm just a horrible, miserable and confused fucking person. I can't just force myself to be happy and trying to "attain" happiness, like its some fucking commodity, is a fantasy pipe dream you see in only in stories. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. Trying to live day to day just isn't working out. Why bother with fucking anything anymore?
