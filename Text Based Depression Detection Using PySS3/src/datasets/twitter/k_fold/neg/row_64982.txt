i see no point in forming relationships.im gay. i live in a veryyy conservative town and state where everyone is a gay hating christian. even my friends talk about how gays are going to hell and deserve to die. i cant get close to anyone. evertime i start to feel my relationships are getting too close i have to cut them off because i dont wanna become attached to someone only for them to leave as soon as they find out im gay. i want to leave something that says my sexuality in my suicide note, but if i survive i dont want it to have been seen. Ive wanted to die even before i realized i was gay, but this definitely hasnâ€™t helped. (i also sorta wanna make everyone hate me after i die so no one feels sad by telling them)
