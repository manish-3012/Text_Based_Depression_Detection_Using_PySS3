I do not feel okThis is my first post on reddit. Seemed like a good place to say some shit Iâ€™ve wanted to for a while. Iâ€™m so damn lonely. I have some friends and family that are probably the reason Iâ€™m even alive but no one wants to be with me. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m ugly annoying both neither but every relationship Iâ€™ve ever tried to start has ended before it even got going. Eventually this turned to me trying to figure out whatâ€™s wrong with me, which also lead to me flat out hating myself, as literally everything is wrong with me. Iâ€™ve tried to kill my self twice, tried to hang myself and the beam the rope was tied to snapped, also tried to od and woke up 14 hours later puking. I leave for college in 2 weeks and literally no one knows Iâ€™ve been feeling this way (this is the first time these thoughts have even left my head) and I donâ€™t know what to do. I think Iâ€™m a pretty nice guy. I try to be kind to everyone, always try to help out others however I can, always try not to be a burden on others but I always feel like everyone hates me, sometimes even my friends. I donâ€™t want to get to college and have everyone else hate me too.
