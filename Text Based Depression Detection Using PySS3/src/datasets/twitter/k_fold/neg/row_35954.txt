Uncle SuicideHello all. My mums brother (my uncle) just committed suicide in the last couple of hours. Iâ€™m really struggling with how to console my mum who is screaming and crying in hysterics. Can anyone give me advice on what I can do today and across the next couple of weeks to ease her pain? I wasnâ€™t as close to him as she was and while Iâ€™m distraught I really need to be there for her right now.
