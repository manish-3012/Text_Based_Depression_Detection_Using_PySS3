A friend killed himself and I get it.Last week his sister contacted my friend group telling us he took his life the day before. He was bipolar. We drifted away in the last year. We didn't know exactly how to socialize with him and we eventually just left it up to "if he wants to hang out with us he'll contact us". I was busy so I didn't get to be with my friend group when they were processing this together so I've had to do it alone. I understand him though. I think about killing myself a lot for the last 2 years. I feel terrible every single day and it keeps getting worse. Ever since I was young I figured I'd end up taking my own life but now it seems closer and closer. I can't have my father experience his only kid killing himself so I'll have to wait until he passes. But fuck I understand my friend. I'll join ya soon guy. You were brave enough to stop hurting and one day I will be too.
