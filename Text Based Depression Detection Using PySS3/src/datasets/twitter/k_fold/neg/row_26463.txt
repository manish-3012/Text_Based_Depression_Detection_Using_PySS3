Suicidal TendenciesI've been depressed my whole life just about, been writing in a journal since I was 8 and as I look through it nothing has really changed, I'm 21 now and still feel so utterly alone, I know I'm not alone, I have loving parents, a loving girlfriend, and loving friends. However for some reason I'm still depressed, I take meds (Rexulti 2mg) everyday and that doesn't seem to really help, at least not anymore. I also am actively doing DBT therapy and that's really helping, but there's still this gut feeling that I carry with me all the time that I don't really have a reason to be alive. I don't believe in "God" so I'm constantly trying to prove why I'm still here. Recently I've been really getting into Twitch and that's been helping especially since I'm around people with the same likes and interests as me, but even still, I feel empty. Had a rough day due to family arguing and name-calling over stupid stuff and the whole time I was just numb, not mad, not sad, not even happy (idk why I'd be happy, just expressing the loss of emotions I guess). I have a bad habit of cutting my thighs when I get really strung out or over stimulated, it's the only pain I can actively control, but I've stopped since I started therapy. I also have actively tried to commit suicide several times, all ending in just attempts and no successful actions (trying to od on drugs/pills) but like the cutting, it stopped once I started therapy. Even with therapy though there's this constant pit I'm trying to fill with something.
