I feel like I'm going to relapseThings took a turn and I'm not coping. I don't want to kill myself, but at the same time I no longer want to live. I wish I could have a terminal disease so I can leave without doing it myself. Without my mum feeling guilty for not being able to help me. Without the one I love feeling guilty for not being able to fulfill her promise. I feel empty, I feel broken. I don't know what to do anymore...
