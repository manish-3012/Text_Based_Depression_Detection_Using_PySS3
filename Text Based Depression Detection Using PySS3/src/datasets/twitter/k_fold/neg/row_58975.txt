i think i finally want to livestruggled with suicide my whole life. attempted suicide exactly a year ago but i think iâ€™m finally starting to get better. i never thought i would find happiness in this life but iâ€™m so so so glad i found it and iâ€™m so glad i didnâ€™t off myself last year. i hope things will get better for you too and i hope you find happiness one day i donâ€™t know you and i wish there was more i could do but i love you and appreciate that youâ€™re still breathing
