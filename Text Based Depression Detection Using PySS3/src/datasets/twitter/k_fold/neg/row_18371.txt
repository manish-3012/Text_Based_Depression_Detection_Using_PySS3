I Tried to Kill Myself Last NightI never thought that I would reach that level of low again, despite knowing just how many people it would harm, and how many other vulnerable people it would effect, I tried to do it. I have always battled with suicidal thoughts, always been wanting to but making sure I kept on moving, but last night was just too much for me. I want nothing more than everything in my life to just stop, to back up and give me room to breath, to find just a bit of time to just get the mess that is my emotions and mind under control... but it is relentless.

I tried to overdose, but failed. Stayed awake until the early hours of the morning, saying goodbye to friends just saying I was going away for a while. I cannot even describe how much dismay and disgust I had when I woke up in the morning, almost two hours late for class. Sat through and just forced a smile and laughed when speaking to people, and just went about my day almost on autopilot, as if nothing happened at all. Now I am just one day closer to failing my dreams as my obligations aren't being met, exams, assignments, interviews for internships... all just coming up, and I can barely even muster the effort to keep on breathing, but I cannot stop working either. I have an interview for my dream internship in 12 hours, but all I want to do is just sleep forever.

I cannot keep on going, I just want my emotions to calm down, my brain to stop being a clouded mess, the damned crushing disgusting feeling in my throat and chest to go away. I just want it all to end... but I cannot tell anybody. The person I tried to open up to is going through the exact same thing, so instead I am just helping him get through it. I cannot open up to him too, I know he would want to make a pact to go out together.

I am in a prison of obligations of my own making, my dreams for success are the things causing my pain, but also one of the only things keeping me going. All I have to look forward to is slowly losing the ones I love and care about, until I die miserable and alone. Ultimately all stories end in tragedy, and my journey is not one worth living.
