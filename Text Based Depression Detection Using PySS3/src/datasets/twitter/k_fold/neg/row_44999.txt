How to help my Suicdal Teenage Friend?Both me and my suicdal friend are under age 18. Iâ€™ve just found out he has done self harm and is suicidal. Iâ€™ve encouraged him to tell his parents, but it seems his parents are part of the problem and he truly believes it will do no good to tell. Iâ€™ve gave him my reassurance and advice, but it just feels it isnâ€™t stable (like he still is suicidal). He doesnâ€™t have any close relatives or adults to tell, and has only told one other friend. What should I do in this situation? So far Iâ€™ve provided him resources that might help him cope with all his mental pain. Shall I tell my parents (will they be useful)?
