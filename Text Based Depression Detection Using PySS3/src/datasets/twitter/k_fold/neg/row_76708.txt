I want to kill myself but I cant imagine leaving behind rhe people that I love.I have a very good family, and genuinely the best friends I could ever ask for. I'm more thank lucky and I love them all. I don't love me however and I never have. I want to kill myself constantly. I'm self destructive, unmotivated, and cold uncaring in general, but I cant imagine not being with the people I love. They're the reason I get up and keep going every day. The longer I spend alone, the closer I get to actually doing it.
