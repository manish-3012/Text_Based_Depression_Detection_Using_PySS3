I feel lonely every dayI feel like i don't have any true friends and it's starting to hurt. 

I'm overweight and even though i've lost half my target weight almost no difference in my emotions have developed. I did it initially to try and be more confident in my body and my self, but I've seemingly gotten even more introverted and sad.

There is a history of bi-polarity in my family and I feel as if I am truly clinically depressed at times, contemplating suicide at other times as well. I've gotten close to telling my family my fears at times but I feel too afraid.

I just want to skip to a time where i am in love with someone and life is enjoyable; not counting the days until I'm in a better place.
