I have everything going for me.I have a good job, a loving wife, financial stability...yet I am so sad. I remember being suicidal even in third grade. Walking down the playground in the winter with my head down 'cause I was teased and felt worthless. Things never got better until maybe the end of high school.

I developed a problem with alcohol which I still deal with, and my job sucks. I really want to jump off a bridge. I won't do it now, but I feel like I will someday. I don't know when. It could be tomorrow, it could be five years from now. But god, I don't understand why I feel so shitty. 

I mean, I guess I could think of a million reasons, related mostly to my mother, but that was twenty years ago. I should be over it now. But right now, I am crying, drinking and just want to be numb.

Thanks for reading.
