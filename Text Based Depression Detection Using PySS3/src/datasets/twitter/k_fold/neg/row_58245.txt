Starting over @ 63?Donâ€™t know if I can start over. Been separated from 57f for two years. Left my job of 30 years because of disability. Donâ€™t have enough to live on so I need to find work. Iâ€™ve done manual labor from scaffolding to machinist. My body is pretty beat up and the state I live in has no work for my skill set. 

My ex has issues with alcohol and prescription meds. Main reason we split. Iâ€™ve had clinical depression most of my life and Iâ€™m tired of fucking living. I tried short suspension hanging multiple times at last place I lived. I wish there was an easy way to go. Just needed to vent. Slept all day and woke up in a bad way.
