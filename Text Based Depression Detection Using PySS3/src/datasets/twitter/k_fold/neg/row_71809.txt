I lost my suicide spot!I had a great suicide spot but I moved and now I have no suicide spot. This is actually making me feel worse. it was nice before to know I had somewhere where I could kill myself and not feel too guilty about who would find me and how painful the death would be. I was looking for options but they all require drowning, which sounds excruciating. How bad is that instead of looking for things like an alternate exit in case of fire, I'm looking for nice suicide places?
