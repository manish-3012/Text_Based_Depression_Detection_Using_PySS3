hi guys, just thought i'd let you know whats been going on in my life latelyso 1 year and 5 months ago, i tried to kill myself.  it was the climax of a particularly harsh, year-long bout of depression.  I felt like i had no control over anything, life was too hard, no one loved me, i loved no one, and nothing would ever change.  

time has passed, i've been to therapy (in-patient and out-patient), i've taken depression pills and stopped them, i quit drinking for a year, i stopped smoking pot, i've changed my friends, and i'm working on getting healthier.  I bought a car, I lost a job and lived for 6 months on no income--eating mostly rice, i've finally opened up to my parents, i've been through a jarring death in the family, i've gone on some dates, and today, i finally got a new job halfway across the country.

it is liberating to change so many of the things that i thought were unchangeable.  I didnt even want to try to change them before.  but, i'm still depressed.  life sucks, and i dont really care if i'm here or not.  I guess i've decided that there is occassionally something good to do that is worth being around for, but sometimes i still take comfort in the idea of ending it all.  

anyway, i guess what i'm trying to say is that thinking about suicide can be comforting in a twisted, shitty way.  I still use it fairly often.  But it turns out most of the 'unchangeable' things in my life are actually changeable, and sometimes, just sometimes, life is ok.  

(sorry i'm just rambling but i'm gonna post this anyway, it's good to put my thoughts down)
