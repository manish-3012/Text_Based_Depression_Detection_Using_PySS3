About to break.I just need someone to talk to. I feel worthless and disgusting and unwanted. I feel like no one even wants me around. I feel like nothing. Everything means nothing to me. I feel dead and I've felt this way for a very very long time. I constantly think about leaving, because I think everyone would be better off without me. I think of ways to end it. To stop my pain and to stop the burden and pain of others who know me. I need help. I'm fucked. I'm worthless. I'm nothing.
