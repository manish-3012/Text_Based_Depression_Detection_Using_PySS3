feeling suicidal..I have a lot of suicidal thoughts I have attempted suicide twice in the past month, but trust me i don't want to die if you get what i mean. I am 15 years old and my life has been terrible recently. I was diagnosed with depression last year around December when my sister accidentally burned part of our house down, leaving it unlivable for 6 months. In that time my life kind of fell apart, i used to be a straight A student and now i am happy if i can even reach a C in half my classes, i used to be good at things but now all i do is sit in my room and play video games with my online friends. I can't talk to anyone i trust, i can't s i tried talking to my parents but they said and i quote "Shut up, get over it" and I don't know who to turn to.. i tried those hotlines and online chats. i followed those advice that say to wait 24 hours before you do anything and i have been doing that for the past 2 weeks or so. Most of the time when i close my eyes or are alone i just picture myself dead. Can anyone please give me some advice on what i should do..? I genuinely need help. (Sorry if this broke any rules..)
