Help. Suicide and self harm feel so safe.Teaching was all I ever dreamt about growing up, now I absolutely hate it. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like my dreams have been shattered. I donâ€™t know how or where to start over. Quitting life would be so safe. I havenâ€™t been this suicidal in years. I donâ€™t know how to move on with out self harm. I could do it in the shower before school. No body would know for days.
