nobody should tell me im not worth killing myself, because it is not true.if i tell anyone i want to kill myself, most would say "dont do it! you are wonderful, you will be missed, you are worth it" this is simply not true. I am not a good person, i have done terrible things, i am not a rational human being. the small small small fraction of the world would actually be better without me. it actually truly would, just because people would miss me doesnt mean they arent better off without me
i do not care to fix my grammar or punctuation right now.
