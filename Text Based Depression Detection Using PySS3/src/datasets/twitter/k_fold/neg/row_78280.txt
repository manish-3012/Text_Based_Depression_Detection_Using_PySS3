Moving on with life.I've come to a point where I can safely say I don't wish to be dead anymore, for the most part.

Now I'm still quite depressed because my issues won't go away (genetics).

I don't want to fall back into thinking that way. But today someone told me I literally radiate death and darkness. 

So is it possible to just be depressed and not suicidal for the rest of my life?
