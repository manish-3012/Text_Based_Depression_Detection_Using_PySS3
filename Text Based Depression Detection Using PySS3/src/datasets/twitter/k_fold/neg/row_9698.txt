I just can't anymore.These feelings I keep getting of just killing myself become more and more prevalent every single day.

In the past month or two, my Mum has been dating this man she knew 20+ years ago, a former work colleague of my passed away dad.

He's a violent thug, a criminal and appears in court like it's his job (it isnt, no idea what he does, if he does anything at all). He's a failure of a man and I don't know what she sees in him. He's also coming into the home, living here 80% of the time, paying fk all, eating the food I buy and being a complete twat to me, setting new rules for me, when he has nothing to fucking do with me and I'd rather him to fuck off.

I only yesterday joined a Gym to lose weight, but I can't get there myself without someone, such as my mum, to take me, but I can't go because the cunt is always here. He just infuriates me.
