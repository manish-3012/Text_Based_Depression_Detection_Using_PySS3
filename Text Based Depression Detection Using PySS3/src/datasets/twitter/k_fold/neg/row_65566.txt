I'm donethere's literally no point. I'm so tired, I'm a failure. I'm not going to pass school. My meds and counsoling aren't working-I've basically been told that they don't know what else to do with me.

I'm probably just a mistake in the making. I keep thinking about it. I was almost aborted. Maybe this is just the world trying to catch up. Make me so miserable that I finally die like I was supposed to 22 years ago.

My friends say they care about me. They won't. No one will. I'm too tired for all of this. I'm too tired to try anymore. Literally the only thing that's keeping me from doing it is I don't have the energy to. But I'll get the energy one of these days. And that scares me.

No one takes me seriously when I say 'I want to die.' I'm just bothering anyone I tell this. I'm nobody. It would be better if I was gone.
