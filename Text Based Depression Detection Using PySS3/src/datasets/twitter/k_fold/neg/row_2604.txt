Psychosis is really bad. HelpI have voices, sounds, and I see shadows.

Its really, really bad right now. I've been hearing this horrible buzzing noise like an insect inside my ear and I keep thinking my parents have a movie on but its just me. 

Uhh what else... I currently haven't left my home in 5 months. I'm so fucking isolated its not even funny. I'm so lonely. Sorry no, I won't go outside anyway. 

I'm not floridly psychotic yet. Not quite at the point where I can't type, read, reason, or communicate yet. I don't want to get there. I need help before I do. 

This is all my doctors fault. I told him I was slipping back in August and he didn't do shit. I'm so scared. I need help.
