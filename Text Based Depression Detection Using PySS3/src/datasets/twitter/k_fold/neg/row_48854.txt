Nobody takes me seriouslyI don't know how to even start this. First of all, I'm 14.

Nobody seems to take me seriously when i talk about killing myself. My parents don't care, my "friends" don't care, everyone i know just doesn't care. everyone just replies sarcastically or passive aggressively.

Literally a conversation i had:

"I wanna hang myself"

"There's better ways to die"

when people actually take me seriously, they just threaten to call the police that would take me to a mental hospital, as if being suicidal is a crime and being hospitalized is my punishment.

I gave up on asking for help. I just feel so fucking alone.

I recently also taken my shorts' drawstring and tied to it in a slip knot, i might as well kill myself.
