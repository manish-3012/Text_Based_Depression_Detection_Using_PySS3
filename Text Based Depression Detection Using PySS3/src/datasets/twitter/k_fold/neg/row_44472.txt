I'm on top of a parking garage and I'm tempted.I don't know what to do anymore. These past 2 years everything has come crashing down on me. I have no control of my life at this point.
I hate my Uni course. I have struggled with depression and still am. I tried before. Ending it all.

So much shit has happened. I fucking give up. Just... holy fuck. 

I want to be free of this emotional hellhole. 
Someone. Please. I'm in a little ball at this point.
