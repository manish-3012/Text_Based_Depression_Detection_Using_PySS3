Thinking about doing it today.I don't think I can do this any more. College freshman, alone all the time, feeling rejected by the world. Been looking for love for years to no avail. Increasingly I just feel empty inside. I know that I'm ugly and weird and unlovable, but I wish someone would be able to look past that. But I wouldn't do it so it's stupid to pretend someone else would.

I don't have dreams or aspirations. I've gotten rid of them because I know I'd just fail. Nothing excites me, nothing takes away the pain. Asked out a bunch of people, gone on a few dates, nothing comes of it. Only thing that keeps me going is my parents, I don't want to hurt them. But there comes a time when the loneliness hurts so much you don't care any more. I think I'm to that point. Constantly dreaming of my ex (the only person who ever loved me) and tortured by regret and anger and self-hatred. The world would be better without me. I would be better without the world. Maybe today, if I can figure out what to do.
