Today is my birthday and I can't live onHi, reddit. Today is my birthday but I just can't seem to feel anything anymore. I count my hours at work to get home and get to bed etternally (without sleeping). I have a therapist and I'm also taking some meds (for about a month). But everyday it seems to get worse. I'm 25 and I just think life is not for me. I'm just a failure.
