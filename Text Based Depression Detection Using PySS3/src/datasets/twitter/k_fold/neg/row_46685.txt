i dont even care anymore. i'll be glad when i'm finally gone.i hate going through the same pain every day of every week of every month. is this all it is?? just looking forward, hoping against hope that it gets better, only for it to get worse and worse? because if so, i fucking cannot stand it. all i want is to not wake up tomorrow.
