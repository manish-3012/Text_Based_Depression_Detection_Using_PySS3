My sister took her life this weekendMy sister took her life this Sunday. She was in an emotionally abusive relationship, regularly stopped from seeing her friends and, in her darkest time, her boyfriend left her without a phone and without her babygirl. I canâ€™t even begin to imagine how she was feeling, and what took her to that point. My family and I are always going to blame ourselves for the fact we didnâ€™t do better. 

Iâ€™ve been that low, and I know how she alone she must have felt. It breaks my heart. So many of us loved her.

In her honour, I want to do everything I can to ensure this doesnâ€™t happen. That anyone in an abusive relationship is not made to feel like nobody else will love them, or that there is nobody they can talk to. I knew she needed help and I always meant to try and push her towards therapy and I didnâ€™t. I could have done more and I know that.

I know she wasnâ€™t thinking rationally before she did this. But if you are in this same dark place, please know I am here for you. I will talk you through it. Nobody deserves to feel the way she did. I know the â€˜just reach outâ€™ idea isnâ€™t always useful, but Iâ€™ve learnt some steps that have helped me when nobody else is awake and I feel alone. 

In my sisterâ€™s memory, I am determined to do more. Please text your siblings, check up on them. Hold those you love close.
