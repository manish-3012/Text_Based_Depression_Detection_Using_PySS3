if anybody caresi am so tired. just done. at the end of the day, i can honestly say that i feel like a nobody. i feel invisible. by my family, coworkers....(i would say friends, but well...there are none anymore). I feel like when I speak, nobody hears me. When I am present, nobody sees me. When I touch, nobody feels me. completely invisible. it hurts. i hurt. i don't want to hurt anymore. i have tried to change this, to no avail. i just am done. if you read this, thank you. i appreciate it. i just needed to get it out. goodbye.
