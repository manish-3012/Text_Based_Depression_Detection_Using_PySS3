I'm so tired of feeling like this.Heya everyone I'm about at my limit here, I've ask ready made an attempt once before so it is very possible that I'll try again. So at the beginning of the year I tried to kill myself through overdosing on sleeping pills, didn't work but I slept great for the first time in months, and after that everything has gone down hill from there. For example my girlfriend left me, I came out of the closet to my parents about being transgender and was told by my father that I'm an idiot and wrong, I started cutting worse than ever before and finally to top it all off my best friend has fallen in love with me. I feel guilty about everything and it's been eating away at me, I feel like I just hurt everyone around me with the way I treat myself. I feel like I'm falling apart and it just keeps getting worse and worse with each breath I take. I want it to end and I'm so close to doing just that.
