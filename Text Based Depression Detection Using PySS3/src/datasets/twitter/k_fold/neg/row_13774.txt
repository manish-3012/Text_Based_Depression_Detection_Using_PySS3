Are the good days worth the weeks of terrible ones?I've just been asking myself this a lot lately. I have good days and bad days like everyone else. The good days aren't even objectively good, they are just not bad. It's like I'm able to break even in terms of emotion rather than have a large deficit. 

But I don't even know if it is worth it anymore. I try to hold on to the memories of when I was truly happy, and even on my good days that sort of happiness seems like a very long reach. And in between the good days are countless bad ones. Countless tears. Countless hours laying in bed staring at the ceiling. Countless chores piling up. Countless texts to respond to. Countless days growing between when the times I felt happy, and now. Countless interactions devoid of any sort of emotion. Countless thoughts of regret, guilt, self-hate that spin in and endless cycle. 

My will to live diminishes after every good day. Because it never lasts. As much as I will myself and take steps in the right direction, counseling, dieting, exercise, being around loved ones, trying to identify and counter negative thoughts, it only takes one shitty thought to make everything come crashing down. And building myself back up is so fucking painful and tiring. 

I wish I could open my eyes one morning and be happy, but that is not likely.
