Mom is terminally sick and the only person I have, which makes me scaredMy mom is terminally ill and my father and sister both treat her like sheâ€™s nothing more than a cockroach. They do this because her sickness is screwing with her brain, so she comes off a little repetitive and paranoid. Because of this issue, they find her â€œannoyingâ€ and treat her terribly. 

Long story short, both my dad and sister have treated my mom like utter shit today (This has been going on for years, and today was particularly the worst yet). She had a breakdown, and my dad just watched and told her sheâ€™s wrong every time she started to speak.

My mom has tumors. Theyâ€™re everywhere. Sheâ€™s sick. They donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m her only support because I care for her.

Sheâ€™s still fighting with my father right now and it made me realize how scared i am to lose her. Her sickness is going to kill her sooner than later, and I donâ€™t want to lose her. Iâ€™ve been unlucky growing up and dealt with a lot of death already, but I donâ€™t want to lose her. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to cope.
