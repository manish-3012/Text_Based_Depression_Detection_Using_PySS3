Need help.My friend earlier today was saying how he was kinda feeling down and that he was getting drunk alone in his room. So I asked if he wanted to chat on PS4 which he agreed and he was talking about how he should just kill himself and such. After 20 minutes of convincing him to let me pick him up so we could hang out, he agrees. I get to his place and he wonâ€™t answer my calls or text and all the doors are locked so I canâ€™t get in. He was saying he was tired so Iâ€™m hoping he maybe just passed out and fell asleep but Iâ€™m worried. What should I do if anything but wait?
