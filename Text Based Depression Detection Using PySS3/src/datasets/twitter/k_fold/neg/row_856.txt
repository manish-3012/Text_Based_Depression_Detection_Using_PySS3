My best friend tried to commit suicide, I feel so helpless. She did not succeed, and she is now getting help, but I feel like I need to do something for her. I didn't see it coming at all, but I just learned that it has also not been her first attempt. I am currently in another country from her, which is also frustrating. How do I act when I see her again? I want her to know she's loved without making her feel alienated.
