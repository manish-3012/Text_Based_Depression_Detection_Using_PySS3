Iâ€™m about to graduate from an elite university, people say Iâ€™m beautiful, I have great friends, but I was in a toxic relationship that shattered my self esteem and ever since this boy walked away from me Iâ€™ve been suicidal.Thereâ€™s more to it than that. I had a rough childhood and Iâ€™m insecure about my upbringing despite ending up in a really good position through working hard all my life. I just want to be loved by someone I love back. I only live for my little brother because I donâ€™t want to be a bad example for him. Other than that, I am suicidal every single day of my life and have been for two years.
