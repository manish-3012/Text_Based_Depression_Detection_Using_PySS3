I dont deserve anythingI don't deserve help, I don't deserve a rood over my head, I don't deserve food, water and money, I don't deserve the life I live, I don't deserve happiness. 

There are people out there that are legit starving to death and I'm here complaining, I'm a stain on the Earth which is why I'm gonna do the world a favour and leave it. Bye
