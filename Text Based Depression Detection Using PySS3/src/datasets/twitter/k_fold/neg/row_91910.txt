Can't connect with peopleI can't connect with people. I don't have any friends and people don't seem to like me. I think I look very standoffish or maybe just mean. People occasionally try to talk to me and it's like they're speaking another language. I don't know what they're saying, why they're saying it, what am I supposed to say? It's not even social anxiety at this point, I don't feel anxiety anymore. I just don't understand how to socialize. I was diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder but I think I might be austistic. Mainly because I actually want to connect with others, I just don't know how. No insurance, so no therapy. What can I do to help myself? Exercise comes to mind but I can't seem to motivate myself to do it. I'm living in my car and shower at the gym everyday, so I could do it then. Don't have a job, so it's not like I don't have the time. I'm not really eating anymore, which I'm sure is having an impact on my moods. What's wrong with me, why won't I do things that I know will help me? I've had thoughts of suicide often since I was 11, half my life. Everyday when I'm driving I think about crashing. I just want a friend that will stick around but why would I deserve that? I have nothing to offer and am a lousy friend.
