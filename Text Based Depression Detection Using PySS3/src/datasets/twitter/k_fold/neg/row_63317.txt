goodbye.In these moments before my departure, I feel more clarity than I have ever felt in my dull life. In one minute, I will be free from the voices, from the pain, and from you. 

this world is cruel and the life I live is painful. I've had enough. God has abandoned me and satan has caught me. damn the man.
