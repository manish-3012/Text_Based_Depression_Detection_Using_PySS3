This hurts too much. I'm so sorry Courtney.I know it was wrong to follow you on a fake account. I just miss you, I miss talking to you. I ruined any chance of you ever talking to me again. maybe if I just told you it was me instead of pretending, you'd have actually wanted to talk. I could have explained myself. Or maybe you just wanted me to admit it was me so you could show the police. I don't know if you actually care anymore. I think if you cared you would have tried to talk to me, and not threatened me. But I understand why you did, I deserve it. All I've wanted to do is die since you blocked me. I've been trying to work on that. You were my best friend, and I'll I wanted was to be close to you again. I wasn't trying to be a creep or a stalker, I'm sorry, I know it's wrong. 

I wish I could talk to you. So badly. I want to tell you how much you mean to me. I want to hear your voice. I'm so sorry.

I think this was the last trigger for me. I've never been so ready to go. I miss you.
