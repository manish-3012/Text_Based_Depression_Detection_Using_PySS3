When you feel like nothing matters anymore.I feel my life is so empty right now. I feel like I don't have the strong to do anything right now. I have been in psychological treatment for around 4 years to heal my depression  but even if I have all my medicines I still feel like is something missing in my life. I don't have the Strength I used to have before. I just feel numb. I don't want to do anything. Even if I am having the bigger opportunity of my life I don't want to do anything. Sometimes thinking on the suicide makes me believe alive, makes me think that there is an easy way to feel alive again. To avoid the pain I feel inside of me. Everyones see someone that is constantly smiling but this is not my reality, this is just my mask, my presentation card, inside I am just a lonely sad and boring person. I'm into a whole where everything just becomes darker and darker. My only hope is to have enough Strength to finnish this, just one more I thought but my reason is so afraid that I couldn't finnish. I'm completelly alone I find no reason to live. I'm a disgrace to my family, I have no friends, always in the darkness!!. I am so tired of everything or everyone. I just want to rest, to disapear, to simply evaporate... Where is my Strength? Where is my hope? Where is my love for live and dreams? They don't exists anymore. I'm just a hopless person in this world. Someone whose existence is just a problem for his family. I'm so tired of being an obstacle for everyone else. I just want to be free. I just want to feel alive again...
