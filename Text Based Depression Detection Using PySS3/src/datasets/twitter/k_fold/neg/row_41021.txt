Transferring the pain...I've been pretty full on suicidal for the last two years of my life, including a couple of serious attempts that resulted in me ending up in the ICU.

A few people now have told me that suicide just 'transfers the pain to friends and family'.  I'm very conflicted by that.  I desperately don't want to hurt the people that love me - but do they want me to live in agony for the rest of my life?  

They are good people and I know I'm very lucky to have them, and how hard they are working to help me - but it's not enough.  It's not their fault it's not enough.  It just is what it is.  

I can't imagine wanting to kill myself to hurt my friends, but I don't know I can stay here either.
