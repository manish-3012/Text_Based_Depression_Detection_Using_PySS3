Lifeline is uselessI called my local lifeline number because I have been feeling depressed and suicidal.
I told them why I was feeling hopeless and depressed. I said I came here for help because many websites and pamphlets have that website listed.

All they said was
"It sounds like you have been feeling depressed"
"It sounds like you have no where to turn"

That's literally all they were saying. I told them this wasn't working for me, and that I don't know why people recommend this phone number.
They said:
"It sounds like you're disappointing with this service"
I hung up.

What the fuck? I can't believe this. I am feeling like I want to kill myself even more after that phone call. How do they expect that helps anyone.

Does anyone know of any lifelines or websites that actually help?
