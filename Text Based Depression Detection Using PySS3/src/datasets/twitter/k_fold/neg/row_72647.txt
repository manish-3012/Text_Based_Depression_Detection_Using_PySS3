I've Destroyed Everything.I'm 33 years old and I feel like I've run as far as I can.
Life has been a series of crashes followed by pipe dreams followed by another crash. I've run out of resources and lies to keep me cocooned and I'm living in a very ugly reality.

I'm almost completely withdrawn from the world and have become a recluse. I still have a job somehow but I hate it and am terrible at it. Every day it causes me massive anxiety. I'm so hyper defensive and unmotivated it makes me sick.

All I'm doing is the most basic of human operations. I'm alive and that's about it. There is no pleasure, no joy, no warmth. Time has changed. I feel like I'm living the same day over and over again. Like the world has left me behind. I barely know what's going on around me and have an extremely hard time following conversations. I hunger for social interaction but have lost the limited social skillset I had. I'm afraid of nearly everyone and I feel coldness and hostility from people. I'm living in my own head nearly constantly.

Every day I'm on the edge. I have no more tricks or tactics to hide myself from myself.  The booze stopped working along with everything else.

I've created this situation myself through the years. But even if I deserve this it doesn't mean I can accept it.

I think to myself what would happen if I won 10 million dollars. And the answer is nothing would change. So what else can I do but end this? It's insane. But I'm cornered. All I can think to do is confess in a letter. To try and explain myself. And then go ahead and do this.
