Tired of rejection...Sick of it all.  Rejection from every job I apply to.  Rejection from every woman I seek out.  Was I just born to suffer?

Last night was the first time I seriously gave thought to suicide.  That scares me.

Edit: Just wanted to say thanks to those who commented and messaged me.  I'm alright now.  Trashed my apartment and went to the doc.  I think I'm good, for now at least.
