I am now officially a high school drop out...(The account I'm currently using to write this post is a separate account from another one I already have.)

Well, I blew it... I'm done, completely and utterly done... Tomorrow is the first day of school where I live. I'm suppose to be a senior, but instead this year I'm not attending. High school was hell from the start from me. It's all due to the fact that I was too lazy to wake up in the morning to even attend, too insecure about my looks to want to be seen in public, too quiet and secluded to make any connections, too rebellious to want to obey any authority figure, and most of all, too apathetic to even care. Now it's over, I was told that if I didn't get my act together that this day would come, but I didn't listen... I am so fucked right now.

What the fuck am I going to do with my life? How am I going to get money? I am so stuck right now. I am so isolated right now. I don't even have any real friends, I have no places to go, nothing to do, and nothing to even look forward to. I am a total failure. I don't see any way I can get out of this. The only escape seems to be suicide. It's either that or be a complete loser idiot who lives at home with his parents that doesn't have a good job and possesses  no friends. I really think I'm going to end it within the next week or so. I don't have anyone or anything to turn to...
