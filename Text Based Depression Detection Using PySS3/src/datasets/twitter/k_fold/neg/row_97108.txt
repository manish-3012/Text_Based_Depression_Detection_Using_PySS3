CurrentThereâ€™s such a nice fog out right now. Almost numbing, like you can breathe in the memory of a time from your past. Nothing but a dark structure behind me when all the lights are turned off. I really do miss it, when I was younger that is. Everythingâ€™s much the same but more intense... the main goal, the answer to happiness, but when I was younger it seemed magical, and like an adventure.
Seems like it turned out that there was no adventure. No princess to be saved, no hero to be uplifted. Just a dark room. Iâ€™m sitting in this dark room. It didnâ€™t matter what happened, or what I did, this fog would be here regardless, good or bad. 
I wish I could admit that I really am in control of my emotions, and that positivity, exercise, and diet have been working, but the reality is, no, they havenâ€™t. So while I had the time of my life, and discovered an incredible happiness, it had to come to an end, it had to be fleeting like everything, and it had to come with a price.
So Iâ€™ll sit in this fucking darkness, in this goddamned fog outside that would normally bring comfort, but Iâ€™ll sit in it during more pain than I could possibly imagine FUCKING EXISTING.
