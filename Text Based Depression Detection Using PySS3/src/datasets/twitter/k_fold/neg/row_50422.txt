Never thought Iâ€™d ever end up posting here, but going to work has finally broken me down enoughI canâ€™t remember the last time I woke up and wanted to get up. I work nights, 6 nights a week. So 6 nights a week I wake up feeling miserable, and then on Sundayâ€™s Iâ€™m depressed af knowing I have to sleep and go back again soon.

I havenâ€™t seen my friends in longer than I can remember. Havenâ€™t seen even my immediate family in months. Iâ€™m spending all of my free time with my girlfriend so I donâ€™t lose here too.

Every day I go to work, fall hours behind, fantasise about killing myself, go home, sleep and repeat. I canâ€™t carry on like this. But I have too: I canâ€™t afford to quit, and Iâ€™m too under qualified to get another job that pays even close to this.

I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so alone, literally and figuratively.
