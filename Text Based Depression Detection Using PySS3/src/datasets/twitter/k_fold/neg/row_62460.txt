I really am getting in my head againI've done so much progress and self improvement but I keep on getting in these lows, suicide is on my mind again. Im lonely. It feels like I cant be happy and I need someone to talk to. I dobt know how to really express myself in person. I need love it feels like ive gone my entire life without it. Im an outsider wherever I go my family, school, any friend group. I just want love, but jo matter how hard it feels like I work I cant get it. Im not important to my family, im not important to my friends. Im not important to anyone.
