I can't even think of anything to help myselfI'm poor and my family is poor. I quit my last shit job because I got a small inheritance and I'm not going back. I will use the last of my money to buy a gun. I'm not working another minimum wage job.

I don't even know where to get help being poor and american. The only thing I can think of is faking a suicide attempt to have therapy forced on me. But if I go that route I'll take it all the way, I hate the idea of faking an attempt. 

I have no reason to live. Simple as that. I hate myself. I hate being around people. I hate not being around people. There is no winning. There is only dying. I'm sick of this.

I can't help myself and there is no external help to be had. I have no money therefore I don't deserve to live.
