42 and cracking againSince I young I went through a lot of misfortune. My sister even said I was such a sad soul. I've been committed for suicide when I was younger. And then learned how to deal with it without meds. Now as I get older life is worth nothing for me. Lost my son 2 years ago, no friends, wife left cause I can't stop drinking. Drinking is my only way to stop the echos of crying and yelling. I've drank since I was very young to block memories of what has happened in my life. I can't get it out of my head. My family has noticed this and they know what may come. I'm shit out of luck with jobs and living till 50 doesn't seem viable. I still go work 7 days a week and become more hateful of everything and everyone. I'm so tired I just want to go home.
