What's the psychology of suicide?I thought it was necessary asking here, since it may be useful understanding for those who are considering it.

As far on what I think it is, I believe it's where your brain cannot distinguish reality vs. fantasy. If we're talking from an evolutionary point, humans are the only species that commit suicide. The only reason we commit suicide is because we believe it's a solution on ending the pain. The brain thinks suicide is the solution to help you survive better, but in reality it's the opposite.


I don't think happiness is a choice, otherwise we would all be happy. I think people are depressed because we are genetically wired for our brains to be more stimulated, much like an ADHD person is. Perhaps this is an evolutionary trait. I think modern society has made this difficult for depressed people since most of society caters to your average person.

By the way, I do not have depression, but I'm trying to understand it better. I thought giving out my ideas of depression is a way to get a better understanding, which I think understanding is the most important trait in this world.
