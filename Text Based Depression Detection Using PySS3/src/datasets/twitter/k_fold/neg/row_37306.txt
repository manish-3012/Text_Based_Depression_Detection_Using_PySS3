Utter lonelinessI have never been more alone in my entire life, I have absolutely nobody in my life that I can hangout with and actually interact in real life with. I just got a divorce and he was the only person I had in my life. I have online friends but it honestly makes me so depressed that I can't hangout with them. Idk how much longer I can handle this
