I finally told someoneI finally told someone that I don't want to be here anymore. It was totally cliche and emotional. 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little less than a year and we've been going through rough patches (we're both 17) and it's 100% correlated to my depression. He came over to my house at midnight last night and we talked outside my house. Until 4 am. There was crying, yelling, kissing, hugging, holding, turning away, but it was worth it. It felt so good to tell SOMEONE, ANYONE that I had a problem. He's wanting to help. And I can't do it alone. 

So to everyone out there, please speak up and don't harm yourself. Things can work out. People want to help.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be fine anytime soon, but I'll get there. I will.
