My noteI tried to emphasize 
My pain inside 
You couldn't empathize 
Tonight it dies


I've tried talking. No one takes me seriously. My failures and shortcomings are overwhelming and I can see them building up. I just want to stop collecting debt motivationally. I spend so much time ignoring my feelings and trying to move forward. I cant do this. I'm sorry I couldn't live up to the expectations. I'm sorry for the pain I cause. If I could take back my existence peacefully I would. I love you mom. I love you Haven.
