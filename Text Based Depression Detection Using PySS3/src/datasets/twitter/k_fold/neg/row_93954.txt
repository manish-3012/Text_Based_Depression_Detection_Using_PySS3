FiancÃ© keeps joking about killing himselfMy fiancÃ© recently lost his job due to medical issues and seems to be becoming increasingly depressed, though he tries to hide it. He jokes about killing himself multiple times a week and when I try to talk to him about it he swears he's just joking and would never actually do it. I know he's struggled with anxiety on and off for years and often feels like there's no point to most things in life. His sleeping patterns have become so irregular that he often ends up not waking up until 6pm and  has trouble staying asleep most nights. He hasn't had a haircut in months and no longer works out, he seems to just be letting himself go. He's been to a psychiatrist, but thinks that they can do nothing to help him and that he can handle everything on his own because he overcame his anxiety years ago (even though it's back now).

I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, but he always insists he's joking and that things will get better, but the worse things seem to get for him the more I'm afraid that he's not joking. I've had issues with anxiety and mild depression from time to time, but nothing like what he seems to be experiencing. What should I do? And how can I approach this with him without angering him?
