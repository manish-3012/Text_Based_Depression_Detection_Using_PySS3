I want to hurt myselfI want to stab myself in the stomach and feel the blood running down my chin.

I want to bite my fingers until they snap off.

I want to make cuts across my body until I can't see skin anymore.

I want to rip at my hair until there is nothing on my head.

I want to pull out my insides until I'm just a puddle of skin.

Why do people get worried then?

When I start talking about that?

Now suddenly everyone gives a shit?

No you don't.

You don't care.

You never have, and you never will.

You just want to feel better about yourself.

You should feel ashamed for trying to give someone in a mental state like this hope, then walking away.

You're making it worse.
