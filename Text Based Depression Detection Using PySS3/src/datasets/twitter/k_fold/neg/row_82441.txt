Everyone around me just makes me want to kill myselfPretty much everyone online, or offline keeps saying the worst possible things, trying to get me mad and sad and depressed. Something really stressful will happen and instead of supporting me, the communities I'm in will tell me to either get over it, or that I'm drunk, or they'll make fun of my stress and I. Everyone wants to argue with me and make me feel worse.  
EveryTHING practically makes me super stressed nowadays, on top of academic stress. It seems that everything and everyone is purposely making my life worse.  
Maybe some resources for a PAINLESS suicide would be helpful, since, trying to "help" me will be temporary at best. The only permanent solution is to either completely change my surroundings, or end my life, since temporary "help" has done little to nothing and for short periods of time.
