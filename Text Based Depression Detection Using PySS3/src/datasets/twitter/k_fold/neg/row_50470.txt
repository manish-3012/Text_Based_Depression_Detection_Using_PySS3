I don't see the pointI am currently a teenager in high school. My childhood was bad but certainly not the worst. One thing I've learned in my life so far is that you work really hard at life and then you just die and it was like it was nothing. I can't see my future in anyway. With failing all my classes atm and no motivation to even try, I've been starting to think of other possibilities in life but I just cant see any other way. I like playing video games but when I get up every morning to have another crappy day, I don't have any motivation to play my favorite games. Hanging out with friends doesn't seem like an option. I'm not antisocial, my mom thinks the worse when I leave the house and we know it. I just want to end it all but I'm stuck on top of a hill. Nothing to push be over to continue life and nothing to push me back to the other side, to kill myself. I am just stuck at the top seeing my shitty future. Then, when I look behind me I see my shitty childhood. Nobody knows about my thoughts, because sharing them would just turn into another problem, I would have to think about. When I was 10 I was put on anti depressants because events in my childhood which made me cry myself to sleep every night. I am currently trying to find hope by listening to music but it seems like a chore to find music to make me stop thinking. First time posting on this subreddit. I like the thought of blind interaction and help. I am not calling a hotline because even tho im not antisocial and can't even bare to think of speaking to a random stranger over phone call about my situation that I wouldn't even discuss with friends or family. Thank you for your time and any suggestions or personal stories could help me think what to do at the top of my hill.
