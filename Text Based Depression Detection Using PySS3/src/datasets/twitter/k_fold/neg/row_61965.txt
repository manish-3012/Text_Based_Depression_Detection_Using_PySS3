I hurtI've been talking to a Psychiatrist &amp; Therapist for the last few weeks &amp; I've been trying to get over things. On day 1 with them, I explained that I had every intention of killing myself if life didn't meaningfully get better or if I had no hope. The last few weeks, I steadily improved while taking medication &amp; even started talking to someone.

Today, I received really bad news. I think I'm back to where I started. I'm going to think really intensely about the next few days. April 2nd was the day I gave myself. We'll see what happens.
