Pain is painfulI feel this deep pain and ache in my chest so much. I just sit there crying and feeling so fucking hopeless that the only thing that would give me peace is if I just fucking died. But death is painful too. Itâ€™s difficult to die because it hurts too. But this pain is I feel canâ€™t compare. To feel it everyday. Thatâ€™s not a life thatâ€™s torture.
