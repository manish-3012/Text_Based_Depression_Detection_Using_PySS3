Sore ThumbI've started writing the notes to everyone i care about and even those i don't. I've completed eight full notes in less than an hour and now have a sore thumb. The first thing I've been able to feel for almost a year of depression and physical pains. And oddly enough, i'm actually satisfied with myself over the whole ordeal.
