I keep waiting for someone to save me.Because I no longer want to save myself. I feel like the only way to survive is to give up my free will and let someone else control my life for me. I just fucking hate myself so much. And itâ€™s eating at me from the inside out. It repeats over and over in my brain, â€œi hate myself, I want to die.â€ You can tell me over and over that Iâ€™m not a burden or that I should ask for help, but how many times are people going to be willing to help me? I shouldnâ€™t rely on them being there. I should be able to take care of it all myself. None of this is supposed to happen.
