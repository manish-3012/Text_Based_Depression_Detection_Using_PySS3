LonelySometimes i feel so lonely. At work, people always take advantage of me, bully me and talk to me however they want. Spreading rumours that I am lazy. I started dishing it back out because I felt like it was unfair to ask me to train someone who acted like a complete bitch when she thought I wasn't useful to her. And use my reports that i spent hours on ALONE and say its a team effort. Now because i have dished out exactly what they did to me because I was tired of being shat on, they reported me to the supervisor who is their friend. Now i have "anger issues" and "cant let things go" when i did it but when i said the stuff they did i was "living in the past"

Now i have to teach this girl my entire skillset so they can fire me and replace me. I'm always being abused and now I'm being painted as a bitch to the other coworkers because i fought back. They are the victims now. I always feel like nobody cares. I'm so lonely all the time. I have to care for sick parents and i am the only financial support they have. Sometimes i just want to die. But then who will care for them. I feel so alone all the time and i try to pretend im ok and keep it together but the truth is i wish i could be asleep all the time so i dont have to feel this way. Sometimes i feel so sad it feels like im numb. I feel so tired of existing only for people to abuse me.
