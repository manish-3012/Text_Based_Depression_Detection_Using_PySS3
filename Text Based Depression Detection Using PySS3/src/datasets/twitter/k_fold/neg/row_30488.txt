How are you supposed to fit it all in a note?It's 4:30am, I've been here since 2 trying to write it, I don't know what to say to cause them the least amount of pain. How do I explain that they could never save me and how do I stop anyone from feeling guilt? I don't want anybody to think it's anyone's fault but my own.
