I get the feeling that a lot of people underestimate basic pattern recognitionWhenever I've said I don't expect anything in my life to improve someone will always show up and say "you can't know tye future, things might change tomorrow!"

What they always seem to ignore is that sure, I can't make perfect predictions of the future, but it's not like the future is completely unknowable. My life is pretty consistent, I can say with a fair bit of certainty that tomorrow I will do X or Y because I do X and Y every day but for some reason they think that because I'm not omniscient some unknown Z will magically happen that changes my life for the better even though nothing I do would  ever lead to Z.

If Z can just happen without my input then why do I need to do anything? I can just do nothing different and wait for Z to fix everything for me.
