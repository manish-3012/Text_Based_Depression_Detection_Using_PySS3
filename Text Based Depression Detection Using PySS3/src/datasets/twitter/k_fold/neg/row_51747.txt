I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreIâ€™ve been staring at a bottle of my medication for twenty minutes, a knife nearby and I even wrote a note. If I do this, I donâ€™t intend to come back. Iâ€™m scared. I have no one to help me, and Iâ€™m done with being left behind and forgotten. I just want it to stop.
