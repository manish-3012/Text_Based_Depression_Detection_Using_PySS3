I just can't take it anymore.I've been struggling with depression for almost 4 years now. There's some days that just hurt so much. Why can't i be happy ? Why can't i get out of this hole ?

I just want the pain to end. I'm tired of waking up everyday thinking of killing myself. I don't really now if it's bravery or weakness that is keeping me alive. I woke up this morning crying and can't stop, why hurts so much to be alive? i can't understand. I feel like i don't know how to smile anymore, like little by little some part of me are been teared up and i don't know how to get it back.

I'm broken in so many pieces that i don't think i can build up ever again.
