School fucked up my lifeFor the past four years I've been grinding myself to death because of school since I felt like that's what would ultimately make me happy because people around me would finally take me seriously if they thought I was smart.

It made me miserable and anxious constantly. I was the smart kid, I had all this pressure to be perfect or else everyone around me and my family would be ashamed of me.

And now since COVID my mental health has deteriorated significantly. I legit just want to kill myself at times because I've fucked up a lot of opportunities for college and whatnot because I did jack shit this summer because I was too depressed and unmotivated to do anything.

I've had so many hopes and dreams and I've put up with the hell that was school for years just because I felt like it would eventually get me somewhere. 

But now I'm not doing anything. I'm going to fail and my family's going to be ashamed of me. I've always just wanted to make people around me proud and like me but I think I've fucked up that chance.

And I'm afraid to talk to anyone about it because I don't want to burden anyone, and I don't have friends who would be willing to listen. And most of my problems are my own fault, anyways.
