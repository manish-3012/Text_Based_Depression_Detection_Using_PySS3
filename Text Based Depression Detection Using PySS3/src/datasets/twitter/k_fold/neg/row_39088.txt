No one caresHey guys this is my first post here and im not sure how well it will go but here goes nothing. So for the past 4 years i have been struggling with serious depression and suicidal thoughts daily. Ive found it hard to go on living day to day and i have no one in my life to go to. No friends an extremely harsh and judging family and i really just want to let out my feelings. The last friend i could talk to moved away a few years ago and even though we stay in contact, things have never been the same since he left. Since he left ive lost all my confidence self esteem and even my will to live. I cant talk to girls and having no one to talk to is degrading me slowly. Last time i tried to talk to a girl i got her number and this boosted my confidence. I felt safe with her and really liked her but i put my self out there too early and made things awkward. Im not even looking for sex im looking for human connection  Every night i ask my self why no one listens to me and why no one seems to care about me. Sorry for wasting anyones time but i really wanted to let out some emotions.
