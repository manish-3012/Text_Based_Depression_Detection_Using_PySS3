Helping people here feels good ?Im going through something right now, and I haven't been feeling good in a while.
I just know that I commented on someone's post to help him, and he answered me thanking me for my words and such. I dont know if what I felt was happiness, I just know I felt a bit emotional about it.
 I dont know If this helps, but if it does then I'll be doing this more often.

Im really confused right now...
