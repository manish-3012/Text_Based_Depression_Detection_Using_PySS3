Therapist just quit on meSo I said I kinda wasn't pretty on board with the fact that she told me to try to stop worrying about things so much. I wasn't rude or anything, I just said I couldn't see how I could do it, that, maybe that was one of the reasons I came into therapy in the first place. The session then ended. She said she felt she couldn't help me and that we weren't making much progress. She sugested sending me to a peer of hers for a more adequate treatment. I just kept hearing horrible stuff while she said this. I'm feeling utterly hopeless, utterly abandoned and just afraid I just jump for it. I never got to tell her how bad it was and I felt just quit on. What if I actually told her how much it hurts? I just seem to not want to open up to nobody else. And it's just fucking unbearable and I want no more of it.
