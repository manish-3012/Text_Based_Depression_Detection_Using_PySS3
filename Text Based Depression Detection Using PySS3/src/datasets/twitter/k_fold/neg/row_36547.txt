Thank YouI posted here once a while back and never did respond to any of the PMs or comments. I feel bad about that, but I want to let you know that I read them all -- some of them more than once -- and they were of great comfort and help to me. I was just not in a place where I could respond or reach back and say Thank You. I am no longer thinking about killing myself, though I do still imagine that a nice stay in the hospital would be such a respite from life...

Day by day...
