Just thoughts(x- r/depression)For some reason I keep thinking about how about a month ago I read someone on here saying they came home and put a belt around they're neck and swung for a second until they decided not to do it. After reading that I thought about it and wanted to try it out in some way. So I just put the belt around my neck and pulled as hard as possible. Kind of enjoyed it. Obviously I cant match my body weight when it comes to how hard I could pull so I guess I just got a little taste. Still not sure if thats how I would want to do it if I did. Idk why I'm having these suicidal thoughts. Wish I could get medication. I dont intend on actually acting on these thoughts anytime soon, though I did consider putting the belt on again last night but didnt. Decided cutting was enough. 
Edit: Was just now thinking about just walking into traffic, wondering if people would stop or not
