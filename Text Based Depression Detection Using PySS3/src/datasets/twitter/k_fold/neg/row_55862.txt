Can it be ok? Can you lie it will be?Please can you say it all will be ok? I'm so desperate today, couldn't handle myself in the street, punched a wall, want to cry, cut a bit, drank some energy drinks, my thoughts are consuming me, I just can't hide anywhere, I can't stand on my legs, my vision goes black, but can't cry. I just want to hear it can be ok, even if it is a lie. I planned to end it after a trip but it doesn't make it better today and I just can't. What if I will not end it then? Will I be able to tie a noose and come there, then this life will continue, I don't want it but I just don't know, there are like two weeks till it. Is there any hope, how to not feel pain at least for now, I just can't get through. I won't drink because it will worsen it.. I don't know.
