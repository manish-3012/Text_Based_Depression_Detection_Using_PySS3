Really freaking out tonight - past issues and constant anxiety. A need to confess all I have done before moving on.So I'm in my mid 20's. I've done a few taboo things in the past but have brought no mental or physical harm to a human being.

Just as I feel that I've put the past behind me, the anxiety comes - you know that feeling; like you're about to lose your mind, like a thermometer creeping up to 100 degrees and about to explode. 

My birthday is in a few days and I don't want to spend it worrying about all the same shit I worry about every day. I'm losing my sense of self regardless of the fact I already suffer from depersonalisation. How the fuck could I sink further than that?

I have tried self forgiveness. I would love to just wipe the slate clean and say, "right, from here, forget everything. Move on," and not think about it all again.

But I can't. I feel like a fake piece of shit in my own family. I feel as if they would disregard me like a piece of garbage if they knew the shit I've done. Realistically they probably wouldn't. They love me to bits. But I'm drifting away from them, feeling more and more like I can't return that love because I feel like a horrible human being.

How do people do it? Just disregard something bad they've done, pick themselves up and move on? How do people like ex-offenders (who can change, nothing against them) just move on with their lives without dwelling on their past?

I feel the need to confess everything I've done to my family. But there's some stuff they wouldn't want to know. I'm sure they have skeletons in their closet as well. Why do I feel like my life is coming to an end? The only reason I don't go and off myself is because of the damage and leftover pain I would cause unto them.

Any thoughts or advice, my fellow humans?
