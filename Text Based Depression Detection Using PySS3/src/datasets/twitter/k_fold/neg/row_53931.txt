Suicidal pact between my fiance and I. Our love is like no other I've ever truly believed existed. However we both struggle with and depression and feel we have failed as parents due to no stable income and have no place or hope to contribute to society.My fiance and I have both made a suicide pact. We both have children (our ex's have custody of my finances daughter, my ex has "physical" custody of my son as we have never gone to court to make arrangements. We love our children SO deeply (8girl, 12 boy) and although we are fully aware of how selfish it would be to leave them in a world where no other mother or father will EVER love them as much as We do.....we do feel they will not only be taken great care of as our ex's despite their flaws, we know our children are in good safe hands. Not to mention they have tons of othervloving family members who will always be deeply involved. 

The thing is. There is still hope. 1 last hope. I need to get a full time job. This could be the start of the hope we have been waiting for to start a new beginning. We have both been seeking professional help and ssri's for depression. I just had to get this off my chest. However with this hope comes a major struggle. I lost my expired license (and NEED documents to get a job), my birth certificate and my ss card. 

That's my best at an attempt at making our lives work. If it doesn't work we decided how we will carry out our act and when/the date we have set as out limit. Forgive long post and typos and further confusion.
