Nobody cares.Humans have problems dying. I should know, I tried multiple times. I think I'll try again at some point. I'm not there yet, but each day gives me more and more reasons. Alcohol doesn't help anymore but it at least puts me to sleep. So I looked at my scar. I have one, an early sign of things to come. I never was one for cutting myself. I preferred putting out cigarettes on my hand. Do you know that a cigarette tip can be as hot as 900Â°C? It's around 1652Â°F. Crazy, the things I can remember... Not the temperature, that I googled, the pain. The funny thing was that nobody cared. There were people who saw me do it and nobody cared, nobody said anything, nobody tried to stop me. _x000D_

Over six years ago my relationship blew up. I was probably too busy with work, travelling all over the country, sometimes even beyond. A woman I wanted to marry cheated on me and left me for the guy she was sleeping with. She broke up with me the very day I bought the ring. Eight years of a relationship gone. That pushed me into suicide. Over the next three years, I tried to kill myself five times because nobody cared. Friends left because they couldn't stand me talking about the same thing each day, every day. First few attempts went unnoticed as well, because nobody cared enough to check why I haven't moved from a single room in two weeks. Finally, someone cared for a couple of last attempts. Enough to limit what I can and cannot do, can and cannot buy. For a brief moment in time, I wasn't forgotten. I even went to therapy. Of course, three years of pity party like this consumed all the savings I had for our first house. Nobody cared about that either, but I needed a job while limited and on a suicide watch... No more travelling. _x000D_

I found solace working from home. Freelance gigs, making my own schedule, being able to listen to music. Over time I regained my freedoms, but at that point, I didn't care. I was content. Calm and collected. I spent my free time on gaming and on Reddit. I didn't know that I could get passionate about something again, so reconnecting with my childhood hobby was a revelation of sorts while Reddit provided me with much-needed companionship, even if those were just strangers I'd never hear from after we're done discussing. And so my days went on in solitude. COVID didn't change all that much for me. Sure, all of a sudden more freelancers than I could count entered the fight for the best deal, but I was known in the circles and that goes a long way. So I didn't care. _x000D_

When a girl approached me on Reddit of all places and we just clicked I regained a bit of a spark. But everything has to end and I really don't feel like reliving this right now. It ended badly is all I'll say. On my actual account, I made a brave front, I made one more alt to make myself look even braver and better dealing with everything, but truth be told I'm falling apart and fast. And not because of a bad break up. You see, she made me into a monster. Not just in her head but all over Reddit. Publically describing my sexual fantasies, calling me a psychopath, mocking the core issue behind my first attempts at suicide, something that only me, my therapist and she knows. And nobody cares, they all talk shit about me behind my back like I'm just a fictional character! As if I don't have any feelings at all. _x000D_

I just woke up and found her lying about me from a brand new account. It's not even true and people are buying it. Like me wanting to be with her only to get to America... Not like she was open to living anywhere fucking else! I'd take Norway over America any day of the week, but I wanted to be with her and she wanted to live in her country, so now I'm guilty because for her I investigated how to make that happen, for her. She says that I live with my parents and that's a lie. It's a semi-detached house, I'm more neighbours with them than anything. Sure, my dad comes by regularly to drink and keep an eye on me, but there's a difference. She says that I don't work and just game all the time. I just finished three gigs yesterday working 18 hours without a break and I haven't been gaming at all these past three weeks, only working 7 days a week. Also apparently I'm a financial parasite on my friends. The same friends that left and didn't care to check-in in about six years, I presume, because the only friend I had since was her and I didn't take a bloody penny from her, hell, I refused any time she offered! Oh, yeah, and I party all the time according to her, while the last party I was at was the 2012/2013 new years one and a family gathering at that. And the funniest thing yet, whenever someone tries to defend me, give me a benefit of the doubt she either thinks it's me or creates more lies on top of lies she said before! And nobody cares! They pat her on the back and laugh at my expense. Because I don't fucking matter... I have no feelings. _x000D_

So that's my new reality. Being pushed into deeper and deeper despair daily. And nobody cares. There isn't even anyone I could tell all this, so here you go guys, a way too long post for you all to ignore! And here I am, the same setup as six years ago and I just stare at it. It's only a matter of time before she releases identifiable info about me. Then I'll try again. Maybe I'll finally find some peace. Not that anyone cares...
