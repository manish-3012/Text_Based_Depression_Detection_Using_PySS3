Solid, rational, anti-suicide argument?Maybe I'm just surrounded by poor debaters, but even those who demand I continue living admit they provide no solid arguments. I feel as if I've come to this conclusion rationally over a very long period of time. My only concern is harming their feelings but that's only going to hold for so long, I'm already resentful at times. Any thoughts?
