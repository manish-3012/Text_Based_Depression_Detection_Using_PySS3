Iâ€™m depressedThere I said it, I didnâ€™t want to admit it but I am and I want to kill myself.

Ever since my physical health went down the drain due to an autoimmune disorder so has my mental health and no one is here to help me.

Itâ€™s lonely and dark and no asks me if Iâ€™m okay or need help.

I donâ€™t think lifeâ€™s worth living at this point.
If this is all that Iâ€™m going to get then.

Iâ€™m taking a walk tonight, maybe Iâ€™ll make it back to my house or maybe Iâ€™ll throw myself over an overpass.
