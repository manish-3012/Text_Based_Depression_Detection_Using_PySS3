Maybe it's destinySome people are destined for greatness, others for meekness. But I am destined for death by my own hand. Why else do I feel nothing but discontent?  My entire life has been filled with events, thoughts, and feelings inexorably pushing me towards suicide. It seems not that I reject life or that I flee from it, but that, I am incompatible with it. 

I graduated college some months ago. Dean's list all four years, magna cum laude. I felt nothing. The day I was supposed to walk I hid under my blankets and cried. I wasn't sad to leave my friends behind. I wasn't anxious about my future, my career prospects.  While my friends threw parties and reminisced and made tearful Facebook posts about their experience and their futures, there was nothing in me but emptiness. That's why I cried. I looked back on my life, my many accomplishments, and realized that I was fundamentally broken. A human must feel something, anything, but I felt nothing. I feel nothing. 

There is nothing in me but discontent. It isn't just that I feel nothing, but that I *am* nothing. My personality isn't real. My emotions aren't real. I am not a real person. I am more an automaton meant to imitate human life. Wanting nothing, feeling nothing, built only to do as expected.  I always wondered why I would be born into a human body while whatever internality I possessed lacked all human qualities.   But, I know now. I was born to kill myself. I was born to suffer in nothingness and discontent and then to die, unexpectedly, by my own hand. 
 
I've always prided myself on believing only what I can prove through evidence. I don't know why this strange spirituality has come upon me -- just as all my preparations were completed this past week. All I know is that I'm convinced. Life is not for me. It was never really meant for me. This is my fate. I accept it.
