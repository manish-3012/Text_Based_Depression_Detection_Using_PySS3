SuicideI'm looking for suggestions on how to leave my family taken care of financially after my suicide. I've stopped eating and that money is being put away. I only have a 10k life insurance policy which is barely anything. I'll have to wait until next year to increase my policy plan and I'm not sure if the policy will even be given to my family if the death is by suicide.
