i post here every other day and delete a few hours lateri'm so scared of people finding me. i'm scared my friend watches out for me on here. i had to stop venting on muttr because i got so paranoid about not being able to delete posts and i mentioned once that i sometimes i vent online and. i dont want them to know for sure its me and call 911. i am so nauseous right now. a concerned family member took me to get weed earlier because it helps with my anxiety. i'm very  responsible and they know it helps better than my medicine, i'm not here for a lecture about how it's illegal because that's the last thing anyone should be worried about. i've been really bad off for a few days and the guy said he wouldnt be able to get me any until tomorrow, and i just really needed needed to sleep. i havent slept decently in a couple of weeks. i was really counting on it because i just have been on edge and i was about to snap worse than i have been, ive had several panic attacks over the past few days and weeks, very destructive of myself and a little violent, only to myself and while id love to go without giving myself a bloody nose 4 or 5 times a week, i havent gone on a full suicidal rage in a month or two but i felt it coming and i really just wanted something to make it all go away for a night so i could just sleep, calm down, and not let it get that bad. so concerned family member (not fully aware of my suicidal intentions) gave me a xanax (that was legally prescribed to them). i just know that its very very likely that i could have killed myself tonight and ive had several means of doing so for a while, but even typing this j feel my legs giving out and im about to pass out. i'm not sure why i really tell you guys but i guess its just comforting in a way. i never really know if i have it in me to make it a few more days. i tgink sometimes you just have to think of life in chunks and. just try sometimes
