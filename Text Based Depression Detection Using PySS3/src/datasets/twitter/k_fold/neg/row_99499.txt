I don't understand why suicide is a bad thing anymore. I know I should but I don't.I am at the point where I don't understand why suicide is a bad thing. I really don't understand. Yeah, it hurts when you lose someone but what if person doesn't have anyone or is toxic. Yeah, I have a family but I don't belong among them. I just hurt people. So, why would it be bad for me to kill myself if no one would miss me? All I am doing is relieving a burden. The burden on me and my family because this is just who I am now. Why is suicide bad then? Some people may just deserve it. I know I am suppose to think of it as a bad thing but I don't. People always tell you to cut out toxic people but what if I am the toxic person. Why would it be bad? I don't know anymore. I don't know what to think.
