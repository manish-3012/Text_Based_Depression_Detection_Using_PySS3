There is a bird in love with its death Who, for the sake of a new beginning Will burn itself aliveI cant stop thinking about dying. Its almost 10 years I've wanted this for myself. I've tried everything, different medications, talking to people, I only end up worse and hurting more people &amp; myself. Now my (ex) girlfriend has given herself to another man &amp; I honestly don't see a point in going on. She was my light, I was suicidal before I met her and I didn't think I'd make it this far. Its not her fault, she allowed me to continue longer than I would have which is a gift in itself. I cant stop cutting myself, its better than drugs I guess, but now even the pain isn't working. I really want to just go to the store, buy a dryer vent hose, tape it up to my window/exhaust, and just drift away into nothingness. Even if it isn't oblivion where I'm going, atleast it isn't this. Every minute of every hour is uneasy and suffering. I'm done with all the fucking placebos. I need to take things into my own hands.
