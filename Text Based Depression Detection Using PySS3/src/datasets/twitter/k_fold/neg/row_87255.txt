Life now seems like too much shit for so little reward.Lifes getting the better of me. Lately all I have been thinking about is a way out. I'm not going to lie, my life up until the last few years has been pretty good. (Im 27 now)


Now life just doesnt appeal to me at all. You are expected to go to work, settle down and start a family, repeat the same shit day in day out until you finally retire when it's too late to do anything and then you die.


I've enjoyed my teen years and early 20's but all my friends are settled down with girlfriends and good jobs. Im alone most of the time. I don't have confidence to go out and do stuff alone and have bad anxiety. It feels like i'm being forced into finding a girl to settle down with but I can't do that 1.) Because I don't want to and 2.) I wouldn't be able to hold down a relationship with all my problems anyway. I do have a part time job but still live with my parents which is deemed as really sad by some people. I very rarely go out and in my free time I do nothing, absolutely nothing. I just don't like the system society expects everyone to fit into. I feel like an outcast.


Bottom line of it is I just dunno where to turn and taking the easy way out seems like a good idea to me right now. Although I know at the moment I probably don't have the balls for suicide. I'm sorry if this seems like a rant post, it's not. Im so fed up with life I need somewhere to vent before i change my mind
