HelpIâ€™m ashamed. Iâ€™m pretty sure I have MH issues, my life is falling apart and Iâ€™m an addict in everyway. 

I had a difficult childhood and struggled at school. Iâ€™m22, I thought I would magically overcome my feelings of low self esteem if I just supressed everything and forgot.

My siblings made me hate my parents and my family

I found an older man at 18. I grew up watching porn (my abused siblings did so I joined in). I felt very sexualised and read too much pro-sex feminist theory too you g so thought it was okay and sex/sex work was fine

I still donâ€™t know if it is but I do know I regret a lot of my actions

Iâ€™ve never been mentally stable and have always relied on my friends heavily. Iâ€™m 22 now and everyone has lives.. Iâ€™m realising Iâ€™m stuck with my shitty family and shitty home

I crave acceptance love and validation to a high degree. I just feel
overwhelmed by everything, bitter and angry 

Iâ€™m so broke and in debt, I donâ€™t know how to cook, budget or manage

This man I met was very wealthy and as a stupid 18 year old I thought it was wise to reinvent myself.. but people talk of course. I thought I was living a normal life (I donâ€™t have designer purses or anything) but I wasnâ€™t

People talk about me and my life and my money. I just fell into it out of survival

Iâ€™m the youngest of four and spent most of my early years being an empath then I just seeked validation everywhere causing me to lose myself a lot
