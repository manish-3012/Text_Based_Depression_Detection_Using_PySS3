I was so ready So. I booked a hotel room and I intended to end my life on New Year's Eve, which is... today, where I live. I had intended to do it right about now actually.

I have not even felt that bad in the last week leading up to this day but I kept telling myself it's going to get worse anyway, so I should just stick to my plan and end the pain once and for all. There's a certain pattern in these depressive cycles and I know that every time I manage to come out the other side of it, it keeps coming back. It always does.

I have been feeling this way for years. So I really don't think it's going to get better. There are okay days, bad days, then *very bad* days, and on these very bad days I always regret not going through with any prior plan I had to end my life.

I had been feeling so bad the entire of December. I still don't feel great, but not bad enough to want to end myself right now. It's funny how I spent the week before this writing out my final note, and another letter to my best friend on the things I would need her help in to wrap up loose ends, with all of my passwords, bank details etc. I cleared out some of my things at work. I thought I was so ready to go. But then the last few days I suddenly felt like damn, there are still some things I would like to stick around for. Shows coming out in 2021 I want to watch, albums coming out that I still want to listen to. I haven't even managed to clean my room yet.

Maybe it's not time to go?

So now, here I am alone in the hotel room at 5am. Feeling okay, for the most part. I think I'm going to live again, this time. Even though I also know I'm going to regret it again the next time I feel super bad. I don't really know what to do about this. Does it ever stop hurting? When will it stop? I want to know that this is going to be worth it. I want so bad to win this, but what is there even to win?

I am so tired.
