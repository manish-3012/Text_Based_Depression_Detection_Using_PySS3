ending**TLDR: i'm ending it this year. i have the right material to assure death, i'm frankly way too tired in way too many ways.** 

people, humanity, depression, so many disgusting things that i have gotten tired of dealing with in everyday life. i have been living for others most of my life: if it was up to me alone, i would have killed myself years ago. thing is, i have now truly and finally gotten tired of living for others.. i know it's selfish but this is not living, it's pure suffering. in a sense i am dying everyday mentally, i'd rather actually be dead. judge me if you wish, i have already judged myself and my situation, and im at peace with my decision.

im looking forward to something for once at least... 

peace out.  


things i've learned about life:   
\-nothing is black and white, only gradients of grey: everything is better when it is in harmony, even harmony itself.

\-life makes some people suffer much more than others, and that's just the way it is.

\-love as much as you can while you still can.

\-humans can be much more disgusting than anyone can conceive, but so can they be much more brave and kind than anyone can conceive. 

\-everyone acts selfishly, consciously or unconsciously, and this predicts and concords well with the general path humanity takes.

\-it is good to think for yourself and to be aware of yourself, your surroundings, and your time.

\-dont engage with depression, it is not a closet you should open or engage with, ever. depression is the monster that lived under our beds and in the darkness when we were scared at night as kids, dont engage with monsters: you'll only make them grow.

\-life is beautiful, so if you have moments of joy, dont take them for granted, cherish them
