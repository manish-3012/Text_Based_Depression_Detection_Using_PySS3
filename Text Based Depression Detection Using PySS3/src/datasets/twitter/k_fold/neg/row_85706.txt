I'll never be good enoughWhat the hell is so offputting about me that I have no one in my life who actually cares about me/loves me.. i have people who i love and care about but they don't give a shit about me and I'm tired of putting so much effort into people I know Don't appreciate or give a shit about it.. also feel like I ruined it with the guy I like, even though we still talk I just feel like he's the same as all the rest and doesn't really care about me either, and honestly if I were these people I would just stop talking to me all together because what's the point? I have nothing to offer. Not attractive, socially awkward, etc. Why should I live this cruel life just to die a cruel death anyway. I think imma just get it the hell over with and do a favor for everyone that I know.
