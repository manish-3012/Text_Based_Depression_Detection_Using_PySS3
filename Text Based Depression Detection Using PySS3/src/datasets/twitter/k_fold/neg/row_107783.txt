I'm not quite sure how to help my girlfriend.I've been dating my girlfriend for a few months, and I feel like her depression and suicidal urges are getting worse. I've been friends with her since high school, and she used to have a boyfriend that she loved dearly. At the start of college, they had conflicts and he cheated on her. She still insisted that they could work things out, but he cut her off entirely. I tried my best to comfort her and be a good friend for a year before she made the move to start a relationship with me. College has been rough for her. She's struggling with her major and constantly worries that the future is bleak and that she has no direction or purpose. Originally, she told me that she wouldn't mind if something happened to her and if her life just ended. It has progressed to wanting something to happen to her, and I'm worried that it'll turn into actively making something happen. I've offered all I can, lending an ear whenever possible, being supportive, being understanding and caring, but I don't think it's enough. She's still hung up on her old boyfriend and misses those times dearly. I know I'm just a second rate boyfriend to her, but I really just want her to be happy. Sometimes I wonder if she would have been happier at a more lively college, with more outgoing and exuberant people, with a spirited and daring boyfriend. She doesn't want to talk to a counselor or take any medication or therapy, and I really just don't know what to do.
