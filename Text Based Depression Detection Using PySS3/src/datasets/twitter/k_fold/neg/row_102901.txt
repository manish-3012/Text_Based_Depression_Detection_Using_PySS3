Repeating depressive episodesI have suffered from depression for 20 years since I was 15. In my teens and early 20s I also had eating disorders. 

I heard once you have one depressive episode, the chance of you having another one is 50%. If you had 2 episode, the chance of having another one is 75%. And after 3 episodes, thereâ€™s a 100% chance that you will experience another depressive episode :( I canâ€™t even count how many episodes I had... I am on antidepressants which make my emotions flat but I still have dark times when I just want to sleep and never wake up. I have times when nothing makes me feel excited. I have times when I go over steps in my head to kill myself. I can function (job and relationship wise) but the suicidal thoughts creep in at times. 

I feel hopeless that these - ups and downs- might never end until I die.

I have a friend who told me she never had any depression in her life. She is older than me in early 40s. I just canâ€™t imagine - how somebody can pass through life with no depression. What is the secret not to feel this way? What am I doing wrong? 

I am way passed adolescent days when I thought darkness meant sophistication. I just want to feel better. I wonder if anybody here was successful in eliminating the thoughts of suicide and overcome depression. Or will it be like this forever?
