Post-deployment. Can't tell if fucked up because of it or just normally.
Did 7.5 month deployment in navy. I recognize that other branches have much more serious issues afterwards, but I'm still feeling off. I have had diagnosed depression for about a decade now. I joined the navy to try and make a difference about 5 years ago. I hate it. That's not the issue.

The issue is I feel terrible. All the time. Regardless of whats happening and who I'm with. I feel out of place and totally worthless. I'm an E-5 in the Navy and I can barely function. I have tried the chaplain. I have tried what medical has to offer. Friends offer support but it doesn't feel enough. Every girl who talks to me, I feel just wants my roommate instead of me(save a few exceptions) and I feel useless because of it. 


On a logic basis, I feel I am unable to connect with people. Not to say I'm smarter than everyone. I'm not. I just can't say that I don't feel death is an acceptable alternative to this life. They don't get it. I feel people have the right to end their lives when they see fit. It's a belief I have, you know?

In 48 hours, I will be standing with a 9mm at a entrance to my boat. I will wake up from this tired as hell and with having served no actual purpose. I can't understand why I shouldn't off myself right then. Chances are, I won't. But I just don't get why I shouldn't. Every part of me screams to do it.

Sorry for the rambling. It's been a rough few weeks and its almost 3 am. I can't sleep much these days.
