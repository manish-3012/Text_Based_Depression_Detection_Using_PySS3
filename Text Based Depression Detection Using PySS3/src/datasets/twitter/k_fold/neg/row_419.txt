Well today's the day.I've had today picked out for awhile. And I have a mixture of emotions. But I plan on doing it tonight, but I still have to go buy my gun, and I'm so freaking lazy I'm worried I won't be motivated enough to go get it.
The gun place opens so early and closes early so I won't be able to get any sleep if I want to go get it. 
It would be easier for me Thursday because I won't have work. I want to just ask to borrow some else's gun but everyone knows why I'd want it.
I'm so sleepy. I just wanted to tell you guys that today was my last day.

I'm going to play some Destiny and then go to bed. 
It's pretty bad that I actually do have a small amount of will power to live longer but it is 100% only because I want to play some more Destiny.
