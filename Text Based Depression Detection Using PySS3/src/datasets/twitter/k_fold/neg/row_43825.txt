i have such anxiety inducing thoughts that make me want to end itevery night i have such anxiety attack inducing thoughts and my adrenaline pumps and i cant fall asleep. my legs tremor and i feel my anxiety like in my throat. i want to throw up and run down the street and just fall asleep for a few days. my mind is going crazy and its making me so depressed and i dont see my therapist until tuesday, the 30th. i hate being so alone in these thoughts and think of suicide until i fall asleep, but am way too scared to just have my life end, especially since my dog loves me so much. i am in this horrible limbo of wanting to die, knowing i cant, and feeling so sick to my stomach, full of anxiety and depression that my skin is crawling and i needed help like weeks ago. i just need to make it to monday to begin getting help. i need some form of medication but i dont want to be chill on the outside, and trapped in a warzone in my brain. i feel like im going fucking insane and i type out messages of paragraphs explaining how horrible i feel but i just delete them cause im terrified of being a burden on someone. my mom just finished a huge work trip and i want to just cry in her arms  and pass out but i know i cant cause shes passed exhausted. holy shit i cannot handle this at all.
