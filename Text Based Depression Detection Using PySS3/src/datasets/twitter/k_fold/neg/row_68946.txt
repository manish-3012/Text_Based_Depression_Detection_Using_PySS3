I wish I didn't exist so I didn't have to cause people pain.Title kinda says it all. I'm feeling really awful but don't feel justified in reaching out to my friends for help. I don't want to scare them or make them feel upset or hopeless. And I guess I don't want them to think: "This again? I thought she was doing well. Is she ever going to be okay? There's really no hope for her."
