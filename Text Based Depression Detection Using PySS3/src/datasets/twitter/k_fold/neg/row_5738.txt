I've learned a valuable lesson over the past 2 yearsIts that you can do everything right and still lose.
Love is a joke. People dont want to work on relationships anymore.
Its been a year, and I still hate myself for not having been a better version of myself. Too little too late. Each day it gets harder to move myself forward. So Tonight I am done. Going to bed early and I'm gonna let the world crash on me tomorrow.

Be good to yourselves, Reddit.
