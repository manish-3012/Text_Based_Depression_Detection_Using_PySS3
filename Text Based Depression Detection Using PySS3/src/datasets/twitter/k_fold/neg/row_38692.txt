Wish me luck!I'm just done man. I relapsed cutting myself and now my boyfriend won't talk to me at all. Won't even read my texts ha. I moved to a new country just to be with him and study and after 5 months I hate it here. I hate the people. It's too late to go back home. I try to hit up my friends back at my home uni and they never text me back. I'm not even burdening them with being suicidal or anything, just a hey, sup? gets me nowhere. I have no friends in this shit country. No family back home but a snarky mom. It's so painful seeing pics of my friends being happy and graduating without me. It's painful seeing my bf come online and not reading my messages for days. What's the fucking point? I was so happy before I left but I threw it all away cause I thought studying abroad would be a great opportunity. I'd be with my bf and I wanted to marry him. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm alone. I've always been alone.

Gonna try and work my way up to alcohol poisoning. It's not the best death but it's what I have access to. So I got some wine to start off with and I'll go back to the store once I run out of that and buy something stronger. Been eating as little as possible for the last few days so I'll die easier. So yeah wish me luck guys gonna get fucking wasted!!!
