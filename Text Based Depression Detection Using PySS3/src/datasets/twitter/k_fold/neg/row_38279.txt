Please help I'm on the edgeI've chosen the method. My hands are shaking so hard. I'm deciding on where and when to do it. I will maybe make a last big party for those few friends I have left and get ready. I just have to break this psychological barrier, that instinct to not die. I'm so tired. My head hurts from all these thoughts. I explained most of things in my previous posts. Even though everybody tells me that I'm so smart and that I would probably invent something great, I don't feel like it. I just feel a bit guilty for disappointing all those people...
