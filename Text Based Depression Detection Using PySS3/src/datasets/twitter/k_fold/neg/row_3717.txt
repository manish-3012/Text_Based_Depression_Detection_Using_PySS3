I don't want to see a therapist.The only person I've opened up to in my life about my suicidal thoughts keeps bombarding me with "see a therapist" and I don't know what to do. Honestly the only reason I'm alive is because I care about him and I made a promise that I wouldn't kill myself. I just don't know what to do anymore. I just wish he would believe me, that SOMEONE out there will believe me that I can't physically bring myself to see a therapist. I know it won't help, but he keeps insisting that he knows that it will. If anything being forced to go talk to strangers will just worsen my depression and anxiety.

I feel so alone, like the one person I care about the most can't even believe what I say. I just want someone out there to listen. I'm really considering breaking my promise and just ending things.
