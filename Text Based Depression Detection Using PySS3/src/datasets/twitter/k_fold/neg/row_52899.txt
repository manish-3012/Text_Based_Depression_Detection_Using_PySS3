Pretty depressed todayI am pretty depressed today I went to therapy yesterday told her I am depressed and laughed about it because when I am nervous I laugh .
I woke up this morning and got some coffee just going through the motions but I think this might be my last year no one loves me and I feel like what I am living for to repeat this mean less shit for another 50 years fuck no.
