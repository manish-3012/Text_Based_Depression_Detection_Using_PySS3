I don't care about living.I distract myself all day with the internet. I have very few life accomplishments. I don't care about taking care of myself. The only thing I really care about is other people. I'm not close enough with anyone to talk about things like this. It's hard for me to be that open with someone. I've never really said anything about this, and I feel like I'm being dramatic writing it out, but I guess it had to come out some time.

Though I don't plan on it going through with it, I think about suicide nearly every day. Why would anyone care if I were gone? Would it matter?
