1 year ago I tried to kill myself.I should be happy Iâ€™m alive and I was the first hour I was awake. Now I just want to successfully end my life. Iâ€™m so confused. The more I try to love myself I become very okay with killing myself. I donâ€™t feel like I look or think like everyone else. No one will admit but I know they think so too.
