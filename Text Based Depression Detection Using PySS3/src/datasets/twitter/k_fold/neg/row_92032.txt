MotivationI've been to the lowest points in human life starting with drug addiction at the age of 14.  No one understood me and I just wanted to die.  Everytime I tried simply unexplainable things happened right down to the very rope around my neck came untied.  

Anyone reading this you're going through hell keep going.  I'm 22 now happily married been clean off drugs for 4 years and have found enough strength to get off my medication.  To top everything I got to hold my little boy, the one thing I though id never have and he is here.

Leave comments I'm here to talk ive lost so many to suicide.  

Strangers are friends you just haven't met.
