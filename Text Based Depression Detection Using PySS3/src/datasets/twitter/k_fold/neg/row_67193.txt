So I finally opened up to feeling suicidal to the one I trusted most...and her reply:
'People will die someday. Life is so easy if you donâ€™t have pain. I have no reason to stop you. I think you are an adult and have a right to make a decision. What I can say is only this. Sorry.'

I reached out to my ex of 5 years of whom we were still on good terms but I'm so stunned and hurt at how cold hearted the reply was. Head is so messed right now.
