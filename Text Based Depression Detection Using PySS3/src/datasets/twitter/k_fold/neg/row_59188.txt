Student Loans/Divorce/HeartbreakI don't know what else to do. The world truly is the bleakest it has ever felt. I am drowning in student loans. My husband is leaving me. I am living back with my parents trying hard to keep it all together. If I default on my loans I ruin not only my credit but the credit of both my co-signers, my dad and my grandfather. If I were to die tomorrow all of this would go away... My husband would get whatever I can't give him and I wouldn't have to live through the pain of losing him. My student loans don't get transferred so my family is free of that burden. I am just at a loss
