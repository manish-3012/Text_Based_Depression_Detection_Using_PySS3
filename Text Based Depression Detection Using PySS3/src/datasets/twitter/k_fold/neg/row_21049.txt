I didn't choose to be born, shouldn't I be able to choose to die?Basically what the title says. I was brought into this horrible life and I didn't ask to be. If I could go back in time and prevent my parents from conceiving me, I would. 
I get that people are looking out for me and care for me, but it's my life... I should be able to end it if I want to, in my opinion. 
I hate the way suicidal people are treated. I've been forced to go to the hospital by the police and I've been threatened to be kicked out of residence.
I didn't choose this life, and people should respect if I want to kill myself.
And yet, the only person stopping me from committing suicide, is myself. 
I'm scared.
