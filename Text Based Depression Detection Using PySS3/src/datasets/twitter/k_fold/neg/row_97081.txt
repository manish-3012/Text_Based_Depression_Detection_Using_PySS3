Diagnosed with herpes. Have a gun on the table and need to talkWhat else is there to do? Im already a virtual recluse. The only way i could have gotten it is by getting cheated on in my last relationship (THAT I USED A CONDOM). I've already had more issues than i can count that have gotten me suicidal, but this, with everything. I cant think of a single reason not to chug some vodka and blow my brains out. I need help. Anyone want to talk :(
