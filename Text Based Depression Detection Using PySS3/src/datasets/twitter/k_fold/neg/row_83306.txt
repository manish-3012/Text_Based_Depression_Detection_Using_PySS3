I recently realized that I am a burden to literally everybody I know.Honestly, itâ€™s true and I canâ€™t believe I didnâ€™t realize it for so long. Iâ€™ve dragged my family down with my depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts for over ten years - since I was fourteen and I have never gotten better. This past year, I developed a bad eating disorder and as a result, basically everybody in my life (all my family, friends, boyfriend, and my boyfriends family) were burdened more with worry, begging me to get help. I was so ready to die but my 14.9 BMI wasnâ€™t low enough. A while ago, I had promised my dad I wouldnâ€™t commit suicide and I thought this maybe could be a loophole. However, I failed and Iâ€™m back to a 16.7 BMI. I was just too tired to fight but I still want to die so bad..I donâ€™t feel like anyone benefits from knowing me. my boyfriend either hates me or loves me and I feel so unstable. I just canâ€™t ruin my parents life.
