I've lost all motivation, and have no idea what to do.I'm 16 (m), am in high school, and have no clue what I want to do. I can't define a single hobby that is my own, I can't find motivation for stuff in the future. I am so close to just falling apart, and I don't know what to do with myself. School has luckily had no counting marks since the onset of the pandemic in march, but, I'm fearful that everything will fall apart as soon as I go back to school.

One of my friends has been trying to hook me up with a guy, and I started texting him. Like, I like him, though I keep pushing myself away for fear of burden. (Lowkey have friendzoned myself, haha).

I have an exchange program to Germany in 2021 (barring this fucking virus), and can't even find motivation to study german, though it would open up opportunities in the future. I know what is best, but I just do nothing and watch youtube for 10 hours a day, sleep, barely eat ,and cut myself. I'm just blank. I've just lost any motivation, and I'm seriously considering just offing myself every week. What the fuck can I do...?

Please, help. I really don't know where to go, or what to do. Sorry if this is rambling, but I don't know what to say or do. (Ask questions if you need clarification; I'll try to answer)
