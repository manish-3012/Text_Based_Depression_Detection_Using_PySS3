Iâ€™ve given up on lifeThis is just too much for me, Iâ€™m too weak for this shit. Iâ€™ve been having some very strong suicidal feelings and I decided to seek treatment, lean on friends and start medication, none of it helped.

Iâ€™ve been taking a shit ton of Ambien recently and sadly itâ€™s losing itâ€™s effect, I canâ€™t even get proper sleep anymore. I feel more alone than ever despite seeking help from everybody, this is too much for me.

Iâ€™m looking into a sure way to end it all, I was thinking of purposely ODâ€™ing but the survival rates arenâ€™t â€œgoodâ€ enough for me. I guess I need to find a way to hang myself, I broke the only fixture in my room trying to do it some time ago and now I need to find some place to do it. Iâ€™d like to die in the middle of the woods at night but I donâ€™t like the thought of scaring anybody who finds me.

Sorry for whining this much, I just donâ€™t have anywhere else to go
