NO you wouldn't my "friends" wouldn't miss how I act how I laughed anything they would cry cause they don't have there human there to make them feel better after a breakup or someone always down to do anything with them talk so much shit about someone and one day they'll be gone you won't care you were saying how insufferable they were and how you hate talking to them now your crying and for what? guilt ?
