i'm so fucking tiredI was just scrolling through my liked youtube vids and found this song [All I Got - Hendersin](https://youtu.be/gu7kdthoJtE) and almost had a breakdown.

I used to listen to this song all day long, playing games, drawing, reading... the list goes on.

I remembered the better times when I had nothing to worry about, wasn't constantly stressed out, had time to do the things I enjoyed and my mental health wasn't a total mess. Back then I actually spent the night sleeping, and not looking at memes to distract myself from this shitty world.

I had so much energy back then, I could do anything I wanted.
Nowadays I'm just so fucking tired all the time, I'm not happy anymore, my mental and physical health went down the drain and I didn't spend the entire day longing for death.

I'm just so tired of this world and my life. I just want it to end already.
