Life is killing meIâ€™m not strong enough to endure this world and all of the suffering that comes with it. I have no interest in working or talking to people or just doing things. My days are so empty and itâ€™s just me sitting in my room thinking about life all day. I hate how everyday is filled with anxiety and dread. How is this even a life worth living? I wish life was worth living because then I wouldnâ€™t be in so much pain.
