I just don't want my friends and family to be sadEarlier today I decided I wanted to take my own life. I had planned to take the full bottle of xanax I had lying around with some old norcos and drink a handle of whiskey and slowly see if I could keep my eyes open. I wrote a letter telling certain people I loved that it wasn't their fault and I'm sorry.

I've just become so unhappy with the person I've become. I am so selfish and lack any sense of self-control and it's been a huge burden on the ones I've loved. I don't want to keep doing that to them. I don't want them to have to worry about me or put aside time to comfort me or give me someone to talk to. I know I've disappointed and hurt them at times and I can't bare to be that person anymore. 

Its hard knowing that my family and close friends might blame themselves and I just want them to be okay with this. I want so badly to let them know that this isn't their fault and they did their best. I want them to remember me as their friend, their brother, their son that was always happy-go-lucky and used humor as a coping mechanism. That I tried my best to be a good person and do the right thing. That I just wanted to make people happy and help those around me. I don't want them to remember this part of me. I don't want them to be sad and dwell on what they could have done or if they did something wrong. It was my own fault, not theirs

I'm sorry reddit, I know this post will be lost in the thousands of other posts by people who are more deserving of help. I just figured someone might read this one day and I hope that they would understand what I mean. Sorry again.
