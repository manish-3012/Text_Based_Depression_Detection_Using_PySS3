honestly never gets betterI wish it would have worked the last time I tried to kill myself. Being here these couple of months every day has been shit, I wish I ended my life in the summer already I left for some time and my friends probably wouldn't have cared if I died who really cares about anything I wish I had a gun so I could shoot myself in the head somewhere. I might do it this winter break or even one of these week days not too sure yet but it should be quite the time if I am able to do it maybe I can buy some gifts for my friends attach some notes saying sorry Im not a man I couldnt do it I couldnt live I already picked out presents for each of them even though theyll probably throw them away anyways.
