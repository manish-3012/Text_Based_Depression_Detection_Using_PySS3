I can'tI can't fucking take it anymore, I'm in pain everyday now and the more the days pass the more i feel the urge to kill myself or do drugs just to forget my sorrows just for alittle while but i can't I have to stay alive for my little brothers and i haven't done drugs in a month.

I want to feel happy for once but it's just so hard when my head is shouting all the time about how I'm never going to be a real girl, I'm only 15 for fucks sake aren't i supposed to be happy.
