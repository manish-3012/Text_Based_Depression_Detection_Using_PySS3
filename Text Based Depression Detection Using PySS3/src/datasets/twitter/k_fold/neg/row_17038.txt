Iâ€™m slipping I want someone to talk toSo Iâ€™ve been working on my depression every since I almost committed suicide last years and it evens very hard. I have been doing many Court things and counselingâ€™s due to the many different abuses my dad had done to me and my sisters. Iâ€™ve cut ends with many toxic people and have been really been getting better. Ever so often I get depressed for a week at random every month or so and that started yesterday. Before I start becoming hella depressed and start wondering why I didnâ€™t follow through last year it would be great for someone to talk to. I just want to chat and be loved while I listen to Twenty one pilots. For every one else
