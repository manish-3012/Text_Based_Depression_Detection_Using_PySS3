I'm thirteen years old, I'm a terrible human being, and I really want to dieWarning:this is going to be an extremely long post and i can almost guarantee no one will read this in its entirety.

I feel like shit right now and I've decided to write some of the reasons i hate myself, please enjoy reading about my misery.

	I just started 8th grade and I decided Itâ€™s not worth it, every day I realise more and more that Iâ€™m absolutely worthless. Iâ€™m short, ugly, dumb, have no motivation, have no confidence,and I flinch every time something even so much as falls in my direction.  The worst part of it is that Iâ€™m not even a nice person, Iâ€™ve created this character in school as â€œThe funny assholeâ€ which basically means that I tell edgy jokes and act like I fucking hate everybody. People laugh at my jokes but they donâ€™t actually care about me, they donâ€™t even care about the persona Iâ€™ve created in school, any dumbass who thinks slightly quicker than the average middle schooler could fill the void that I would leave in my school if I was gone.  A little earlier I said that I have no confidence, Iâ€™ll go on to that next.  I canâ€™t and never could get a girlfriend even if I tried, I donâ€™t even really want to get a girlfriend that much and yet I hate the fact that I couldnâ€™t if i wanted to.  I barely ever talk to my classmates in a way that doesnâ€™t make me look like a complete prick, and if I do then they either donâ€™t like me down to a fundamental part of me as a human being or I lie to them compulsively because I refuse to let anybody get even remotely close to me, that includes my parents.  My parents donâ€™t even believe me when I tell them that I feel like shit, my family is fairly well-off (upper middle class) and I see my parents pretty regularly and yet I still donâ€™t have much of a relationship with them simply because Iâ€™m too lazy to actually talk to them or do something with them without being on my phone listening to music the entire time.  Everyone in my family and beyond (my teachers, family friends, and therapist) tells me that Iâ€™m a good person and that I â€œspecialâ€ or â€œgiftedâ€ or â€œtalentedâ€ but I know thatâ€™s bullshit, My only hobbies are playing guitar and sitting on my computer playing games, and Iâ€™ve got no talent in either of those.  Another thing that Iâ€™m supposedly talented in is comedy, which again, is bullshit, I make shitty jokes masquerading as intelligent or deep and then say that I like george carlin, which Iâ€™m pretty sure just makes people from carlinâ€™s golden age fucking adore you.  Now onto the things keeping me alive. This part will be pretty short, so letâ€™s get into it, I really want to write an album before I die, I have no talent but I still enjoy guitar a lot, so Iâ€™m going to write and record an album and then Iâ€™ll have one less thing keeping me from suicide, next up is s list of petty, stupid things that donâ€™t need explaining

*I want to get a tatto before I die
*I want to get a car and go on a long-ass roadtrip
*I want to get in a fight and beat the shit out of a few of the people in my school that I really despise

And lastly, I want to go out in style, I want to announce or execute my suicide that will make it fucking unforgettable.  I know that if I do it Iâ€™m going to give personalized letters to a select group of people telling them what i think of them (why theyâ€™re a better human being than me, why I despise them, that sort of thing)
