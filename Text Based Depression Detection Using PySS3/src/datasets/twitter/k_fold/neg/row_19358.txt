Iâ€™m so fucking depressed and lonely and I think tonight may be it for meI donâ€™t have anyone to talk to and no real support system my ex best friend sexually assaulted me last winter and I stayed friends with him until this spring when it became too much because I had no one else. I went to rehab earlier this spring for alcohol cocaine and Xanax and I was doing okay for the first part of the summer but now Iâ€™m slipping. I got back to drinking every night and I started abusing perc 30s pressed with fentanyl and got back into cocaine and Xanax as well.

I can tell that itâ€™s killing me, I took so much fentanyl tonight and I have a gut feeling that after all the coke I did thatâ€™s keeping me awake and revved up wears off Iâ€™m going to OD and no one will be here to save me, honestly Iâ€™m scared of death but for some reason I just keep killing myself 

I just need a friend, someone who gives a shit why am I so fucking unlovable
