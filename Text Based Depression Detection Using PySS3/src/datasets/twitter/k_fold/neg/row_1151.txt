I've decided I'm going to end my life when I'm 35.Currently 20-years-old. I've a good 15 years left. 

Please don't try to dissuade me. I've settled on this, and I'm adamant. This is the absolute best I've felt in years. 

Hopefully by then I'd've moved out from my parents' house. I'm CF and so I needn't worry about sticking around for any hypothetical children.

I just can't cope with this any more, and having a time limit â€” it makes things easier. I can't live in a system as restrictive, as rigid, as oppressive as this one. Nothing will change either, given that people â€” myself included â€” are too afraid to take a stand. 

There's too much suffering, and there's hardly anything to show for it. There's austerity and homelessness; domestic violence (against both men and women) and mental illnesses â€” and so many other issues I can't pinpoint from the top of my head.

My family will mourn, of course. 

I was never made for this world. I'm flimsy, talentless, and just below average looking. I'm a constant anxious, depressed, and incompetent mess. 

So that's that. I'll save up as much as I can with whatever jobs I can get (too dumb to pursue university, ha) and just before I commit, I'll fuck off somewhere. I'll give the money away to various charities. To my family.
