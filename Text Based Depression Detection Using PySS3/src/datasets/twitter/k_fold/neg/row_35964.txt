I don't know if I'm fked up.Listen I'm getting better, it's been taking time but it has, but the thing is there's that part of that's still there, wanting to crawl free again and regain control and just keep me depressed. I'm talking to a girl I like but for some reason nothing is fulfilling me. I guess it's because I cared for someone else to deeply I still want them but I just don't know. I'm happy in this moment writing this but for some reason when I really concentrate on stuff I really cut deep. I just don't know what's wrong with me. I feel like I have split personalities most of the time imo but I'm probably wrong. 

I'm happy for everyone around me, I got my 2 friends away from this type of life and fulfilled what I wanted to. They're both happy and I'm proud of them, I love them to the bottom of me but I just don't know why happiness is just so damm like pushing 2 magnets together that won't connect for me. I got my best friend from killing himself and made him a better man than what I could've been, this other girl I used to like, has found someone but im happy for both of them despite the shit that happened. I would gladly give my life for either of them but all I'm saying is, why can't I just be normal
