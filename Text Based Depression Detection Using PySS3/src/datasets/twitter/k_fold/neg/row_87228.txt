I Don't Know WhyI'm suicidal. I have been for years, but it's really hitting hard lately. I just want to die, stop existing,  escape, anything. 

I know I made a post two weeks ago just like this, and I feel like a stupid attention whore for posting again. But I have no idea where to go from here. I'm lost once again. I'm in the same place, but somehow it feels lower and I have no idea why I didn't just follow through before. 

I'm trying so hard, but there's no one around me to express that to. I don't want to end up hospitalized (again) I just want to let out all of this emptiness I'm feeling.
