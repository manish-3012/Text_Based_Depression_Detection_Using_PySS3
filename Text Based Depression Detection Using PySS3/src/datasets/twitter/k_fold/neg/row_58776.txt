Iâ€™m tiredI look and feel more depressed than ever. I hate getting up in the morning. Itâ€™s getting colder outside and I hate the cold. I love being warm. I canâ€™t stop thinking about suicide. How I would do it? How it would affect my family? Thereâ€™s so many risks to them. Like paralyzation or organ failure. Iâ€™m begging to God to end my pain but he never answers. Iâ€™ve been talking to my friend and he can tell somethings wrong. I donâ€™t even really try to hide it anymore.

My teacher asked how I was today and I didnâ€™t answer. I slowly mumbled to myself â€œhorrible.â€

The only things that make me happy is my best friend and sometimes memes. There was these two memes today that had been rolling. I love thinking about myself laughing. I wish I had it more often.

I tell myself to hang on for a little longer. I just want to hold someone. I want a baby so I can hold them and sing to them and love them. I want an SO so I can cuddle with them and kiss them.

Man, Iâ€™m so lonely. 

I wish my life wasnâ€™t this way. I hate waiting. I want to fall in love and have kids. Man, I canâ€™t wait. Iâ€™ll just keep trying to push through.
