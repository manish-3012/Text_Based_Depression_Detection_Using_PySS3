so sick and tired of thisyesterday i posted that a nurse would call me today. she did a few hours ago this morning around 9 am (now it's 2:45 pm). went.. meh. didn't lead to anything and she told me try to go with schedule ive received from the psychiatric hospital last Friday. which is difficult. i just can't because i don't have energy for not much really to be honest. after we hung up i started to cry and slept for another 3-4 hours more. 

im sick and tired of no one understanding. im tired of everything. of living. of existing. the ONLY thing i feel and are thinking is about taking my own life. every day. it can't even go 5 minutes without these suicidal thoughts. im not on any mediations since last year. since they didn't really had an effect on me they won't put me on new ones or try new ones what it seems like so far. they want to try to make me active and they think it'll help the most. 

they don't understand that whatever i do its the same. nothing helps. nothing distracts.

now i started to think and plan again how to do it and when. ive been thinking about later on today. i feel done and can't fight anymore. i don't have much energy to clean and stuff like that, but will try again soon to plan ahead so it's clean. i already have a goodbye note on the laptop since February. i don't want to leave my parents and i know ill hurt them. but i can't deal with this anymore. i can't stop the pain. i can't stop feeling empty and numb. i can't stop these thoughts. i can't stop feeling this way. im getting worse and only thing i think about is suicide. every. day.
