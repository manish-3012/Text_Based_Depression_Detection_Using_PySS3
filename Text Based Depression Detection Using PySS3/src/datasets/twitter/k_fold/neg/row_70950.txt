I kissed death and livedI walked the line between life and death last week and, by some miracle, came out alive and mostly unscathed. I suffered a respiratory arrest in the middle of the night on 22/07/20. I was surrounded by my family, I was scared and they were scared. As I felt myself drifting away, all I could think was "not now". Luckily, paramedics revived me using a combination of mechanical ventilation and an adrenaline shot. I was then put into an medically induced coma for three days while I recovered from acute epiglotittis. Needless to say, I was fucking terrified and this experience has made me no longer suicidal. I will have long-term psychological issues from the trauma I experienced but I'm just happy to be alive.

Hug your friends and family. Tell the people who matter most to you that you love them. Kiss your lovers.

We never know when our time has come.

Choose life because death is the scariest thing I have ever experienced and I will never be the same.
