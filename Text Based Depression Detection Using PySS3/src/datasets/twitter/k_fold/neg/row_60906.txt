Help me get through the night.I'm at the end of my rope. I have no money, which means no more food, and in a day or two my car will run out of gas. The stupid virus going around has isolated me even more, as I can't go to the library or anywhere really.  I've lived a very traumatic life, and the last few months have me begging for the end. And that's about where I'm at. Since I have no friends or family to leave behind, death seems like the best and only option for me. My therapist says I should go inpatient, but the idea of it has me really scared. 

So I'm making this post to ask for encouragement. Please, help me feel better about going in.
