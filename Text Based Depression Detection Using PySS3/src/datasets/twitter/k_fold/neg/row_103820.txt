I feel like my brain is brokenI have struggled with chronic stress, anxiety, and depression off and on for years, but I've never experienced anything like this before. I used to have a great memory. I used to memorize stuff for fun. I kept all my schedules and responsibilities straight in my head with no stress or problems. I was organized and on top of things. It may sound silly, but my memory was a big part of my identity and my self-confidence. Now, I can't remember anything. 

Appointments, responsibilities, planned activities with friends, simple directions...I have become completely unreliable. If I'm cold and want a blanket from my bedroom, it now takes me an average of three trips from the living room to the bedroom (about 15 feet away) to successfully fetch the blanket without forgetting what I was doing en route. I don't even remember that I forgot (sorry, that's best way I could think to describe it). It's like I think "I'm cold" so I get up and start going in search of a blanket. Two minutes later, I'll sit back down on the couch with a coke in hand or my phone or [insert some random thing] and go back to watching TV. Then five minutes later I think "I'm cold" and realize I failed to get a blanket. So I go to the bedroom again, only to find myself back on the couch sans blanket after detouring to the bathroom to pee. Then I think "I'm cold," kick myself for forgetting blanket AGAIN, and venture out for Round 3. If I'm lucky, I'll succeed that time, but it often takes 4-5 tries. Each time, I completely and utterly forget what was in my head after a few seconds.

It makes me so angry and frustrated. I feel like a horribly unreliable alien invaded my body and has me trapped, helpless, in this broken brain. I own a business that requires complex scheduling, and I live in constant dread that I'm just going to forget some essential appointment. I keep inadvertently blowing off plans with friends without realizing it. I show up to scheduled activities without the proper materials. I can't even remember my keys in the morning, and they're ON THE FREAKING DOOR.

I have put (multiple, redundant) reminders in my phone, on notes, on the back of my hand, and more. I have tried taking ADHD medication (note: I do have ADHD, but this is a whole new animal). I have tasked my husband and friends with calling me and reminding me of super important things. I have cut WAY back on my responsibilities, including cutting my workload down to only a few hours a day. I have changed my diet and exercise routine. I have had my hormones, blood count, thyroid, etc. checked. Nothing helps. No one has any explanation beyond "You're stressed and depressed."

I feel like I have Alzheimer's, and I'm 30. I don't know how to live with this new version of myself. I don't want to kill myself, but if someone walked through my front door and shot me, I would be so grateful. I just hate living like this. I don't want to be this person. I want my brain to work again. I want to be able to work and live and do responsible shit like "normal" people, but I can't. Who is this person I have become?
