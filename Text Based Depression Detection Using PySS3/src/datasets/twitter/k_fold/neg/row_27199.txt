what do i even do?i used to be smart, and i mean pretty damn intelligent, that was until i woke up one day and my brain stopped working... medical mystery - doctors cant figure it out. i feel so stupid now and that was the only thing that gave me joy. i lost my emotions due to neurotoxicity 11 years ago so i dont feel alive, i dont feel anything. and i suffer from severe ocd, so everyday is living hell. i dont know what reason there is to live anymore.
