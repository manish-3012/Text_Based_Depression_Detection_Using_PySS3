who's committed their spouse?I've done this to my wife twice now in my life...
and feeling a bit guilty :(

She's done it three time voluntarily, so it's not totally foreign, but involuntarily always seems so much worse.  The times she signed up, she's been mostly having addiction issues, but the times I committed here, she was suicidal and despondent/acting unusual.

I just spoke to her on the phone and she seems scared, but actually much more lucid.  

I would love some perspective from the "other side", someone who has been committed by a spouse and felt it was the right or wrong thing to do for them.
