Thank you for everything, I'm no longer suicidalToday I am happy to say, I legitimately think i am no longer suicidal. I was previously due to feeling shit about how i was worth nothing to someone i cared a lot for. But thanks to this subreddit as well as them showing their true colours I can finally say fuck them, i'm off to live my life to it's very fullest and I no longer need to feel unwanted because I have amazing friends who will do the exact same that she did for me, but without hurting me while doing it.

Tl;dr cheers lads, I'm off to go clubbing
