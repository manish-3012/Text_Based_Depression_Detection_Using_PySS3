I feel even more suicidal when I try to liveSometimes I try to get out of my comfort zone to do something but my efforts always ends with failure. And I cannot handle failure anymore. I cannot handle my mediocrity. I've been close  to my breaking point for the last of couple years but I feel like I'm pretty much here at this point. There is not a way out anymore.  
  
I am done.
