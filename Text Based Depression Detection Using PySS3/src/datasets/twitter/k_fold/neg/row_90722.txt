I'm losing the energy to keep fightingI'm unemployed for starters. I quit my job after having slight anxiety attacks after returning back to work. I attempted the beginning of December and was put in a psych ward by my request. Spent 6 days there after getting diagnosed with moderate major depression disorder. The medicine didn't help. The 2 medications I got from my psychiatrist didn't help either. 

I had psychotic episodes spread out through a couple months before all this happened from obsessively smoking. That led to me being distanced from my close friends, burning bridges with everyone besides that, maxing my credit card, frivolously spending my money on things I didn't need, pursuing a music career, and whatever else I fucked up. 

If I was actually able to find out what's going on in my head that's keeping me from being a productive adult I would have so much peace of mind. Maybe I could work on fixing it? But no. I only get told I have anxiety/depression. My grandparents are very mentally unstable people and having them raise me and pass their genes off to me is obviously going to affect my mental state. 

It's not just the wiring in my brain that's stressing me out. I can't find a primary care physician because of how terrible my insurance is, also a lot of doctors aren't accepting new patients. By me not being able to obtain one until I probably turn 21 in a year cause my insurance gets upgraded, I cannot get put on disability. I feel that with the way I am now I won't be able to hold a job and my mom agrees with that and also thinks I should work towards disability. For the past 2 months since I quit all i do is sit up, play videogames for about 11 hours, possibly make myself food if I start feeling weak, then go to bed and restart the process. I'm losing my ability to give a shit about doing anything with my life. If I'm not ignoring reality though videogames I'm usually contemplating dying. Not necessarily suicide, but simply not existing. I'm so tired, emotionally, physically, spiritually, and everything in between. 

I don't even know what I expect to come out of posting this. I've gotten plenty of advice, but I never commit to actually utilizing whatever I'm suggested. Everything that goes wrong in my life now is amplified by 100 no matter how small. Everything for the past 1-2 years has melted away everything that made me who I am. Not like I've ever liked myself anyways. All this self hate, low self esteem, anger, sadness, among other things, have consumed me. I've been contemplating overdosing on opium. Sadly in order for that to work out I need money which I don't have because I can't deal with working. I had a job that my friends dad helped me make a resume for because he works in the same business and they never got back to me. I had plans to move out with some friends and get an apartment and have a fresh start but now that's not going to happen. 

I've always thought about suicide. It became a response I had within my own head for a little while when I would mess something up. Deep down dying scares me, but I just don't want to deal with this anymore. I've tried getting help but my care providers seem to share the same qualities as my shitty insurance. I want to take a pill and disappear. I'm sick of dealing with my train of thoughts. I'm sick of not being able to trust my decisions and at the same time regretting all the prior ones I made. I'm sick of who i am and the pit I let myself slip into. I don't even know how to end this. I post shit like this when I get low because my friends won't know how to handle me contemplating suicide when I've already attempted and them being well aware of the fact. I reflect on all my failures and fuck ups some times at night and it makes me unable to sleep. That's what's happening tonight and led to me taking the time to write this to hopfeully make my thoughts as of right now evaporate. I didn't ask to be like this
