I have no meaning in my life, no friends and no hopes for a better future..Started uni this fall and it's really stressful and I have no goals with my education so nothings really motivating me. I really like the subject but it's just not worth the effort. I think I expected too much going in to this. I thought I was going to meet people who were like me. I guess I forgot that even if those people existed I wouldn't get along because I barely open my mouth unless someone is asking me questions. (In middle school people harassed me whenever I said anything so I gradually got quieter and quieter till I just didn't say anything. And I haven't really "recovered" from that, I've basically been socially isolated till now.) I've been struggling for a long time and it's a miracle I managed to move to start uni. I feel like this is where it ends though. I'm so close to giving up.

I don't think my life has ever felt worth living for. I've always escaped into fantasies about things being good. It's lead me to make poor decisions chasing weird fantasies. I've realized this now though and I'm trying to spot when I have them but I don't dare to dream about things anymore. I want a nice car and house but that's not going to fix anything. I think what I need is to better myself so that I can have healthy and meaningful relationships and a source of income. It's just so difficult and I honestly just want to end it. I'm so tired of life.
