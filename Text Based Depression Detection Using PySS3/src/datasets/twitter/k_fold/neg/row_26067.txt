Advice about intrusive thoughts?Hi there (23m)

Cutting to it, I have intrusive thoughts about suicide most days a week, that just kind of creep up into my thought process.

I'll be sitting at my desk at work and get daydreams about just walking out the door into traffic for an example, but another example is picturing driving off into the sunset and throwing myself of the Severn bridge. I'll be having a good time with friends only to switch off and picture drowning myself I just can't stop it.

I don't understand why it keeps happening; I am someone that has suffered with depression growing up and had a very stressful and disruptive childhood.

But that's all behind me now I became fully independent and moved out of my messed up childhood home at 21, and I have been trying to really invest in myself ever since , socially through friendships and trying online dating (not that it's really gone anywhere serious), economically I'm in training to be a low level lawyer and personally through taking up music and trying to read more.

But I still struggle to combat this background feeling of vapid apathy for my being alive - it's got better since becoming independent but I feel like I'm treading water mental health wise.

Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.
