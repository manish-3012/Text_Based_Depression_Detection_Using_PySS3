Is there a place to go when you just give up?Another topic was like this but I wanted to ask in further details about this. I do not wish to pull the trigger on myself but I also want to give up on trying at this point. I don't want to be committed as they don't really allow most people in there anymore anyway. What should I do? Would I just have to stop everything and wait for death to slowly take me? Is there a way to live off another while I do minor tasks making just a tiny bit of money to 'survive' on? How can I do this into old age?

I just don't know what to do anymore. I've given up on trying to be financially responsible as I have proven I just can't do it. I want to go into bankruptcy and give up all this debt I can't handle anymore but no one will help me with that either. Then I wouldn't have a car or way to work to even 'somewhat' get by. What should I do?
