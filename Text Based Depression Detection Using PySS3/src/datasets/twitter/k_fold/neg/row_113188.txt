Donâ€™t know how to help an internet friendHey everyone! 

Recently Iâ€™ve (17F) have been talking to this girl (19f) over discord and her girlfriend broke up with her. She mentioned to me she wants to kill herself as her girlfriend decided to call things quits from her trauma with previous relationships. The girlfriend refuses therapy because itâ€™s her secret but I seriously need to vent it out online? Iâ€™m really unfamiliar how to address this as I never had anyone come to me with suicidal thoughts before, but sheâ€™s been in trouble with her mom from opening up about it. Any ways I can help online?

I gave her suicide hotline numbers and I know she wants to talk to someone she cares about it without consequences but Iâ€™m really scared right now.
