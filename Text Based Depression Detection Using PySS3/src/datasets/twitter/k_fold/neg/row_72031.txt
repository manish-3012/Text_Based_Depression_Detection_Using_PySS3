I havenâ€™t felt happy in 2 yearsIâ€™m in my 3rd year of college now and I feel more depressed and suicidal every single day. Iâ€™ve been on meds and going to therapy for the last 1.5 years but neither seems to be helping at all and my life has only gotten worse since then. I havenâ€™t felt and sense of self efficacy or truly happy since December 2017 (the end of my first semester of freshman year) and I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on for. I have no motivation to do anything in life except sleep and play video games (and not even video games help me cope much anymore). Hearing about people making positive changes in their lives when they used to be in my position or hearing people say that what Iâ€™m going through isnâ€™t unusual and that I still have my whole life ahead of me and that I can make a change for the better just makes me mad because I just want to kill myself i donâ€™t want things to get better I donâ€™t want to hear about how things will get better I donâ€™t care and I donâ€™t think they will. I have had a crush on a girl for the last 2 years and I recently found out she has had a crush on me for a year as well but that excitement has worn off since my crippling anxiety and self doubt has made it it impossible for me to be able to move toward being in a relationship with her. On top of that I have never dated a girl before or even kissed anyone so Iâ€™m extremely self conscious about that and feel like I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing. I donâ€™t want to go through the anxiety of trying to figure that out either I just want life to be over I no longer enjoy living anymore I want to kill myself so badly but I know I wonâ€™t have the courage to.
