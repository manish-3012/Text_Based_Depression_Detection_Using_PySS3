Right NowI wish I had a rope or shot gun. These thoughts always come and go but they never leave me. Right now, my suicidal thoughts are at an all-time hight. I am so tired and my mind is slipping. I fear that their can be no treatment that would work. I feel my essence, my being, is destined for torture. No amount of kind words from a professional could turn my thinking unfortunately. I am sitting in my at 3:22 contemplating why I even woke up. What is the point of my existence aside from feeling pain? I have no worth. I am so fucking angry at this world because it expects people to be happy that they are living. Some people are just useless.
