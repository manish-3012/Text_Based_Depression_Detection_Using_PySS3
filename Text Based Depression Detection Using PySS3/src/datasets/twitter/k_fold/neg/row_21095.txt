Single, no friends, no plans or goals, what's the point?I didn't go to work today. 
I stayed home, distracted myself by cleaning, ultimately ended up on the floor of my living room hitting myself and crying. 
My ex came by and dropped off some of my things. 
He did some shitty things, but he was the only person I had in my life. 
I don't have anyone now. I don't know what to do.
I tried exercising today and as soon as I was done I started crying. 
I just don't want to do any of this anymore. 
I don't see myself going anywhere or doing anything worth remembering.
