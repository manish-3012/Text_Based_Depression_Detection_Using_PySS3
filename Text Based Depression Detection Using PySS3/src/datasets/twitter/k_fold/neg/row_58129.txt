I have literally nothing to live forSo Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was pretty young and now in early adulthood Iâ€™m realizing that life just gets more unbearable with time. 

Anyways, Iâ€™m wondering if anyone can relate to this/ is in a similar situation...

A lot of times when I read or hear about what suicidal people have to say, they talk a lot of their failed relationships, addictions problems, etc. Obviously, I know these arenâ€™t the only reasons people become suicidal, but the reason Iâ€™m suicidal is because I have absolutely no meaningful relationships with anyone, and absolutely no idea how relationships even work. Iâ€™m extremely socially awkward and donâ€™t even attempt to be a part of any community or make friends or date, even though Iâ€™m a somewhat attractive girl and do get asked out pretty often. Iâ€™ve really fucked myself in a lot of ways in life and ultimately I know Iâ€™ll spend my youth in pain and misery.

Iâ€™m planning my suicide for this summer. It sucks that itâ€™s gotten to this point, because I know Iâ€™m gonna fuck up so many peoples lives, but itâ€™s too painful to go on. I think we should ultimately have the right to die. 

I remember being young and really just wanting to be held by someone who cared about me. If I canâ€™t develop meaningful relationships, that will never happen.
