A Fork in the RoadSupport from friends who are all too busy to take me in or return to shitty abusive parents. I canâ€™t live anymore with this. I need someone to take me in and love me but this fucking pandemic sucks the possibility of that happening. Fuck life, wish I had rope or a gun to make my decision easier: choose death, because I certainly canâ€™t live well
