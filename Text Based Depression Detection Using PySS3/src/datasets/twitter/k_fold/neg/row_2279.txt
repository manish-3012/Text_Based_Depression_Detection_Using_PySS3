Sorry if this is the wrong sub, but please read...I've recently managed to get hold of 100 mEq/50 ml KCL solution.
I know when injected it's suppose to stop your heart, but i'm not sure if 100 mEq will be enough?
Btw I only weight 118 lbs, if that matters.

Will this work? please tell me it'll work, also I hope it won't be messy or painful...
