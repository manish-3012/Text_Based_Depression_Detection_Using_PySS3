ðŸ‘ðŸ‘„ðŸ‘Iâ€™ve attempted suicide in the past, with tablets  cutting, and I drunkenly tried again last night, I swallowed a bottle of hydroxyzine 10mg, which did nothing..  I felt guilty about worrying my husband, who was pretty upset.  I usually feel pretty unhappy, but I feel like I get these moments of clarity, where I think that the only thing that makes sense is for me to kill myself, and once I get that feeling, I feel quite determined.  I donâ€™t really have any friends or family to talk to, and I feel like Iâ€™m doing nothing other than hurting my husband, which is the last thing I want to do.  I do still, most of the time, wish I was dead.  I hate my life and I hate everything about it, other than my husband and my pets.  I think that, in the end, theyâ€™d all probably be better off without me.
