Does anybody enjoy ruining their life?At this point I do. 
I like to just fuck my life up as much as possible but just doing whatever the fuck I want reckless or not 
And it's because I know I'm going to die soon I know I won't make it past 20 so why worry?

Edit: I'm not done 

I'm really fucked up right now I've been spending all my money on narcotics I'm addicted to tobacco failed last year dropped out of summer school and don't care how my grades look this upcoming this year and I don't care about the consequences 
I'm not trying to be a rebellious teen 
I just can't seem to care about anything 
I could really not give a fuck less 
Wish I could
