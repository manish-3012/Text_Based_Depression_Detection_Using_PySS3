I don't know anymoreI've tried to make this post 3 times already but I just kept going on and on so I'm going to shorten it. Basicly I'm really ugly , socially akward , and I hate myself. Every time I make friends I just can't seem to gain their trust , I feel lonely all the time , like nobody wants me , even when they tell me they do and we go out I just feel sad and depressed and basicly like the 3rd weel of the group. I pretty much failed school  as hard as I possibly could for about 3 years now just because I'm so depressed. I have no vision in life , no future. I try so hard to make things work with friends I put so much effort in , and trust , and basicly everything I can give , and they just take it and leave me. I feel lonely as fuck. Even my parents hate me... And the worst part is it's all my fault , I chose this life , I made bad descisions , and now I have to fucking deal with it. I've been struggling with this for about 3 years now , I just turned 17 and im reconsidering suicide. I really do not know what to do.
