I'm scared of myselfI have regrets. Not necessarily big regrets but they're certainly there. Sometimes I think about these, though, and for a short bit I am self-loathing. I know suicide is not the answer. But when I get flustered at those times, I don't think right. What if I get into a situation where I have the means to kill myself? I'm becoming increasingly scared of myself.
