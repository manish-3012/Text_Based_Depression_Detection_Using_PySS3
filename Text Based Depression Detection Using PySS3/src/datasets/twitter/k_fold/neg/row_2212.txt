Final restat this point i have no clue what to do. i never felt rested out at some point of my life and everytime i had time to rest i come home to more fight and drama and at the end when i want to be mad or angry or sad i get told to just get a grip of myself and at the end i will get blamed for not even the mistakes i made.


i tried to be honest with myself and wanted to be myself but everywhere i look i see lies and hatred  and i helped people but when i needed help i was left alone. 

as much as i tried to help others i couldnt help myself. 


i am tired of trying and trying and failing with as reward punishments


i dont want to be this kind of '' me '' since i feel i lost my real self a long time ago  when i stepped intro depression and no medical care seemed to help and i dont want to live like this '' me ''
