The hotline sent cops to my house at 2:30 in the morningI used an online hotline chat because I was feeling really in crisis and I felt unsafe. I talked to the person for about an hour and afterwards I told them I was feeling tired and wanted to end the chat. They asked me if I wanted to connect with someone on the phone or schedule a call tomorrow, but I said no. I was emotionally and physically exhausted. I told them Iâ€™d write or call back if I needed more help.

3 hours later, I get a knock on my door and my two roommates wake up. There are 2 fucking cops on my doorstep asking me all kinds of personal questions. I had finally calmed down a bit, but now Iâ€™m back in a whirlwind of emotions. I feel hurt. It was scary and I didnâ€™t know if theyâ€™d make me go back to a mental hospital or not. I told them to leave and they did.

I know now to never trust a hotline again. All this did was freak my roommates out and cause all kinds more drama in my life.

So thanks, Trevor lifeline, for the terrifying experience.
