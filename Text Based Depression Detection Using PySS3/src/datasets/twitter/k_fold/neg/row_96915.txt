contemplating deathrecently i snapped out of a depression and i was doing so good. cleaning my room, talking to family, just enjoying life. i blocked a girl iâ€™ve been â€œfriendsâ€ with for a year. she messes with my head too much. acts like she likes me, then goes ghost. fucking hate it. i hate how sheâ€™s been in my head for a year and a half and even blocking her and cutting her off doesnâ€™t help. iâ€™m in a mental prison. i want to break out. i just have the typical â€œwhat will my family doâ€ regrets going on. but i really am starting to not give a fuck. i used to not be selfish, but iâ€™ve been molded into it. i genuinely do not care if anyone will miss me. iâ€™ll be dead, i wonâ€™t even know how they feel. obviously iâ€™ll kill myself far away from here, i still have that thing inside me that knows itâ€™s fucked up to have the family see my corpse. i hope they never find me. but detectives these days always have to be nosy and diggin around for the body! lmao jk. iâ€™m planning either shooting myself in the place that causes my hell, the brain. or just overdosing and feeling a great high before perishing. not sure yet, still planning that part. iâ€™ve been to doctors multiple times, they donâ€™t help they want money. the pills theyâ€™ll put you on will fuck ur brain up to potato status, and id rather be dead than dumb, so thatâ€™s a no go. drugs have been helpful, marijuana, acid. but itâ€™s a money hole. iâ€™m broke. i have no will to work, i find it silly how human beings are out slaving away and come back from work with a smile. give this species fattening food and a big old truck and theyâ€™ll never question their surroundings or what the fuck theyâ€™re doing here. i believe in god, i love god, i accept christ, all of that. i believe in it all because how else could this nonsense world be here? some believe the science route, i respect it, itâ€™s ur opinion. i believe a god made all of this. only thing tho, is i donâ€™t believe i fit in gods plan. i shouldnâ€™t be involved. i wish i wasnâ€™t part of gods world. i wish he kept me in as an idea, and didnâ€™t decide to spawn me here. i donâ€™t belong here. weezer, i feel you. all respect to you god, the scenery itself is pretty, the nature is awesome. but what were forced to do is beyond enjoyable. work? talk to other human beings who i couldnâ€™t care less about? fake laugh? fake relate? man fuck this. and even if you do fall in love with something in this world, itâ€™s temporary. well guess what? iâ€™m temporary. fuck this.
