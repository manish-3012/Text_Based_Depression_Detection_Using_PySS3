I'm dyingHi, i guess i just wanted to post this somewhere. Somewhere people could find it, without directly telling them at this moment. 

I ruined everything myself. I'm needy and draining and toxic. And I think its best i opt out. Im sorry. Best wishes to all my friends, and especially my boyfriend.
