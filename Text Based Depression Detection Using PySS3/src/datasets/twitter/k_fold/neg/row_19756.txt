Iâ€™m literally not good enough for anyoneI just found out my wife wants a divorce. Apparently she has been feeling this way for quite some time, but has convinced me that everything was fine until yesterday. 

I leaned in and kissed her playfully before going to take a nap before work. Just as in falling asleep I get a text saying that she doesnâ€™t feel anything when she kisses me. Iâ€™m devastated but I go to work just the same. I get off work at 6am and go home to sleep. Ha! Like sleep is gonna happen now. I finally crash around 8am-10am and have been up since. We sat down and talked for about 4 hours tonight and she told me sheâ€™s unhappy. I donâ€™t make her happy. She doesnâ€™t want to be with me. She doesnâ€™t love me like I love her. She said sheâ€™s been feeling this way for months. I was literally clueless. 

Iâ€™ve been abandoned by my mother, my father. My wife convinced me to move across the country with her, so I have no one here. And now she wants a divorce. Forcing me to make the choice to stay in a state where I know no one. Or move back home to be close to my brother and sister. Oh. And the fact that we have a 3year old. That makes it so much harder. Iâ€™m just tired of feeling this way. Iâ€™m tired of never feeling like Iâ€™m good enough. 

I also think there is something poetic about dying on your birthday. Which is Monday. Maybe Iâ€™ll get the courage by then. Who knows.
