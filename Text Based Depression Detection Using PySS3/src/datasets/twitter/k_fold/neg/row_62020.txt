Bad habits againHi,

I sometimes turn to alcohol and overdo my medication when Iâ€™m not feeling good. 

I told everyone I wouldnâ€™t do it again but now I have. Itâ€™s not really bad but I hate that Iâ€™ve gone back to this. 

I just needed my mind and my thoughts to slow down. I couldnâ€™t take it any more. I still feel bad.
