Sometimes I want to die, sometimes I want to liveOf course I want to live. 

If life went the way I wanted to. If I had friends, could afford to go to college, had things I wanted, etc. But I donâ€™t. Of course life can be beautiful, when you have everything you want. But if you donâ€™t, then itâ€™s not very enjoyable.

I always feel like shit when I go on Tik Tok or Instagram or wherever, seeing all these people with perfect looks and perfect cars and perfect everything. And then thereâ€™s me, with none of those things. I would never wish someone not to have their things just because I donâ€™t have it, Iâ€™m glad at least others have stuff they want. I just wish I could say the same for myself.
