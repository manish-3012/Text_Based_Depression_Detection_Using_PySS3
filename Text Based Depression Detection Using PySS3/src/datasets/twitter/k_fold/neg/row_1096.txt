Questions about SuicideSo I've been considering suicide, I have a history of that shit. I'm in a bad depression. I don't know why I'm thinking of suicide. I'm bipolar, so I know this is all bound to end, rather soon, soon being probably in 6 months at least. So it's not that I believe this is a never ending pain thing. But the depression really hurts and I'm scared I'm going to commit suicide. I don't want to actually die, I want to live and enjoy life. I don't want the ones I love to grieve, although I wish they would understand where I'm coming from, understood how bad things are. I go to work and just cry and it's so embarrassing. 

I feel like I can't trust myself. I'm afraid if I get in my car and drive I'm going to drive to where I where I want to commit it. I'm scared I'm going to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night when everyone is sleeping and commit it. I feel like I'm on the brink of doing that. I feel like this is the end and I can't imagine actually living another week or so. I feel like I want to do this and this is my destiny. I'm scared this is going to be one big impulse and I won't be able to take it back.

So I've been telling myself suicide is an active, conscious decision. It won't happen unless I decide to do it. So here are my questions, what if I /decide/ to do it, and go off to do it, how do I stop myself, what am I suppose to do? When people commit suicide, do they have a clear reason in their mind?

I see a therapist and psychiatrist. My pdoc just gave me a new anti depressant so I'm really hoping it works sooner rather than later. I do all they say to treat depression but it's not work. So yes I do exercise and all these different things a therapist would suggest.
