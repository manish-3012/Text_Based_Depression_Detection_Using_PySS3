A Farewell. Hello Reddit. This is my first and most likely my last post to this sight. I originally just wanted to end it and have everyone forget my existence, but it felt like i needed something to leave behind. A legacy maybe. I let my life get so far ahead of me and now its starting to bite me. After leaving my significant other i thought i was happy, she was abusive and made me feel miserable. But after that it felt like the world was crashing down on me. One after another family began to hate me, my grades began so slip and I no longer feel like I can contribute to society in any way whatsoever. So I made a decision to end my life and be done with the suffering. Quick and simple. I want everyone to know that i won't be missed by anyone in my life, so i wouldn't call it a stupid decision. Don't let yourselves fall into the same pit of despair as i did. Focus on anything, whether it be school, work, or even family. I might be a lost cause but that doesn't mean anybody else should be. Goodbye everyone.
