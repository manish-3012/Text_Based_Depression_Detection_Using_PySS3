I just don't know anymore.Ok, im not even going to bother with a throwaway. I dont know what to do anymore. Ive been out of work for almost 3 yrs with just the occasional job yo hold myself and my daughter over. We survive barely, and i mean barely. We've lived in my car, motels and tents. Notbing has gotten better and isnt going tk in the for seeable future. My daughter could have an amazing easy life with her grandparents, much better than i could ever offer her. Everyday i want to kill myself and havent strictly because of her but its to much now. I can't keep letting her have nothing and live like this. I cant provide for her or myself and dont see any possibilty of being able to. Her father is absolutely useless to her and his other 3 children. I just know she'll have a better life with her grandparents than she could ever get with me and she deserves that, not me. I love her more than the world and it kills me to not be able to do anything for her. I cant take this life anymore, I dont know what else to do and needed to vent.
