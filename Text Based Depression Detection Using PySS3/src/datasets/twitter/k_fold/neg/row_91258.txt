Internet bullying taken too far So there's this forum that i've been posting in for 7 years, most of us know each other personally now, it's a weird little community in a subsect of an internet site. anyways. i said one of the girls that i dont particularly get along with was a bitch (ooOOOooOO). Her reaction was to send topless pictures of me from 6 yrs ago around the forum. which was shitty, but it happens. 

well, someone got a hold of them and managed to send them to my family. 

im 25, i work in a government office as an accounts executive. im horrified that any minute now im going to get called into my bosses office because he's been sent them too. 

this has just been a catalyst in a steadily declining state of mind. ive since deleted my facebook and forum accounts, and have pretty much been in hiding hoping this all blows over. any one i have tried to talk to about this just says to get over it. 

work has be frazzled to the point where i can barely concentrate, i just dont know what to do. 

im an easy target, im chubby, im weird, and i dont make as much money as a lot people. but ive worked hard to get to where i am and now someone is hiding behind their internet screen coming after me for no good reason.
