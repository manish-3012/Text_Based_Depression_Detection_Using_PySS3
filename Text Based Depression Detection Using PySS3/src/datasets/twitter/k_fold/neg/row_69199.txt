I'm getting close and I am not sure what to do anymore.I have been really struggeling for about 5 month now. I broke up with someone who I loved very much. I first turned to drinking and drugs to ease the pain but I got quite suicidal. It got so bad I had to make some major changes in my life or I didn't think I was going to make it. I have done absolutely everything I can to pick myself up. Therapy, psychiatrist, lexapro, quit drinking, quit smoking, started working out, started eating right, started travelling, focused on work and even started hobbies. Despite all this somet It feels like nothing is helping. I can barely get out of bed most days. I'm on the verge of tears every day. It is difficult to do anthing. It's even hard to write this post. I don't know what to do anymore. I wake up everyday feeling like I am being tortured. It's been 5 months and It is driving me nuts feeling like I can't escape. I could really use some words of wisdom right now
