To be honest I don'tI have had depression for 4 years now I have attempted suicide 3 times all failed. I'm overweight. I'm awkward, no one likes me, I have never had a girlfriend problaby never will. I'm just a joke a waste of human space waste of money aswell as a waste of time for my parents. I don't feel the urge to live and haven't in so long. The few people I actually cared about no longer wants anything to do with me.
