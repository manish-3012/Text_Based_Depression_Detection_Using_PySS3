Is there a point?Once I'm dead, nothing will matter... because I'll be dead. Sure, my death will matter to a couple of people, but that's okay because I won't be aware of that.

Friends won't matter, family won't matter, my hypothetical future won't matter. Nothing.

I've tried to live with chronic fatigue syndrome for almost four years and I've had enough. I'm not saying it can't get better, but even if it will get better, what's the point? Even if I had the most amazing life, if I was healthy and happy, what's the point? Humanity will keep going. People around me will be a bit sad, but they'll keep going. I won't though.

What's the point?
