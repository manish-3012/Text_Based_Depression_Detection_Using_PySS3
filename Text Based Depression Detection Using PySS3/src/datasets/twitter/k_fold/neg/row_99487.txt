Everyday I think about jumping off a 3rd story rooftop/balconyNot really sure what else to say, donâ€™t think 3 stories is sufficient enough to kill me. I have a little brother, mother and father that would be devastated because theyâ€™ve all tried to help me through depression, anxiety and OCC. I have a girlfriend that cares deeply about me and I know it would hurt her. I donâ€™t have the energy to live for others anymore. The only thing stopping me is the thought that I wonâ€™t die from the fall and it will only make things worse.
