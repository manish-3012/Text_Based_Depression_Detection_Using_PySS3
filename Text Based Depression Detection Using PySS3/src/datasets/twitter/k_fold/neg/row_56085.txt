what is wrong with me?i donâ€™t understand. here i am, months and months later, still crying and still depressed and not over you. but you moved on in half the time and have already gone back to someone i thought was my best friend. 

what is wrong with me. why did i love you unconditionally, when you made me feel miserable and were the reason i started cutting myself again? why did i love you so much?

i feel so fucking pathetic, still hung up on you while you donâ€™t even care anymore. why did i love you that much.

itâ€™s gotten to the point where i just want to end it. iâ€™m not getting any better, in fact iâ€™m probably getting worse, and every waking moment iâ€™m shaking with anxiety over you. i canâ€™t even go to sleep without fearing the nightmares of you both laughing at me for being so pathetic and weak. 

i canâ€™t even accept anyone into my life. iâ€™ve had countless people ask me out at this point, jumping at the opportunity of me being single, but i push all of them away, because iâ€™m in so much pain.

i just want to kill myself.
