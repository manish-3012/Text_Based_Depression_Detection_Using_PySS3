Life just got a hundred times worstTo put it mildly, I had a very traumatic experience as a child. I remember it very vividly, but I'm unable to feel any emotion from it. This apparently is my mind suppressing said emotions to protect me. I found all this out in the last hour. I was always depressed and suicidal, but I never associated it with what happened in the past. Now I'm being told that it's exactly why you're feeling this way. I'm trying very hard to feel said suppressed emotions, but I'm just not feeling anything, because for the first time in years, I'm actually scared. I remember everything, but it's very difficult getting my mind to feel anything.

 How was your Wednesday?
