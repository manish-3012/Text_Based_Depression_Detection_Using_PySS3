I really want to go to the hospitalTo finally get diagnosed and get some help but Iâ€™m scared everyone will leave me behind and Iâ€™ll just end up in bigger debt then I already am in.  Itâ€™s not fair. I wanna get a job and get my adult life started but Iâ€™ve had to be a caretaker  and Iâ€™m so afraid Iâ€™ll never get out of this spiral.
