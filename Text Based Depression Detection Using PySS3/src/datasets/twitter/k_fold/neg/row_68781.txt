I don't think I can take this any much longerI fucking hate this life, I still live with my family and I'm fucking trying ok, I tried to ignore them and do my thing, I tried not cut (haven't for a year now) I tried not to do drugs (close to a year clean) I started to exercise and did a diet (lost 20 pounds during quarantine) but it all eventually came down to shit because they're always there, laughing at my face, they said no matter how much I lose I'll still be fat. They called me stupid because I failed a year, if I fail another year I'll kill myself. they've degraded me beyond reason, in ways I'm more ashamed to admit on a sub, I've seen them sexually harass my siblings, I've seen my dad put my hand on his dick, I don't wanna live the rest of my life with this knowledge, I don't wanna be near them, but nothing will solve that, fuck me, fuck it, if I fuck up another time that's it for me, I won't even write them a letter, they can speculate and spend their energy making up whatever story they want. Y'all can fucking laugh at me every time I open the fridge to eat because "oh here comes a binge" well fuck you i've eaten 103kcals in the last three days and am about to burn that as well. Fuck you for watching me "in case you steal smt" fuck you for abusing your pets and laughing about it. Fuck you for using religion to control ppl and fuck you for not getting me help when I needed it. I seriously can't imagine being more done than this
