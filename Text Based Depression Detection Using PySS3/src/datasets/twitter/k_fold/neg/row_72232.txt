My parents betrayed me and I think it has finally given me the motivation to end it.I have no friends, money, future job prospects, I hate being alive. I have no human connections aside from my family but they have recently shown that they hate me. The only reason I didn't do it before was I believed they loved me and I didn't want to make them feel bad but now I know that won't be an issue. There is nothing tethering me to this existence anymore. So I think experiencing that hate might actually be a good thing since I no longer feel guilty about doing what I have wanted to do for so long.
