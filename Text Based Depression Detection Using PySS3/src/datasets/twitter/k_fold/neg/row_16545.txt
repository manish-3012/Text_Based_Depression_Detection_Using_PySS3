Why do I feel the way I do?I have an okay life. My family loves me, theyâ€™re supportive, I have a few friends that appreciate, I have my education paid for... yet, I think about suicide every other second. Why would I think about ending my life when I have it so good? 
Iâ€™ve tried killing my self a number of times, each of which failed, and I have people after people telling me how much they love me. Even so, I still want to do it. 

I could do it. But my stupid family is keeping me here by saying theyâ€™d never get over it, or Iâ€™d kill my younger sister since Iâ€™m such an influence. I get it, but Iâ€™m in so much physical and mental pain, I can bear it. Iâ€™m on meds, Iâ€™ve done therapy... nothing helps. 

I donâ€™t know what I need.
