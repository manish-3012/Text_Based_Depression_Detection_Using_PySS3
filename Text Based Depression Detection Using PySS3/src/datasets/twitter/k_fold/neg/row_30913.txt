How do I do this?So I'm five days out of a psych ward. I asked what happens if I get to absolute crisis again and they said to call them. 

They didn't even give me their number.

I feel absolutely done with everything. I feel empty. I thought a weekend away with friends would reset or give me a reason to be alive but it's just further confirmation that I'm absolutely done. 

I'm tired to fighting to stay alive and waiting constantly on external help. I upset my fiancÃ© constantly and I just don't see a future for myself. He'd be happier finding somebody who doesn't constantly put the fear of God into him over whether I'm alive by the time he gets home. 

I'm still waiting on CBT from a June 2018 attempt. I told everyone I thought could help that I was at the end of my coping skills and nothing happened. Nothing will happen and nothing like change. There's no help and I'm not enough. 

I just want out.
