I could kill myself on the same couch my spirit died onTo give context, I'm a child sexual abuse survivor that has been battling depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 10. I'm also a recovering self harm addict (I'll be 20 months clean on the 20th) and I'm currently 19yo.

A year and a half ago, I was 17 and dating a man 7 years older than me. During that time, I had surgery and was knocked out on pain meds post-surgery for almost 2 weeks afterward. He sexually assaulted me on the couch multiple times a day for the entire length of time I was on the meds. I was semi-concious for some of it, and knocked TF out for most of it. The memories from when I was concious won't leave my head. They're always there. Always putting a damper on every part of my life.

I don't want to live this way. I literally just got the memories of my CSA out of my head less than 6 months before the assaults, and now I'm right back to where I was. Suicidal, fighting thoughts and memories I can't escape, and feeling like a worthless whore. I know my parents and best friend care about me and want to help, but I don't want to fight it anymore. I'm done trying to be strong. I'm done trying to be a functioning adult and preparing for the future when I can't get the past out of my head.

 I want to put a bullet in my head and forget.
