It's not gonna get better. I just wanna give up. It's hopless.I'm having a hard time. I really wanna kill myself right now. I seriously feel like I really want to go. It's hopless. Nothing ever gets better even if people say it does. Don't even say that to me because multiple times things seemed like they would get better in my life and then it just started going in the opposite direction. Because of these events that happened in my life I really just want to give up on it.
