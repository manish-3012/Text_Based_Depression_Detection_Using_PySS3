Iâ€™m so near to ending itMy life just feels not worth it anymore and Iâ€™m a burden to everyone. There are problems that I canâ€™t solve and my only reason to live before was fixing people.
Now I am to tired of things being that way to stay alive. My suicide letter is already written.
My parents are divorcing and I realised my mother is so controlling. I just feel like there is only one escape. Life just is one big hole and everything is shitty.
Iâ€™ll go to sleep now and decide what happens tomorrow.
Anyways, sending love to yâ€™all and if Iâ€™m still there tomorrow, if anyone needs someone to talk hmu.
