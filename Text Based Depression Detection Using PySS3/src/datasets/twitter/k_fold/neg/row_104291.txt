Every morning I wake up and immediately think of killing myselfEvery morning I  know I should see my baby and be happy. I know I should see my older son and be happy. I know I should see my husband and be happy. But I'm not. 

I'm very sleep deprived, sex/affection deprived and I know that has a lot to do with it. I didn't think this was a postpartum issue because I'd been feeling fine for months until recently. 

I'm anxious, sad, depressed, and my OCD is terrible lately. It feels like nobody gives a fuck. I have no friends. My husband just acts like me feeling so shitty makes him distant and he withdraws which is the opposite of what I need right now. 

I tried reaching out but I couldn't get into see a counselor or psychiatrist for meds. My doctor discharged me because I stopped taking meds when I was trying to conceive. Now because of a silly fuck around I can't even get in to see my primary care physician. 

I just can't handle this anymore. I don't want to die but I do at the same time. My kids shouldn't have to grow up with someone like me. I shouldn't be such a burden on my husband. I keep hoping maybe I'll have a brain aneurysm in my sleep or something.
