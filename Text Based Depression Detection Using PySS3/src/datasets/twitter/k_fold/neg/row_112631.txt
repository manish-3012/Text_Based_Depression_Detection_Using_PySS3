i donâ€™t want to live anymoreiâ€™m 23. i literally have not had any friends since i was 12 years old. iâ€™m pretty sure i have a mild or â€œquietâ€ form of bpd. also pretty sure i have social anxiety or avoidance personality disorder or both. iâ€™m fucking lonely. iâ€™ve always had people i talk to at work and school but it ends as soon as i walk out the door. the only people i talk to outside of work right now are my grandparents, my mom and my siblings. i had an online friend that i talked to all the time but he eventually got tired of me being clingy and annoying and cut me off. 

iâ€™m so lonely it physically hurts. i hate myself. i cry myself to sleep at night and wake up crying in the morning. i donâ€™t want to do this anymore
