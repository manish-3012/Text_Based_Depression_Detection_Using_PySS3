I've had it allI was born in a place where I could get a wise look at the world, I know how beautiful life can be. But I also know the way things go â€²round this place. For some people to laugh and live happily, majority of the humanity and almost all the nature must cry and live miserably, only to die in the most meaningless of ways. Life is unfair. If thereâ€²s a God, dude is a prick. An entity who's bored and dudeâ€²s out there trying to prove something to some Satan or someone he created. A ridiculous story coming from somewhere in a goddamn desert if you ask me. 
 
Still, Iâ€²m a prick who had it all, too. I've had decent people around me. But I was being bullied in school for 8 years straight. I was a ball of insecurity by the time I reached high school and that made my life with decent people in my classroom into me being awkward and destroying the good first impression I've had in the first place. I always leave a good first impression but I'm also professional at destroying my own image. So I've had it all and now I've lost it all. Friends, decent network of people, possible love interests, all kinds of job opportunities. I've blown them all and I diminished my own life. Now I feel like I should end it before it gets even worse. There's no chance for me to make a comeback. Iâ€²m being crushed under the influence of the person I could've been versus my present self. I've had it all. Basically everyone would fare better in my place. But I've blown it all. I'm the worst possible thing to happen. And I shouldn't be that anymore. I should've been nonexistent.
