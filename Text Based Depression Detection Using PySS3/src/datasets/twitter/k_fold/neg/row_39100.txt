I don't want to do engineering anymore but not even brave enough to kill myself.Hey, 
First of of my parents love me a lot. They care about me too much. But sometimes too much results in too much harm too. 
I don't want to do engineering. I feel suffocated I feel like I'm in water desperately trying to breathe.
I'm 21 and have failed engineering three times. But I told my parents that I failed just once. They're expecting me to graduate this year but I can't for next 3 years. 
I don't know what to do. I just want to stop existing but I'm not even brace enough to kill myself.
Don't get me wrong I don't want to drop out. I just want to do BBA instead of engineering. 
I'm 21 it's little too late to start university again. Maybe I should just kill myself.
