LostI've been suicidal my entire life. I'm 27 now, and attempted to end my life back in High school. I told friends/my girlfriend at the time and they helped me through it, I talked to my parents about it and got help. For years I've had things contained, I've learned to live life. Of course there are rough patches but they've never gotten that bad.   


Lately I've been in the deepest, worst, most depressed state I've ever been. I don't know what to do in life, and I feel like everything I've worked on and gained is very rapidly slipping through my fingers. I don't want to be this toxic, awful void in my girlfriends life anymore. I'm so horrible to her sometimes, I don't know how she puts up with it. Deep in my head I hate how I talk to her, I hate how I act, but I'm so angry and upset and I hate myself so much. I don't know how to stop myself from acting so awful.   


I was just laid off from the only job I've had for 8 years. The room mates I've been incredibly close with and lived with for 5 years are done with me. I called one out for behaving insane while he was on amphetamines, and because of that he's manipulated everyone else into no longer wanting me around. By the end of April I will be homeless. My parents who are lifelong alcoholics have been admitted into rehab, and I no longer have any relationship with them. I have no drive to look for apartments, or a job, and I just want everything to be over. I'm a failure in every aspect of life, I've squandered so many opportunities. I have no money to my name, and no potential in life. I want the pain to end. I want it all to just go away. I've been told so many times that things get better, when the hell does that start? Am I just a waste of space feeling sorry for themselves? I genuinely hate the person I've become.
