I'm ready to fuck off. Why move on in a world that won't give you a chance? I've been trying for a few decades now and nothing has ever worked out for the best. It's always the least worse of the options I have laid out in front of me. Now I live thousands of mines away from anything that's familiar and still I never get ahead. I'm tired of being told to volunteer or just wait things will get better. I'm sick of interacting with people period. I sick of some asshole telling me how it's not all that bad when they have way more than I'll ever have. If you have a family to get Thanksgiving dinner with then fuck you, you don't have the right to tell me what I should do with my life. On Thanksgiving or Christmas I work because they know I don't have any loved ones. I spend every holiday working to barely make enough to pay my bills. I can't even get the time to go see my parents graves. I don't even have the money to get back there. Every choice I can make will end up with me being homeless again. I'm sick of the assholes telling me that being homeless isn't that bad. Ever been woken up by some asshole kicking you? Ever been in a soup kitchen and some other homeless guy takes half your food because you are in "his town"?

Every path laid out in front of me is horrible. It's not worth continuing on with the options I have. If things did get better I wouldn't have the ability to save up enough to retire. It will be like this until I can't work anymore and then what? Where do I go then? 

Fuck this world and the people in it. I don't want to be here or around anyone anymore. I'm sick of trying to solve unsolvable problems.
