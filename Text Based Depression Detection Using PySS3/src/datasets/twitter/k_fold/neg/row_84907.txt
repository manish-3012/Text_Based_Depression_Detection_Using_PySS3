My girlfriend is really depressed and I don't know what do anymore. I need help.She says I'm the only one who makes her happy, so I try to be with her as much as possible. However, I can't always be there due to school and work.

Her parents are very nice to her 50% of the time, but the other 50% they act quite silly and harsh towards her, which makes her even more sad.
I try to do so much, but I just don't know what else I can do. I can't imagine losing her, and I need help before it's too late. She even told me she thinks about suicide often, but didn't do it. She also cut herself in the past.

She's very open to me and I'm pretty sure she says anything which is great.

Thanks so much in advance for the help ;c

EDIT: She has been depressed for several years now, she almost lost a very close family member years back.
