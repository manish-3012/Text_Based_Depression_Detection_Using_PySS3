OCD making me want to kill myselfPlease I want you wherever you are to understand that you don't have it that bad. Please I have been suffering from OCD for 5 months and each relapse has been getting worse and worse. Literally I'm begging for my old relapses! That is how awful my life is. I have no friends . Quit my stupid restaurant job. Literally every change in my life that I do to degrade my OCD only increases it in other areas. Tonight I have had enough of this damn OCD even though I'm beating it. It seems death is calling me since my OCD obsession was to grab onto a telephone wire connected to my local gym. I entered my gym doing my usual warmup shit until I got the o=OCD thought that I could get rid of my OCD through touching this wire with a stick. I know but please understand. I'm so numb right now that I don't even know if I'm alive or dead tbh. Seriously FML. I want you all to know don't kill yourself , you will never have the guilt and numbness I'm experiencing now.
