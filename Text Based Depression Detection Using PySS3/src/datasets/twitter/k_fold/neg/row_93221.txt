Getting thoughts off my chest and onto a public platform...I feel like everyone I know is hiding something from me that explains why I'm difficult to love and care about. I feel like everyone around me has some kind of communication that I don't have and I will always be lagging behind. I feel that I was meant to die early because I wasn't built to last as long as others. I feel like I don't have enough love, kindness and motivation in me than others do. I feel like the worlds closing in on me in every way and I'm destined to die soon even if I don't want to. I feel like I'm at the last stage of my life. I feel like I wasn't meant to have a future.
