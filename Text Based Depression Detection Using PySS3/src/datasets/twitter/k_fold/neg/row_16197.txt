I suffer from severe anxiety/ depression/ OCD and itâ€™s almost 4 am here. Iâ€™m lying in bed with my husband and our doggos but I canâ€™t stop crying.I thought coming to this sub would make me feel better? Boy was I wrong. Reading all of your stories of how â€œperfectâ€ life is and how youâ€™re still miserable makes it so hard for me to be optimistic about life as a 22M homosexual. My life has never been good, not even okay. I thought dogs and marriage And a house could fix it but it was just a brief glimpse of something reminiscent of happiness? Life really Fucking sucks and I just want to go to bed. My nervous ticks that I havenâ€™t had since grade school are resurfacing. Oh and the cherry on top is that when I cry I feel guilty that my husband might hear me so I feel worse and the cycle continues and worsens ðŸ˜Ž
