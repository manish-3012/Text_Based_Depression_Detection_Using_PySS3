Am I the only one who gets texting anxiety?!?For example, I don't want to be the first to text my friend when I'm bored or I'm feeling down because I'm afraid I'll annoy them.
And if they don't respond within the first ten minutes, I start freaking out.

Or if I'm getting into an argument with my friend cuz they are trying to tell me I'm a good person, but i keep saying I suck cuz I have no self-esteem, and then they don't answer and I think i pissed them off, and I start apologizing a bunch.

Or when i try to explain that they can't stop me from killing myself, but it comes off wrong thro text, so they get mad atme for giving up, and then i freak out cuz i hate when my friends are mad at me. 

Or I just haven't talked to someone in a while and I text them to ask if they want to hang out, and they say they're busy, and I think i did something wrong. 

Or when I'm trying to have a real conversation and they give one word answers and I think I'm not good enough for their time...

Anyone else???
