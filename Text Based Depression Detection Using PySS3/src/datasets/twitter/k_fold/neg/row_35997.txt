I don't really want to live a life of mediocrity.I'm a 17 year old. I just failed my driver's test. It's made me realize that I will never, ever be GOOD at anything I try to do. At best I'll just be okay. Average. Mediocre. I wanted to be special. I wanted to live my dream life. I had built up a delusion where I saw that as being possible; I'd get my license, get a job, go to college, meet a girl, get married, and live a child-free life of decadence. This failure to get my license is only my latest in a long string of failures, and it's broken down the delusion and now I can't see myself amounting to anything but being an average lower-middle class eternal virgin (I'm fat, ugly, and I can't even grow facial hair to hide my "baby-face").

So I'm pretty much tired of this bullshit. I think I might walk into traffic tonight.
