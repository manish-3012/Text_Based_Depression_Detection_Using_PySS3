I just want to end it allMaybe itâ€™s the quarantine thatâ€™s getting to me, but Iâ€™ve always felt like this. Iâ€™m a 24 year old man and I feel like Iâ€™m always gonna be alone. My mind is always going a million miles a minute with these thoughts of a better life than the one I have. I donâ€™t have any friends, never had a boyfriend or significant other, I always feel like the â€œotherâ€ in a social situation.

Iâ€™m not close to my family and they donâ€™t understand what I go through. And they never try to understand my depression. Iâ€™ve been institutionalized for it before. 

I just wish I could be normal. Like I always feel like Iâ€™m struggling to keep it together. I have no one to lean on. I have no one to confide in. I feel like I can never express myself. I just wish it would all stop. Iâ€™m tired of ALL of it.

Iâ€™m losing hope that itâ€™ll all get better. Iâ€™m convinced it wonâ€™t. I want to be normal
