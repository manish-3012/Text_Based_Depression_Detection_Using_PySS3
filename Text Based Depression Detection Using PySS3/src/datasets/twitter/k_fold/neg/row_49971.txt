worst time of my lifeI can't take it anymore. My life is ruined. I'm suicidal. I can't stop crying and thinking about ending my miserable fucking life.

I'm 20. It all started a few years ago, I stumbled upon the philosophical doctrine known as "Determinism". It claims that we have no free will, and everything in the universe is pre-determined and out of our control. And everything was going to happen anyway.

This ruined me. I sank into major depression and became suicidal. Eventually, like after a year or so, I got over it but it still left a scar. Now, recently, it randomly came back to haunt me. It's bothering me so badly. Life feels so 2D and fake...

And what made it even worse, I tried to talk to my friend about it to make me feel better, but they only made it 1000 times worse, because they're a firm believer of determinism. It bothers me so much because they are intelligent and smart and it makes it even more believable. I can't fucking take it

So I went to bed crying and aching in pain, contemplating suicide and took a nap. Now I'm here and I don't know what to do. I can't fucking take this anymore. I am not happy. I will never get better. I can't fucking take it.

can someone possibly pm me
