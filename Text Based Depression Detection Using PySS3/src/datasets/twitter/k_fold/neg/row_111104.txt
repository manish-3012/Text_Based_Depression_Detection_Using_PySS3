There is one question I ask from myself: Do I want to be rather dead or alive?My answer to that question is that I rather want to be dead. So there is only one action I need to take and I then I've achieved death. I do not ask this question only right now while typing this post during some awful breakup or loss but for last 9 years consciously, unconciously, in every way I've been asking it. So I don't take suicide lightly. You seriously have to consider what you give up (are you willing to give up things you don't know yet - like possible new relationships, activities etc) and decide if you seriously rather be dead than alive. My answer has been that I want to be dead or better yet - I wish I never existed, so I think that's enough time to have made this decision.  That means I do not want ANYTHING anymore - to spend time in Internet anymore, eat, swim, talk, see, hear music, talk with my family, friends, work, study, worry, get older, fight with mental illness until old age and eventually die. For me everything is pointless. And long time I was embarrassed to call life 'pointless'  because it sounds too edgy and childish for a grownup I thought. I'm a grownup and should handle life like everyone else. But deepdown, it's pointless. For me, personally, I do not want it. I do not want to experience life. I do not want to have consciousness. I do not want happiness, excitement, sadness, or anything. I want to be non-existant.
