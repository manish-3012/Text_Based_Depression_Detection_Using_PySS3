I fear silenceWhen I am alone and everything is silent I have an overcoming feeling of dread, first is the sadness of facing that Iâ€™m only at peace when Iâ€™m doing something to distract me from the fact that Iâ€™m not at peace, then comes a feeling that (I guess should be normal) that Iâ€™m completely alone, then the irrational sense that itâ€™ll always be like that even though a few hours ago I was doing something with people I care about, then is the feeling that time is just leaking, that my life will pass i the blink of an eye and that Iâ€™ll soon be dead, Iâ€™ll be forgotten, confined to only hear silence for eternity, then I panic I start getting desperate and roaming around my apartment back and forth impatiently and I have the suffocating urge to go out, but itâ€™s 10PM, Iâ€™m totally tired and my friends all have gone home thereâ€™s no reason to go out, whatâ€™s more I risk being mugged or confused for a mugger or something, and itâ€™s not like the silence will go away just by being outside, then I take a bath and try to go to bed, all while I breath heavily and my hearth is beating at max speed, when in bed Iâ€™ll start wanting to cry but I simply wonâ€™t.
Then Iâ€™ll either get up and play videogames until sleepiness defeats me, or watch anime in my phone while lying in bed, Iâ€™ll feel like someone or something is watching me from the non lighted rooms of my apartment, but it usually goes away as I get into the game.

Can this be fixed? this doesnâ€™t happen every day but is becoming more and more frequent, and Iâ€™m waking up without energy and in bad mood which makes me feel even worse the next night
