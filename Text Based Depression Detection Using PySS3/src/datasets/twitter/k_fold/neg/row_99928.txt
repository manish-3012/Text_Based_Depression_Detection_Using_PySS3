Tired of failureRecently reconnected with an ex. Things went amazingly and was happier than Iâ€™ve been in a long time. At her urging bought a ticket to fly across the country and see her. 4 days out and she texts me â€œshe needs to focus on workâ€ just as Iâ€™m finishing up a crap shift. Devastated. Not the first time Iâ€™ve considered ending it. All my bad choices lead to failure and whatâ€™s the point if it only gets worse. Every time previous Iâ€™ve convinced myself things will get better but itâ€™s a lie. Only thing keeping me alive is knowing it would ruin my family. Spent considerable time trying to work out a way to make it look like an accident as I feel this would be easier on everyone around me. Iâ€™m tired of hurting and hating myself.
