Just tried to kill myself. Help me! How can I go back to who I used to be.Hi,
Please see (https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/3uowvm/loosing_motivation_feeling_worthless_self_esteem/) 
I used to be a very cheerful and happy person years ago. I had everything I could ask for and was successful and doing well. Now things have changed (see linked post).

I don't know what to do and apart from academics I have a ton of other problems. 

I drank some bleach and then realized I shouldn't do that and that it would affect the few people I know me. I vomited it out instantly and did not drink a lot. 

I don't want to be like this. I want to go back to who I was and restart everything. What I hate the most is that I am acting differently around people because of my mental state. 

I am an extremely patient person, and I could really bond with people because of that and people liked me. Now I want to stay far from everyone cause I fear I'll hurt them.

"I have always been interested in the field I am currently studying. I got many awards for it, achieved a lot in it before entering university.

However when I entered university things did not go so well for me due to sickness and other reasons. I am in good health now (maybe not mentally) however since I failed some courses and did excellent apart from my failures. This makes me feel scarred.

I feel worthless and I keep underestimating myself. This is a vicious cycle because it leads me to do worse and worse as time goes on. I fail to get what I want in every aspect of life these days not just courses. I present myself as an idiot.

I can't believe what has become of me right now, from what I was. I miss my old self, how can I go back. I just wish I could restart everything but I can't. I had hopes for graduate studies now I will never get that. I need some successes to boost my self esteem but for successes I need self esteem.
