Had a panic attack and was rushed to A &amp;EIt started in the morning today when my mom and sister were fighting. We were supposed to go out for lunch and have a nice day but they kept on arguing. While walking to the restaurant my chest started hurting and I started hyperventilating. I lost my balance and felt like fainting. While this was happening my mom was screaming at me to stop pretending and kept shouting at me. She just left me there while I felt like I was dying. I almost fell down in the middle of the road a couple of times and my sister had to drag me back home. I went home and locked myself in my room and lost everything I just started screaming and hyperventilating and thinking to myself maybe I should just die. I could hear my mom shouting and screaming at me asking me to stop and telling me I'm making it up in my head. I have had panic attack a couple of times but not as this bad. My sister started to freak out and cry because at this point I was close to fainting. She called the taxi and she forced me to go the a&amp;e for the institute of mental health. After that a lot of shit happened. But I can't seem to look at my mom the same ever again. I feel like she thinks I'm mental and crazy. I would have just wanted her to hold my hand and tell me that it was okay instead of leaving me in the middle of the road and screaming at me . I'm back home now and no one wants to look at me or talk to me the same way. I know my relationship with my mom will never be the same she never likes to address my depression and always think it all in my head.
