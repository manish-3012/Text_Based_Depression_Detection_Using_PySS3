Every night I come home with a bottle.The walk of shame in and out of a liquor store is well alive.
I know, it's contributing to my depression. I know, I should stop if I want to get better.

Although, I feel like happiness is a lie. That if I ever improve, it's only because I've convinced myself that this lie of a life is worth living.
I'm not happy when I'm sober. But I'm content with not being happy when I'm drunk.
Killing myself is a fantasy I play over and over and over in my head, every night.

I'm scared to die. 
Although, I don't want to live.
