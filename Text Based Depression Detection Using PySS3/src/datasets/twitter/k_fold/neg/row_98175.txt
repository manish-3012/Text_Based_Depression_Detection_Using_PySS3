I donâ€™t see the point anymoreMy goals are unattainable. I have no one to talk too. The people I love donâ€™t care about me. Thereâ€™s only one person who cares about me but he has a life and I canâ€™t always be bothering him. Iâ€™m never going to tell him how Iâ€™m feeling because itâ€™ll freak him out. Heâ€™d be fine if I died anyway. I hate myself. Everyone is probably indifferent. None of my dreams feel attainable. I feel like Iâ€™m constantly falling at life. Iâ€™m a disappointment. I couldnâ€™t do anything positive. Iâ€™ve literally done nothing substantial.
