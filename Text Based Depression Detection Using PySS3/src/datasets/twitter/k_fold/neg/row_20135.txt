I think Iâ€™m readyItâ€™s almost been a full year since we broke up. Itâ€™s all my fault that we broke up. I had an anxiety attack and ended it after 6 years. If I hadnâ€™t broken up with him, weâ€™d still be together. But because of me, heâ€™s dated two people since then, moved them both in and the most recent one, he married. I tried so many times to get him back but it didnâ€™t happen.. 

Him and his mom were my only family and now Iâ€™m actually alone. Iâ€™m completely ready to take my life now.
