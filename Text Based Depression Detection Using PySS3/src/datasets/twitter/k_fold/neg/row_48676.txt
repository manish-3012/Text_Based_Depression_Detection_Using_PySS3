On the way to the hospitalI've been falling lower and lower. Last night at work, I barely kept it together. I did freak out enough over the phone while I was alone, to the point that my husband said if it really is so bad, he'd take me to the hospital in the morning. Well, we're on our way now. And I'm fucking terrified. I've never been hospitalized. I'm afraid it won't work. Or it'll be like all the horror stories you hear about psych wards. Or they won't listen to me or take me seriously. Or maybe someone will find out and it'll get spread around that I'm fucking nuts, then I'll get treated differently. I'm ashamed of myself that I'm not stronger, too. God, we're getting close to the hospital and I'm really freaking out....
