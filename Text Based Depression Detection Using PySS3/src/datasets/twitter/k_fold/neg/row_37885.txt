My suicide note ( if I go through )My life is fucking over. I never been happy with my body or my family. I'm writing this because I want people know that I wasn't alone all the time. My aunt who was like a best friend died when I was 6 then one of my dogs that I loved so dearly died when I was 9. I feel like their deaths are my fault because I made her stay home during the winter instead of going to Texas. I didn't notice the signs that my dog wasn't ok. I've always carried this guilt with me and it's developed into my depression. Growing up I was always bullied and once middle school hit me harder.  My anger worsened I couldn't play hockey because I got thrown off of a team. I'm the reason why everything in the world goes wrong. If I was dead the world would be a better place. I would always fake being happy because I never wanted people to worry about me. I hid scars and my arms in hoodie for a long time. I've put myself in the hospital hopping one day I'll die but it never works. I won't miss anyone the way they have treated me and I hope my mom burns in hell. Goodbye.
