might as well be deadi'm sorry to share, nobody needs my problems...

so my high school class is graduating, state, private, ivy... i wish i could just finish community instead of dropping out because i can't keep doing this pointless shit anymore. four years behind, it seems the fastest way to get ahead now is to die.

sure, i've written more than most people these days in their lives, trust me on this one, and friends and others like the short stories/essays/poems and things i write. people think i'm funny, but with every person's smile or laugh, i die some more on the inside. when a girl might come onto me, or likes me, i always turn them down or drop out of their lives because i don't like them. i'm not sure i like people, besides the old friends i've made. there's only one girl i want, but will never get her...

i play some music but not that great. i haven't had a job in years because my jobs have always been terrible, slave wage status and am not good with frustration and people. i live to count down the days until i can do heroin again (two weeks about, i chip) and not really much else.

i am the fuck up of the family, why i still live with them, well, i wish they disowned me years ago. i'm don't deserve the air i breathe. i wish i could just end it all, because i know i could go through with it, but i might be so stupid that i think any of it will get better. i'm afraid even if there was somebody that was my reflection in the world, they'd be so ugly i'd off myself, because i am an ugly person. 

"If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face. And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until you can hardly bear to look at it." -Roald Dahl

yeah, that's me. i don't know why i'm even posting this, i should just jump off a bridge.
