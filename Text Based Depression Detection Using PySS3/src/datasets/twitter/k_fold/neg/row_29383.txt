i want to diemy dog saved me from suicide for years and i tried all i could to give him the best life i could. the other day, i took him to the vet. They messed up and fucked up his trachea and it collapsed and he couldnâ€™t breathe. emergency surgery was 14,000 as soon as possible because he wouldnâ€™t last until the end of july, where theyâ€™d be able to do the surgery for 8,000 instead. i couldnâ€™t afford either one. i had to euthanize him and i donâ€™t want to live anymore. i always promised myself when he died, i would. but iâ€™m pregnant now. 16 weeks. so i know i have to stay alive and this life in me should keep me going but i canâ€™t believe i had to lose him. he was almost 13 years old but so healthy otherwise. he followed me everywhere. he protected me from my momâ€™s abuse when i was younger. i had him for almost 7 years. why do i have to live without him?!? i wanted him to live so long with me. i wanted him to meet my baby but he never will. i want to die so much i want to be with him. why the fuck does life do this to me? my other dog who i had since he was a puppy was killed by another dog in december. i couldnâ€™t cope and had a miscarriage at 9 weeks right after he died. my fiancÃ© and i had been trying and chose to try again and thatâ€™s how iâ€™m pregnant now. my dogs are literally my lifeline and theyâ€™re both gone now. how the fuck can i survive without them? why do i have to?
