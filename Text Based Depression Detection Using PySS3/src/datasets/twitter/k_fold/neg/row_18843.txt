someoneâ€™s hereI feel like a terrible person. Iâ€™m awful. But Iâ€™m finding comfort in being there. As if Iâ€™m doing something good for once in my life. That Iâ€™m around others. So if someone needs to talk about their problems or even just chat with someone Iâ€™m here - sorry my reasons are selfish but I promise I care!  Take care of yourselves â¤ï¸
