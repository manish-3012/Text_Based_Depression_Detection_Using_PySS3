The thought that 'I probably need help', is the hardest to deal with right now because I don't understand whyI don't know what happened to me... Like I didn't go though anything that big and/or bad. About 4 weeks ago I just lost some motivation to do things, and I'm only noticing this in hindsight. My motivation just kept going down and down and down over the past few weeks, but I just ignored it. I felt the same way last year and it was just a little thing that passed. But today I'm feeling so much worse, I bearly left my dorm all weekend, I only ate twice since Friday because I'm not even hungry. And I tried to make myself eat and I tried to make myself get out and ride my bike just to move some but I just don't ever feel like it. I don't feel like doing anything, everything's boring af or not worth the energy. And I don't feel like I want to die... I just wish I could have a reset or at least live as a kid for a little longer where I don't have to spend my whole day to make money/do work to make more money later.


Just reading over this I don't know where I'm going with wiring this at all. Maybe I'm just hoping someone will respond. I just don't get it I don't have anything going wrong in my life, so what happened ?
