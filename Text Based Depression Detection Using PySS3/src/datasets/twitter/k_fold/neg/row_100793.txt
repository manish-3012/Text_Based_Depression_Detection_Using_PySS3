I've thought about this for a long time now.I'm of no use.

My ex and I broke up 3 years ago. 
I lost the absolute love of my life. 
I've tried to move on, and can't seem to let go. 
It's only spiraling me into a deeper depression. So much so that I'm at this point now. 

I have always suffered from depression, since I was in high school. I'm 26 now. 

I'm unable to finish my degree in mechanical engineering, I have adult ADHD that's diagnosed but unmedicated. 
I can't afford to continue going to a doctor. 

I have tried to see light in these situations, but sometimes the void is just too great. 

Thanks for reading.
