My Friend Is Not Allowed To Visit Her Friendâ€™s Homes and It Makes Me Extremely SadI feel really awful for her. She said that her stuffed animals are substitutes for her friends, and that she gives them voices, and hugs them. What the fuck is wrong with her parents? Why wonâ€™t you let your child interact with other people? This makes me incredibly angry and sad. This is borderline child abuse. I hate people.
