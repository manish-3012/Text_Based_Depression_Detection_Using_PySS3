How to tell parents I suffer from depressionI have strict African parents. They sent me overseas by myself and they are sacrificing a lot. 

Throughout my whole life I have been very suicidal and depressed. I'm depressed to the point where I can spend a month without talking to anyone besides the check out girl at my local supermarket.

I have been slowly giving into the darkness. I need help. Any day from now I feel like I'm going to kill myself. I want to tell my parents but I'm scared they won't understand. They'll think I'm too lazy to go to school so I'm using this as an excuse. Please help
