I'm tired of being dependent on my dadI'm 27F, and I live with my dad and work the job at his merchandising company that he got for me. I hate my job because it offers no challenge or reward, but I can't be accepted by other people, which is why I got into this situation in the first place. I have a worthless degree that gets a laugh whenever I tell people about it. I was stupid and I'm feeling the consequences.

I spend several hours at the library looking for solutions every night and then cry myself to sleep wanting to die.

This is not a sexist/control thing. Everything wrong with my life is entirely my own fault. I'm just a burden on my dad, and every night I hold a bottle of pills wanting to just end it. He'd be relieved to not have to deal with me anymore.
