I won't be able to be there for my kids, the date is set. How do I write a good suicide note?In October I hooked up with a girl after a night out. She is now pregnant with twins. I spoke to her recently to talk about what we were going to do, she basically told me that she only told me she was having them at all so I'd pay child support, and that she planned on allowing me minimal contact because she always wanted to be a single mother anyway due to her upbringing. 

I know due to my history of mental health issues, and being institutionalized I will not be able to achieve the custody that I'd like. I'm not willing to live a life of seeing my offspring on weekends. This whole situation has only compounded my other issues which already had me on the cusp of suicide, this is the universe's way of telling me this is the time. 

May 10th is the date, it's after my brother and mother's birthdays, and after my friend comes down from interstate, so I'll be able to see her one last time. I plan to spend the next few months enjoying my life as much as possible, secure in the fact that nothing I do will have any long term consequences because I won't be around long term to experience them. 

I want to write a suicide note where I wish my family and friends farewell and explain that this is the best thing that could happen and that if they love me they should rather I die on my own accord than live a life of suffering. How should I write the note? what should I put in it?

Also I don't care how my death will affect those around me, all I care about is not suffering anymore.
