Painless end?In the last five years or so I have felt some changes in my body. Itâ€™s like part of my brain has shut down in a way. Iâ€™ve struggled with memory loss, lost some of my vocabulary and its like I dont care about anything any more. Iâ€™ve realized that i have a dementia related disease at the age of 42 with to children of 2 and 6 years old. That bitter pill is hard to swallow. The funny thing is that im not depressed about this. Iâ€™m more annoyed by the fact that i will not be around the help the girls when they struggles with day to day issues like homework and boys. Before i got this disease i had a lot of anxiety attack and i have always been so scared of dying and not exist, now Itâ€™s different. I feel nothing about ending my life. Iâ€™ve decided that ending my life would be a natural step and i want to do this before the disease have taken full control on me. It is important to me that my girls remembered be as i am today and not who i would be in let say five years time. This turned out to be a long intro, but do anybody know ways to end a life without any pain. What is the best way to do this without going to a suicide clinic in switzerland?
