happy thanksgiving.i don't know... today was a difficult and very lonely day. holidays really fucking hurt. i've been suicidal since may. i've made a few posts about it here. i think i just want to express myself a little bit.

i had friends. people i loved. and i betrayed them. i can't live with the shame and the regret, and every day that passes... it just makes things worse and worse. there's a physical pain to this sadness... my ribcage tightens up... feels constricted.

this is a mess... these thoughts. it's difficult for me to communicate and connect now. i don't feel like a human. i feel like this thing that has been fucked up since birth and just made poor choices all throughout his life. devastating choices. it really, really fucking sucks, because i look around and i see happy people and i just wish that i weren't me... i wish i were them... or some happy version of myself. some un-fucked up version of myself. and i feel selfish for wanting this... i want magic. i want to go back in time. i want to save people from the horror that is me. i hate this... i hate this so much.

the truth of the matter is that i am sorry. but this is beyond me. i made things worse for myself and in doing so have hurt so many people. it makes suicide even more appealing because... it'll only get worse.

i don't know. anyway, happy thanksgiving.
