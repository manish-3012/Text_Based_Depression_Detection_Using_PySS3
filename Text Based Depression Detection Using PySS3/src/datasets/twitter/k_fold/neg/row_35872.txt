Just a rant...Im just posting this as a rant, Iâ€™m not necessarily sure what Iâ€™m feeling myself so I wonâ€™t burdening you all by asking for advice. Okay, it all started when I was in high school. I fell for this guy, but I messed it up. I fucked with his friends lives in an irreversible way? Why? I have no clue, it was just â€œfunâ€ to me. Itâ€™s like I have a dark side that likes to be in control of people, to lie, to get people to do what I want. I canâ€™t control it, itâ€™s like a switch goes off and I start doing completely irrational things and become manipulative just for the â€œjoyâ€ of it. Maybe Iâ€™m a sociopath, maybe Iâ€™m something else, maybe itâ€™s a form of twisted depression. Iâ€™m not sure. At the time, I was fine with losing him. I didnâ€™t care. But now I realize I was completely in love with him. And itâ€™s been years (Iâ€™m 20) but I still care so much about him but I know he will never take me back, I canâ€™t blame him. I have friends, I have people close to me but I still feel alone. Because no one knows the â€œrealâ€ me. No one knows what Iâ€™ve been through. I go out and party because drinking seems helps my depression and loneliness a lot, little do my â€œfriends know, that was all the money in my account. Iâ€™m only twenty and Iâ€™m $5000+ (and thatâ€™s without student loans) in debt. Most is mine, some because my family used my name and couldnâ€™t afford to pay it so it went into collections. We live in a shithole of a house. I have no job because I hated everyone Ive had. Iâ€™d be depressed at work a lot of the times because it always just served as a reminder of my situation. It got so bad I would just drink at work to keep everything off my mind to get through the shift. I left that job due to this a week ago, and now Iâ€™m completely broke. My gas tank is drained, and Iâ€™m not really sure what i could even do at this point. The bills are slowly creeping up and my only choice is to sit here and let them. Iâ€™m currently in community college but am barely staying a float with that because itâ€™s so hard to focus with so much on your mind. Iâ€™ve began seriously contemplating suicide, Iâ€™m just becoming completely detached from everything at this point emotionally and physically,  I honestly canâ€™t imagine things getting better. I just keep falling and Iâ€™m not sure how to make it stop. Regardless, I just needed to rant. Thanks for reading.
