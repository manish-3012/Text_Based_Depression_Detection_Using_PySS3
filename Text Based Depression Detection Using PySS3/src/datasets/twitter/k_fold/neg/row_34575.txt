Advice for families of suicide attempt survivorsNot sure if this is the right sub but Iâ€™m in crisis at the moment. I just found out hours ago that my mom overdosed on prescription pills and left a note this afternoon. My dad found her and acted quickly. Sheâ€™s currently in the hospital, unconscious but stable. Iâ€™m about 4 hours away and hopping the next train tomorrow morning. Iâ€™m shocked, devestated, and absolutely heart broken. My mom is like salt of the earth, and Iâ€™m just running through every conversation for clues. I just talked to her yesterday, and we made plans to see each other in January. Iâ€™m blind sighted and crushed. I feel every emotion from shock to sadness all at once and itâ€™s relentless.  

Iâ€™m looking for resources, guidance, support, anything you can offer. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s expected of me here and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m supposed to be doing right now. How do I take care of my mom and myself?
