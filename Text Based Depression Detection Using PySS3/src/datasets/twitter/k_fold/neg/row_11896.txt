1 more year of sufferingI have one more year till i graduate from high school and become an adult. My youth will end and i will have nothing left to remember it by because i wasted it all. I was naive and thought it would never end so i decided to spend it all doing nothing and watch time pass me by. Now with the finish line in sight i have this big feeling of anxiety and regret that i spent my entire youth doing not one single productive thing and cant help but feel disgusted with myself whenever i think about graduating. With my sub par grades i have no choice but to immediately join the work force not because im dumb but because i decided not to try until it was to late. I decided that their is no way that i can can find any source of happiness for myself and plan on ending it all after graduation. I given myself a final year plan to do at least a little bit for the people around me before i kill myself out of respect for the people who truly care. But this is all i could think of to solve my very underwhelming and childish problems. many people on this planet have alot more to worry about than whether or not they lived their youth to the fullest but for some reason this fills me with anguish that i cannot describe in words. The pain and anxiety i go through just being alone with my thoughts make me cry myself to sleep. I hate that im this way and just want it to end. My last year i will try to do some good so that i can atone for the pitiful act i am going to commit and the suffering that others will have to endure because of it.
