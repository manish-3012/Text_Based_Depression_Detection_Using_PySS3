No one care about me since I don't have money. Why am I even here...I had been suicidal for a long time and felt better in the last year. Until recently. Recently I lost a pet (it was a 2 days old baby) my boyfriend stopped receiving his disability pay and can't go back to work. This mean we only have 1 salary. I cannot afford my meds, no one can pay them for me. I even got throught a bottle of my meds that expired 2 years ago. I am getting tired of eating soups and pasta It has been like that for a while. The tought of eating the same stuff again make me cry.

I tought I was getting better with ergotherapy but I learned the insurance will cut this and the shrink soon because they believe I don't need them and they can save money.

One of the only joy I had in the last year has been the gifting sub and helping others out in various subs. It made me think that the good I spread would turn around. I even sent someone money to pay for the Dr appointment and they said they would send me a little something each months. Nothing big but like a chocolate or elastic for my hairs. All I asked for in the exchange accepted. I have no news of aby package but still felt like I helped. Over the months I sent a lot of stuff but now that I have financial issues no one even talk to me anymore or only briefly if prompted. I don't want gofts just to be as loved as when I had the money to send stuff.

I tried asking for help for the food on /r/assistance and for someone to talk to in /r/depression but all I get are downvote on assistance and absolutely nothing in depression. People ignore me like it always has been.

No one care about me and I am starting to wonder why I am even here. I feel like there is no point of trying anymore. The only thing that made me smile are subs that only wanted my money. Now that I am broke I am useless and no one would miss me.

Sorry for the rant and probably for the bad english I am a french Canadian and I have been told it shows when I write.
