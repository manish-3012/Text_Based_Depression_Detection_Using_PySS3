Im finally going to kill myself tonightIm too weak to keep going...ive always hated being alive. It started when I was raped by my brother when I was 6. I always knew i was going to kill myself but now i think i have enough courage to actually do it. I wish i could keep going and trying in life but i cant. Im 22 I live in a shitty trailer with my boyfriend on his families property. Im not working because im terrified to. I have horrible anxiety and always want to cry when im in public. I cant drive because i was in an accident a few years back and now i have anxiety attacks when i even think about driving. Im a failure at life. I have nothing to live for. I never had anything to live for....and i think its finally time to end it.
