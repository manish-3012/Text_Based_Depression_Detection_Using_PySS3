Iâ€™m scared to live and scared to dieI donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m such a mess of a person inside but on the outside Iâ€™m doing all the right things. People think Iâ€™m doing alright. But I feel like a burden to the ones who know and love me the most. I wish I could remove myself from their lives and just move far away so I didnâ€™t have to hurt them anymore. But Iâ€™m too scared to actually move and start new. So I donâ€™t know. It occurred to me I could remove myself another way.. but Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to die. I used to, and I tried once, I immediately regretted what Iâ€™d done once I took all the pills. 

I wish I could start over and be someone different.
