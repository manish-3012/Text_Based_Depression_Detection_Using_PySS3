how to deal with intense self-loathing?I dislike myself because I'm a bad person. I lie, cheat, and steal from friends and family. Basically 0 friends left at this point, for those reasons. Family still cares and feels obligated, wrongly, in my view. I massively screwed up a series of meaningful relationships for no particular reason other than I'm selfish and stupid when it comes to those things. One in particular haunts me in my dreams nearly every night. I justify all this by telling myself I'm really a genius and it will all be worth it in the end, but deep down I know that's just narcissism, and that in itself is very fucked up, the idea that it's okay to screw people who care about you because you're better than them.

So what to do? I don't want to hurt my family, but it seems that I can't help it - and is one massive dose of hurt really that much worse than a lifetime of it being doled out gradually? I think I'm a natural manipulator, liar, and kleptomaniac. I'm sure I have psychopathic tendencies, with how easily I manage what should be guilty feelings - although I know I'm not a full-blown psychopath, because I can be very emotional. Therapy has been totally unproductive - I often lie to therapists out of shame, and I've had little success implementing the advice they give me. I've been on a wide variety of meds but they haven't helped, and I tend to go off them because of the flat affect. Weed seems to help a little with everything, but I also have an addictive personality and it gradually takes over my life, which I don't enjoy and can't afford. Drinking doesn't help with much at all, but I can't help myself.

I don't see much of a future for me - I am mostly unemployable at this point, due to a massive gap in my work history and no good references. That said, even if I could find decent work, I've proven time and time again I can't hang onto it, mostly due to laziness. I'm also deeply pessimistic about the state of the world in general.

I do disagree when it's said that suicide is mostly about anger towards other people, or that people who commit it are terribly selfish - I think they underestimate the level of self-hatred going on, and how difficult it is to live with that.

So what to do if your actions show that you're a horrible person? There's no question in my case, believe me. I had a lot of advantages in life and I've managed to screw them all and spite the people who gave them to me, and I show no sign of stopping. Really, if you got to know me and tried to help me and be my friend, the whole time I'd be thinking about how to screw you over. And yeah, I don't feel like it's worth living, being like that.
