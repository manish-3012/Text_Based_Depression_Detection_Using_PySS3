fuck life*venting* 

(sorry in advance)

- I got a 4.0 last semester of college and I donâ€™t think I can do it again now that schoolâ€™s going to be all online
- My parents donâ€™t know about my BPD and I keep lying to my therapist because I donâ€™t want people to know Iâ€™m still struggling
- My bf is amazing, but I feel like weâ€™ll break up eventually &amp; im already planning to end it the day that happens
- I hate myself &amp; donâ€™t know how to feel 99% of the time
- I canâ€™t decide whether Iâ€™m a narcissist or an empath... but either way I feel like Iâ€™m a silent manipulator
- I have no friends or hobbies because I push them all away
- I can never feel stable.. Iâ€™m either on top of the world or eating shit off the ground
- I lost about 20 pounds from last year and I keep finding new parts of my body that i hate (even without the extra body weight)
- Iâ€™m beginning to come to terms with my mortality... and honestly who gives a shit anymore
- Also if I see one more post on social media telling people how much they should be grateful for their lives, Iâ€™m gonna kill myself just as a big â€œfuck youâ€ to them (it doesnâ€™t help. stop with the fake fucking advocacy)
