Drunk and so, so aloneWELL *they* want to throw me back in the hospital. Hate when that happens. I'm all out of options. I'm about to lose my fucking job because I keep calling out. WhY tHe FuCk do I keep calling out, you ask? Because I'm a spineless little shit who can't handle the stress of the situation. Everyone is suffering, they all are! Yet I run and hide like an ABSOLUTE FUCKING COWARD. Here my sorry self is, having called out, slamming run and cokes. Not an alcoholic btw. HahahaahahHAHAHAHA just kidding. I can't even do my FUCKING LAUNDRY. Do I have A washer and dryer? FUCK NO. I definitely do not. I have to venture out into the cruel world full of people who fucking hate me. And for good reason I might add. I'm a sack of absolute shit. I have absolutely nothing to live for. I take the poisonous pills. I really did. This morning. Yup, sure did. I can't see a fucking psychiatrist until June. Something is wrong, wrong, wrong. Why is this happening again?! I'm not strong enough to endure. Sick of fighting. So alone. My boyfriend left me after CIA coercion. Now I'm alone. Me and my handler. Not Chelsea Handler.
