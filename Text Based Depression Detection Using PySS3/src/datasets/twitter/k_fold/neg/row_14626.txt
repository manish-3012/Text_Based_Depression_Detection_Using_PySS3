To the people that life makes sad and bitterJust know it's not a long life. 

We all are dying. Suicide is not neccasary. Life will kill you a lot sooner than you think. Rest easy friends. If anything, find solace in the fact that death will do us all apart sooner rather than later. Death awaits no man or woman. People live life being afraid of death. Why live your life being afraid of something that was bound to happen once you were born? I hope you all can find hapiness in your life some day.
