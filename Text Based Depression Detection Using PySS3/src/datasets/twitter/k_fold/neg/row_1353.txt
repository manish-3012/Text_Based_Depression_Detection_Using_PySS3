are there downsides like reprecusions to asking for helpwhat i mean is if i were to ask someone to talk to or something about suicidal thoughts, would i get in trouble ex jail, being told off to school, being scolded, restricted from certain things

like i want to talk with my friend who has had the same things happen to it and came out on top but i dont want it to turn sideways
