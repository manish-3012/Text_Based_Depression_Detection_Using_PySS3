I need help...One of my best friends wants to kill himself today. I talked to his girlfriend and told me some unimaginable things: he says is just her fault. He does it for her. He has mental issues, but we didn't know. Not even his parents, not even himself. But I realised days ago that something is wrong. He cant establish some real inter-human connections and when he does, he's obsessed about that person. I'm so scared for his life.
He doesn't want to do that because he has an awful life or something. He just does... 
His girlfriend, her best friend (who's my friend as well), his mother and me are the only one who know. I am scared that if he really does that, our friends, his friends, wouldn't have had the possibility to tell his how important he is for us. And it would be my fault.
