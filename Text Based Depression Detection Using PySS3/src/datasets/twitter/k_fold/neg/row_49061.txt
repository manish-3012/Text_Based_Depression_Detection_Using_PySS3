Someone.. Please...just read thisIt's weird. I've dealt with chronic depression since I was a child. Not once has it been this bad, though. I have vowed that today will be my last day alive, however, before I carry out my plan, I do have something(s) that I want to say. 

     Y'all, please be good to one another. No seriously. In my 19 years of living, I have just seen so much selfishness and greed amongst people, and for all the wrong reasons. Even the people you wouldn't expect. Everyone is just so fucking self absorbed and although it is human nature to live for your own benefit, wouldn't it just be so much nicer for everyone to prioritize one another?? That's what I've done my whole fucking life..give to others, discern and carry out my actions that ultimately benefit others. It's not that hard. That's all I ask. Just give everything you have for others. In the end, it's worth it :)

     I am now going to leave this world forever, though. It's been too fucking long since the last time I tried...should have done this sooner. I refuse to delineate on what's causing me to decide to do this, because I want to be at peace, I don't want to be saved. I am walking out into this 5200 acre wilderness and killing myself today. It's been such a ride, y'all, but I am afraid this is my last Reddit post, and my last rant. See y'all later :)
