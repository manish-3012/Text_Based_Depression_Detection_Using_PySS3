If I respected myself I would have done it 10 years agoSo now I running out of time and money.  I can't work.  Can hardly leave the house.  Can't talk to people the social anxiety is so bad and now the depression makes me not want to try.  

 Fuck I can't even watch a movie or TV show for the past 5 years.  Everyone has abandoned me.   I haven't spoken to anyone in 2 years..  I mean literally other than once every 3 months if I accidentally bump into someone and say "sorry"

Invested my life savings out fear of going broke and being homeless.  I felt I had no choice but to gamble and basically lost it all.   I tried working online but not luck.  

I HAD enough money to last 10 years.   Waking up and going to sleep is the worse time because there is zero hope for anything better.   Just endless suffering to look forward too.

Now that I my resources are running out I am seriously debating being homeless or being dead.  I have zero peace or happiness..  and haven't for man years.

Social assistance won't help me... and even if they did the most they offer is about 450 US a month.  My rent is 900. And they won't give me anything until all my money is gone.  

Not exactly sure how a person who can barely leave their house will survive being homeless...  my plan is to take my last bit of money and head south where the weather is warmer.   

I tried my best but everything I did was done from a position of fear and it never ended well.  I spent 10 years forcing myself into situations that I didn't want to be in like and engage society but it just ended in humiliation.

I am such a loser for not ending it sooner... I knew this was headed this way I just didn't expect it to happen so soon.
