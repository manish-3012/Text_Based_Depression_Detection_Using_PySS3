Life in a terrible pit full of shitWhat is the point of living if you can't get out of the pit of shit you find yourself in.  I feel like the rats that they would trap in a oily bowl, doomed to swim and scrape against the sides futilely as you eventually tire and drown.  My kids would be better off with a family that can give them time and is not always saying they hurt.  So why stay? 

My only hope is to get out of this pit.  And I have tried everything to no success.
