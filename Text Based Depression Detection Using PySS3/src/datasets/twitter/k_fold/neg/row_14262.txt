Am I normal?
Am I normal? I donâ€™t think I am. Whenever Iâ€™m stressed out I tend to forget to take care of myself and it bit me in the ass today. My mom asked me why I didnâ€™t take a bath and when I told her I forgot. She started lecturing me on how thatâ€™s not normal and I started spiraling down into a breakdown. She asked if I feel icky not washing and tbh, I donâ€™t.  Then she started talking about how I donâ€™t cook, or baking and stuff that my brothers did when they were my age. But I canâ€™t do those things without thinking of killing myself 

Holding a knife? How about I stab myself with it? Turning on the stove? How about I let it burn me? I would think about those kinds of stuff when things went bad. 

Then it all went downhill when she told me that teenagers arenâ€™t supposed to cry. To me, thatâ€™s the equivalent of her invalidating my feelings. 

I made mistakes and Iâ€™m not afraid to admit it but when Iâ€™m constantly reminded of it, it just brings up my own perception of a failure. 

Iâ€™m scared of myself and I donâ€™t know what to do
