Iâ€™m feeling lonely and sadI am very sad - been going through so much with my ex husband. We are divorced and he  prevents me or makes  it difficult to see my two children - girl 13 and son 9. He is being so deliberately cruel to me itâ€™s beyond words.  I feel so shredded emotionally and was ready to throw myself in front of a train today. I have a great therapist and we spoke today - i am grateful to him  - itâ€™s so hard if someoneâ€™s not inside your head - and living your life to fully get it . Iâ€™ve Been having depression since high school and itâ€™s many years later -5 or 6 inpatient hospitalizations for major depressive disorder and 1 rehab stay . Iâ€™m trying to summarize my story here - but my ex husband served me divorce papers in 2016 while I was inpatient for depression / anxiety and took my children from me giving me supervised visitation .  Iâ€™ve lost almost 5 years of my childrenâ€™s lives - have had 3 attorneys as well who accomplished nothing.
Iâ€™m ashamed of myself as a mother and feel like the laughing stock among my siblings. I donâ€™t have a lot of friends , and am not really enjoying life too much .  I pray a lot for help on this because  this is  so unbearable .
