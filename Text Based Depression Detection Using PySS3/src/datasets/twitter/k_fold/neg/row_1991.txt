I've had a tooth &amp; throat infection for 2 months, I think its spreading.I'm agoraphobic and haven't left my house in 7 months. I suffer from daily anxiety and SEVERE nausea. I wouldn't be able to possibly open my mouth at the dentists. I have a horrible tooth infection that has spread to my throat. I have had a moderate fever for nearly 2 months straight and i've been in severe pain all day every day. I've been popping painkillers like no tomorrow, but they aren't working anymore. The fever won't go down and I feel confused and strange.

I don't see how I can possibly leave the house. I feel paralyzed wen I try. I desperately need to be in the hospital but my psychiatrist refuses to admit me. He says i'm not trying hard enough to get better and therefore I guess in his eyes, I don't deserve hospitalization. 

I'm scared. I'm so ill. Somebody please help me. The depression is getting worse. I never realized how bad physical symptoms could be until I was faced with it. This is worse than any mental agony I have ever went through. I'm thinking of killing myself tonight.
