Can there be an acceptable reason to just end it? Or does there have to be an underlying reasonI don't feel depressed, well I sorta don't. Many surgeries and constant pain just seem to be enough reason right now, and I've given it a lot of thought, it seems like the clear choice except hurting the ones I love, but that matter less and less everyday
