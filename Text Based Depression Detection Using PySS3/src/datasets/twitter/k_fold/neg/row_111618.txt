Exclusion and LonelinessLong post. 

Since the age of 8-9 Iâ€™ve been ostracized and bullied pretty harshly. The bullying started in grade school and escalated to severe abuse by the time I was in middle school. 

I was a very shy, quiet little girl, and for some reason the other girls loved to take advantage of this. There were rumors spread that I was lesbian, and despite the fact that I was straight, in the late 90s and early 2000s just implying that someone might be gay or lesbian was enough to have them completely ostracized from the community, especially in a small town.

Other girls used this to pick on me relentlessly. I would find things written on bathroom stalls or desks about me. I wasnâ€™t allowed to use the girls locker room during gym class and had to change in the bathroom. I eventually just started wearing my gym clothes all day, which led to even more bullying. 

It escalated to kids sticking food or gum in my hair and having to cut chunks of it off on multiple occasions. I was put into one of those older-style metal cage lockers and an older boy kicked the door so hard that it bent inward and trapped me inside for several hours until a teacher noticed that I was missing.

Nothing was ever mentioned to my parents by the school staff, as far as I know. And I certainly didnâ€™t tell them anything. My mentality at the time was â€œI have to be a loser all day at school, I donâ€™t want to come home and be a loser there too.â€ 

Iâ€™d make up stories of â€œfriendsâ€, who were actually terrible to me in real life. Iâ€™d pretend to have a social life and talk about funny things that so-and-so said, because despite how horrible they were, I desperately wanted to be their friend. I didnâ€™t carry any hate in my heart for them, but boy did I develop a deep self-hatred.

In high school, things calmed down significantly. Occasionally Iâ€™d hear â€œI hate that bitchâ€ or â€œI canâ€™t fucking stand herâ€ from a few random people who I didnâ€™t personally know, but the physical attacks completely stopped.

There was one person who I connected to during my sophomore year, but he wasnâ€™t accepted by my family because I considered him my â€œboyfriendâ€. I wasnâ€™t allowed to hang out with him, and when I got caught doing it anyway, my dad drug me to my room in a headlock, hit me, and eventually took away my personal belongings and only allowed me to go to school and come home, which honestly wasnâ€™t difficult seeing as I had no meaningful friendships anyway.

Despite all of this, I was able to slog through school, doing enough to pass, and graduated.

By some miracle, once I hit my early 20â€™s, I grew into my awkward features and became really attractive. Most people who I know today would never in a million years guess that I used to be the ugly duckling. No one, except for myself and the people responsible, know about what I went through as a kid.

But that self-hatred has stuck with me. 

No matter how hard I try, I do not know how to be myself and connect with other people. I have thoughts in my head that Iâ€™d like to share, but they wonâ€™t come out of my mouth, or if they do, they come out very awkwardly and not the way I intended. I stutter a lot. 

Sometimes I see people dancing, laughing, and having fun, and Iâ€™d really like to do that, but itâ€™s like my body physically wonâ€™t allow me. Sometimes, if Iâ€™m really drunk, I can mirror peopleâ€™s actions and look like I fit in. But when I am sober I have no idea what to do.

90% of my personality is just doing things Iâ€™ve seen other people do or repeating things Iâ€™ve heard them say.

On the surface I seem very normal. Most people look at me and see a pretty woman who is maybe a little quiet. But once they get to know me on a deeper level, they usually are very disappointed.

Iâ€™ve been in a relationship for 3 years now with a man who I deeply, truly love. However, lately heâ€™s become increasingly distant, often doing things without me. If I ask if I can come along with him on outings, lately Iâ€™ve been told no. When I inquired as to why heâ€™s been excluding me from everything, he told me:

â€œI donâ€™t know, itâ€™s just not fun to be around you anymore.â€

â€œYou just really get under my skin and I donâ€™t know why.â€

â€œOther people notice that Iâ€™m not myself when Iâ€™m around you.â€

â€œMy friends really donâ€™t like you.â€

Fuck.

Maybe some of us walk this earth but are really not meant to be here. 

Maybe itâ€™s some evolutionary feature - if I were an animal Iâ€™d be the one the mother eats because somethings â€œwrongâ€ with it. 

I donâ€™t really know. But lately the only thing that keeps me sane or comforts me is knowing that I can always just kill myself tomorrow.
