36m Not finding a good reasonQuite frankly, I'm not sure why I came here. I've lurked on another name for so long I felt like making a last stop in case I'm overreacting. Which is normal I suppose. Wtf do I know about normal?

36, life was supposed to work at some point, and all I've gotten is feeling awful and useless after devoting my life to others. Others that shat on me in return. Is being taken for granted that painful? Did I miss something in the grander scheme? I hate existing because I find no happiness nor joy. I find nothing but terror at whatever shitstorm brews next. I'm so fucking done with this. 

And I still don't know why I'm posting this.
