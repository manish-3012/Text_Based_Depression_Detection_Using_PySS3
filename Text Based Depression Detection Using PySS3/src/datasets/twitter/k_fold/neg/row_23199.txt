I'm going to shoot a gram of furanylfent any take some xanniesI don't want to live anymore. There's nothing anyone can say. I am no one, no name, always anonymous. I'm going to die. This is going to be over. I won't have to deal with this anymore. It's relieving to think that. I'm going to be truly free. I'm 19. There's a lot of life I had wanted to experience like burning man and coachella and going to a concert. I've never been. I wanted to get a boyfriend too. It makes me cry to think about suicide because I'm sad that I won't have any of those, but at the same time, I feel like it's the right thing to do. I should kill myself because I don't believe that things will get better. I'm so sad. So incredibly sad.
