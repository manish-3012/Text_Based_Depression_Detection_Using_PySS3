I'm trappedI'm in a relationship that has gone pretty bad, most of the time. My girlfriend acts like she hates me most of the time and tells me to get out and find my own place, which i can't for at least a couple of months because i only just found a job.. i have no friends who would let me stay on their couch in this town, and my family who i'm sort of estranged from lives 4 hours away and i don't have a car, so basically i have no choice but to stick it out until i can get out. I try so hard for her and she not only doesn't appreciate it, but somehow turns it into a reason to be more pissed off at me. It's just constant. I can not do ANYTHING right, or well enough. Even getting a job, she found a way to throw in my face. I really love her but i don't think i can keep living like this much longer. All the time now i find myself considering killing myself. I know i'm only in a temporary situation and that's kind of an extreme response, but i'm one fight away from being put out out on the street and i don't know what else i can do. She has me so stifled i already can hardly breathe without pissing her off. Every so often we fight about it really bad, usually i apologize, because she says it's all my fault for being such an asshole, but sometimes she apologizes, usually blaming something like pain or stress, and says she'll try and do better but today was probably the 30th time we've had the same conversation and nothing ever seems to get any different, it's like we're 2 people who hate eachother who occasionally get along. Idk what to do. Just stick it out until i can get out i guess.
