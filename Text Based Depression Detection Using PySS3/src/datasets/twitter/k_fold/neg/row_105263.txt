My Brother, and many friends from HS are now gone.Depending on what you believe; once it's over... it's over. There is _nothing_ afterwards. Once people pass I think how they are not experiencing this same day I am. 
 
Weigh in the following... 
 
1) You're very unhappy in life, BUT with the potential of doing (_experiencing_) anything in which your whole perspective on life could change. Anything ever happen to you in which you say "holy shit, glad I didn't kill myself"? Well, your goal can be to feel like that for the rest of yourself because it IS possible.  
 
Or.
 
2) _Nothing_. aka Then end. No waking up from your numbing and comfortable sleep. 

It's bad right now, I know. I have been very close to it. I experience the bad but enjoy the good. And when things are _very_ bad not giving a fuck and frolicking through life is better then not experiencing any of it. Not giving a fuck helps me stick around sometimes... because I think I'll not give a fuck since I'm going to die, but then up enjoying not giving a fuck.  

This is a throw away and probably will get downvoted since it's not the best advice and probably doesn't make much sense, but it's my take on things, and it's what keeps me alive so I figured I would share. 
 
If you end up ending your life, please don't let your family members see you. I know you won't care since you'll be gone, but please figure out a way they won't see you for their sake. 

Thanks
