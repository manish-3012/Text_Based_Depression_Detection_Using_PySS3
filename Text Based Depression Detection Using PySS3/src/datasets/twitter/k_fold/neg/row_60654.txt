I heard good things about you, SuicideWatch.Obvious throwaway.

I'm planning to kill myself. As of right now, I need only to return some books to the library and I'm done.

I know that nobody will care if I die or live. Parents? Not there anymore. Brother? He barely (if ever) speaks to me. He's got his own family, his own problems, so I understand. "Friend"? Same, more or less. We barely even speak. She's got her boyfriend so my death will not affect her in any way.

And then we have my boyfriend. I don't even know if I can call him that anymore. We barely speak to each other (see a pattern?), he's working a lot, he doesn't care at all. I don't have any things at his place so he won't need to return anything. Nothing there to remind him I exist. I honestly even think that he doesn't remember I'm there at all.

You know what are the only things keeping me alive at this point? As silly as it sounds, my guildies in Guild Wars 2 (amazing people), and the last season of Breaking Bad. That's fucking all.

I'm not going to kill myself today, or tomorrow, or even the day after tomorrow. I need to plan this out. I know that nobody will cry for me, nobody will remember me, nobody will even notice I'm gone. Sometime next week. I don't know when yet. I'll plan everything. I won't leave any suicide notes, because who the fuck will read it? Just *poof* and I'm gone.
