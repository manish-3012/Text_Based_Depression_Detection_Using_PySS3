Living with grief and heartache.Just in a low state of mind lately not the best thoughts to say the least and I just don't know how to cope with the feelings of grief the hopelessness and despair. It such a strong emotion overwhelms my soul and fills me with heartache. Not to sound sappy or anything. Just wondering how people live with regrets and live with painful things they can't change. How do you guys cope and live with your pain?
