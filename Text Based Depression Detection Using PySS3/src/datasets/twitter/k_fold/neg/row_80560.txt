College Grad, Unemployed 6 months, SuicidalI graduated with a degree in Business Administration last September. In December 2014, I quit my job since my supervisor stabbed me in the back. Since then I have applied to numerous jobs of all types. I have not been picky. I even sent my resumes to Staffing Agencies. I get interviews all the time, but no one ever hires me. My savings are running out, and I am feeling hopeless. I have no friends to turn to and my family does not want to help me. I just want to die. I hate life. I worked as an Administrative Assistant during college to pay bills. I have a degree and experience, but that means nothing apparently.
