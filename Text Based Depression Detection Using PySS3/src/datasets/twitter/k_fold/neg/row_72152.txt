I hate myself and wanna dieI was with her with her depression and suicide thoughts. She overcame them and she is ok now. She left me for someone better...I never had those thoughts before,but now i am in depression, pills dont help me ease the pain. I gave eveything i could,everything! I dreamed with her,all my dreams was with her. I am 24,never had these feelings before...I see her everyday,we live in the same city,she is happy. I am broken. My life is hell,i cant trust anyone,my dreams are dead. I am too weak or i hope to be with her sometime,i can't now. But this idea struckt in my head. This is the only way i can be in peace...I was in love with the beauty,and she endend up a beast. I wanna die,cant take anymore,but i am coward...and i love her,more than my life...maybe my death make her understand what she meant for me...she destroyed me...
