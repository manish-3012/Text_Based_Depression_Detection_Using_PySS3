I was dealing with life until she left...Honestly, I'd give anything to have Her back. Like if she told me I had even the slightest chance I'd be in sask in 5 hours. This past week has been awful, she was the only thing keeping me going. Even when we weren't talking about anything special just seeing her name on my phone brightened my day. I just had a few shitty weeks and didn't talk much, and she just thought I didn't wanna talk to her and dumped me for it:( and I wish I could take that back. She is my world and I love her more than anything and it sucks because she doesn't feel the same. And I just wish I could fix it, fix us, fix everything... Ya occasionally she annoyed me but most of the time I'd do anything for her attention, and tried to give her all my attention when I could... And I just wish I had another chance, but I don't and it's tearin me apart more and more everyday.
