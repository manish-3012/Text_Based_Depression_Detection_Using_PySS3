Thank you to everyone who helped me + explanation and apologyIt's me again. I want to apologize for two things. For worrying everyone about my suicidal tendencies yesterday and again speaking about this.

Here's the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hbhd2v/im_going_to_kill_myself_tonight/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

First of all. I'm F, 23.

My reasons for wanting to kill myself were because of the recent events that happened + old stuff that was happening in between.

In the same week, my girlfriend (who I extremely loved) broke up with me for the second time in a month span, my computer stopped working with my drawing tablet and my grandma passed away yesterday. Not only that was happening but my family environment has been really bad. My parents are good people but are very controlling and non-supportive. I was having past regrets and I wasn't being able to deal with them. I have severe OCD and consequently, suicidal tendencies. I have also depression, zero self-esteem and body issues. 

I can't indulge in therapy (which I haven't had since late February) because it sucks. It's a lottery to get a good psicologist. Every single one I had experience with, was strange or awful. Plus, my parents have several issues with me going to therapy as well. (it's so many and I'm not going to list them) 

Yesterday, I snapped. I literally snapped completely. I'm ashamed for going into that mode. I was desperate... My life has been a downhill from very young. And it was just a year ago that I found true and pure happiness with my girlfriend. And it ended very poorly. All my life was making others happy without feeling happy. Yes, I was living for my girlfriend but I was so happy to make her happy. She made me happy.

Her reasons to break up with me were reasonable. She said she couldn't imagine being with someone that was suicidal. We still have never met and according to her, our relationship wasn't healthy was in a standstill and not healthy. (she also had her mental issues to worry about) 

Part of me knows that I don't want to be with a person that doesn't want to be with me. But I'm selfish and it hurts... It hurts to be abandoned by someone who you thought you were going to marry with. She said I was the love of her life. And yet, we were having problems (without me being aware) and she broke up with me without discussing them.

There's the small possibility that she may want to try again in the future. But I'm so afraid that 1. she will just stay with me because she's afraid I will kill myself (I'm afraid she'll endure a relationship when she's not happy just so I don't hurt myself or kill myself), does it make sense. I don't want that. I don't want to spend the rest of my life wondering why she's with me. 2. I'm afraid she'll settle for me because she doesn't have any other options. 3. That I'm holding her for a better life with someone else. The first point is probably just my mind obssessed because she DID broke up with me because she's not happy with the relationship. But I'm afraid she'll settle in the future... And I really don't want that. I'd rather be in pain. The third point is about my own self esteem... I don't think I was never good enough for her.

If I had known that so many problems were going to happen, Id had never dated her. My ocd exploded 3 months AFTER we started dating. In fact, I only dated her because I thought I was mentally stable to be in a relationship and also because I loved her.

I know it was selfish of me. I know the break up is a good thing!! For her at least. I should be happy that I'm not holding her to something better, to someone better! But... I'm not... I'm selfish... And I'm hurting.

I actually snapped and sent her a message... (I've been trying to hold on) We had an argument and I feel so guilty for hurting her... Because I felt she gave up on our relationship for the wrong reasons. And I feel so poorly for guilt tripping her... It's not an excuse for what I did... I just thought... She gave up too soon without talking with me... She gave away her our future plans and.. Well... I'm rambling.

Regarding my decision to die. Listen to me. I know it's selfish to kill myself. But to live to please others it's miserable. I have nothing I want to do. I don't want to go anywhere and I have no ambitions! I have always felt like this.

Why should I live in misery so to make others happy?

And no. My life is not going to get better.

Even my parents told me that "I had to live. Even if it's  miserable. And you should continue to pretend to make us happy" thank you mom and dad for being such good supportive parents in my mental health. *sarcasm*

Edit: I forgot to add this but I'm happy we broke up. I'm not a good person and she does deserve better.
