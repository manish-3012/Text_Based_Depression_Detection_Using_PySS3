My Friend wants to kill herself and idk what to do.I gave her my number and a suicide hotline and after a long conversation I told her that if she has those thoughts again immediately call the suicide hotline then call me. But idk if I should do anything else, I donâ€™t know where she lives and I canâ€™t drive at the moment. Please help I care very much for her!
