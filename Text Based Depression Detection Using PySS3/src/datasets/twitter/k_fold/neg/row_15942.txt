Suicidal Friend wants to take psychedelicsHi everyone, 

so my friend has just recently tried to commit suicide and was admitted to the hospital, so while I was cleaning his room I found his LSD and shrooms and decided to hold on to them for now. His doctor also agreed with my actions when I was on call with him. He got discharged today, but was pretty upset about me taking them. I just want some opinions on whether or not I'm making the right decision on keeping the drugs away from him or is it safe to return them to him?

Thank you
