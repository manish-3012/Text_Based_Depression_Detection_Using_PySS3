Please help meIm so scared of my life i live with an abuser (not 100% physical) i have childhood trauma, i was born with SEVERE depression i have wanted to die since i was a baby, i would put scissors to my wrist and cry and tell my mom "I'll do it" AT FOUR YEARS OLD. My life has NEVER EVER been okay, every single year my entire 22 years of life it gets worse and worse and i keep living because I'm so scared of death  but I'm so scared of living. ALL I WANT is to feel LOVED i just want to be loved not a single person has ever loved me I'm so disgusting and mentally r*tarded anyone I love with all my heart has never liked me back because I'm unattractive and sad, i keep hitting my head hard against the wall until theres no physical feeling until the next day. Im too scared to kill myself but i have no NO REASON to be alive i wish someone would kill me so bad I've offered people thousands of dollars i can't be alive
