It's selfish that we make others live for usHow selfish that we expect other people not to kill themselves for our own sake? We expect others to stay alive and live in misery just so don't have to live without them. 

Note: I'm not planning on doing anything tonight or really any time soon, but I've thought about this for years and I did attempt recently but the 'friends' who stopped me and took me to the hospital really did so just to ease their own guilt because they immediately abandoned me afterwards and treated me like shit again and I'm so so tired of living a life I don't want to just because others don't want to let me go even though they're not here for me now.
