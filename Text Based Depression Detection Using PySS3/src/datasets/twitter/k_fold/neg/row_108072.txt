Just want it to be overI just want to disappear, and suicide does that. I know it's not fair for my friends and my family, but I can't bring myself to give a shit about that right now. I've read all the "50 reasons why you shouldn't kill yourself" articles. It doesn't help. I'm not even sure if I want it to help. I don't wanna stick it out, I know life might get better, but it's not worth it. I want it to be over, I don't care about missing the best day of my life.
