I don't know what to do.I've been having money trouble for a long time, despite having a fairly well-paying job. The problem is my wife, who has multiple medical problems and the mountain of medical bills that goes with them. She is unable to work, so we've scraped by as much as we could on my salary.

About a year ago I was arrested for shoplifting. I was at the self-checkout at Walmart and I apparently forgot to scan certain items. While it was a stupid thing to do, I don't feel like I did anything wrong. When it went to court, my lawyer advised me to plead guilty to disorderly conduct. Even though I didn't do anything wrong, I did what he said, and I got six months of probation.

The real problem was with work. I work in police dispatch, and the POST council could revoke my certification regardless of the court's decision. Today, almost a year later, I received a certified letter stating that my certification was revoked.

I've considered suicide in the past, but the main thing that kept me going was the thought that my wife needed me to support her. Now I can't even do that.
