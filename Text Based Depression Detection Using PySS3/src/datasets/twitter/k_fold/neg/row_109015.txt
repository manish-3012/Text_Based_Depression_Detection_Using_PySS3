Static to SilenceI've been on Suicide Watch for nearly a year now, but nothing is helping me get better. I'm being medicated, interviewed and "counselled" and nothing helps with my depression.

I lost my house and job, my wife had an affair and she took my kids, I barely get to see them anyone because it "isn't fair for her to not have them more." This was after an abrupt ending to a 10 year relationship, and a 6 year marriage.

I am a 27 year old, unemployed, soon to be divorced man, father of 2, with no marketable qualities or skills. I have been unemployed since February where I use to be a school bus driver. Under the pressure of stress from my wife's affair, not seeing my kids or the fact that she has a restraining order against me caused me to snap. February 25th, I was going to take my own life, and despite the no-contact order, my wife consistently messaged me on my phone, usually to blame or insult me, I called her and told her I was going to kill myself. I hung up on her and soon had cops outside my current residence. They took me to the crisis centre in my city and left me there. The counsellor was less than helpful and I took a cab back to where I am staying.

Recently I attended court to put these matters behind me; so I can get a divorce and try to salvage my life, when I was hauled off to jail as my wife reported me to the police weeks after I called her, the officers that night did not care that I called her, but the ones she spoke to arrested me INSIDE the courthouse. I spent the night in jail which was new as i've never committed a crime previously. The next day I was released and I had to walk across the city (a 3 hour walk) to get back to my residence, in my wedding suit, which is my best suit.

Suffering from the intense level of depression i'm under, and not wanting to miss a chance to actually see my kids; i've remained unemployed. I have spent months sitting in a cold dark basement, watching YouTube videos, playing PC games, attempted to make YouTube videos and live-stream, and tried to forget my pitiful life.

Now i'm losing all aspiration. I have no friends, only a few people I talk to occasionally online, no one I know besides online aliases. No game can hold my attention or distract me, no amount of videos or movies can drown out the sorrow. I have been resorting to music to try and keep me alive, but I feel that grip fading, I can feel it slipping.

I spent years studying all sorts of things, including psychology. I am rather well educated (mostly self-taught) and I know how i'm feeling. I understand the repercussions of what could happen if I killed myself, but the pros outweigh the cons.

In just over 12 hours I will once again be inside that same courthouse. I wonder what plan my wife has cooked up this time. She can pretty much say what she wants and my word isn't good enough for the system. I give up fighting.

I use to write poetry, my muse is that of a cold dark place, which is what my life has devolved into so I did just that.

*Blaring the loud rhythm, hoping the shattering bass simply vibrates the sorrow from my soul. Hoping the crass tempo will drown me out.*

*Rip another note out of me, use my tears to write a symphony. Smash my soul with your chorus, take the treble from my voice. Burn the sheet.*

*If I could compose i'd sing a mournful tune, a melody so filled with morbid thought. It would bring sadness to the masses, ending their joy.*

*As the hum of the amp dies off, the silence returns. The last note is struck, my fate is sealed. An eternity of silence, kindred of death.*

These words are my own, if they resemble someone else's then I don't know who or where they'd be.

I posted these words online, I got some "favorites" for my posts and the only comment was asking if they were my words and then how I was "spitten' sick lyrics" and that point my heart simply sunk. There was more interest in something that was automatically posted on my behalf than the words I poured out from my soul.

I am not looking for sympathy, I can't even say i'm looking for help. With this post I know I have said how I feel, and that these words can be found, and that the guilty will hopefully feel remorse, and maybe I can be at peace.
