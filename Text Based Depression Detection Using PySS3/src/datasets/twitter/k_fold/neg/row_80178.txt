I'll inevitably do it sooner or laterNot right now, or anytime soon. I'm actually doing pretty decent right now. But I know this day will come, when I'll snap and just do it. It will just be a matter of minutes, won't need more. But I know that inevitably this is the way I'll go. Could be in a month, a year or a decade, hell knows. But that day will come.

Anyone else feel the same way?
