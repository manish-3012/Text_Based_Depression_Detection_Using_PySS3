I am an unnecessary piece in this universeI used to think the only reason I had to live were my friends, and this isn't good. I ruined many friendships living in anxiety.  Now I have a cat that I love. But I'm seeing now that I'm kicked out of my house and paying for a bed at my friends house, that he could survive without me. I could just leave him here. Go drive to some highway in the middle of nowhere. Find a tree. Take the noose I already have. Tie it to the tree. Feed it through my car. Get in the car. Put it around my neck. And accelerate. Within less than 75 ft, I can end my suffering. I would hurt my family doing this. I would hurt my friend who is housing me. But they gain my cat which they love. And I won't be able to hurt anyone else. I hurt people. My only friend my age, is a great person. Who has been there for me throughout their own pain. Through my pain. And throughout the pain I've caused them. I'm a broken person. I want to be better. But I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. I don't want my friends too feel like they're stuck with me. I don't want to be here. I wish I could make the world a better place. But I've caused more tears than I've helped soak up. I can't take care of myself anymore. There's knots in my hair. I can't fall asleep until 4 AM on a good night. I wake up, and especially now after getting kicked out of my parents home, I just don't know what to do from when I wake up too when I goto bed
