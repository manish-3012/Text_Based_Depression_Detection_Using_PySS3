Canâ€™t do it anymoreIâ€™m going to get a gun by next week and kill myself. Right to the left ventricle, aiming it superior lateral under the costal margin leading to immediate desanguintation or instant death 2/2 lack of blood flow to the brain from the LV. Iâ€™m a doctor. Iâ€™ve been single for 6 years. I work in a prison. My ex left me for a fucking warehouse worker, no offense to you guys but fuck him. Heâ€™s dumber than a rock. Thatâ€™s it. I canâ€™t take this fucking planet anymore. Billions of people and I canâ€™t meet ONE fucking woman on the planet who has a fucking heart or interest in anyone like me. Fucking 7 years of nonstop school/training. Working in one of the most demanding fields. NOTHING. not one fucking blip. FUCK YOU. FUCK THIS PLANET. I predict a full on nuclear war after Iâ€™m dead. FUCK YOU. GOODBYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES. It doesnâ€™t matter how hard you work or bust yourself or improve yourself in this world. You will die alone if youâ€™re a halfway decent human being. All the evidence you need is fucking Jesus Christ. Even if he was some immortal god being they fucking killed him. We did it. This planet does not value people who fucking care, ever. We are the garbage. We are nothing. It is moot and I can see why so many women get abortions now because they would end up having kids like me. People who fucking give a shit. Well when we are all gone you will all die and the human race will end. FUCK YOU, YOU GET WHAT YOU GIVE YOU FUCKING HORRIBLE HUMANS.
