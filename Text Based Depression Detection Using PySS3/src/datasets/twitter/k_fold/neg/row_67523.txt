They know but they try to forget.A couple months ago I was put into a GP because I had too much weed at school and was reacting badly. I know it sounds stupid and destructive but that was the only way I coped with the onslaught of suicidal thoughts and actions, it was the only way to forget and keep control. When my parents arrived they asked me why I did it, what they did wrong always what they did wrong. So I told them for almost a year my every thought has been directed towards the ending of my life and for a while I thought things would get better and that they cared but they never mentioned it again except in the one therapy session we went to but it wasn't even proper therapy. I think they forgot or that they think it was just a phase or some mood I would only keep for a week or that they don't want to talk about it that it's too out of the ordinary for them and it'll be easier to forget than try and help.
