I wanted to set a good example for my familyMy entire family is poor. I have a deadbeat dad who got my name and my sisters names (a tattoo) covered up with solid black
and he didnt bother to go to my college graduation.  My older sister attempted suicide multiple times and been in and out of mental hospitals. Although we are poor and had to move in with our grandparents after my dad left. I got good grades and had a good childhood. I went to college and majored in what I loved. Im the only one in my family-both sides, cousins, everything who went to college and finished. I work as a wage slave barista. I wanted to show my family that college is worth it because my older sister dropped out. I wanted to get a job in my field and  help pay for classes for her to go back. I bought her a laptop and paid for her out of insurance doctors appointments so she wouldnt be depressed. She hasn't been in the hospital for a long time and I'm happy for her. But I hate my life. I worked hard and got scholarships and had classes from 9am to 9pm. And I cant even move out of my mom's section 8 apartment. My art lies in a closest and I try really hard to be confident and keep applying for jobs but it's so depressing because although I can draw, the applications ask for things outside of my field like coding or video editing skills as well as knowing illustrator and realistic drawing, good writing. I get ghosted as regularly as I get denied for jobs and I try so hard, I sell my normal clothes for interview clothes and drive miles and miles to interviews and dates.ill drive early and sleep in my car to not miss an interview. I feel like I just wasted my time in college honestly. There was no point of going if I was going to end up making coffees and kissing ass all fucking day. I'm over this.
