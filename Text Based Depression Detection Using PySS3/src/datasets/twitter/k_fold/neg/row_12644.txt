I don't know if I'll ever get outHi I'm Eslam, you might know me from my other post 'Egypt isn't very nice', I'm a bit terrified of the fact that I might not be able to immigrate to a 1st world country and get my mood disorders treated because my family is poor, my dad had to spend all the money he stored in my bank account to get new shipments for our shop, so now I'll either have to get a decent degree and be a translator or work my dad's shop after he dies, and my family isn't really ok with the former and I don't know if I'll make it out of highschool, I'm not all that proud of the latter because we work at a pipe-fixing oil-y replacement parts shop and I'm not all that good at it. 

My family want me to work the shop because that's how we were able to sustain ourselves for so long and they think it's a good second option if I somehow drop out of school or get bad degrees, but I really don't want to take it from there when my dad passes away because I barely know the prices or how to deal with customers and it'll take a long time for me to save up and be able to pay for flight tickets let alone buy a house or pay for rent in whatever 1st world country I'll immigrate to, it's all a mess and my family barely gives a shit.
