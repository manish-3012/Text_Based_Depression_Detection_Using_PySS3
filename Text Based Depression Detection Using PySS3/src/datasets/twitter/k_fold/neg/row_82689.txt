I'm Better Off DeadI know most of you won't bother reading this. I don't blame you, why should you care about me?

I have been depressed since I was 11 years old. I always told myself that one day things will look up. Yet, 8 years later, here I am, still wishing I was dead. I have exhausted my resources. I tried Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, at least 4 different anti-depressants, staying inpatient at a mental hospital, counseling...you name it. I am ready to give up.

I have no friends left. I started making posts online in a pathetic attempt to meet some people. It didn't work. I am alone in this. I just finished writing my will. I am ready to kill myself. This is my last attempt at invoking something, anything that could convince me otherwise. But I have a feeling it will be in vain.

Goodbye, Reddit. Thanks for accompanying me all those times I awkwardly scrolled through my phone while eating alone, sitting at a bus stop, or just isolating myself.
