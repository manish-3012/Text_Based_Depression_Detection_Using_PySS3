Why...Why should I keep living? The past few years all Iâ€™ve felt is depression and these past few months itâ€™s only gotten worse. Itâ€™s at its boiling point right now, I can feel it. The anger, the self hatred, Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m going to hurt someone else if I donâ€™t end myself first. Today was the straw that broke the camels back. Someone I dearly love is very sick, and is likely not going to make it. My family is mad at me too, and my parents and I had the worst argument weâ€™ve had to date this morning. I found out my girlfriend is cheating on me today, and she feels no remorse for it. Itâ€™s not like I can give her the life she wants anyways. Then I accidentally crashed into someone today. I canâ€™t afford to pay for the damages on their car and my insurance is shitty, my job doesnâ€™t pay me anything either. I am just done...
