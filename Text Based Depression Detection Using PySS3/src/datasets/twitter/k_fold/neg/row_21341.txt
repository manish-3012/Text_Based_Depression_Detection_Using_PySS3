CheeseHi peeps.
Today I was watching some twitch, kryticzeuz baking a cake and then I folled his suggestion and went to loki82_707 channel. He is a small twitch streamer. I followed him as he seemed nice and all. So when he saw my name (therealloneycheese, which is my YouTube and twitch streaming name) he said that it was a cool name and he liked it. I started crying because of this. It felt like this was something I never had before. It made my day!! I felt under the rag again, but this helped me! This is just a thank you for him! If you like twitch gaming streamers then follow this map as he seems very nice!

Thanks for the read. Now I had my attention. As most people here I am too an atentionwhore. I make YouTube videos (although all of them are private) so I'm probably even worse then most of the attention whore people. Well I took a stab at everyone, now you can all hate me without restraint.

Bye bye
