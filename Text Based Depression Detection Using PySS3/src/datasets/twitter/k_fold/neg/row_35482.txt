Miserable in Michigan40 had everything lost it all; got lots of debt and a terrible job. Dad is dead, my remaining family played a part in my destruction. In 2018 I hung myself after learning that my 5 year marriage was a failure. Once jumped from a U of M parking structure after just being released from there psychiatric ward. Drove the wrong way on highway 94 but got scared of the large trucks coming from the other direction. Been in and out of the washtenaw community mental health program for the last couple of years (not by choice). I have no hard drug or alcohol issues. Medication is a moot point. Therapy is pointless. I've tried to improve my life situation through my personal means but no "joy". I am one of the few who have tried spravato for my suicidal behavior. Its' effects on my mood don't last. No real housing situation, go for days without talking or eating. I daydream or talk to myself about violently killing myself/others or both. I look forward to conflict and take it too the extreme in everything I do nowadays. Honestly I don't know how to make it to the end of the year let alone to tomorrow. Somebody kill me plz or get me the gun so I can do it myself. I don't deserve to die a painful death at least in my mind anyway. Thought I should've died twice already not sure how to go  from here? Hard drugs? Hot Dose? Live another day...thanks.
