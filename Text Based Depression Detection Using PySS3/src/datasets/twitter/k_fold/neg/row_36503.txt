my mind broke and my boyfriend isnt the person i know and love anymore. I want to fucking die but i dont have the guts.four straight days of anxiety and crying. i dont have any energy left in me to talk about the problem. i just need someone right now. im getting blood everywhere. i need help. i domt want to talk about the problem. i cant stand to think about it any longer.
