unfortunately, some of us are just dealt unplayable handsthat's just the reality of this existence. if your brain and/or body is truly and genuinely broken beyond repair, then by all means you have every right to leave. 

"normal" people will never quite understand this concept. they can only see existence through their own lens. it's inconceivable to them that some of us are authentically suffering due to things beyond our control. (by the way, I don't begrudge them for this at all.)

"suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem". well what if your problem is permanent?! and some of our problems are truly lifelong sources of pain and misery. sometimes, the cold, hard, shitty truth is "suicide is a solution to a problem". 

don't get me wrong, this existence can be fucking amazing. Life Itself is intensely, almost overwhelmingly, beautiful. but only if you get to experience it within certain, though fairly wide, parameters. 

if your mind is broken, if your body is weakened, if you're undergoing insurmountable levels of trauma... by all means let yourself be free from your suffering.

Life, Liberty, &amp; the Pursuit of Happiness. if any of these are outright denied to you, then do yourself a favor and quit playing the game in which you'll always lose. 

I'll be taking my own advice within the next day.
