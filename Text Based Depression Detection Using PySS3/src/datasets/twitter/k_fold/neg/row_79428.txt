I'm ready to give up...My life has been one disappointment after another. My father left when I was little, haven't seen him since. Apparently he was a real loser anyway. Then my "mentor" abused me for almost three years. That left me real fucked up. All my mom does is yell at me or ignore me. She goes out of her way not to touch me. I think she hates me. I get anxious all the time. I never had a serious girlfriend. My older sister graduated and is no longer going to be living at home. I got horrible grades in school last year. I don't believe in God anymore...I mean, at what point do you just throw in the towel and say enough is enough. We get this one life here on earth and some of us get dealt a real shitty hand. So why prolong this? What's the point of living such a worthless life? I'm not at any immediate risk right now, but it's just like, does any of it even matter? Does anyone even care?
