For my girls.Prior to being married I accumulated 180k+ in medical debt. I have a (5 days shy)1 year old little girl and a beautiful mama they are my world. But I fear this debt as well as more medical debt from the birth. Coupled with my teeth being abhorrent , though I have insurance I cannot keep up with all the payments. I make 33K a year @ 50+ hours a week, and do side jobs for extra cash. It is breaking my heart and soul that I cannot properly provide for my girls. I am going to get life insurance and (hope) to die shortly thereafter. My little girl loves me so much this plan hurts to think about. I'm at wits end all because of money. I'd rather be poor and debt free than continue like this. Constant calls. Unable to get loans. Though my brain tumor has been treated, I still feel I have a death sentence. Is there a place to turn for help?
