Has anyone been to a hospital or â€˜mental instituteâ€™?Sorry I dont know the word for this, but has anyone gone to a mental health ward thing? I guess each place is different but if you have what was it like? I am talking about where they take you when you are at risk of harming yourself. Did it help or make you worse? I think I need to go to one.
