I wish I wasn't such a cowardI've been living with depression long than I've been alive at this point.  I have a shit job where I'm used and abused and treated like trash, but I have been applying to other jobs for years at this point and can't get anyone to give me the time of day.  I couldn't even network my way into an interview.  I have an immensely hard time making friends and people that I thought were friends only want to talk to me if they want something.  I was trying to plan a trip with one of the only friends I have that lives near me.  Thought she decided to go alone, only to discover that she went with someone else instead of me.  Family doesn't give a shit about me, aside from 2 extremely over protective parents who lost their shit when I actually found something that made me happy but would have required that I move extremely far away.  Guys have never found me attractive or interesting, so I've given up on relationships.  I have nothing in my life, and at this point I'm tired of trying to do anything about it.  I was actually pricing guns the other day, but I'm such a damn coward I'd be shocked if I ever did it.  I eat like shit and have let my weight go in hopes that I'll just keel over from a heart attack.  I've said for 10 years that if I got cancer or something, I wouldn't do anything about it.  I'm just so tired of trying.  Life is nothing but an unending series of bullshit and I'm beyond over it.
