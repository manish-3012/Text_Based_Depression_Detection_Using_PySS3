My life isnâ€™t worth living, Iâ€™ve wanted to die for over day years.As the title says my life isnâ€™t worth living. My week is, get up, go to work, get home, eat, shower, watch TV/play Games, sleep. Weekends are the same but swap work for the gym. My friends have moved on and have houses/girlfriends while I have a 10 year old urge to die. My life sux and Iâ€™ve tried for years to change it, new hobbies, even a new career (3 times) but every day my first and last thoughts between sleeping is dying. 

I donâ€™t have the strength to do it myself but I hope every minute of every day that some strange accident will end it for me quickly. Iâ€™ve tried everything in my power but nothing has helped the only thing I hadnâ€™t done is have a girlfriend but I have tried and never made anything off it. Death please take me away on this day are my first words everyday.
