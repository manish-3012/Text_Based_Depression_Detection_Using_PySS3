I just donâ€™t see myself living a good lifeI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the point anymore. Iâ€™ve never had friends growing up, iâ€™m 21 now and im utterly alone right now. I have no one, i pushed my family out of my life, i pushed what little friends i had out of my life, iâ€™ve been all alone for the most of 2020. It just dawned on me a couple days ago that I literally havenâ€™t spoken a single word out of my mouth to another human being in weeks, and when i did it was when i was ordering fast food. When i finally spoke my voice was so hoarse and the words croaked out of my mouth i felt so low, and when i saw myself in the mirror and saw my unkept hair and dark circles under my eyes and realized what iâ€™ve become, itâ€™s so clear that iâ€™m just never going to have a life worth living.

My mom has cancer and dementia, my dad doesnâ€™t even talk to me anymore more, me and my sister used to be so close together and now we canâ€™t even be in the same room together. I know that when i kill myself everyone that used to be in my life will be sad, and my family will fall apart, but i want to do it so bad. I just feel so selfish leaving my family in a worse state than they already are but how can I keep living like this.

I just donâ€™t know what to do, every time i talk to anyone i get so nervous and anxious. I keep thinking about the future i can have, and i just donâ€™t see myself being happy. I do good in school, could probably have a decent career if i tried, but whatâ€™s the point if i canâ€™t even look someone in the eyes and have a conversation with them. I know ill never get married, much less date anyone. And if i am lucky enough to find someone i just know itâ€™s a matter of time before they get bored of me and leave me.

Thereâ€™s just nothing left for me. Iâ€™d love to say i tried but the truth is iâ€™ve dug myself into a hole that iâ€™m afraid i canâ€™t dig myself out of. I want to be better than this so bad but iâ€™ve been this socially awkward since i was a kid and at this point I donâ€™t know how to stop. I feel so weak and stupid for allowing my life to be this way and now thereâ€™s no hope for me.

Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 15, iâ€™m 21 now. I already know how iâ€™m gonna do it, what to write on my death note, how iâ€™m gonna leave my body for my friends and family. Itâ€™s so pathetic that iâ€™ve put more thought into my death than my life but even the thought of waking up tomorrow and going through the same hell iâ€™ve been going through my whole life is so daunting. 

I wish I could give this life to someone else so badly. It feels so selfish and wrong to give up on living but it feels even worse to continue living like this. I wish there was a way to give my life to someone whoâ€™s more deserving because death is the only alternative i can think of.
