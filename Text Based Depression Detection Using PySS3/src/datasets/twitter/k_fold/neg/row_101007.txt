Maybe this is petty but hear me outMy friend and I were laying down in his room at 5:00 in the morning desperately trying to get to sleep, and our conversation slowly got more and more depressing. He told me that awhile back he was gonna kill himself. He said he had the entire plan and he was gonna do it until he met the woman who is now his girlfriend. This crushed me. Iâ€™m not good enough. Iâ€™m not good enough to keep him around. Every time Iâ€™ve gone to the hospital and come out Iâ€™ve always decided that I was gonna stay alive for him because I knew thatâ€™d heâ€™d be hurt if I did something, but now Iâ€™m not so sure. If Iâ€™m not good enough whatâ€™s the point of me staying around anymore?
