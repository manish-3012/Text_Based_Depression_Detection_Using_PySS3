I just don't see the point..I don't see the point in living anymore as I have nothing to live for. I'm not feeling suicidal but I just don't see the point in living anymore. I was bullied for about 1-2 years and have been feeling depressed ever since (that happened about 4 years ago). Sometimes the feeling of sadness seems to fade away but it always comes back. I've tried several times to turn my life around but it never works. I have no friends and I've tried making friends but it always fails because I have social anxiety. I just need someone to talk to.
