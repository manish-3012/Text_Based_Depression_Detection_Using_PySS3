I need help, but I also feel I don't deserve it.Hello.

I guess I'm coming here as sort of a last resort. I've contacted a few help lines but I didn't feel heard or understood. If anything they made me feel worse. 

I don't want to kill myself. I'm too scared, but I also don't think my life is worth living.

I feel like a terrible human being. Everyone says I'm not, but I still feel that way no matter what, and I reject any sort of kindness I get because I feel undeserving of it. I'm not sure if I'm some crazy delusional person or lying to everyone I know and love. Might have OCD, but I haven't been to therapy in months (no access).

I've attempted a couple times in the past few weeks and I guess I'm attempting now by bodily neglect? I've been off my meds for a few days now. I eat minimally.

I keep seeing signs that I should kill myself... And my friends tell me there are signs I shouldn't that I need to find, but I just can't seem to find any other than people. I just want some reasons to not do it, when it feels like everything is against me including my own self. I'm sorry this is kinda dark I just really need some help.
