Ready to goI think Iâ€™m finally ready to go... the thought of suicide doesnâ€™t really scare me anymore. I plan to get high and head out to this lake in the woods where I will walk out onto the ice. Thereâ€™s a spot where the lake connects with another body of water and the current makes the ice weaker there. My plan is to go through the ice there so that the current will pull me out further under the ice and I wonâ€™t be able to get back up. I wish I could say I tried everything to fix myself before resorting to this but the sad truth is that I didnâ€™t try all that hard. I know Iâ€™m a coward but I simply donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore and this is the quickest path to getting any relief.
