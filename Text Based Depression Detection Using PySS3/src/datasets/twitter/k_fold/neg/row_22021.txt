I can't take it anymoreI'm sliding towards death a little bit more everyday. I'm completely dead inside, didn't cry for years, no feelings at all. There's just no reason why I should want to stay around besides the fact that me ending my life would crush my family. I've been thinking about faking an accident or something, just so they don't feel responsible for my illness, but I don't know. 

I just really have nothing to do here, nothing worth living and I can't take it anymore. Existence is pain for me and I just keep living to make my family feel like nothing's wrong. I just need it to end
