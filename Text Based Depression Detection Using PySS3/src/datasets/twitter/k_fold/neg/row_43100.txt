I'm a single mother and suicidal. I can't control my feelings anymore. Every day I feel I want to die . So many times I have tried to kill myself even after I got my son. 
I'm just so stupid for everything. I got married the wrong guy who ruined my life and hurt me mentally. 
Nowadays I have been so depressed and thinking about kill myself very seriously. Because of my situation. And I can't love my son. He doesn't understand what's going on. He always wants my attention. He always does what I don't like. 
To be honest, I hit him often.. I know I'm a really terrible mother. I am sure I shouldn't be his mother anymore. but there's no one who cares about him. My family doesn't Care, my ex's family doesn't Care... 
The place where I live now is  not a good place. 
I can't see therapist. I can't use baby sitters... 
I have to take care of my son only by myself physically and financially... 
But when I am gone. I would take my son with me. 
I'm tired of this life. 
Thank you reading my Post..
