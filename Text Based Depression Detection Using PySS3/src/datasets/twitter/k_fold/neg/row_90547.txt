it doesnt get betterI dont even want to live anymore. I wish i could kill myself. i really wish i could. but the thought of my parents reaction stops me. 
People say it gets better but it doesnts, thats a load of shit. Theres no point to anything at all, and im unhappy so why should i stick around.
