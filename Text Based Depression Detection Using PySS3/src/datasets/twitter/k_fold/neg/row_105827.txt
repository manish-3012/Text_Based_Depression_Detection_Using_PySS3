I think Iâ€™m in crisis modeTwo nights ago I took a handful of Tylenol pm. Like maybe 20. And probably 20 ibuprofen on top of an empty stomach full of gin.  These past 5 years have been hard, yadda yadda chronic spinal  pain yadda toxic long term relationship and a history of depression.

My roommate tried to make me vomit but I fought him away, gave in when I was basically incoherent and vomited through the night.. I woke up the next morning in my bed. Perplexed and let down that I was actually awake.

I was throwing up and had cold sweats all yesterday and today I have the shakes. Iâ€™ve tried not to drink but itâ€™s only been a limiting.  At this point Iâ€™m just worried about any long term liver damage. Iâ€™ve just been pushing fluids. Roommate/boyfriend hasnâ€™t left my side but Iâ€™m feigning interest in life. I gotta tell you I just donâ€™t see the point of it anymore.

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll try anything drastic again anytime soon. But I didnâ€™t see that episode coming so who knows. I havenâ€™t told any family or friends, I guess i just needed to get it out there. Thanks.
