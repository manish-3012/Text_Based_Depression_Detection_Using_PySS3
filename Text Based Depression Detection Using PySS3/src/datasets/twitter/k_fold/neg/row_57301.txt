I dont even know where to start, living for the last 10 years has been painfulIm 24 now, I live alone and it seems like the last 10 years or so has been just an all out self destructive Hello_matey (sorry for the funny SN) spiral. 

I cant seem to get ahead in life. I keep thinking to myself "If i havnt changed for the better this time next year, im going to kill myself." Next year rolls around and bam, Im more depressed than before. Im a pretty smart guy, I can fix just about anything and do well in school, but I always seems to intentionally turn myself into the clown of every situation. 

I have basically no relationship with family, I only get random messages from parents wondering if Im still alive. I have no friends because I burn bridges with everyone I know. I havnt had any sort of romantic relationship. 

I really am not looking for sympathy or to hear "its ok, it will get better." I want some sort of closure from this miserable existance and why every day I wake up wanting to hang myself. I cant look anyone in the eye because I feel this overwhelming shame about the actions and choices I have made. 

I tried to kill myself today by cutting off circualtion to my brain (rope around neck, pinching carotid ateries) because it seems like a pretty painless way to go. 

I feel like everywhere I go people are laughing at me or mocking me.
