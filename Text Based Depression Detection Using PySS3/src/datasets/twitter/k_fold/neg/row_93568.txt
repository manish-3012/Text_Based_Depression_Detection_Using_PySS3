I really and truly believe I will have ended my life by the end of 2021I can't fucking think, maybe it's because i'm in panic mode right now.

i posted like 9 months ago or so to the depression subreddit about my distant fascination with death and suicide (haha! its my throwaway name!), and the fact that i'm posting here should be enough to say that it's grown almost into an inevitable plan. I have a lot to live for, I just don't care about any of it. I genuinely can't look past this year at all. I'm not going to bother putting the energy forth to provide some background story, that's up to you to read through my posts, not that I really understand what's happening anymore.

I guess this is a cry for help, but i'm almost entirely positive i won't be swayed away from it unless some miracle happens.
