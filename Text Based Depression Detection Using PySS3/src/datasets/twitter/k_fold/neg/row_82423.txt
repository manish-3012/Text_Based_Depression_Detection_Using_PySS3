A study from about a year and a half ago explaining teen suicide rates related to school. It really hit me hard.I have suicidal thoughts, constantly. This article put things into perspective for me as I find I struggle in school and is one of the main reasons for my thoughts, I don't want to continue at school anymore but I really don't have any other choice but to fail and then fail in life because of my poor choice to give up on school.  


The article is here:  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201805/children-s-teens-suicides-related-the-school-calendar](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201805/children-s-teens-suicides-related-the-school-calendar) 

and I would encourage you to read it.

(I am unsure if this is against the rules, I read the rules and didn't see anything against it but if it is I will remove it to save mods trouble)
