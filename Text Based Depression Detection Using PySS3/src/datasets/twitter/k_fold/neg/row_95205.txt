Itâ€™s getting worse.I can barely sleep, eat or do anything at all. I havenâ€™t left the house in over 5 months, Iâ€™m just here alone, thinking bout ending it all every minute, itâ€™s the only way I can find some peace, I canâ€™t handle this any longer, I donâ€™t see any light at the end of this dark miserable tunnel, and frankly I dont even wanna see it. My time is way over due, thereâ€™s no place left for me here. I have to go.
