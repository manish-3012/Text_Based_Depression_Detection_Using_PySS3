Giving myself two more years.I'm currently in grade/year 10 at school. I've been diagnosed with chronic depression, disassociative identity disorder, cardiovascular disease, and some other minor health issues. This is mostly thought to be hereditary, my psych thinks in the next few years if I experience any more trauma then the risk of me developing schizophrenia is too high for him to be comfortable. I grew up without a childhood. I can't remember a majority of it due to my identity disorder. I'm sick and tired of living knowing I'll be the first of my friends to go. That I'll die before my parents, and they'll have to give an eulogy at the funeral for their daughter. I want to end it now, get it over and done with. I have the means and I know the next time I attempt I'll succeed. However, I'm giving myself two more years. To graduate, give my parents something to be proud of, show them that I can achieve something even when I'm decaying into nothing. 
I know in two years time I will be half of what I am today, but I would have given myself something to base some pride off of.
