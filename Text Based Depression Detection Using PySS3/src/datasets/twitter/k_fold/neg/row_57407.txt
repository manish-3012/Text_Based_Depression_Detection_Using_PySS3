Why do people lie about depression and suicideI'm sick of it. I once was suicidal, I'm not currently. I struggled with depression and seeing people fake it makes me angry as fuck. It happens everywhere on social media, even here on this fucking subreddit. People saying "this is the night I kill myself, it's been X amount of hours and I took X grams, when am I going to die?". One quick Google search and turns out that OP should've been dead 10 hours ago, next day he posts like nothing happend. I'm sick of it.
