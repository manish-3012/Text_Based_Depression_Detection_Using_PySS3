I sought help, and it didn't do it.I have been out of school for somewhere around 40% of this year. Last semester failed 6 of my 8 classes. I have a 34 on my ACT. I have had low grades in classes for years. I am a christian, but this is the longest I've ever been out. I hurt constantly in my abdomen but all tests come back negative. I have had no one check on me, or question my well being. I had a bought of new suicidal thoughts back in september for the first time, and I knew I needed help. The psychiatrist is doing things but said with my brain, even failing high school I could do anything. But I still dont see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have leadership roles, I am a mentor to the Freshman at my high school, and am planning on going into ministry, but I just can't fucking do it. I dont have any friends who actually care, just forced by teams or organizations or churches. I dont have a girlfriend. My adoptive parents are too racist hateful old bikers and I have been lying to my bio mom who only cares about my good grades saying things are fine so I cant turn to her, and I'm now back here. I thought for a while and the only reason I couldn't come to terms with suicide is the suicide note would take too long to write, not leaving a person out of it, and the girlfriend who recently broke up with me would probably feel at guilt along with other people, and I don't want them too think they are at fault. I don't see a solution. I understand I'm young and dumb but I don't see myself wanting to live in the future I expect it to be.
