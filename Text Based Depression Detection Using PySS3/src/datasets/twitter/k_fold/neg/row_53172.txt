I don't feel anything anymore. Despite what I haveHi, I'm a depressed college student who wants to die..I know, sounds typical. So what's got me down? School's too hard? Friends? Family sucks? 

Actually, no. I currently have a 4.0 GPA and have enough scholarships to pay off my tuition AND even get a hefty amount of what's left over directly to my bank account. Enough to sustain myself in an apartment comfortably (although I still work part time). My family is perfectly functional (besides me), my sister just became a pediatrician, both my parents work at respectable jobs. They're not abusive or anything. As for friends, I have a few, which I've always preferred, but they haven't done anything wrong. I have a wonderful cat who's super loving and caring. My counseler is super cool and I actually believe she cares. 

But despite all of that, I don't feel anything anymore. And when I'm not completely numb all I feel is despair. It's so easy to put up an act and convince everyone around you you're perfectly fine. I've even tried talking to some people about my depression and they're like "Oh I'm sure it's just a phase, you're so smart!" But I've been wanting to die everyday for the past year. I ODed a few weeks ago but it didnt work (obv) to my intentions and it just ended up being a nuisance (I only took 8 pills of 75mg of Zolaft/Sertraline, on 2nd thought shouldve downed the whole bottle). 

So I guess my question is...how the hell do you fix someone who has so much already? People just can't believe that I could possibly be depressed when I have so much. The craziest thing is that I know I have all these things,and I acknowledge it, and yet I still want nothing more than the sweet release of death. What's wrong with me?
