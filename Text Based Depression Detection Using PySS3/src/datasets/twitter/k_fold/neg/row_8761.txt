I hate my lifeHi. Im 13 and I hate my life for multiple reasons. Firstly, my parent are so overprotective and strict that I cant even breathe without their permission. I cant go to the mall with my friends even when I told them one of them is the head girl and I cant even step outside without an adult. Secondly, usually its home sweet home but home is my least favorite place to be because my parents and siblings are constantly bullying me about my weight when my friends say im skinny(im 143cm and weigh 37kg). And lastly, at school im a happy person, really social and always smiling But then at home, i stay in my room,come out mostly for food(perfect opportunity to tease me) then cry myself to sleep.
