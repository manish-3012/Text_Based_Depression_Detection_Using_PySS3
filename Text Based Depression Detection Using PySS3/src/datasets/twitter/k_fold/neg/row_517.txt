Life is funny.You'll go through life. You'll find happiness and disappointment. You decided some things were better left alone and some things you should have put more effort into. For all the good you could be trying to do, even those who means the most could still only look at the worst parts of you and think you're nothing. No part of life wanted me and i never wanted any other part of it. Im tired of going through everyday. Day and night no matter what I do or try and push myself towards i feel nothing but emptiness. Like a ghost in this world with nothing left to lose. I wont lie I am severely depressed. I can see how worthless my life had to become for others to move forward so easily. They walk away from you only seeing the worst in you when you had only good intentions that turned out the wrong way. I wanted to do more with my life, to be someone who could still have meaning, but it wouldn't be worth it. Nothing could change could it? Im tired. Everyday i imagine the sweet release from the bullshit that is life. From the bullshit people put each other through. What's the point when it really wouldn't make any difference?
