Iâ€™m done.Iâ€™m done. This may be the last time you hear from me. Iâ€™m not interested in reaching out anymore. Iâ€™m criticized for reaching out. I try to open to people but that doesnâ€™t work. So Iâ€™m gonna end this. I have an idea of what I could do, and Iâ€™m gonna try it.... letâ€™s hope it works.  I feel this was a bad idea in the first place. Trying to live. It wonâ€™t work.
