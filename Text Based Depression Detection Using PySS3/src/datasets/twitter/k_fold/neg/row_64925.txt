An Arbitrary Existence, for an Arbitrary Man....Have you ever wanted off a Roller Coaster so bad that you jumped out half way through the ride? A rational question one may ask to this inquiry would be *"If you wanted off the Roller Coaster, why didn't you just do the normal thing and wait until the ride finished? It wouldn't last forever anyways"*
 
That Question is the only reason I've been staving off my ever present urge to kill myself over the years. The rationale behind it is basically, *"No matter how shit life is, you might as well stick around for the ride because you won't stay on forever. And if at the end it's still shit, you'll get what you wanted anyways and die all the same."* Death is inevitable, so why not stick around to see if there's anything good.

Many consider Suicide because they're depressed... some are angry, some are heartbroken or psychotic or hurt... I'm not depressed, I'm not heartbroken, I'm not ego-shattered or disillusioned to the world, I'm not a cliche case of a victim of bullying, I'm not stuck in a dead end job, I'm not overweight, I haven't had a bad life, my family isn't great but it's not the worst in the world... No, Not me. For me, there's just no point. I have no meaningful reason to Live anymore..
 
This all might surprise you coming from a relatively attractive 19 going on 20 year old guy with above average intelligence who has had a well to do Life that grew up in a supportive family and has had a meal in his stomach every night. However, the truth remains. I've lacked a meaningful reason to exist for many years now.
 
Most of my life, I have been a somewhat xenophobic Apathetic Introvert, socially and physically Isolated from any past peers. I have lived in small rooms most my life, rather than the world. I've never had a sexual let alone intimate relationship with another human being (never kissed a girl, had sex, etc..). I've never had a best friend or good friend, only ever temporary acquaintances to pass the time. I can't confide or connect with any human being whatsoever, whether on a casual or deeply intimately personal level. I dropped out of my Junior Year of High School back in December of 2013. I considered *dropping out of Life* around that same time as well but never did. Since then, I've done nothing but linger on doing nothing but living with my mother and watching youtube/playing video games. If not for my mother, I would be homeless. Lastly, Over the years, I have developed mild Agoraphobia. 
 
When I was younger, these things bothered me slightly... but these things honestly don't bother me today *(except for the never had sex part. Who the fuck wants to die a Virgin?)* the most part not so much. I'm just telling you these things to give you a vague Idea of who I am and my situation.

Most people say to 20-something-year-old's "you have your whole life ahead of you" in regards to all of the meaningful things they could do given that they're still young. Well... I don't see many meaningful things to do on the horizon. Here are just a few things common people live for that I would derive no significant purpose to exist from:
 
* Moving out of your mother's house is always a liberating thing to do towards becoming an Independent Adult, but it's a short term goal that only ships you and your problems to a different location where you have to figure them out alone. After all, wherever you go, there you are. However, While my Family isn't the worst in the world, they are very annoying, badgering, and verbally Abusive. Honestly... I just want peace and quiet, and I can't have it living with them. I suppose moving out isn't a reason to live for, but it is something to live long enough to see happen.
 
* Losing your virginity is a basic, short term, right of passage that doesn't really mean anything to anyone but yourself. And it only means something to you if you value losing it and growing up in the first place. So, it would be kind of pathetic that the only reason for me to continue existing would be to lose my V-Card before eating lead. I suppose I still will though, because hey... Dying a virgin would suck ass. I'll probably hire an escort.
 
 
* From the bottom of my heart, I have always hated children. The thing that clicks in Adults brains that make kids seem cute just never clicked in mine. No way in hell I would ever start a family with anyone, let alone have children. Also I'd make a terrible Father, and the world already has 7 and a half Billion people fucking each other, so I don't need to be bred like cattle. Plus, I'm sterile.... so it must be Fate.
 
* As for finding a partner and living solely for them, like I said before, I don't truly connect with other human beings, regardless of gender. Even if I could get a "Significant Other" of any kind in my life, it would be a facade built on lies of false Intimacy and False Empathy. In my eyes a relationship is a pretty small pathetic reason to stay alive devoid of much purpose other than procreation and pleasure, the former I can't physically do and wouldn't if I could, and the latter of which is meaningless to me.
 
* In terms of a job/career/work worth living for, I have always been interested in Science and Mathematics. Always wanting to improve technology and the systems of Human Civilization, if not replace current systems with better ones. I've also always loved space. But the truth is I'm by no means a genius. As I said before, I'm a high school Drop out. I dropped out for stupid reasons like a stupid person would, but I am not stupid either. The point is, I'm only one uneducated young man who wouldn't have a large nor meaningful positive impact on civilization in any way. If I could, I would have a very solid reason to exist and I wouldn't be writing this.
 
* Traveling the world is a big goal and Aspiration for many people. Traveling has been in the nature of Humanity since its origins. I've always wanted to travel and see what's out there in the world... but at the same time it costs more money than I could ever afford, I'm monolingual, I can see all those places for free from my computer without having to deal with people, and after a while I've come to realize that the world is simply the world. It doesn't really matter where you are as long as you are relatively secured, safe, can procreate, and have a reason to exist. I've got the first two down at least..
 
* Like so SO many others, I *could* cling to a Corporate career somewhere in the world and climb the ladder to societies perceived definition of Success, chasing after things I don't really value and becoming another useless unneeded cog in the blind machine of Corporate America... No, I'm pretty sure I'd kill myself before I let it come to that shit.
 
* **MILITARY!!** Ah, the Military. There's always the Good Old Military, where the Jar-heads, Low Lifes, Over Zealous Patriots, Bigshot-High-School-Football-Players, People looking for feed and a stable life, Sociopaths and Warmongering Savages all sign up to become the trouble-making pawns at the mercy of the machinations of governments that don't give a fuck whether they live or burn. I suppose if I'm feeling vindictive I can join and seem how many fuckers in the world I can take down with me before my time comes.... But... Nah, that seems like an empty existence as well. Patriotism is just propaganda for the Ranks as they say... I think I'll just stick to blowing my own brains out instead of chancing the task up to some extremist sand-monkey shouting *"Allahu-Akbar"*.
  
* Then there's the simple **"Pleasure-Life"**, which the majority of humanity and most Lifeforms follow, Where one lets the baser biological drives towards catharsis and ecstasy be their reason to exist. Of course, it eventually leads to addiction *(whatever your Vice may be... booze, pot, hard drugs, gambling, hookers, video games, etc...)*. And although chasing pleasure is natural and the structure of life, Pleasure is only a means to an end in pointing an organism in the right direction to survival. Pleasure is also empty, and to only live for Pleasure would be a Hollow Life. Not only that, but.. Hell... I can't pretend this isn't what I haven't been doing for the past 5 years of my life. I just naturally fell back on it. But truthfully, It practically leaves my eyes glazed over to what I should be doing and thinking about, unable to find clarity of mind. To lack a reason to exist is one thing, but to not even consciously/mentally be you, it's like you don't exist at all.
 
* To top it all off, I am a part of a stupid, violent, egotistical, arrogant, short sighted, warmongering, cowardly, fearful, basic-pleasure-driven species that is destined for Self Destruction anyways. Humanity. Where the corrupt and rich flourish and exist mostly for pleasure on the backs of the majority of everyone else. Where there is War and Religion and Genocide and Torture and Rape and peace for a little while when we get bored of it all, then MORE War and More Genodice, etc...
 
Such a small percentage of Humanity is actually greatly intelligent and turning the wheels Progress. At least 90% of our species is as described above and is freeloading off of the small amount of intelligent people in the world. Knowing this, I'm not sure if I'd want to be in either general category.

So, as a quick recap:
 
Pleasure and Pain are meaningless, I hate children and am sterile, I don't connect well with people let alone intimately, I can't largely contribute to civilization in a positive way, Fuck Corporate America, Fuck the Military and War, Fuck Government, and Fuck Humanity for existing as the disgusting thing it is and the Atrocities it commits.
 
I'm up at night right now writing this article at nearly 5am on an early Saturday morning. I'm writing this because I'm having an existential crisis. I'm having an existential crisis because my mother can't afford for me to freeload off her anymore *(which means I'll have to move out soon and get a job)*, and because my brother passed away yesterday from a sudden heart attack. He was only 17, he was my only brother, and my only friend.
 
___
So... I'm Sitting here here in my chair typing the end of this article, unemployed with no sources of income, a virgin, uneducated with no way into college, a high school drop out, living off of his mother that takes care of children for a living *(Somehow I forgot to mention that she takes care of children, the things I hate..)*, Without a Car, Without a License, and Brotherless... Living an Arbitrary Life with no purpose, reason, or Desire to Live any more *(beyond instinct)*... and I can't stop asking myself...
___
Should I really stay on this pointless Roller Coaster till' the End? Or should I take the quick way off..
 
Either way... before anything happens the game plan is as follows: 
1.) Get Laid with a really hot girl.
 
2.) Move out of my Mother's House.
 
3.) Continue to Linger on in Life, or have the dignity to Eat Lead in **My OWN House.**
