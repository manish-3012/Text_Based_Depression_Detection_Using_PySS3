I dreamt about ending everythingTwo nights ago I had a dream. I was a normal day in my life. I came back from lecture to home and there was my father. He is an abuse person and had treated me like shit since I have memory. It was the same situation here. He started yelling me and i ran into my room. I started crying like each time this happens. 
The hours passed and when I got the courage to get out of there, I walked to the balcony and saw the sky. It was beautiful and then, right in time I made my decision.
My dream ended with me hanging myself. 
When I woke up that morning no one was at home. I didn't feel scared. I kinda feel release. 
Maybe this was what I need to finally kill myself. I can't visualize a future to me, I started consuming opioids. I'm only happy when I'm on drugs. I don't care about getting my medical license. I can't feel nothing but sadness.
