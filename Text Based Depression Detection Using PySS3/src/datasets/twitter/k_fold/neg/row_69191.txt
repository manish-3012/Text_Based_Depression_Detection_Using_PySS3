Welp, everythings gone to shit just nowFought with the folks again a few minuttes ago. Girlfriend doesn't love me and is now ignoring me ( imean i wouldn't love me too). I have no one to support me mentally and emotioanlly. I've had this noose in my drawer for months now from my last suicide attempt around october/november-ish and well, now seems like the time to get ol'noosey here and do it. But i'm scared. How do i overcome fear?
