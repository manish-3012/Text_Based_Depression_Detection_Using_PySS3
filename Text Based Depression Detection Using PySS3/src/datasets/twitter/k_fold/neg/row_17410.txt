Ok, I need coping skills. I'm precipitously close to hanging myself.This is something of a desperate last resort for help. I have 'major depressive disorder'. Brief history- I'm 33, struggled alone with suicidal ideation and depression since I was about 9. I attempted suicide by hanging at 29, and again a year later. I had a perfectly normal upbringing. I have two undergraduate degrees, a long term SO, very supportive family, house etc- I am very lucky, privilaged, many friends. I feel a tremendous sense of guilt and I am fully aware that there are many people here in a much worse situation than me who will rightfully regard me as undeserving of any attention. I have had intense psychiatric support, and I am on a smorgasbord of medication. However- I feel utterly, unremittingly suicidal. The only respite is when I drink, and this is something my doctor has strictly forbidden, as roughly 1 time in 10 it results in a quasi-psychotic response in which I am singleminded in ending my life- and I know human anatomy and physiology in great detail, certainly enough to make a very good job of ending my life. I know I shouldn't drink, but the mental torture is such that I feel I simply *have* to, and take the dice roll as to whether I will feel much better, or end up in psychiatric hospital, wasting the time of many skilled professionals, who's time could be better spent on other people. If i am honest with my doctor about my drinking, she will lock me up in a secure ward. I don't know what to do. I can't see this ending in any way other than suicide, or ECT- I would rather die than subject myself to ECT.
