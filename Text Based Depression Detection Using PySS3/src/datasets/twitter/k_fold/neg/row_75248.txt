to be or to jumpi told myself I'm gonna drive to the highest bridge tomorrow and jump, everything is planned, the only thing holding me back is that I'm not 100% sure the jump is gonna be lethal. I did some research and a study claims that falling from 46 meters (150 feet) or more is very likely to be lethal, up to 98%. the bridge im going to is more than twice this height yet I'm still not convinced I will die. 
I have literally nothing else holding me back there is absolutely nothing that would stop me other than this feeling that it won't kill me, I have to make a decision now and I don't feel like I can do it on my own, can anyone of you "reassure" me and tell me that there's nothing wrong with doing it and that it will kill me, or convince me to stay somehow
