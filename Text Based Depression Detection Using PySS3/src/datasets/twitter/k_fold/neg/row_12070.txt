What are your reasons to keep living?I'm afraid of everything. I have some stomach issues, and although they truly wouldn't run my life if I weren't such a scared bitch all the time, but I am. I'm a hypochondriac, and have panic attacks all the time because of dumb things. I'm also socially awkward and anxious, stopping me from making good friends/getting a girlfriend. Even with those things, I know I'm living a fantastic life as compared to someone with true mental disorders, or living in a third world country etc. 
But why put up with it? We'll all end up dead, either ashes in a jar, or a body in a box 6 feet under. I guess I'd like to see how my life turns out, but I'm so afraid of the road ahead I can't stand it. 
I guess that's all a bit off topic though, although I'm not directly suicidal I just want to ask you, what are your reasons to continue living? Whats so damn great about life that you'd like to force yourself through the hardships that are inevitable in every person's life.
Is it survival? Is there something you want to complete? What about when you've reached your goal, would you be willing to die then?
I'd love to experience dating a girl, and having them truly enjoy my company, but does it really matter? It may or may not happen, but even when it does I doubt I will be completely happy. Humans in nature always want more, we couldn't possibly be happy with something forever. 
List some of your reasons please.
