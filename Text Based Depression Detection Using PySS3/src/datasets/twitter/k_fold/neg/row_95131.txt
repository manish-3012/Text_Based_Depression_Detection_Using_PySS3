I need helpI have been really stressed out lately because of school, exams etc.
Iâ€™ve tried to talk to people about it but they donâ€™t care. My friends, if you could call them that are constantly making fun of me because of what I like or do, and I feel like every time Iâ€™m not in war shot they talk about me negatively.
I also have a really bad habit of comparing myself to other people, and often deduct that theyâ€™re better than me. 
Iâ€™m sick and tired of just not being able to talk about things on my mind. Iâ€™m usually a quiet person because Iâ€™m shy and have trouble making conversation with people.
Iâ€™m alright at most of my subjects, but every time I have an assessment on them, I have a breakdown and stress out.
I have had some dark thoughts lately.
I donâ€™t want to act on them, but every day I feel closer to the edge.
