Everything hurtsI made a reddit account to post this. On mobile so sorry if itâ€™s formatted weird. 

Every morning my first thought is â€œI can make the world a better place by not being in itâ€. It hurts to do anything, my asthma is getting worse, my shoulders hurt and Iâ€™ve gained more then 4stone in a year. I canâ€™t look in a mirror without wanting to throw up, I cut and binge until I feel like Iâ€™ll throw up then feel bad and do it all over again. 

Iâ€™ve tried meds but nothing is working. I told work that Iâ€™m getting treatment for depression and I thought my manager understand but today she made it clear to me that she doesnâ€™t. I keep fucking up at my job and Iâ€™ve had â€œtalksâ€ about my performance. No matter how hard I try I keep making mistakes like this morning I slept through my alarms (yes multiple) because my meds make me drowsy but if I donâ€™t take them I canâ€™t function durning the day. 

â€œYou can either do this job or you canâ€™tâ€ is what was said to me this morning after I asked for help at work. During this my mother has been fighting advanced cancer and my visa (not in my birth country I have moved overseas) ended causing me a lot of stress. 

Iâ€™ve written a note, I keep thinking of how to stop it all and researching how to make sure I do it right. Iâ€™m scared to sleep in case I miss work again and get fired because I really think that will be it for me. Iâ€™m sorry to bother everyone but I really donâ€™t know what to do. 

I just want it to stop.
