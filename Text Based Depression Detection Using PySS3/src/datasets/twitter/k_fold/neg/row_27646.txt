I want to kill myself tonight, but I'm too much of a coward. Which just makes me hate myself more.I have GAD and depression and have been struggling with these for multiple years now. I finally sought help and am on Zoloft for the anxiety. I've felt better at times but recently with my girlfriend out of the country, school starting up again, and work the stress has been tearing me apart. The whole day today I've been in pain and severe discomfort resulting from anxiety and a lot of a self hate. Tonight I am back at school early and no one else is around and I just feel like it would be so easy to end it all right now. I've already texted my girlfriend saying I want to kill myself and that its not her fault and written a note to my family. I've been out to the balcony of the 10th floor where I live and looked out but I've given up every time. I don't honestly know why I'm posting on here, I've never done it before but I just need to tell someone about what I want to do. If you read this at all I appreciate that alone.
