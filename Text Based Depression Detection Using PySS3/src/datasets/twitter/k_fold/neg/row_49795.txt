The hardest part...... for me is wanting to say goodbye to few friends and family but not have them feel hurt or angry at you for wanting to leave. I hate when they tell me things will get better and not to â€œdo anything stupidâ€ why is it stupid that I want peace? I canâ€™t even tell a mental health professional how I feel cause theyâ€™ll just lock me up for â€œbeing crazy or suicidalâ€ wish I donâ€™t care about any of them. At least it would be easier.
