No, I won't be turning 20 in 2020. I already have pills to end it.My life has always been crap. Constant abuse by my parents who think they are better than everyone else. No friends, just toxic bullies who hang around me for gossip. Constant moves.

My older siblings were my only friends growing up. My sister died in a car accident when I was 10, and my brother moved out and got married when I was 16.

My dad died from a heart attack when I was 15. My mom hated him and started doing everything she always wanted like drugs and gambling when he was gone. She had a baby at 47 and he almost died several times due to her abuse and negligence. My baby brother is going deaf, is scared of everything, and is very delayed in speech. My mom acts like she is the best mother ever who could have no flaws, but CPS ended up taking my baby brother away when she attempted suicide. He's living with my older brother now whose own baby is due in a month.

My mom openly gives herself shots of drugs that make her go crazy. She shouts at me constantly. She takes alcohol, cough medicine, and anxiety meds together to come off the drugs and basically just goes into a coma for a day. She doesn't manage her diabetes. She doesn't go to the doctor because she tells her not to smoke and do drugs.

I wanted to get a degree in medicine, but I dropped out after one semester to check myself into a psych ward. They did nothing for me by the way, and I probably won't get back the scholarship I had. My brother says to leave and go live with him, but then our mom will just die. 

I'm ready to just end it. I refuse to live to see my mother die even if she is Satan. I have a life insurance policy for my brothers, so they will get something out of it at least.

I have the pills I need. I'll just go to a remote location so nobody I know finds the corpse.
