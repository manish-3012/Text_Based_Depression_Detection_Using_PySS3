I feel awful.I can't seem to shake off the thoughts that make me wanna die.

Life's been going downhill since the moment I turned 16. I decided not to open up about my feelings anymore 'cause figuring out nobody cared. Nobody gave a fuck about how I truly felt. And now i'm literally on the edge. I've been struggling for so many fucking years and i'm so tired. So tired you have no idea i'm so frustrated I just want a way out. Now.

Nobody has been around or even bother talking. I've tried, but everyone always seems to want to cut the convo off as soon as it starts. So i've given up on it. Slowly the person I thought would be there forever til the very end, turns away and I can't help but think of how close we were. 

5 fucking years of this bullshit and i'm just so tired and I want out.
