Just needing a little boostI am going through a divorce, I'm staying with my mom, and I just got a new job to start on Monday. I have a beautiful daughter. I'm miserable. I work so hard doing the maintenance on my mom's house which can feel like a full time job. I'm more than happy to help. She has started treating me badly. She favors my brothers and I have no place to go. I love my mom to pieces but after a bad time growing up and constant put downs I'm starting to think just ending it would be the easiest thing to do. She's always sorry after she hurts me but I've been through so much and I'm feeling so tired. I love my daughter but maybe she would be better off without me. Anyone know how to help? I don't think I'll last much longer.
