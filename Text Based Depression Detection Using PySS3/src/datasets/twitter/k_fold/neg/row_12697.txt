Can tonight please be the night I die of a freak accidentI'm tired of waiting and trying all these therapists, psychiatrists, medications, etc. I'm tired of calling the suicide hotline only to be put in an even worse mood after. I'm tired of having literally no one to be with physically. I'm tired of longing for some kind of human compassion. I'm tired of going outside when cops are out there on the off chance they'd stop to ask me questions just so someone talks to me. I'm tired of wanting to eat as a way to cope with my depression, then feel too sick to eat any food given to me and end up wasting it. I'm tired of feeling exhausted from the moment I wake up to the moment I lay down because of no other reason than my medication, although I have to take it to feel "normal" yet I still feel just as shitty, maybe a little more numb. I'm tired of trying and receiving fake happiness only for the sadness to come back shortly after. I'm tired of being optimistic about everything especially when someone talks to me because I'm way too clingy and attach myself to someone who shows any kind compassion for me. I'm tired of being on the verge of crying but never actually being able to which results in all this shit building up and having no way to release it. I'm fucking tired and I want to fucking die already but don't have the fucking balls to kill myself.
