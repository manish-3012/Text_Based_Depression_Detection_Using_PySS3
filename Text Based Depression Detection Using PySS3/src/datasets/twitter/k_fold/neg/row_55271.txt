Wish I could just end the years of suffering already.I stopped showing up to class... Again. Looks like that's another 8k of student debt with nothing to show for it (yay. This is my 3rd attempt at college in 4 years) 

Last night I didn't go because the night before I got drunk and stabbed myself in the thighs. I stayed in bed all day cuz I couldn't walk.

Apparently I called my mom at 4 am and asked her to pick me up and take me home. I wanna go home but that's nowhere. Apparently my voice was that of a small child and I have no memory of doing it. So not only am I suicidal but I'm a weird blackout drunk as well.

I'm so tired of dealing with this. I know I need more "help" but I can't stand another day month or year feeling like this way. I can't talk to anyone because being depressed and suicidal gets redundant after awhile, you know.
