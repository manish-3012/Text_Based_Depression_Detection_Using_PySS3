Increasingly seems logicalCompared to some people here I have no great tragedy or angst, but I'm just increasingly bored of life.

I think my life peaked a few years ago. Not even a high peak, as objectively I was a bit of a failure, but I tried to follow my dream in illustration and animation, which resulted in me falling out of love with one time interest.

That idea about, if you do something you love it doesn't feel like work, nah, it just made me so loving what I did.

Now I'm just plodding through life. No ambition or real passion. No dependents, thank God, no S.O.

So I don't really have anything left. There's a quote I like: Life is an ocean of ennui and past the age of 30 land is seldom seen. 

It's just so true, and approaching 40 all I see is water.

Might be a good point to cash out
