I so badly want to die.But I can't leave my kids. I just had to have children didn't I? I'm a shit father, and a shit husband. I'm nothing and I'll never be anything more than nothing. 30 years of wasted resources on me. I don't deserve anything good or happy. I suppose all of can do is hope to die of natural causes sooner rather than later.
