April 6th demotivated and deactivatedIts not that im lazy, i genuinely dont care anymore. I dont care about grades, my well-being, my life
I used to be an almost straight A student and now im dipping lower and lower

I dont enjoy studying bio (which used to be my favorite working-related thing to do) and i dont enjoy video games. I have so much homework and an essay due tomorrow, but i just dont care about it at all.

I keep having mental breakdowns in class, and i cant pay attention, and i dont fucking care to learn trigonometric graphs and equations

Me being bipolar doesnt help, i can be motivatdd to work, but in a minute i just dont see the point of doing all this and stop

Ive had a record amount of times of wanting to kill myself, for most of the school day ive been dreaming of killing myself. While walking home, when cars would drive in front of me, passing by, i had a strong urge to put my head under the tires and end it. Everytime i see a truck thats all i think

I joked around with my friends saying im going to kill myself tonight, and they didnt say anything, tinking im joking. I was semi-joking, but i genuinely want to die. I want to have something available at the ready so when the timr comes, ill do it. 

I dont know how much longer i can do these journals, i promised myself if i would do something daily, it would be this, and i wanted to dtop after the third day. But honestly, i think the only reason i  would stop making journals is if i kill myself
