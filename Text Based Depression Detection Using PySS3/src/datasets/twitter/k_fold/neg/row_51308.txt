I don't want to get betterI just don't want anything. I don't want life. I don't want all the bad feelings. I don't want the good feelings. I can't do this anymore. I'm so tired. No one loves me. No one ever will. The one person I thought did truly love me didn't and doesn't now. I'm so done with all this shit. I'm so done with waiting to die. Just get it over with, life. Just fucking kill me already.
