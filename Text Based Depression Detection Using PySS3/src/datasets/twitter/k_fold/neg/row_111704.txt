pls help meEverday i feel like jumping off a roof or drowning my pathetic useless self. i feel so worthless and i have thoughts of suicide everyday because it feels like the most easiest option to escape all this. 

The worst part of this is that no one knows or understands the problems i have and assume i am just boring  but i am definitely not. thus i appear lifeless and boring when im actually dying inside and have no energy to show people my true character.

pls give me a reason to live.
