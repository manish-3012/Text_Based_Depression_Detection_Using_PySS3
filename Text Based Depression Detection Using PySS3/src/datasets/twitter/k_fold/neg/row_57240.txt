Can someone actually give me one good reason not to kill myself other than "it'll upset your family?"I get no joy out of the world, every day is non stop torment, I'm a terrible person with no good qualities and a shit load of bad ones. I've hurt a lot of people. I'm honestly no good for anyone or anything. I'm seriously considering killing myself tonight. I thought about it extensively yesterday too. Anyone have even 1 reason I should keep trying?
