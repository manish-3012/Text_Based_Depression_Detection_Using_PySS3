It's over!  Just found out today -- I'm HIV+.  

I had a bad break up ~ 3 months ago, and went a little bit nuts.  Dangerous, risky, promiscuous behavior -- well, my death wish came true!  Such a lucky man!  

I'm 26 years old.  Now what?  What kind of quality of life can I expect?  The only thing I really enjoyed was powerlifting.  I can just see myself in a few years time -- emaciated, 155 pounds, stressed immune system, beset by fatigue/chronic pain, cognitive decline...

Oh, and I never came out to my parents, siblings, only out to one of my friends...an old joke from the early days of the AIDS epidemic, right -- *What's the hardest part about having AIDS?  Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian*...ha!  Great.

Still alone, of course.  I really, really want to die.  I see my suicide as a return to the negative bliss of non-existence.  I can't live in this hell.
