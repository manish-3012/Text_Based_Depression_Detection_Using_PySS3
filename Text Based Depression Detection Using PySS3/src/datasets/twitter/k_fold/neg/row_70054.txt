Having a psychotic Break was the best thing that happened to me.For most of my life, I operated on a high-low basis. 
Manic me would act out physically, emotionally, impulsively, manipulatively. 
Then I would sink to the lowest of lows a few months later. I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't shower or take care of my basic needs. I had convinced myself that I was unworthy. 

When I was manic, I powered through the thoughts of self-worth. I was surprised when people wanted to be around me. I clung to any semblance of acceptance I could.  I would manipulate situations for my benefit, then feel like shit when a depressive episode came along. 
It took the millionth suicidal intention, mixed with a manic phase, to urge me to check into the institution. My insurance doesn't cover mental health, but I knew I wouldn't last the day if I didn't.
My best friend ended our relationship after 10 years on the way to the hospital over text. 
A medication I was prescribed earlier this year wasn't working for me, instead of muffling depression, it brought me to suicide. To knowing how I would do it. To planning when it would happen. 
I rose above the water I had drowning in for about an hour in the morning and knew it was time. 
I am on better medication, a mood stabilizer, and it has given my life back. I am still working through the fallout, but I finally have hope. I am reaching out to friends I haven't spoken to in years, talking with strangers on the internet, going to the movies by myself. Enjoying, instead of fearing, time by myself. 
I can trust myself again. 
I am more happy and more confident than ever. There is hope, guys. And I am proud of you all for being here. If you need someone to talk to, know that I am here.
