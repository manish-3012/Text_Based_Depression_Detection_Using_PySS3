I tried but I guess it was already too late. I'm literally on the brink of ending my life.So the issues will never be resolved. I'll never be worth it and I'll never be worth anyone's time. And I've recently come to realize that I don't deserve a life any more. You might talk to me, comfort me, etc.. But in the end, no matter how much you can try, you won't like me for who I am.. You'll like me for everything that barely begins to explain the real me. I nearly cried in three different places.  Everybody thinks they are like me.. and they judge me as if I was like them.. but they are completely wrong.. I'm not like them and I have never been like them.. Nobody will ever fully understand me.. and nobody will realize that I'm always overwhelmed and I can hardly function in proper ways on my own.. and I don't want to hear any more that I should love myself first.. After I've been taught for two decades that other people are supposed to love me, but they show it by hurting me. And then they try to mess with my mind and try to convince me that I hurt them. And sometimes they are so good at it, that I believe them.. but I stop when I remember the cruel things that they did to me when I was a child.. But it probably won't matter soon what I think anyway.. I have a method now.. and even if I used it, I might think in that final moment.. I finally did it.. And I'll probably have epiphanies of ways that I could have changed it.. unfortunately, I may not have enough time to think of them and I wouldn't think of them unless I actually used the method anyway... Now I'm just waiting for someone or something to deliver the final blow... then everybody will be at peace and I'll never have to worry about the past and the facts... and I'll never have to worry about how i'll never be able to fix anything...
