Sitting next to a cliff right nowI'm feeling pretty shitty right now, writing this on my cellphone. My parents just had a huge argument about divorce so my brother and I left the house and went separate ways. I went to a trail to go for a walk, and now I'm on a cliff above the ocean. I don't think there's anything after death, and I have some good friends, but I just don't feel like I'm there anymore, I'm not sure if all do it (typing this is proof of that), and I know it's a waste and everything and it'd hurt a lot of people, but I kind of just want everyone to realize who I was, and maybe my death would actually make my parents be better people, and my dad would be nicer to my brother, but I also don't really want to die, since, well, dying sucks. So I'm not really sure where to go from here. Again, I doubt I'll do it, but it seems so plausible right now.
