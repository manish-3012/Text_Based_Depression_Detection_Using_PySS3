Being Disowned is a incurable curse.Being Disowned is a incurable curse.

My religious family disowned me for not believing in God anymore when I was 9 and lived with foster families until I was 18. As a 26 year old man, I've been struggling hard with my emotional pain. I suffer from these problems:

* Morbid Obesity (&gt;520 lbs)

* Intermittent Explosive Disorder

* Depression

* Dysthymia

* Sleep Apnea

* Sleepwalking

* Nightmares and Night Terrors

* Parasomnia

* Oppositional Defiant Disorder

* Suicide Ideation

I live with a wonderful girlfriend, a kind and helpful lady. Also with 2 sweet dogs (Pekingese and Maltese Pug mix). I help my girlfriend with her college homework often. I have very few friends, mainly because I am misanthropic. I find the world to be a horrible place from my point of view and experiences. I find religion to be a web of lies with no evidence to prove any of its assertions. I believe that living in the lie that is religion is nonsensical and attributing ALL of your fortunate experiences to God is the most ridiculous concept I have ever seen. I have read the Bible cover to cover at least 4 times.

Being kicked out of my home has been deeply traumatizing for me. Every time I get reminded of the concept of a loving family, it hurts very much. I wish I had a family that loved me. My foster parents never truly loved me. They were distant at best. The only person I have contact with who is actually related to me is a brother of mine. He is the only one who ever loved me after I came out as atheist to my family. We talk to each other occasionally. We see each other roughly once a year. He believes in the family religion (Fundamentalist Christian). Including him I have 3 brothers and 3 sisters. (I was the third oldest sibling and he is the third youngest (fourth oldest). Him and my girlfriend are the only people I truly love.

On March of this year, a man with a Five Guys uniform told me in CVS, while I was looking for a new ankle brace (broken right ankle from Decemeber, surgically repaired), that â€œGod will help you healâ€ after noticing my Air casted leg. This angered me because I really donâ€™t like how God gets the credit for all positive things and I started arguing with him. This went for a good 10 minutes until I made the mistake of bringing up my family and eventually he made the claim that my disownment was my fault. This shocked me to my core so much that after telling off the Five Guys man with hateful, profane loaded insults, I started feeling incredibly angry, depressed, and in some of the most emotional pain Iâ€™ve ever had. I spent a few days contemplating suicide. I have actually had issues of suicidal ideation in the past, but this is the worst case of it to date. I told my girlfriend about this: she responded that he was wrong because he does not know me and to ignore what he said. She reassured that my family that kicked me out donâ€™t deserve me and how much she loved being with me.

I started calling and texting suicide hotline to feel better and they were able to calm me down for fe more days. I was told how strong I was for coming out and reaching out to them. They seemed supportive and caring for me. But between support from my girlfriend and the suicide hotline, it wasnâ€™t enough. Evcentually on March 13th, I tried to kill myself by stabbing my left arm and trying to get me to bleed to death.  I actually cut myself a lot, but most of my cuts were just small thin incisions that only made me bleed small amounts or were just scratches that did not bleed at all. One cut was a little more deep of a laceration, though. I was bleeding the most from there. I was hoping to kill myself before my girlfriend came back from college. My girlfriend came back and walked in to see me cutting myself and called 911. This prompted me to attempt to slit my throat instead. Only scratches and thin incisions happened before my girlfriend came back in with a neighbor, who restrained me long enough for the hospital come.

I was taken to the hospital and I had 7 stitches to close my largest cut and bandaged everything else. After that I was brought to a mental hospital and had to stay there for a few days. Friends visited me, I talked to my brother over the phone, and my girlfriend was able to find the man who argued with me over God and he brought me food and apologized for everything. He did not think his words would make me want to kill myself.  I told him about how words can hurt and he needs to be careful on how he uses them, specifically not hurt others too much. I also apologized for lots of things, specifically how I treated him. We made up.

Iâ€™ve been feeling better ever since up until last week when I watched some movie that was on cable which went on about the importance of family, which brought me to tears (in a depressing way). I talked to my girlfriend again about this and she kept telling how my old family was in the past and to look into the future. She also expressed how much she didnâ€™t want me to kill myself again and to hang on for her sake.

I have been talking the hotlines, as well. Same message as before. Never felt this consistent in wanting to end my life since the incident in March. I had nightmare flashbacks. Last Sunday I contemplated plans of killing myself and making it look like an accident. Or trying to drown myself in a beach, or trying inflict some infections or things like that. I picke4d up a knife to stab myself, but dropped it before I can do any damage. Today I feel good and donâ€™t want to die, but tomorrow I might be attempting to drink bleach or something.

Once your own family leaves you behind over religion, You will never be mentally the same.
