My father started drinking again and I can't take it anymore.My father is an alcoholic. At least once every year he just starts drinking and turns mine and my moms life into a living hell. I feel so stressed because I know this is gonna go on for at least a few months, and there is nothing I can do. I just feel so stressed because this combined with school getting harder and more stressful makes me just want to kill myself. And the worst thing is, I know that even if in a few months he stops, it's gonna keep happening again and again because he's an addict. He went through several rehabs and they never work. My mom isn't going to divorce him because she doesn't want to, despite him doing so many terrible things to us. I've been laying in bed for hours not being able to sleep, and too lazy to do anything. I feel so powerless I just want to end my life.
