I've scheduled my euthanasia for my 40th birthday in 5 yearsI've been suicidal since I was 13, but at age 35, I still feel suicidal despite all the attempts to feel otherwise. And trying almost everything psychiatry has to offer. And even when something was moderately helpful, it gave me side effects like migraine that in itself made me wanna die. I still have migraines without such medication though less often. And also a bad fatigue despite jogging 4 miles a day to keep it away.

I don't want to be rash, because I still have hope that a breakthrough medicine will help me. Like rapastinel, in whose clinical trial I am hoping to enroll soon https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapastinel

I will try every psychiatrist and psychologist I could find. But if I would still feel the same I do now, I have my death scheduled in 5 years. Which is saddening, but I suppose also liberating.

I hope I can cancel it, or at least postpone it for another decade or two. But status quo is not acceptable to me, I have to figure something out to alieveate my mental anguish. And I will try. Nothing can focus my mind as much as having my death on the horizons - in 2023. Long enough to give me a chance to avert it, but short enough to feel its chills.
