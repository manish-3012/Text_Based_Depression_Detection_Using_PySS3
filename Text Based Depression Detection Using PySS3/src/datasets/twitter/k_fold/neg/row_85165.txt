Exhausted 21mI have a million thoughts racing through my head right now, none of which seem to connect to anything tangible or sensible. I guess I'm seeking some kind of catharsis by writing shit out like this, not really getting anywhere with it though. I feel ugly, in every sense of the word. I have no one I can speak to about any of this. Everything and everyone that has ever held some semblance of meaning to me has left me. If Hell is the absence of God, then what is the presence of the Devil?
