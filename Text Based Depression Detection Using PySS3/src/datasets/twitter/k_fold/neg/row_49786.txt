Help me PT.2I posted here once before. I told you all I was going to end it, but I'm obviously too much of a bitch to do anything. Last time I posted here a 30yo guy (I'm 20) tried flirting with me, used my vulnerable state to try and get with me. 
One of my problems I have with myself is I am super self-conscious. So imagine how I felt when someone I thought was trying to talk me down from this just used it to flirt. 

Well here I am again SW. I wrote in a journal for two weeks talking about the different reasons why I'm killing myself. I'm finally going to go through with it today. I have a therapy appointment at 3pm and then afterwards I am driving to a lake, and jumping in with weights tied around my feet. I don't want to live anymore. I am a failure. Everyone in my life hates me. They would not care if I died. Especially my boyfriend. 


My boyfriend said to me yesterday, "I love you but it is so clear we are not meant together" and then said never mind. He keeps saying we are not meant to be together, and blames all of our problems on me. Because I am the complacent half of the relationship. I am the person everyone takes advantage of me. I am a piece of shit that only has a couple of hours left. 

I told my mom I wanted to hill myself and she said to me "You keep saying you want to do that, but you haven't done anything yet. Don't be like the boy who cried wolf" see? Even she doesn't care if I go. 
So, goodbye SW. You guys helped me stay alive a little longer, but now your efforts have gone to waste.
