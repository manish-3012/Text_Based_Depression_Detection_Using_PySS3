What can I say?Every time I start writing one of these, I find that one topic leads into another. There are so so so so so so so many things that have gone wrong and so many things that make me angry. I am utterly trapped. There is no place for me to go and nowhere for me to scream. There is nothing I can do and I can't escape. Social media is a fucking parasite on our society. I want to be loved, but I am just not. Half of the time, I myself feel worthless and unlovable. I am a helpless animal in a cage and there is nothing I can do to escape. Nothing at all.
