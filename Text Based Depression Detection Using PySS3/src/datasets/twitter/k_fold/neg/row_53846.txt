Hey, all of you feeling down, help me out at least?So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for two years, started sophomore year. We are freshman in college now, at separate colleges. She goes to the only school in our state with her major (what she loves) and I go to the only school in my state that has my major with my specific focus on psychology. So we both really want to go to our own schools but she can't afford mine (nor would I want her to give up what she loves) and I don't want to attend hers cause it will get me nowhere. When I say we should make it work at different schools she says that she will break up with me and she wants to kill herself. It has made me stay with her. How/what do I say, Reddit? I need you big time on this one. Her terrible outlook is even causing me to be sad day to day. Im such a happy guy! I can be happy with nothing, but my education and future are what i really want.

 P.S. we're an hour away and I see her every two weeks for the weekend and on breaks.
