I'm going to do it by the time I'm 25I absolutely despise being alive. I've had crippling depression and anxiety for over 8 years now. I'm 24. A third of my life has been a fucking disaster. I had to drop out of college (english college, the step before university) 3 times cause I couldn't cope with anything. I eventually passed 4th time round and got really good grades - got in to a really good university for Mental Health nursing (really wanted to help people who feel like this, i wish nobody experienced any type MH issue). 

I lasted 6 months at uni. By the end, I hadn't left my dorm room for 2 weeks and hadn't eaten for 5 of those days. I came home late January this year then got a job in March. I had to come and live with my mum and stepdad. Stepdad emotionally abuses my mum, but every time I've tried to stick up for her she's taken  his side cause he's a fucking evil manipulative cunt. 
But yeah I've had another breakdown and it looks like I'm gonna have to leave this new job too. (Same thing happened 4 years ago in a different job, had a panic attack talking to a customer and collapsed).

Like what the fuck is the point in me being alive? I contribute nothing to anyone or anything. I absolutely hate myself so I find it impossible to want to better myself since I have 0 respect for myself. I fail at everything I do (bar one college course). It's got to the point where nothing interests me. 

I've been thinking about killing myself every day for about 3 weeks. It wont go away. It doesn't even worry me or set my anxiety off, it feels like I'm just planning a little trip or something. 

Apologies for the essay, just wanted to air some shit since I'm not burdening my friends with this for the 1000th time.
