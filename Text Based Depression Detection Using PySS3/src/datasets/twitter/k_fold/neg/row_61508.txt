Completely alone this weekend for the first time in forever and I keep thinking about it.I'm not going to do it. I still have pets to take care of. But it's in the back of my head. This weekend my parents have gone out of town for whatever reason, and my boyfriend is on a trip with his family. I'm completely alone. The only exception being my dogs. It's tempting to daydream about it.
