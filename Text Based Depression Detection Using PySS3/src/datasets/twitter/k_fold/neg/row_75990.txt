I feel like Iâ€™m in animated suspension.Iâ€™ve been struggling with GAD, MDD and Severe Panic Disorder for the 9 years. The first two were only diagnosed 5 years ago, the third only 6 months ago. Iâ€™ve considered suicide too many times to count, and have attempted a small handful of times, none successful enough to hospitalize me. I was 13 then. Iâ€™m 22 now. 

I finally have a good, full time day job working for the province. My family is steadier on their feet and understand mental illness better. There even a boy who seems to like me for me and cares about me. 

So why do I still sit here at night pondering why Iâ€™m still alive? Why do I still hate myself when I look in the mirror, why do I feel so useless and such a waste of space? Why do I feel like I have no purpose? And if I do, why canâ€™t I find it? I feel like Iâ€™m in suspended animation. Iâ€™m drowning, but the image of me drowning has been paused. How long until itâ€™s un-paused and Iâ€™m drowning again? How do I get out when Iâ€™m stuck in the animation? Iâ€™m so lost and confused. I know better than to want to harm myself but itâ€™s the only feeling I can identify at this point. Thank you for listening to my rant, fellow redditors. If you have any advice I am all ears.
