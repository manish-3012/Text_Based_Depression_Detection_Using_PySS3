No interest in hobbies.I just don't care, it doesn't matter.

I try to do activities I liked, that I cared about. The interest never stays. Why am I doing this? I don't care about it, it's not fun. I shouldn't have to force myself to draw, to read, to do something other than look at pictures of cats on the internet. I just can't make myself happy.

Get out, do something, meet people. Rely on people to make myself happy? Because that works out well, I've tried that. I realize I need to make myself happy before anything else. I just have no interest in my hobbies. I'm excited about them as much as watching paint dry.

I've been getting out, doing activities around campus. I'm still relying on people to be happy. I'm trying not to. I need to do my own thing, but I just don't care. I still do things, but the pleasure just never lasts.

I don't care about my classes. I get up, I go to class, do my homework, and that's it. I do just enough to not get fail and get kicked out. All I care about is having a roof over my head and money for food.

Money. I need a job. How the hell can I hold down a job while going to school full-time, and wanting to throw myself in front of a bus while I'm at it?

I just want to do fun things again, and have fun doing them. That's it.
