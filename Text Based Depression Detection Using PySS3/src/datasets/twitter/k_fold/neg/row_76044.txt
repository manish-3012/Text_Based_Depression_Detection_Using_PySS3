Why Should I Keep Just Existing?I've dealt with depression and suicide since I was a teen since I've been ill and in chronic pain since I was 10 (I'm 30 next month). I can't work, can't drive, gets out of the house maybe 2-3 times in an entire year. I was homeschooled so I have no friends in RL and I'm also non-binary/like girls and my parents, specifically my bitch mother, hates me and says I'm evil and going to hell. I don't really care, but my life is just existing and it will never change. I'm fucked in the head thanks to all the shit I've suffered from people who don't understand and have shown no sympathy or wanted to help. I think I'm nothing and not worth it, but I have no idea why I'm still here.



I thought I wanted or needed to be in a relationship, but I can't handle hearing the words "I love you" nor say it. I'm bored with everything, been trying to force myself, but I just get angry or throw fits. I'm in lots of pain 24/7, have trouble sleeping, no doctors will help me, can't get pain meds, so what's the point? People don't like me because of my mood issues, because I'm weird, different, and don't even feel like I'm human. Sometimes I say things, but then later change it. I get dominated between pure emotion to pure logic so it's like I'm two people and this just confuses and frustrates other people.



I've tried like everything to fix or manage my problems. I went to dozens of doctors, I tried therapy, reading help books, various meds, herbs, exercise, hobbies/projects... nothing works. Lately I wake up and just sit at my desk staring at my screen or pacing the house. Music use to help, now I'm bored with it.



Why should I keep just existing? I have nothing, no one and can't fix myself. I'm just too fucked up.
