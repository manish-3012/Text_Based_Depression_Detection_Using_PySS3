Took my moms car out in hopes to end it,Itâ€™s currently 3:00 here and about two to three hours ago I took my moms car out for a drive with a bottle of extra strength Tylenol in my hand. Quick backstory, the place Iâ€™m going is where my dad died a few years ago while driving and he fell asleep, so my plan was to go there, down the Tylenol and hope that he brings me up with him, my dad was a train conductor and has worked with trains for many years, keep that train part in mind, on my way from the highway across the train tracks onto a secondary road, I started hearing dinging, thought to myself ah fuck a train of course, but whatever because usually the trains down here are quick and short we usually came down her about 3-4 times a week to visit my grandma and grandpa so trains were not a very special occurrence, but the train stopped, not for long but just long enough for you to notice it 2-3 seconds max it was at a complete halt, I thought to myself, k weird Iâ€™ve never seen that before, like I said before usually the trains are short and quick but this one was going max 7 kmh, and long, wayyyyy longer than the others, but I shrugged it off and just said Iâ€™m not gonna let a train stand in my way, that was until Iâ€™ve heard something Iâ€™ve never heard before, me and my dad had a handshake it was kind of boring but it was just three slaps, staring contest then two slaps, I heard the train whistle or horn whatever u call it, go two short honks, then three short honks, and that scared the absolute shit outta me, I definetely took that as a sign even tho it was in the wrong order, visited my dads death spot and turned around, going about 145 in a 100 cause speed makes me happy and makes me forget about my worries, I took that as a sign not to kill my self, and Iâ€™m still suicidal but Iâ€™m gonna tough it out:)
