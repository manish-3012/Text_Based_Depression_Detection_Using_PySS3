Why can't I do it???Why the f*** can't I kill myself. I really want to. I have a plan in place, and I know how to do it with minimum exposure in my town. I just can't bring myself to do it. I am so doggone tired of living. I hate this world and the bigoted people in it. I hate how my life has turned out and it will only get worst, but I can change all that if I would just stick to my plan. My wondrous plan to end my life. A life that I am tired of living. 

I can't sleep and I sit up all morning planning my escape from this world, and I am to much of a p*** to finish it off.
