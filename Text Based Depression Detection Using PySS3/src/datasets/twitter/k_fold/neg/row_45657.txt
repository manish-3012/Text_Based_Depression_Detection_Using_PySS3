Giving Up.i never felt happy in my life. father died when i was young, mother is an alcoholic and i got sexually abused by a man and a woman. next to that i got tortured basically (got locked in in a dirty laundry room without lights or just beaten up if i grabbed something to drink for example). that was when i was 7. now i am 21 and i never felt like i can live a healthy life. 

Because of all those things happening to me i just want to make other people smile. i dont need to be happy in my opinion if the people i care for just are happy. but recently i became a little too selfish and didnt think about the people around me for a while. i tried to express my feelings more and that backfired. 

my mom stopped with drinking for a while and now she started drinking again. i lost connection with everyone. i lost the most important person in my life. i just feel all alone and i see that everything is my fault. 

i really hate myself and i cant stop thinking about suicide. what am i worth if i cannot even make the people around me smile. that is the main thing i wanted and i cant even do that. i cant even put a smile on someones face.

i really want to end it all and i really dont see purpose in my life. it feels like this is my only place to express myself since i have no one.
