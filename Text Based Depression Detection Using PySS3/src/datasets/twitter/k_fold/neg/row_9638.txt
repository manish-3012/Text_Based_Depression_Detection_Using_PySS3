Whats the point in anythingNo matter what I try to do to make things better they only get worse. All I do is drag down everyone around me. I tried doing all the right things. I tried and everything only keeps getting worse. I am still trying. I wish i never existed. If I were to die that would hurt the one person who cares. Its so hard to keep fighting. I feel like no matter what I do I hurt someone worse.
