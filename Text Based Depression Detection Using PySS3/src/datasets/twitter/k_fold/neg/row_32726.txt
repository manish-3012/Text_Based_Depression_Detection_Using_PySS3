I can't stop thinking about it..Jumping in front of the train


Slicing my wrist.


Getting into an accident.


Anything to make the pain go away.


To put me out of my misery.


I can't stop thinking about it.


Planning my own death. 


Awaiting the moment I can gather courage.


To let my breath slip away.


But I fear I'll fail at this too.


I fear I'll fail and end up a burden.


My biggest fear used to be death.


But Today..its cheating death.
