No one is interested in meEvery time I ask a girl out I get the same "someone is out there for you I promise" or "you're a great guy but... etc" and I'm tired of it. I've been talking and playing with the most gorgeous, amazing person in the world for a while now, and I thought she was seeing me like I saw her. That smile on her face when I walked up to her made me smile back every time. But I guess I FUCKING READ THE SIGNS WRONG. I DONT FUCKING GET IT. WHY DOES THIS SHIT HAPPEN TO ME? YOU BUILD MY HOPES UP AND MAKE ME ALMOST HAPPY, THEN YOU FUCKING TELL ME ITS ALL FOR NOTHING, JUST FRIENDS, SAME FUCKING SCHPEIL. I am meeting up with her tomorrow morning to cheat off of each others college papers. I can't fucking do this shit anymore guys I just can't. I have no confidence, no self-esteem, and I can't fucking read people.
