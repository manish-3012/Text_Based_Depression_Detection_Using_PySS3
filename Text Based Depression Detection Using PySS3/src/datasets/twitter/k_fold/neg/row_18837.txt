I just tried to kill myselfI wrote out a note and got in my bathtub and started running the water. I took my blade and I was so close to cutting my wrist and letting everything go but then I stopped. I thought about my friend I had still to talk to later, I thought about my unsupportive mother and how she would react by saying something like, â€œShe was just mad she didnâ€™t get what she wanted. or some dumb shit. I thought about my Dad, my brother who I try so hard to protect and my brother who is distant yet still tries anyways and I broke down. I sat my blade down, turned off the water and took a long shower while I just cried. I was about to kill myself and I didnâ€™t care. The worst part is, I want to do it again but I donâ€™t where to go or who else to turn to. I had sent my friend a text saying Iâ€™ll miss and stuff but she never even looked at it. I texted my other friend and she never answered either. I just feel like the world is telling me something and I canâ€™t help but feel it doesnâ€™t require being able to live.
