I can't do it anymore.I can't. I'm so lonely. I'm so empty. Nothing makes me happy anymore. The only thing keeping me alive is my family and my boyfriend, I don't want to hurt them. But it just keeps getting harder, and I don't even do anything. I've barely left the house in 2 years, yet I'm exhausted all the time. I haven't had a friend other than my boyfriend in years, probably because no one likes me. I'm a fuck up. Every day it gets a little harder to stand up straight, if I can even get out of bed. Every breath is more laboured than the last, every word feels more worthless. I've been to therapy, I've been on a million medications, it doesn't get better. I just want one good day, fuck, just an hour where I don't want to die. I just want this to be over.
