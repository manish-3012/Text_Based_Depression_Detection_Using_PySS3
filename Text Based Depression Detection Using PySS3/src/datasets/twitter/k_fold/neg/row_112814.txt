is it weird to feel extremely suicidal at one moment, and then relatively normal / happy at the next?i have clinical depression and anxiety ( and iâ€™m just a kid, iâ€™m 13 ) and iâ€™ve attempted once. i have been going back to that place in my mind and am trying to get out of it, but i noticed that one moment iâ€™ll be seriously contemplating suicide, and have a plan and everything, then like an hour later iâ€™m feeling relatively normal or happy. itâ€™s scary because itâ€™s like my mind is on a switch, one extreme or the other. is that normal or is there something wrong with me??
