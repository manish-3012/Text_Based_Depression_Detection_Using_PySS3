Nobody I can trust to talk to. Wife and therapist don't seem to care at all.Been having a lot of thoughts about suicide and feeling like I really can't handle things. I've tried to talk to my wife about it, but she just seems to get angry at me or annoyed about talking about it.

I started going to therapy last year, but my insurance really doesn't cover much and I only have one option for a therapist. In all honesty, it just feels like she's waiting for the hour to end and doesn't seem to have any compassion. She comes across as very cold and I'm not really comfortable sharing anything personal with her, which is kind of a problem for a therapist. At this point, I just keep going so they don't cut off my meds.

I wasn't too worried about it until recently. I used to just have fleeting thoughts about it, but over the past few months I've caught myself actually thinking pretty in depth about how I would do it.

Has anybody found any solutions to finding somebody to talk to? I really feel like nobody around me understands and just looks at it like a challenge to fix like there will just be some magic trick that changes everything. Sometimes, I just want somebody who I don't have to pretend I'm happy around.
