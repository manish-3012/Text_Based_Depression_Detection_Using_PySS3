girlfriend having serious suicidal thoughts (sorry if this is the wrong place for advice from someone who doesnâ€™t have suicidal thoughts)iâ€™m 15(m) and my gf (15) has been having suicidal thoughts the past year. we started dating this year so i havenâ€™t known her for so long since i just moved to this district. iâ€™ve asked a couple of her friends and theyâ€™ve said sheâ€™s self-harmed twice and has had these thoughts from the SECOND GRADE. i havenâ€™t been able to sleep thÄ— past couple of nights and me and our friends have tried convincing her that committing wonâ€™t solve any of her problems. she does have serious depression from dating a guy who then dumped her five days later for thÄ— â€œschool sl*tâ€. this broke her. according to her friend she cried for days and was extremely quiet Ã­Å„ class. eventually she got over him and started to develop a love for someone else. but he never liked her back or even paid attention to her. and on top of all this, she has no living grandparents and her parents are constantly arguing and have mentioned divorce. they are very hard on her since she sings, dances, and plays an instrument. eventually when i moved to thÄ— district Ã­Å„ thÄ— beginning of thÄ— school year, we started to talk a lot since we were Ã­Å„ some classes together and i eventually got a bit of a crush on her. my friend subtly told me she likes me as well by screaming it Ã­Å„ thÄ— hallways. she says that being with me has made her happier than before since iâ€™m thÄ— one person who genuinely loves her. a couple days ago her mother found out about us dating and told her to break up with me. she eventually told me that she wonâ€™t do it but thÄ— stress broke her even more and she left for two days on â€œk imma go kms nowâ€.  she came back and said her mom stopped her and that they went to a therapist. i never got an update on how that went. my friends and i are running out of ideas and iâ€™ve decided to turn to reddit. please help me.
