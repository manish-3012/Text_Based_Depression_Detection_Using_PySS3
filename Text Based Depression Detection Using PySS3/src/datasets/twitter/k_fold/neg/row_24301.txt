I'm such a pussy.... I deserve to be in this much painMy situation is nothing unique. I just don't have the guts to keep going with the monotony. I probably have Peter Pan syndrome, because I can't come to grips with being another useless cog and I don't have the motivation to make things better. I dug myself too deep in this life I'm living and will see the success I desire. I just wish I had the guts to swallow enough pills, pull the trigger, or take the leap.
