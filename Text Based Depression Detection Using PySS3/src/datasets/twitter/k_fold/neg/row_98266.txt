Am I damaged goods?Throwaway for obvious reasons.

   I think Iâ€™m damaged goods. Iâ€™m 21, live in a large city, no debt, in school, and stable. I have a good group friends and my family is very supportive. I also have a trust fund so I never have to worry about money. I donâ€™t think I could ever date someone.


When I was 16 there was this guy I would talk to from time to time Iâ€™ll call him John. I would text and talk to him sometimes for over a year. He was a senior. I briefly dated a â€œbad boyâ€ senior that year named Tim . A lot of crazy rumors were put out there. That I did group sex or things like that. There were these guys in my grade who would tease me a lot. They started rumors that I was slutty.

John invited me to a party that summer after he graduated. People at school called me pretty or said I looked like I was in my 20s or that I looked like Amy Adams. But I lot of people had it out for me. Girls would say I look 40 or I look trashy. I developed quite young.


When I got to this party I drank until I blacked out. I can remember some things of that night. I had hung out with johns friends before and let them drive my car. We go there I get drunk and John gets mad at me because Tim was trying to get me to leave or something. But I donâ€™t remember I was so drunk, but I could walk and talk.


John and his two friends ask me if I want to go back to their place and have some fun I say okay. When weâ€™re at the house they tell me to get undressed and I do. Then they instructed me to suck their dicks. Then laid me back on the bed and penetrated me. I bleed, I said it hurts. They finished.


The following weeks they called me gross. That I was a slut. I had sex with one other person before this. I feel like this happened because Iâ€™m ugly. I kept sleeping with and sexting one of Johnâ€™s friends who did that because I felt lost. He would say he wants sex with me and nothing more. That Iâ€™m annoying. I havenâ€™t been with really any other guys since.


Guys ask me out a lot but I think if they found out I did that theyâ€™d ghost me. Iâ€™m scared all men are like this. This what I think men are like if not family. I think itâ€™s my fault because when I asked John years later about it he said â€œI donâ€™t like girls who fuck my friendsâ€ then blocked me.


Am I a bad person? Was this my fault? Will any guy want me?


Tl;dr: when I was 16 I had a bad sexual experience and am now scared no guy will want me.
