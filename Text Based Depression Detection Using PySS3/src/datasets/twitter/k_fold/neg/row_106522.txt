Give me an advice..Hi everyone, so my story is with this girl who was in love with me back in high school, ever since then she was this sensitive sort of fucked up, demanding/needy.. i was patient back then &amp; I didnâ€™t want to upset her so i shared this love with her although i wasnâ€™t happy most of the time &amp; reached a point that i was stuck, i told her that I donâ€™t love her back the same way &amp; she went crazy and mad! I felt huge amount of guilt that knocked me down &amp; affected my life.. so after a while i came back &amp; made sure she forgave me, we came back as friends but it wasnâ€™t happy..  i reached a point where i wanted to only be with myself &amp; keep this peace with myself, so i started to go away and not keep in touch which triggers her &amp; makes her mad, she texted me after a some time with no talking, that she wants to kill herself! ... I donâ€™t want to go back to the relationship &amp; feel miserable again &amp; at the same time itâ€™s a huge amount of pressure to hold when someone tells you this.. you keep having nightmares if she really kill herself &amp; youâ€™re related to it.. Any help what can i do please?
