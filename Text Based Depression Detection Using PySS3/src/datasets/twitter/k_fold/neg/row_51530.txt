There is no happinessAbout 3 months ago my life was a typical 17-year-old boy. Playing video games all night, talking about girls, and having fun. All that changed one day I came home from school I heard my parents fighting and my dad left i asked my mom what happen she said my father cheated on my mother at moment i just saw my world crash down i fell in a hard depression i cut off all social media, not talking to friends, and even eating. I started to take Xanax and weed to make me feel better but it dosent help me it just made me worse. All my friends left and i have one else now  have to get a job to support my family since my father left and my mother cant walk I really consider dropping out of HS and to make matter worse my older sister was recently diagnosed with leukemia and current staying in the hosptial i just have so much anger and sadness I just really want to end it and end this sadness i have and make it go away and not feel this anymore but i know if i actually do commit suicide i would be seen a coward to not deal with this as a man and plus im leave my only family my younger brother, and my older sister, and my mother i dont want to do that.
