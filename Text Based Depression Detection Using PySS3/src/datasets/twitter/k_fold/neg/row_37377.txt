Family coming down on me hard after a bout of depression.I was kicked out of my moms house when I was 15 by her douchebag boyfriend after he started physically abusing me and had to get a job and quit highschool to pay bills, I have no education and never really learned how to be a responsible adult other than "go to work and pay bills"

So I am a framer, in construction, I hate my job, I get picked on a lot and it makes work a living nightmare for me I dread going and when I am there I can't think about anything else other than how much I hate being picked on and treated like a piece of shit all day. I became really depressed and thought of suicide a lot, actually drunk drove my car to the bridge in my city to end it but bitched out.

I quit my job so I could find work out of construction and it has been very hard but I know this will help me quit being depressed, I sent out hundreds of resumes and got very few callbacks, 3 I think, and one was a pyramid scheme, combine this with the fact that I have no phone and no money and have already borrowed a lot to cover what I need to it's fuckin hard.

Yesterday there was an intervention planned for me which I didnt know about (as a dinner) and I didnt go, when I got home my sister basically laid me out saying I have to go back to work it doesnt matter if I hate it or not and that if i dont she will kick me out of our house (I found the house, went to the viewing with her, payed half of all the bills and moved all of her shit since she didnt drive) all I didnt do was sign the lease, but it's "her" house, which legally yes it is.

I am thinkin that if I go back to work Framing I'll probably just kill myself, I cant handle it. I am not looking for sympathy this just fucking blows, I have tried my ass off to find something that makes me happy and now I am being forced to go back to doing what is making me suicidal because thats what my family wants from me.

Fuck this life, fuck my sister, fuck my family, fuck everything. They are saying its because they care but it'll be funny when them caring gets me to the bottom of a river.
