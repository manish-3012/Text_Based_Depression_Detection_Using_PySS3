Planning a foolproof suicideI won't explain how. I guess I'm still thinking about doing it. Not today but in 2 weeks.

I'm so fucking alone. My family are all estranged a part from my mother who simply does not understand. Keep in mind I have been in a mental hospital for PTSD and depression.

I no longer suffer from trauma and I thought I was no longer depressed for a while. I'm not. My finances are ruined. My living situation is terrible. I have very few "friends" and they're only around when they want to go clubbing because I'm seen as the "fun one". A facade.

I was abused growing up and then ended up being abused in my first relationship. I started self harming at 11 and my body is ugly. I feel so ugly. And it's hilarious because I'm seen as conventionally attractive so no one understands how I feel when I say it. My image insecurities are through the roof.

I've always been criticised by family growing up and its had its effect.

I'm giving up and I said I never would when I left hospital and got my life back. But I don't see the point anymore. I'm probably going to end up homeless and whatnot. I just wish my childhood was normal. Things would've been different.

I'm sick of feeling used, not enough, lonely, etc.
