I've never been so close to end it allI've been having suicidal thoughts for about 5 or 6 years but I have never been so close to doing it until now. More than unconsciously planning I'm also unconsciously accepting it.

I might do it this week. Rent a hotel room for a couple of days â€“ so I don't fuck up the family house like I fuck up everything else â€“. Buy about 10 bottles of wine. Sit on the bed. And try to drink it all. Until I finally pass out.

I just don't know what else to do. I'm stuck in a dead end job. In a shit hole third world country. I guess I'll never achieve my dreams of traveling the world, owning my own business, buying a house. I don't deserve it anyway.
