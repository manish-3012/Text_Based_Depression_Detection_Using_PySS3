I'm tipping over the edge. =/Ok, so the reason I'm here is because I'm worried about myself. I've recently started cutting and well I've been thinking about just ending it all. I've always been thinking about suicide. Well for 4 years. I first started because I was thinking. What's the point of it all... It's all bad, there's nothing good to be had in life, well for me anyway. So I'd been toying with the idea already. But I saw no reason to tip me over the edge of, "Suicide wouldn't be that bad but life isn't that bad..." But due to recent events well.... I'm tipping over to, "Suicide sounds great right now"

A bit about me I guess: I'm pretty young to be thinking about these things. I've/Am growing up with a alcoholic mother and a father who has left my mum but trys to keep in touch with me but is abusive so I don't want him in my life anyway... So my two options are, alcoholic mother or abusive father. Yeh.... I'm gay, and well a main contributor  for my suicidal tendencies is because of homophobia I'm having to deal with... From my dad and people I know. I'm currently not "out" to anyone I know IRL (Another reason for my suicidel tendencies... If I "come out" my father will likely disown me and the homophobia could become much more apparent and concentrated at me... I would likely become an outcast at school and life would generally go to shit some more... So yeh, that's another reason to not want to live any more...) so they don't know that I will take there homophobic remarks to heart, maybe there opinions would change if they did?... But they still have those opinions... Anyway... I'm leaving stuff out because... Well I don't want to type it all and I don't want to think about it... So the just of it is... I'm depressed because of my minor problems that hold no real significance... And I'm going to/Might kill myself because of them...

(Sorry about whining about all my stupid little issues which I should really just toughen up... But well, I've been trying that and well, it hasn't really got me anywhere... So I'm turning to you guys for **help**... Before I well... "Tip"... Also sorry if this made no sense, I'm sought a a mess right now but trying to keep calm... So my writing skills aren't at 100%)

So the thing I'm trying to say is... **Help**?...
