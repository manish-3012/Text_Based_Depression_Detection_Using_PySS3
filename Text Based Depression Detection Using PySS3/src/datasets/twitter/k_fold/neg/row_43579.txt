I'm done with lifeI'm done with living. I am a completely worthless human being, and I deserve to die. All I have to do is decide on the method and write a note. 

Part of me wishes there were a reason for me to keep going, but there really isn't. I've realized that I'm at a dead end in my life, and there isn't any way to fix it, because the problem is with something that is unchangeable. Suicide is my only option.
