What if we just shouldWhat if literally no one cares and itâ€™s all an illusion when they say what about your family or you one friend? And you think they would actually be upset and picture how you made them so sad. But if you were actually gone they would be like oh wow so sad but it doesnâ€™t actually really matter to anyone. What if weâ€™re just not that special, they just want to make us think that maybe we could be. So keep clinging to the hope one day you wonâ€™t have to stuff pills to trick yourself into being happy, everyone would be so sad without you, one day youâ€™ll find your passion, youâ€™re just going through a hard time, itâ€™ll be okay itâ€™ll be okay... when none of this will ever pan out. Maybe life is just shit and then you die so might as well choose when and how ... thatâ€™s the reality stop trying to cling to some little faith that one day there will be a light at the end of the tunnel
