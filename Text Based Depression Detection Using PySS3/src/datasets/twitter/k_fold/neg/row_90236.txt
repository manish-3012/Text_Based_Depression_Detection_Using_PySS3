Help for a friendSo,one of my friends wants to die.I've pulled her back from the brink once before,but I want to make sure that she's safe.I've told her to go see a phsychologust or talk to someone,but she won't.I want to tell her parents,but I'm afraid it might push her over the edge.What should I do?(also i dont know if this might help but she's muslim)
