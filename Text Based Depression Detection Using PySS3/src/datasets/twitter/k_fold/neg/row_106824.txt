I (M18) didnâ€™t plan to live past high schoolI decided very early on in high school that I was going to kill myself just after it ended. I spent my time battling depression and body dysmorphia because of how overweight I was. In grade 12 I dropped ALL the weight and now weigh a healthy 155 pounds. I thought that would fix the depression, or at least make me feel better about myself, but it didnâ€™t. As I watched my classmates plan their careers and futures I did not bother at all because I was so dead set on killing myself. Then Corona happened and it threw a wrench in my plans, as I was only staying until the end of high school so my parents could see me graduate. But now I get no graduation. Then in August I started officially dating this girl I had gone out with a few times in the previous months. We would hang out everyday and I very quickly fell in love with her. Every second I spent with her was like a ray of sunshine through the dark clouds that were my life. Then she started her first year of university and we hung out less and less. Two days ago she ended things between us, but we are still keeping contact. The only thing keeping from killing myself is the thought that she might blame herself, because I know she would if I did it so soon after we broke up. My heart is crushed, I am not attending a post high school education, and the promotion I was up for at work was given to someone else because they are older than I am.  I am just so over living at this point.
