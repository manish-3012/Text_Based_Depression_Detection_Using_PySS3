Holy shit thoughts hitting hard tonightI have no friends, I wish I was out in a progressive city celebrating the Biden win but I live in rural Tennessee. There is so happiness over in my side of town at least. My only friend is in town for the weekend but he keeps ignoring my texts asking to meet up and hang out. I feel like shit. I feel so useless and Iâ€™ve already texted the Trevor project hotline like 3 times these past 2 days, Iâ€™m sick of them just patronizing me. Iâ€™m done. Everything and everyone around me isnâ€™t real and everyone just lies. Itâ€™s all lies. Just people tolerating the mental burden I am on them until I eventually die. I do more harm than good. I hate it here. I hate this life so fucking much. Everything fucking sucks and nothing makes me happy anymore.
