Nothing works.Tmi, Fyi... I don't really care anymore: I do go to trauma therapy twice weekly. I exercise when I am not burnt out by my physically active job. I have no friends as my latest aquaintences only hung out with me in hopes they could "turn me straight" (I am a lesbian)

Been in dozens of hospitals. Been on over 40 FAILED meds since age 7. Was better off of them except prazosin. I have had so many counselors and therapists.

All I can think is: "well... they helped me make it this far..." 

Every day I wake up and my first thought is "I want to hang myself. I want to hang myself." Or I think of the time I almost jumped off an overpass and ended my life, but didn't because I fear the void of blackness that comes after death. (I dont like religion nor do I believe in god/afterlife)

Then it becomes a constant battle of convincing myself "You're not homeless or being sexually assaulted or abused (just verbally abused sometimes now) anymore so you are safe and you're holding down a job so you're brave!" Yet, even though I'm not homeless anymore, and I can temporarily reason with myself, I am still depressed because all of my abusers got away with abusing me. I have seen deaths. I looked into the eyes of a dying stranger once. I've been through a lot of very scary things and yet I'm still depressed.

I lost weight. I got a motorcycle. I take care of my body and don't drink much, I don't smoke... I have a good paying job, parents are (attempting) to be better to me. I cant get a wife and it makes me want to kill myself daily. 

Before anybody says "love urself b4 u love others!" Shut the hell up. I love myself enough to know I need someone in my life that will love me because Im worthy of love as I work on myself. Fuck right off with that shit.

I plan on killing myself in a few years if this feeling keeps intensifying. My nerves are just getting worse.
