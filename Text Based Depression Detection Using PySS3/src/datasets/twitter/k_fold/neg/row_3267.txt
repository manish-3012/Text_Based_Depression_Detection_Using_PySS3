Was scared to call hotline, for a good reason.So I already made a post in off my chest not too long ago. But I'm depressed and suicidal at times. Sometimes I feel like I should call the suicidal hotline. But I've always been afraid too. I would have no idea what to say or do. I finally did tonight. But the lady hung up on me. It's for emotional struggling, suicidal people and she didn't ask me what was wrong or try talking to me hardly she talked like a customer service lady. I don't know how the hotline is supposed to work, but I expected a bit more help than that.
