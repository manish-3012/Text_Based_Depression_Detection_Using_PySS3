i want to end itok, a little bit of background information. im 17 years old and in college. im advanced academically with a decent job with a management position at my college newspaper. my mom loves and supports me, my sister is my best friend, my dad isnt always the best but he's trying. what im trying to say is i have everything going for me...
and yet i still want to die. ive been depressed for as long as i can remember (first self harmed at 12 years old). i used to take thumbtacks and stab them into my arms because it wouldnt scar like cutting. now i burn myself with my hair straightener.

maybe i made this reddit account and this post as a cry for help? or a desperate attempt at attention? or for someone to tell me itll all be okay? i dont know what im doing. all i want is to die. i cant handle being alive anymore. it all hurts too much. i just need a hug.
