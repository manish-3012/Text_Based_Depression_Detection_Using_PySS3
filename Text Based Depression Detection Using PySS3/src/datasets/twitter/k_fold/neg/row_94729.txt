What is the sense of living if I always feel ashamed?Moments ago, I went to convenience store to buy coffee but it spilt and suddenly get burned. I was shocked and all people looked at me. I nearly cried. I feel so embarrassed. The last time that I feel embarrassed is when I felt at work that no one liked the way I am.

I am still crying. I am now thinking how to die. I know this is dangerous but... I felt like I have no sense in this world.

I posted this on the other reddit but it seems like the stigma is real. So disappointing.
