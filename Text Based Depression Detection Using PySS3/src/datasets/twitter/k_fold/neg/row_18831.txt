Seeing the aftermath of failed suicide attempts has made me not want to attempt suicide.I have seen pictures from failed suicide attempts and it honestly is the strongest prevention from me commiting suicide, outside of the fact that I don't want to give my family and friends mental anguish. It also terrifies me that there is no way out of this world, without feeling pain, or causing pain for others. I suppose it is a good thing though because it does prevent me from committing suicide.
