suicideI have bipolar disorder. I take medication that sort of works. Right now is one of those times where I'm thinking about suicide. Some reasons why: I don't feel right in this body, not a gender identity thing just general discomfort. I'm scared of the outside world especially vehicles. I'm bad in social situations, therapist thinks I have asperger syndrome and I'm getting tested for it. I'm 20 and never had a job and the prospect of getting an education for a career in my current state is laughable. So I spend my days with no hope for tomorrow. I try to stop myself and think positively but sadly one thing I don't have is psychosis. Well maybe a little bit. So I should probably just wait until I don't feel like killing myself right?
