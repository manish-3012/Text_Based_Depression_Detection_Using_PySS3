My life is fucking awful.22 years old and wont graduate college until 24 at least. I changed majors and failed/dropped a lot of courses. I'm a pathetic loser manchild. Everyone my age is already starting their lives.

I had a gf for 6.5 years and I thought we were getting married until she stopped giving a shit about me and dumped me. She couldnt care less about me. She knows everything else that's going bad in my life and I told her I'm depressed and think about suicide alot and she rolled her eyes and said "you're not actually going to do it." We don't talk anymore, she blocked me.

I never had any friend group, I was introverted and socially anxious for stupid reasons throughout highschool and even somewhat now. I have zero actual friends, just a handful of people from HS on Snapchat. I never went to parties and I only had sex with one girl. I missed the train.

And all these things are horrible, but that's not the reason I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself because I have a chronic illness that all of a sudden got worse and has been worse for a year now, despite seeing doctor after doctor. I used to go to the doctors once a year, this year I've had at least 3 appointments a month. It's so stressful. I dont want to feel like shit everyday until I die. I'll never have the life other people have and I'll never experience it to the fullest. I don't want to live a half assed life, I want a good life.

Meanwhile time doesnt give a shit about your problems it will move on regardless. I'm falling more and more behind everyday. It feels like everything is closing in on me. Fuck I just want my illness to get better. I want my old life back, even though it wasnt good before. I think about death everyday. This isnt normal shit to think about at my age. I shouldn't be having health problems at my age. I'm supposed to be in my prime. If this is the best things are going to be, I dont want to live anymore.
