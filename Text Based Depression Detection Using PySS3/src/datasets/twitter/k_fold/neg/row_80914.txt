Ashamed about telling my friends about my problems and shortcomings. Kept everything bottled up. When I told them about depression some of them ran away. Does anyone feel the same way?I keep this image among my friends and peers that I'm happy doing well in my (lack) of career after college.

In reality I've been miserable the past couple years after college. I pretend my life is perfect on social media. I rarely talk about my personal life with coworkers and non close friends. I pretend I'm happy around my parents. I laugh and smile, try not to gossip pretending everything is okay.

Some people can tell that I'm depressed and I try to be super positive around my friends aka "bubbly" and upbeat. Lately I can't keep up with the act and I've been crying the past couple months lashing out on people.
