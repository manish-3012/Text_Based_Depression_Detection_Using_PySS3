I always thought it was hardest at nightBut the mornings, with a whole day ahead of me where I'm going to do nothing but feel sick to my stomach and dread the night, is maybe worse. 

If anyone needs a buddy today, send me a message and I'll really try to respond asap. Been hard to be on my phone lately
