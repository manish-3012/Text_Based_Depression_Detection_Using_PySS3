Giving up.Short story is that I've been depressed for 5yrs with pretty bad anxiety and weight issues thrown in to the mix. I didnt seek help till about may 2015. Since then i've been on:
Ciprolex, Symbalta, Abilify, Mertazepine, Nabilone, Welbutrin (most recent)
I'm just wondering whats going on. I take the meds like they say but my psychiatrist and doctor are pretty shocked nothing has helped one bit. Mertazapine didnt help for depression or anxiety but its the only one that made me feel somewhat ok but I gained 25lbs in a month. I'm on wlefare since I cannot work and trying to get on ODSP (better benefits and a little more money)
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel like I'm just giving up. I want to try medical marijuana but my doctor and psychiatrist both are heavily against it. What can I do to change their minds. At this rate I'll be on ODSP my whole life....

My family doctor tells me I should be on anxiety medication and my Psychiatrist is against it saying I'll depend on the medication and that I just have to "suck it up". I stopped taking the Welbutrin as it has caused me to break down and threw me into a deep anxiety attack. I made the effort to go back on my previous meds (mertazipane and nabalone) in hopes this anxiety will go away before. 

I'm just afraid that either my Doctor or Psych will get mad at me. The Wellbutrin made me want to swallow all my pills so bad to end it and now those thoughts are stuck in my head. I dont see family doc till 17 of nov (he's on vacation) and my psych till december 3rd... Hopefully this feeling goes away... I don't know how much more I can handle of this.
