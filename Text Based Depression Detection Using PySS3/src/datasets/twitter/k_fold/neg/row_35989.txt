I feel like I'm running out of will to liveMy story isn't that special. I lived a decent childhood etc. Although whatever I did my parents would never acknowledge it, no matter how hard I tried or how well I did. I'm now 19 years old, and moved back home a month ago temporarily while looking for a job.

No success so far. Everything is taken, I've tried as hard as possible to find jobs, and it's still not good enough. I'm about to be thrown out and don't have anyone to turn to. I feel like the simpler way would just be to off myself. I realize it's moronic, but I'm running out of options. 

My parents are the only ones who really can make me feel like absolute shit... And they do it, a lot. I had a sense of accomplishment today, as I've decided I'm going to study hard to become an engineer. I was on my way upstairs to tell my parents about my decision, but before I got the chance they started talking about "How fucking stupid it is that you still live here, free shelter and free food, you're 19 for fuck sake go and get a job." I've already checked everything, there's literally nothing.

There's this thing called NAV in Norway that supports you with money if you can't work or can't find a job etc. I've been in contact with them earlier regarding help getting a job, but today I broke down and begged them for assistance, anything that will get me away from this bullshit. I haven't had suicidal thoughts for over a year, since I lived by myself in a tiny apartment. When I came home my parents went on vacation and everything was good. Today they came home, within 5 minutes I was already told what a waste of space I was, and I was working on tying a noose when I managed to stop myself and look for anything to help me. They're leaving for another short vacation in a couple of days, and I can't find a place to be until then. I dare not leave my room as I know that every time I do I get closer and closer to offing myself.

I don't know what to do anymore..
