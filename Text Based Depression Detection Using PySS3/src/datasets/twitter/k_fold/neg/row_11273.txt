Does anyone else feel as broken and miserable as me?
I could not feel anymore alone than I do right now in life. Iâ€™ve been dealt a really bad card. I have no friends, never had a boyfriend and my family has done me dirty. I donâ€™t know what I have done to make people hate me in my life, Iâ€™ve encountered drama with a lot of people, in work and school etc. Iâ€™m not hideous or mean, I take good care of myself. Iâ€™ve tried to be friendly but only end up being treated unfairly. Everyone I know has family and people that care about them, my family is filled with backstabbers and shady people that only want to gossip. Iâ€™m 25 and have no one, I felt so lonely that I ended up adopting a dog. The dog is clingy and has separation anxiety. I feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with everyone around me, not even men find me attractive. I never get attention from men, do I sound like the issue?
