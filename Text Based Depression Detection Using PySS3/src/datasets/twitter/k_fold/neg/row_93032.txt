I feel lifeless...* I never go out in town because I am different looking (born with a disability)
* I never feel I have something that other people like
* Whenever I see beautifull, I just feel depressed - because I guess Iâ€™m ugly
* I donâ€™t know what I have to live for (my parents is the only one)
* I exercise daily, but what good will it become, If I anyway is ugly?
* Never had a girlfriend, or any social contact to a girl
* I never feel that people see me as a man, just like a small person that some people laugh of.
* I sometimes can talk with one to one, but when there is other people around, I feel like nothing, hopeless, helpless.
* I hate my life. I have no joy anymore in anything. 
* I am depressed everyday, and always has been since I was very little.

Want to kill my self honestly. I feel tired, hopeless/lifeless, cant even pull myself together to do practical stuff anymore.
