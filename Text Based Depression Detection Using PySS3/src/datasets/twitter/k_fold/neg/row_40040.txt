I kinda attempted suicide tonightI had a horrible day and I've felt really set on killing myself. I was driving on the highway and when I drive and I'm having a really bad day and really thinking about suicide I drive recklessly. Turn the headlights off when it's dark, close my eyes, don't wear a seatbelt, drive in the oncoming traffic lane, etc. I know it makes me a piece of shit, but I do it.



Anyway today I was on the highway driving and I wasn't wearing my seatbelt. I was feeling very very bad but had no choice but to be driving. I thought well this isn't my plan but it could be it, I sped up to 85+ in a 55 and slipped into the oncoming traffic lane.


I saw a car coming in the distance and after a few seconds survival instinct brought me back into my lane. They definitely saw but I'm sure didn't think I was thinking of purposely hitting them.



Again i know this makes me a shitty person and this tonight makes me feel even more likely to kill myself but using my actual plan rather than risking somebody else's life who doesn't wanna die.



That being said I wish it would've worked, that I could've hit a tree or something that wouldn't hurt another person.
