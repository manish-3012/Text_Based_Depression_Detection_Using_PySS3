I guess is working, but I hate feeling like thisLately my desire to do it is becoming stronger and stronger with each passing night. Yet, I have so many things that bind me to this life like my dog, my job responsibilities  and other family members. I don't want to feel like this, I wish that my desire to live was self-sustainable through peace and happiness. I can't stand such indignation.
