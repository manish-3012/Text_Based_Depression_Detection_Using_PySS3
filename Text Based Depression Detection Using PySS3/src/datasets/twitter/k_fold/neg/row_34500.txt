Feeling down and misunderstoodI donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to do anything rash, but Iâ€™m feeling not so good and just want someone to talk me down really. Someone here on Reddit has upset me, but itâ€™s the same argument I seem to have with people constantly and itâ€™s just pushed me over the edge tonight. I feel like nobody understands me and itâ€™s exhausting. It doesnâ€™t usually affect me this badly and Iâ€™m worried I wonâ€™t be able to get to sleep and so make my low mood even lower. My life is otherwise not too bad, nothing terrible to report, but I just want to talk to someone or hear some kind words. I often try and help people out on here and can say that doing so often makes me happy when I see Iâ€™ve made a difference. I hope helping me does the same for someone else. If thereâ€™s a better place for people seeking comfort, let me know and Iâ€™ll go there instead. Thank you.
