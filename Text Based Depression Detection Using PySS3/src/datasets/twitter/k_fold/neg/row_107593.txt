Hate.I hate that I am useless, have no skills, passions, goals nor interests. I hate that I'm shallow, the fact that I'm a pushover, antisocial, boring, uninteresting, a virgin, dumb and lazy. I hate that I'm unemployed, I hate that I'm a useless piece of shit that's just a drain on society.
  
And I fucking hate the fact that it's all my own fault.
  
Goodbye.
