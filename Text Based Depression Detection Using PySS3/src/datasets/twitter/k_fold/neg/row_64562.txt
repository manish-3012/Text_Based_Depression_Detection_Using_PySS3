Miserable no matter what I doWhen I'm unemployed I feel like a useless sack of shit, yet when I'm working I feel like my life has no meaning other than work. I don't even have time to do anything I like anymore. Lately, all my mornings consist of are me driving to work for an hour thinking about the least painful way to die. What is the point of living if you get 2 fucking days to enjoy in the week and the other 5 are you on auto pilot doing the same shit day in and day out, I seriously don't understand how anybody can live with this, and the weird part is I actually enjoy the work I do for the most part, which makes me feel even more stupid.

I'm at a mental low I haven't been at for years. I don't really need advice or anything I just wanted to say this out loud, ranting sometimes helps.
