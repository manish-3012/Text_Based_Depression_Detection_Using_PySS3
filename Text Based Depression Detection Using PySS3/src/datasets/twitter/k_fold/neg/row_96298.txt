I got rejected and feeling extremely downI confessed my feelings to this one girl and she rejected me in the worst way possible. I'm feeling very down, I just feel like I need someone to talk to. I have extremely deep thoughts at the moment and can't barely breath. I don't exactly know what this subreddit is used for, but I just need to talk.
