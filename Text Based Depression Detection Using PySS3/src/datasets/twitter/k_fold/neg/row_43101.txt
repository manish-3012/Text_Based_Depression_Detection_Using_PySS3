just give me a genuine response. seriouslyokay listen. i been contemplating this since June 11th or 12th. idk my mind is too foggy. basically to sum up the events of that day, i ended up losing all my friends. my whole group. i made it thru the summer somehow. for the past 3 years iâ€™ve been so depressed itâ€™s insane. i was happy september+october+november 2019 and may 2020 but besides that i havenâ€™t been happy since 7th grade. i turned 17 yesterday and iâ€™m a junior in high school. so letâ€™s recap. i have one friend and i havenâ€™t hung out with him in weeks and it feels like our friendship is just based on our music career, i sleep my days away and havenâ€™t gone out in weeks, i had a big glow up and still canâ€™t get a girl that i actually want (they all either already have boyfriends or iâ€™m just not interested) i canâ€™t make any new friends because my city is way too toxic and thereâ€™s not enough people. all i have is my parents and theyâ€™re worried sick about me because i do my e-learning and then sleep on the couch all day. i hate life so much and i just want to die asap. i donâ€™t have the balls to do it tho. iâ€™ve been spending the past hour looking for the easiest ways to do it but canâ€™t find any. so i ask of you to leave a comment. donâ€™t tell me â€œeverything will be okayâ€ or whatever iâ€™ve heard it a million times i hate it. leave a comment giving me ONE just ONE solid reason as to why i should keep living besides â€œyouâ€™re only 17â€ because i donâ€™t want a future where i have a failed music career and iâ€™m living off my last dollars by my lonely and i donâ€™t want a future where i DO succeed and donâ€™t even have people in my life. so just give me ONE reason as to why i shouldnâ€™t commit suicide.
