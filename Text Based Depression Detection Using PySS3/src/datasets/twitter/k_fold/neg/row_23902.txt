I'm TiredI'm so tired of feeling this way. People talk and it's like they don't even notice that I'm not physically here. I can't hear anyone or anything, I don't want to. It's all bullshit, nagging, and constant nothingness. It means nothing and it will always mean nothing. I'm in the darkest hole of my life and it's like no one notices. I think about death all the time, whether or not I'll be able to attend my own funeral, whether or not anyone attends. I doubt anyone would at this point, I've done too much hurt. Maybe I deserve to cut my story short. The attempts are getting closer and closer together, the rope is dwindling. Soon, I'll be on the last thread. Make sure they check my journal when they look at these posts, in it are the letters to the people most important to me. Make sure they know that I love them, that I'm sorry, and that nothing I did was ever their fault. I'm so tired of fighting my own destiny, I look around and I see darkness. And eternal darkness seems more comforting than anything I'm dealing with now.
