I feel emptyI am destroyed by everything that happened in my life. From alcoholic father to my sexuality.

I've had depressing thoughts since my classmates in primary school blackmailed me because of my sexual orientation.
On top of that my family has negative attitude towards bisexuality/homosexuality, so I didn't have any support from the most important people in my life. I have nobody I care about to talk to. No sence of belonging whatsoever. I put myself into years of isolation and alienation. I spend almost all my time procrastinating. Youtube, pornography and games devoured my mind, it doesn't let me think about myself so I do it. I have no social skills, work ethic,no real life experience. But the worst thing is that I'm terrified of intimacy now. I want to want someone and be passionate. 

I wonder if I'll get the courage to end it.
