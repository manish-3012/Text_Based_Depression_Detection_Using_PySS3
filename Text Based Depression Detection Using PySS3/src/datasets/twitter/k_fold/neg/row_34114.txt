I'm gonna either run away or kill myself. I'm tired of being here and feeling like I'm just a burden.On one hand it's very hard to kill yourself, I've tried before. It's painful. I don't want to die either but if I have to die to stop existing then I'm fine with that. 

Running away would be easier but long term might not work because I'll eventually run out of money and will probably be caught and it'll just make more problems. But if I runaway I'll also have the chance to find a high tower or bridge to jump off of so there's that I guess.

Nothing I do is ever right anyways. I know I'll fuck up no matter what I decide. I just wanna go away forever. I don't get why if I never asked to be born in the first place I'm forced to still live anyways.
