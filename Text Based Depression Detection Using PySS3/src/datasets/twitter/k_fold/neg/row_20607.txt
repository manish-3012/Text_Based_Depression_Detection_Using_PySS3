I've thought of shooting myself in front of my classmatesI know its awful, traumatizing an entire group of people like that. I'm a horrible person for even considering it, but I feel like it would at least give my life some meaning after I'm gone. If I just commited suicide, I would be forgotten rather quickly. I have 0 talents, 0 accomplishments. I feel like very few people would know that I vanished. But if I did that. If I blew my brains out in front of a bunch of people, they would'nt forget me. I would'nt be entirely worthless. My death would be more great than my life. This is just a thought I've been having, and I probably won't go through with it. Just felt like I needed to share it somewhere.
