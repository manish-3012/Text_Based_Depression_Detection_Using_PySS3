I think I'll be okay.I've posted here before, detailing how I was sure I was going to end my life but fearing it at the same time. I met a really good friend (r/NeedAFriend if anyone's interested) and after talking about what's wrong with me he now checks on me multiple times per day, asks me how I am and how my day's been, just the social interaction I've been longing for. This isn't so I can brag to the people struggling out there, this is me trying to say that I stood where you stood, completely alone and destined to die with nobody to care about me in the slightest. But I found someone who cared enough about me to stick with me and be the support I needed to keep living. You can find somebody like that too. They're just the hardest to find. I truly, sincerely, hope you all find the happiness you deserve. Nobody deserves to feel what I felt.

Thank you for listening, have a good day, and please stick around to see tomorrow.
