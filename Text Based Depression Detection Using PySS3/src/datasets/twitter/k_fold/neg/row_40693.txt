Alcohol is my problem.  I've never been to a shrink...should goI'm married, going to school to gain degree in radiologic protection technology. So far so good.
The marriage is great! It's just that, my drinking has become an issue. I'm well aware that I'm an alcoholic. I drink a half pint of vodka and a 6 pack a day. Believe it or not, this was cut down from when I used to drink a 12 pack a night for at least 2 years solid.
In short, I drink, a lot.
It's not a problem with my professional/school side of life. But it's affecting me and my wife, and I'm ashamed of it. I use it to fall asleep, been doing this for years.
I understand this isn't healthy. I know I know I know....don't go off on........the fuckin' obvious.
Those who have been where I am......how did you change? I need insight, because I've just been so...............used to this lifestyle I find it hard to fathom another.


EDIT

I hear voices.  It's like screaming voices.  How am I to sleep?  

EDIT
