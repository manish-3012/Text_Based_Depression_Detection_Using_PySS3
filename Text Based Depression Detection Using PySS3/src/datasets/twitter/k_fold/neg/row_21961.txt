Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to just walk off into the woods and never come backIâ€™m an avid hiker/prepper. The bag I bring on hikes is normally packed with 3-4 days of food and water, because who knows if I end up getting lost right?
One thing I often find myself thinking about is: what if I just grab my pack and gun and just walk off into the deep wilderness. No trails. No map. I just walk off in whatever direction I can think of.
Maybe Iâ€™ll hunt. Maybe Iâ€™ll starve. Maybe Iâ€™ll watch the stars. Maybe Iâ€™ll blow my head off. Really itâ€™s just up to how Iâ€™m feeling once Iâ€™ve made it so deep out that I canâ€™t remember which was is towards a small town and which way is hundreds of miles of nothingness.
