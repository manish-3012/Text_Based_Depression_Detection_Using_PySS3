2017 will be my last yearYeah. Just like what the title says, 2017 will be my last year of living. I'm only 19 and I won't be able to make my 20th in 2018. I have thought about committing suicide before but then I never got to it. The reason why I would always hold back is because I always saw hope in myself. I even have a career goal that I am passionate about. Just because my life is a little rough right now doesn't mean that things can't get better for me in the future right? Things CAN get better right?
Well, I've been thinking more and more about actually doing this to myself. Throughout most of my life I really feel like I don't get the proper respect I deserve. When it comes to my social life, it really feels the people I've come to know just come and go. Instead of the people actually sticking by you as true friends no matter what. I really feel different from many of the people I am growing up with. Sometimes I even feel like I was born in the wrong country, with the wrong people. I am still studying in college by the way.
I know people will always say that things will get better in the future but I feel like my is just too low point to keep moving forward. Each day I feel like I'm becoming more emotionless. I feel like I'm losing who I am. All I ask at this point is to become a role model to others and having lots of respect from many people. That's why I was really looking forward to becoming successful in the future.
I have finally thought about ending by the time November comes around. I don't know which day yet but I have until then to decide whether I want to do this or not. I feel like my family is the only one who would be affected by my suicide. I don't think anyone else would care...

I will let you all know by the time November comes around if I will do this or not. Any advice is appreciated.
I'm really frightened to do this guys but it has to be done :'(
