FUCKHey y'all

Another year and another handful of attempts later, here I am. Against all rhyme and reason I stand. I've heard so much motivational drivel that at this point it just goes in and out of my ears like trying to catch water with a dishrag. For years, the same "it'll get better!" "you are more than this" "it's just a feeling" bullshit. Nearly four years since I was diagnosed with depression, three years on various meds, and over a decade of feeling like this. 

This year, I've come to the conclusion that I have no fucking purpose. Am I young? Yes. Have I had hope that I'd one day amount to something? Yes. But nothing interests me or makes me feel whole. I've gone to therapy, worked out, tried every medication. I've cut off friends and family alike. It's easier to go if nobody cares, or thinks it's better off that I'm dead. I've hurt people. Really hurt them deep, in ways they'll probably never heal from. Everything that I bring to the table is manipulativeness, pain, and dishonesty. 

I don't want to see the new year, there's no hope left. No light at the end of the tunnel. Not for me anyways, whatever's to come will be better when I'm gone.

Unsure if this is a final goodbye or some twisted cry for help or just the rantings of some sick, sad person. I'll keep you posted.

Happy new year. If you see any hope at all, you better cling to that and don't let go until you've got enough hope and happiness to last you lifetimes.
