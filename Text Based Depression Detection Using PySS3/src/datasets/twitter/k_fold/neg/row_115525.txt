The thoughts never seem to go away for me.Every night I get home (I work second shift so I usually get home at around   1 am) everyone is asleep. I never see anyone except when I wake up and walk out of the door to go to work. The girl that I love with every fiber of my being is slowly slipping away. I am in debt from credit cards, and I can barely make my car/insurance payment. It's all weighing me down into this deep dark place, and I'm alone. I'm tired of dragging along every day.
