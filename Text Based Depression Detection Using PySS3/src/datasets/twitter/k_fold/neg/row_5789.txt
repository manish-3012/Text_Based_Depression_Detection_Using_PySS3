I am depressed and my family doesnt understand.Cause they are highly religious and whenever i want to talk about it with them and i tell them that i dont want to live in this world anymore and that i want to die and that i think the world would be a better place if o wasnt around,  they tell me that i will go to hell if i kill myself. And they start making me feel guilty that i am not religious. And i do feel guilty and it makes me want to not live even more. Its not me wanting to kill myself. I just dont want to live. Cause i hate myself and my life.
