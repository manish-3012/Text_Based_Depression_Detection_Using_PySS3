I'm so tired Â´m goodbye worldClose to a decade of suicidal thoughts is tiring. I'm drunk. I'm so lonely but I've realized that no person in this world can satiate that feeling. I was a gifted child and yet I ended up like this, why? Everyone expected so much of me and now I'm on the verge of suicide. Zolpidem, sertraline, promethazine, oxycodone, my last supper, wish me luck.
