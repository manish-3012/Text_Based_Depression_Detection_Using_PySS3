Thoughts and feelings starting to creep back inI had an okay couple of weeks, I don't even know why tbh but I did. Now for some reason all my usual thoughts and feelings are coming back. I'm constantly in a bad mood and I'm just tired of it all. I'm so miserable. 

Idk what to do anymore. 

It'd be nice to have someone to talk to but everyone ghosts me lmao.
