whats next?I push myself to keep it together, to push aside how i'm really feeling because thats what i need to do for people to like me. i don't have many friends i can talk to, some even know i'm in a dark place but never check in. all i've wanted is to have a close knit group of friends who go out on weekends together, holidays that kind of stuff but here i am 21 spending another saturday night at home as if nothing has changed since i was 14. "find a hobby, play a sport, try going to uni" as nice as this advice sounds it has gotten me no where. yes i'm playing "social" netball once a week. yes i went to uni and dropped out because i couldn't handle it. so, whats next? i've reached out to friends old and new and never get anything tangible back. i'm working a job i dont see a future in + working under shitty management. spent time in the sun, gone for bike rides, seen the doctors - im over it, i have no energy left to keep trying until something changes. please help me. i couldn't end it for the sake of my mum and dad i just pray for an accident to end this all.
