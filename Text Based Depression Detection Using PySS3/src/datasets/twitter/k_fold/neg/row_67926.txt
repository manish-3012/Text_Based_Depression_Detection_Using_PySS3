Reasons Why I want to dieI hate myself.
I have a burning desire to destroy what I hate.
I feel like a useless waste of space with no hope of a meaningful future.
I am incapable of forming meaning bonds with others.
The Marfans will only get worse with age so even if I stopped all the self destructive shit I'm still royally screwed.
I can't even fully open up to my psychologist without dissociating.
I am a complete failure at being a human.
And finally I'm tired of putting on a happy face so the entire world thinks I'm fine.

I want it all to end and I can't for the life of me find any protective factors to hold on to.
