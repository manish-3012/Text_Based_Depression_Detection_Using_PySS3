I lost my brother and father in a span of 2 yearsWhat do I fucking do now in my life? Im uncertain of everything and I just want to end it all. I lost everyone. My girlfriend has been ignoring me and is uninterested at all. I lost my friends because I fucking pushed them away and I have no one to talk to and I feel like im losing my mind. I want to die.
