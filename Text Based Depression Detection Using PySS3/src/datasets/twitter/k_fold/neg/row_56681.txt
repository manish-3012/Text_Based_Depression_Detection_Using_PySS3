just another reasoni donâ€™t get the point of living. Like the one and only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because iâ€™d hurt my family, nothing else, n o t h i n g   e l s e. 

but is this life? Living just not to make other people suffer?

i often fantasize about being hitten by a bus or smth. Just die, but not as a selfish suicidal coward, as a lovely unlucky young girl.

Whatâ€™s the point of  suffering if you can end it  right now and stop being conscious of your failure as a human being?

i want another reason to live that doesnâ€™t involve other people, as a selfish human being, i want to find a reason to live for myself.
