Always been made fun of for being quite, Had to flip the fuck upI  like to play football (soccer), it's a escape for me. Even though I have pretty fit built I  always been verbally bully for having quiet personality and for struggling to fit in. Last week I just flip the fuck out and knock 2 of them out for being disrespectful , while the other just shocked for what happened. I hate my life, why I can't just fit in and be happy..
