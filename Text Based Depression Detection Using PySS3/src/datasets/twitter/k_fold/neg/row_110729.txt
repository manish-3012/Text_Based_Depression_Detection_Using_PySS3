I've consistently been backing myself into a corner. Today, I realised it's over.I've always sucked at pretty much everything. Throughout my life I've been a gigantic prick every single step of the way. The only thing I've ever managed to affix myself to is the idea that I was "smart". I threw down everything and everyone else in my race for "intelligence". "I'm so smart" I told myself. The school says I was "gifted".  Because apparently doing no work makes you "smart". Yeah no, I'm just an idiot.

Today marks the day where I hit the final wall. My 3 years of University have been a fucking battle to stay afloat- I barely made it through second year with the power of resits. I told myself things would be different in year 3. After all, I was "intelligent". What a fucking lie I told myself. 

My attendance past week 3 nosedived into non-existence. Today I got the email that says if I miss a single extra day of class, that I'm getting the boot. This is it. The one reason, one chance, one positive thing I could say about my miserable fucking mistake of an existence was that I was "so smart", But I've shot myself in the foot by being a lazy piece of shit and now I've lost that chance too. 

It's all over. I can't get anything positive out anymore.

Before you all start feeling sorry for me, I want to point out that this is entirely my fault. I'm the one who didn't work hard enough, who continues to laze about all day doing mindless shit. Hell, my family is actually pretty well off (both my parents work really hard in teaching). But I haven't worked a day in my life. Haven't known true struggle. Haven't ever had to fucking try. And it shows.

I never deserved this life. Every day I wish I could swap places with someone else and give them the life they deserve, not to have it squandered on some pathetic little shit who can't do anything nice for anyone ever. Someone so selfish that they have literally never done anything nice for anyone ever. Someone who has so much privilege in their life, but refuses and continues to refuse to share it or help others.

This is it. This is the culmination of my fucking mistaken 20 years on this planet. I'm gonna get kicked out, my parents are gonna be all nice to me and stuff, and then in like a year I'm gonna try Uni again only to repeat this because I'm a fucking failure.

I don't deserve any of this. Not my parents. Not my relative wealth. Not my "smart" brain. Not my lifestyle. Not the freedom to bitch about my problems on the internet because they aren't actually debilitating enough to be a proper threat to me.

I just donezo. I would like to say I tried, but that would be a fucking lie. I want to stop living, not because my life is so terrible, but because I am so fucking lazy that even trying to do anything for once in my life sounds like hard work.

There is no place for people like me in the world. I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time
