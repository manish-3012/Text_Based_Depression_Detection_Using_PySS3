worried about my own suicidal thoughtsive recently been having really bad suicidal thoughts. for the past few months, my family situation has spiraled out of control (abusive household) and i've basically been locking myself in my room without any real social interaction for months (i've basically become nocturnal and only leave my room at night for food).

i think i've been having these thoughts because i've been feeling like my life is meaningless because the one thing i truly want (receiving familial love) is impossible for me to ever achieve, so i'm not really sure what to do...

i was wondering if anybody else had been in a similar situation. i'm not really sure what to do because i can't really see any light at the end of the tunnel, but logically i know "suicide is a bad idea", so i'm very conflicted.

thank you very much for any input
