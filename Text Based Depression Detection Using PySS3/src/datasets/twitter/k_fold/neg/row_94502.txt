I need to do it quick but I'm too scared alwaysI've put myself on a clock where I more or less need to do it realistically in around 5 hours but at the very latest on Monday. However every time I'm standing on the ledge I'm just too fucking scared... I don't know how to numb my adrenaline and self preservation instincts but holy fuck the amount of pain I'm in every single minute isn't worth it
