Reddit, I need help. I don't know what to do anymore.Alright, I don't know if this is the right place to post this so, if it isn't, please tell me.

I have always been a bad kid in school: bad grades, disturbing class etc. Since I have entered 9th grade in this shitty private school, things have been going downhill. My parents are always on my back, making sure I do everything I have to, I have tried telling me this pisses me off, but they won't stop. It's really bad, it's actually having an adverse effect on me: I don't do my stuff, so I get detentions, I get pissed at my shitty school. I have lost all motivaton, I sleep in my classes and am failing pretty much every class. Being a private school, they notify your parents EVERYTIME you do something DIFFERENTLY. "Oh, he didn't do his homework? Ha! Let's call his parents to make the atmosphere at home complete shit!" I really mean this, I am not suffering from physical abuse at home, but I am constantly being yelled at, insulted, etc. It's getting so bad that I'm staying at school until 6PM so I don't have to go home (finishes at 3PM). At home, I am constantly swearing and insulting my parents. I have used drugs before, but have stopped. (Speed, E, K, weed) If you need more details, please tell me. What should I do? I can't keep up with this anymore.
