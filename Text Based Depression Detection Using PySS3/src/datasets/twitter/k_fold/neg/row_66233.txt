Gonna fucking do itIâ€™m so done. Iâ€™m so fucking done. I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m just a disappointment, waste of potential, and have no real value in this world. Thereâ€™s no point in me living when all Iâ€™m going to do is go into debt and end up on the streets. Iâ€™m already letting everyone down, they wonâ€™t have to worry if I pull the trigger. No one actually fucking cares about me, my problems are meaningless and hold no value. Iâ€™m sick of waking up miserable and tired and DREADING the thought of going through another day of the same repetitive shit. Iâ€™m canâ€™t happy when the world keeps fucking kicking me while Iâ€™m down, and since Iâ€™m such a fucking mistake. Iâ€™m a waste of resources in this world and everyone would be happier without me. I fucking hate my life and I already know I wonâ€™t fucking go anywhere because Iâ€™m so fucking stupid and canâ€™t do fuck all. I have no real world knowledge, how the fuck would I make it anyways? Iâ€™m fucking done and Iâ€™m tired and this looks like the only option for the time being. I just need to figure out the easiest way to do this.
