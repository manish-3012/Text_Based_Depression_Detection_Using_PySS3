Not sureNot sure why I'm here, other than I just want someone to know my story. I'm 39. I've been chronically ill since I was born. Honestly I think nature was trying to do the right thing and weed me out young but modern medicine prevailed.  I've been depressed since before I was old enough to express and understand it. I've lost 2 children. Haven't ever been able to keep friends. I have been married for 20 years and that is teetering on the brink. Found myself thinking about suicide a lot and it scared me. I had one friend left who I confided in. She told me people who are going to kill them selves don't talk about it and then a day later told me she had decided to eliminate me from her life. Shoulda kept my mouth shut it was kinda nice having a friend. My husband is fed up with all my issues. When I told him what I was thinking he just kinda shrugged and walked away. So here I am broke trying to find the money for a helium tank because I'm too much of a coward to hang myself and the local bridge put up a damn suicide barrier. Like I said not sure why I'm here, just wanted some one out there to know.
