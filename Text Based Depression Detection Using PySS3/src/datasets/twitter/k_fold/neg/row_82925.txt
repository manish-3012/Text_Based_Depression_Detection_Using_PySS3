Trouble opening upOkay so Iâ€™m writing this after deleting an hours worth of writing that I was about to post here. Iâ€™ve always had trouble with opening up to people about my mental state and well being.
Around my friends Iâ€™m a rather comedic person, and I feel like Iâ€™m nothing to them but a â€œfunny guy.â€ I really like the comedic side of me ( I donâ€™t mean to sound like Iâ€™m boasting) but thereâ€™s also a side of me that Iâ€™ve  never shown to anyone. For about a year now, Iâ€™ve been suicidal I guess you could say. I feel empty and numb and I want to disappear off this earth but at the same time I feel like I have an obligation to stay alive because I actually do have friends that would be sad if i left. Anyway because Iâ€™ve never had an outlet, for a while I resorted to self harm. When I did it it felt like a way to relieve my mental pain by channeling it to physical pain. Anyway i havent self harmed in about a year but I feel like every day I get closer and closer to relapsing.
