I planned to hang myself today.My road to depression started when I was 16 without knowing it. As my parents are from a foreign country and are raised in a different generation where religion always was involved, its more difficult to talk about mental illness. So I just kept it inside me and just thought "This is who I am". Everything I did was wrong and I never lived for myself but for others.

I graduated from high school and I went to college and that's where my downfall began. 

My social skills back then were so bad. My first day at college, we had to introduce eachother and I started sweating. My forehead was wet and so was my back and chest only for talking to someone I didn't know. Now I know this was about my lack of SELF CONFIDENCE.

I failed my first year at college which didn't bother me. I went from college to uni to SATISFY my parents knowing damn well I wasn't capable of succeeding at such a high level. Making DRASTIC DECISIONS was something I would always do because of stress and fear. 

I obviously failed again, still went to uni and
I went to study IT because my parents thought I was good with computers which was true. Thing is I never wanted to do such things but I never wanted to tell them because I was ANXIOUS and I didn't want to disappoint them. I wanted to do something with editing, design and so on. That was my passion which I did on YT but it was too late in my eyes. 

I failed again and I kept FAILING. I am a failure and that's where I started thinking about suicide. I started getting ANXIOUS about everything which lead to ISOLATING myself and refusing to eat after arguments with my parents, destructive lying about school and money and cutting off friendships.

Today, I wanted to hang myself. I had a cable around my neck and I stood by a tree. It was raining a little bit and as I pulled it started raining much harder and I was telling myself I had to die. I couldn't do it so I pulled the cable from my neck and the rain stopped.

This indicated that I had to keep going but I hope I can overcome this illness.
