The person I tried to open up to left me on read.I donâ€™t know what I expected. 

â€œRelationshipâ€/unrequited love problems and general suicidal thoughts incoming. Iâ€™m sorry for the semi-incoherent ramble. Iâ€™m so tired.

I just told the guy Iâ€™m in love with about how Iâ€™ve been feeling. He does not like emotionally fueled conversations and I let him know that, even though I felt bad about venting to him, he was the only person Iâ€™d care to open up to precisely because he is lead by logic so much more and I needed his rational thoughts.

I told him that Iâ€™ve been feeling like Iâ€™m a worthless waste of space who canâ€™t live life unless someone is holding their hand and guiding them through it, telling them what to do. I feel like I have no purpose other than doing whatever I can or is required of me in order to make other people happy.

I donâ€™t have a job. Iâ€™m not going to school anymore. I feel like I have no more direction or purpose and no ambitions of my own (other than â€œdo what other people think Iâ€™m useful forâ€). 

Even though I know that it isnâ€™t right for me to depend on other people, I know nothing else. And ever since meeting this guy and falling in love with him I have made it my purpose to make him happy.

He reassured me our feelings were mutual and he told me he loved me before I told him. But he was not ready to make anything official despite that.

Long story short, I realized that his love is just very conditional. He isnâ€™t willing to put in the effort. And even though he could love me if all obstacles were removed, he does not care enough to make me a priority. By the time I realized this I was in love.

I feel like Iâ€™ve lost my purpose because of it. If I canâ€™t make him happy, what else am I supposed to do? 

Iâ€™m too (socially) anxious and depressed to look for a job. He motivated me enough to actually want to go and do it, though. That motivation is now gone. 

I feel like Iâ€™m just waiting to die or to be saved. Whatâ€™s the point in being alive if I have to depend on others to give my life any sort of meaning at all?

I only told him that I was feeling worthless and suicidal. Not about the depending on him; I feel pathetic enough admitting that to myself. Despite that, in the middle of me opening up to him, he stopped replying for over an hour.

Even though I told him I wanted to die.
Even though I told him I only cared about his support.

It just confirms my fears of being nothing but a nice temporary distraction to him even though I stupidly let myself decide to love him unconditionally.

I feel lost and useless.
