Gonna do it tomorrow. I'm pretty stokedI left a had job to join another bad job. Ridden with debt and outcasted by my family. Living on my car. I've done all I could and it's dead end after dead end after dead end. Even psychologists have a grim outlook on my future happiness. I have done all I could with optimism and patience and perseverance. But, my circumstances have proven themselves too strong for my will to continue. I'm pretty stoked because I know I put my all into my life. Now that I have exhausted all avenues and am yet at another dead end. I'm like fuck it, I don't feel like living anymore. Don't want to find a good job anymore (already landed it and it's with shitty people), don't want to eat good food anymore (had my fair share of delish foods), don't want to live in my car anymore (it's not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be). I'm just done. I'm ready to go home.
