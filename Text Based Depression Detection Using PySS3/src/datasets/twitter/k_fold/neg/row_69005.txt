The right choiceSo for some time I've thought about taking my life and as the days go by it seems more and more like the right choice even tho deep down I know it's not. I won't go too deep into why cause I'm sure you've heard it all before plus as many times as I state why, psychiatrists, therapists it doesn't change the fact of how I feel after all of it. As I was saying, days go by, no matter how much I do to change myself, create new memories and forget, I can't. I'm not looking for anyone to tell me it's all gonna be ok, I just want to know that I'm truly not alone, I want someone to know that I exist if that makes any sense.
