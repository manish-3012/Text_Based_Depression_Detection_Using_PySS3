You have helped me.Hello, to everyone who is here to help and everyone who is here to seek help. You've all collectively helped me get a little better. You've helped me get to the point where I picked up my hobby and life's ambition, writing a book. 

I never wanted to die, I wanted the opposite. I wanted to live forever. To me there was never a point to life unless I could live forever. Why bother if you're going to die anyway? This thought just kept repeating in my mind "You're going to die. You're going to die. Could be tomorrow, could be today, death is waiting for you." It just made me long for it. Just get it over with, please, make it quick. 

You people have helped me realise that perhaps all's not lost. If I write my book then perhaps I can create something of a lasting legacy. The book I'm writing is mostly about my mind, about my beliefs and about my struggle. I've warped these themes into a story and I hope I can finish it one of these days. 

Perhaps if the legacy of my conscience and my mind can live on long after I decay, then I can be immortal. All my life, I just wished I could be the last human being on earth, living long after the last human dies. It is the ultimate comfort for me, that thought. I've had this wish since a very early age. It's nothing of a God-complex. It's just knowing that human life has been concluded. That everyone has had their spill at life and some have had fun. I want to be there to see it end. 

Anyway, you guys helped me towards achieving a fraction of that dream. I hope that if a publisher likes it enough to publish it, the bookworms among you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it. I will definitely update should that be the case. 

In any case, thanks for listening and thanks for doing what you're doing.
