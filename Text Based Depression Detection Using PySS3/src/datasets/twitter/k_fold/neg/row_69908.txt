I don't even know what to do anymoreI am in my early twenties, and I fucking hate myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. Therapy isn't helping the way I thought it would, and neither is my Prozac. It feels like none of this shit matters. This time last year, I was still depressed, but I had someone in my world that made things so much easier to deal with on a daily basis. She was everything I ever wanted. My love life had been miserable my entire dating life. We went to the same high school, where she hated me, and we reconnected years later when I was in my fourth year of university. We shouldn't have both been in the bar that night as she didn't even go to my school or live in the city that my school was located in, but we were. She made me realize what I wanted to do with my life, and gave me a reason to want to get out of bed for the first time in years. It was blissful. Of course we had our problems, but who doesn't?

I broke up with her because of the distance in January while she pleaded for me not to. When I realized I made a mistake less than 24 hours later, I guess one day was enough for her to realize that I wasn't what she wanted or that I didn't deserve her love or whatever it was. My heart shattered into a million pieces, and now all I have left to show for it are mementos of things we did. I have them tucked away in a box that I never open, but I just know they're there. I walk around the city that we're both from and I see places that we visited and things that we did. I hear her voice in my head every single day. I'm fucking tired of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have things I want to do in my life. I have goals and dreams, but I just don't REALLY care anymore. I know I have the capability to do great things, but none of those things can fill the void that she left. I tried so hard to make things right but nothing was enough. Tomorrow is her brother's wedding and she's back in town for it. I can't stop thinking about it now, and I know that it won't change when it passes either. My day tomorrow will be filled with tears and sorrow and it doesn't fucking matter what I do because it'll all be the same. No amount of positive thinking or mindfulness is going to change anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I tell people how I feel, they tell me that things will get better, but what if they don't? What if I'm never that happy again? I don't doubt that there's someone out there that can make me feel the way she did, but I don't want anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could have been so much better, and it's too late. I fucking blew it. I want to die every single fucking day. I wake up and hope that I get hit by a truck or an asteroid or that I go to take a breath and can't get any more air. I don't cut myself, but I sure as fuck want to, and I don't do hard drugs, but it seems like this might be a decent time to start. I know everyone is going to advise me against it, but at this point, the shorter this life is, the happier I'll be.

I always hear that people who commit suicide are selfish for doing so, but I don't understand why. I know that I can make people sad or fuck people up, but if they just could really understand how I feel, I don't think that they would view me in such a negative light. These people wouldn't last a week in my head. I know everyone goes through their own shit, but it's been a good decade of feeling like this and the past six months have only made it exponentially harder. Nothingness seems like the bliss I've been missing not only for the last six months, but the last ten years.
