The world is a mess. I just want to contribute something good.Does anyone else have the problem of feeling like their lives don't matter and that everyone hates them? I've started to appreciate the ideas of Ted kaczynski, aka the unabomber, who was a Stanford professor that became obsessed with the idea that technology had ruined everything. I agree with him. Technology and maybe a few other things is what led to this mass unemployment/welfare state we have now. When people can't get jobs and don't have the opportunity to be a contributing member of society, they inevitably feel like their lives don't matter and enter a suicidal death spiral. I dropped out of high school due to bullying so obviously my job prospects have been minimal. I just wish we could go back to the ancient past, like as far back as mesopotamia. Does anyone else feel this way or am I just turning into a raving nut?
