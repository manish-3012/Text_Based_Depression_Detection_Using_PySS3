How do you care about something when you know it's ultimately pointless?I've accepted that suicide is inevitable. Life is miserable and I've tried everything to make it better. It will only get worse as I get older. I've done years of therapy and medication and programs. Life remains miserable, painful, and pointless. 

Right now I take care of my mom, who has a lot of health problems. I'm all she has. There's no one else to take care of her and we can't afford for her to be in a nursing home. She doesn't deserve to suffer the loss of child or have to be neglected. 

Basically, I'm waiting for her to die so I can kill myself. I don't know when that will be. For the time being, I have to be alive. 

I'm working on assignments for incomplete college classes. I'm finding it extremely difficult to work on or finish anything. I know that the work is pointless. I know it won't mean anything or improve my life in any way to do it. I have no desire to do it. And I'm pretty hopeless about even passing these classes even if I do the work. I've already had two professors change their mind about accepting it. I'm trying to get them to reconsider, but hopeless about that as well. If they don't accept it, I don't finish school. Financially we're totally fucked, so there's not an option to retake the classes. 

I don't have a desire to finish. I don't aspire to anything. I'm just waiting to die. Rationally, I know it would be better to finish the classes, so I could qualify for some better job opportunities. I feel like I can't find any incentive, no matter what I tell myself or what scenarios I imagine, nothing encourages or motivates or inspires me to the work. 

I'm going to be miserable no matter what I do, so why bother? I gave up on life a long time ago. I can't get myself to want anything other than death. It's why I couldn't finish these classes in the first place. 

Before I die, I do think I'd like to finish this. The trouble I've had with school has caused me a lot of pain. It's definitely a significant factor in my decision to commit suicide and feelings of hopelessness. 

That's not the right thing either though. I still don't care.
