Two failed attempts..shaken.Tonight I attempted suicide..both attempts failed and I was going to attempt again in desperation..but I took time to think about have decided against suicide.

My main issue now is that I WANT to tell my parents about my depression, social anxiety etc. that led up to this, but im not sure how they'll react. 

Any advice welcome
