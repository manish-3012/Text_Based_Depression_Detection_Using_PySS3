26. No hope left. There's nothing I can do anymore.Since I was born, my parents were never there for me, never had a gift, a hug or a kiss from my parents.

I was beaten, bullied and abused Since day 1 of school until the last day of 9th grade. No one cared, no one blinked an eye. Nothing. I was meaningless to anyone.

In High School I met a girl, whom I became enchanted by. Never thought her, but I became quite obsessed, guess that's what happens when you have the worst possible childhood.

Like my childhood wasn't enough, I had to become quite ill by college. Always tired and in pain. I don't know how I graduated. No one cared about me, I did everything I could but no one cared about how I felt, how much it was hurting me. 

Finally I had surgery, but since I was angry because they way I was treated, I was forced to a mental institution, and they gave me drugs and I've taken every kind of antipsychotic and antidepressants, and every one made me progressively worse.

Everyone hates me, I have no drive to do anything. I'm all day in my room. All I do is cry. I wanted to be so much more, nobody had the right to take that away from me.
