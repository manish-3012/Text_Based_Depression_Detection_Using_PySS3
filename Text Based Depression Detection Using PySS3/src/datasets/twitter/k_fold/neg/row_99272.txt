Iâ€™m done lyingIâ€™m so tired of my job. Iâ€™ve been lying to my friends for years. I havenâ€™t been honest with myself and who I am. I am in a loveless marriage that is going nowhere. I want to die every waking moment. I have become an alcoholic and a drug attic and hide it every day and put a smile on my face to help others. Every moment of my life is constant pain and I donâ€™t see any way to end it without hurting other people. I just want to sleep and go to bed forever. I donâ€™t know how to recover. Financially I canâ€™t survive on my own and mentally I donâ€™t know how to bounce back from this. Iâ€™m just so tired of fighting. 

Iâ€™m 29. Own a home with SO (35) and live a constant lie. Mid career professional seemingly have it all but I just want to die. Iâ€™m so deeply unhappy I donâ€™t know if I could Eder leave or start over. I feel like I only live to keep others happy or content. I just donâ€™t think I can keep going much longer.
