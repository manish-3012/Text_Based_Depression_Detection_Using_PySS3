I cant go onIm going to say my goodbyes soon. No one will miss me so it wont matter if i die. Im already invisible. No one will notice im even gone. No one cares about me. I cant do this anymore. My only friend that i thought cared doesn't talk to me so what reason do i have to live anymore. I was only staying alive for that one friend. I didn't tell her that though. I have the note, and everything ill need, now i just need to say goodbye
