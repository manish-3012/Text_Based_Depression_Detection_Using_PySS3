Friend keeps making brief remarks about suicideOne of my lifelong childhood friends (20/m) fell into a deep bout of depression over the past few months - he quit his job and became a NEET and has accrued a decent amount of debt and doesn't leave his house. He does not care about finding a job anymore and has become very lazy and has absolutely no self esteem.

He's told me a couple of times that he sometimes wants to kill himself but he is a very emotionally distant and non-intimate guy, so any time I try to get him to talk about his feelings he quickly changes the subject. The first time he did this (years ago) I told his parents and they did absolutely nothing. Didn't even talk to him. The second time, I emailed his dad and still, nothing. The only thing they have said to him is "We hope you will reach out for help from Jesus." He's a dignified atheist, so this literally infuriates him and he has a lot of spite towards his parents because of this.

I don't know what to do. He has no desire to seek help and he will not talk about his emotions. He's never been the one to open up to people - I have known him for almost a decade. 

Any advice would be immensely appreciated.
