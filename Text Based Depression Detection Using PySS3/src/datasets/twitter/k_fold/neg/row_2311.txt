sick, sick foreverI don't even wish to be healthy anymore, I just wish to not be in pain. I just wish to sleep. I can only rest when I'm full of drugs. I'm not a person, I'm just an incubator for a disease. Every waking moment, of which there are far too many, is spent on the disease. There's no help. No one gives a shit. They can't even imagine the suffering. Even if they could, it would still just be my problem, not theirs. I just want the pain to stop. I wish every night to never wake again. There's no hope. I can't go on, I'm forced to go on. I don't really want to die, I just want the suffering to end. But for me there's only one way to end it. This life feels like unpaid over time.
