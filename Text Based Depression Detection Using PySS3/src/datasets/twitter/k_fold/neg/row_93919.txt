Just So TiredHey friends. I'm posting here bc I'm not sure what else to do. I haven't felt this bad in years, and my usual coping methods aren't working. I'm not going to actually do anything to hurt myself, mainly bc I know it would destroy my little sister's life. She's literally the most important person in my life and I can't have her be hurt. I just feel like I'm going to let everyone down just by being myself. I'm 21 and I'm not bragging, but I have a really good job and career path. However this is so scary to me. Everyone has such high expectations of me and I have so much responsibility I can't do it! I just want to sleep forever. I have a really high stroke risk due to the type of migraines I get, and since w my life insurance I'm literally worth more dead than alive, I can't stop thinking about how much better off everyone would be without me. I have amazing friends and literally the best boyfriend in the world, but I just don't deserve them. I know they love me but for some reason I just can't feel it. Everything's all numbed out. I just want to sleep and not wake up. I know I'm annoying my friends and acting weird and I'm trying so hard to keep all this shit from them, and I thought maybe posting it here would be a relief but idk lol. thanks :)
