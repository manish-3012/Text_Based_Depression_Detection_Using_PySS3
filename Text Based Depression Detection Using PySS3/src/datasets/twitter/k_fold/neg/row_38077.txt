Hey so I'm sad and I want to dieI really want to die. Ever since I was little Every time I fucked up there was this voice in the back of my head that was always like well you'll just get it right next time. But not next time like you'll get another chance but next time like the next time you're alive. Like without giving it a second thought or questioning it I would always just think next time I love ill get it right. Well right now I'm just in a bad place. I hate myself. I made mistakes with some people and now I don't have friends some because of that mistake and others because they wanted me to be someone I wasn't. I have one friend but she doesn't know how much she means to me I just love her as a friend but she started talking to some of my old friends and kind of stopped talking to me as much almost at all. I don't know. I just want to die. Like when I think about me dying it actually makes me feel calm. I'm exhausted. With life. Growing up my brother was an addict and he would beat my mom. When I was old enough around 9th grade I thought I could step in and defend her but he knocked me out with a pinch to the ear and even now years later I can't hear anything out if it. He's in prison now. He has a son that my parents take care of I love my nephew. I've always felt lost. Like this life was a mistake. I wish the decision was easier. I feel like honestly there is nothing wrong with me wanting to die and I should be allowed to. But the same people who make me feel bad everyday and ignore me well if I died they would be sad and I don't want that. I don't want anybody to hurt. But I don't want to hurt either.
