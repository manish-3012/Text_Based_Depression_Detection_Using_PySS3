The only way outI really feel like there is no way out...To most, it seems I donâ€™t have it that bad. And that contributes to one of the reasons Iâ€™m feeling this way. But most days I wish something bad would happen to me. Or I think of ways to end it. I have a plan. But I feel like my long term partner cares, but end of the day... would it make a difference? If I leave Iâ€™ll be miserable. If I stay, Iâ€™ll be indifferent. Iâ€™ve lost my independence. My job and my life revolves around my Instagram account. Itâ€™s my livelihood. I canâ€™t get away. If I do Iâ€™ll be broke. I canâ€™t go back to where I used to be. But itâ€™s all too much. I work with my long time partner/boyfriend. He loves me to death. Very selfless and caring. But also controlling in a way he doesnâ€™t want to ever let me be alone. I know itâ€™s dangerous out there. But I can never just voice my opinion without being overwritten. Iâ€™m stuck. And the only way out is death.
