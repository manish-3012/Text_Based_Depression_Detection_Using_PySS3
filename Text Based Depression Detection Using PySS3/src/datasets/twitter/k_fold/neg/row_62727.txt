hanging by a stringThoughts of commiting Suicide comes to me every now end then. I cant even look at myself in the mirror , whenever I look at my self in mirror , question comes to everytime - "Why are even alive ?".

 I am 24 and didn't achieved much in my life, not even graduate till now . No Job either .I kept on failing in my exams .I let my family down on many occasions. They also have to listen from everyone because of me .I am the only one idiot in my family , even younger cousins in my family  have a job or at least they are doing something meaningful . I am idiot. I get confused very easily and take terrible decisions all the time ,that makes things even worse for me. I don't love myself .I just hate myself , I hate me , I hate me , I hate me.

My family is very poor , I am just keeping myself alive because I feel if I die that makes things even worse for them. I dont know what to say next . I am sorry.
