Why do I find it easier to help others instead of myself?Iâ€™m very suicidal and plan on killing myself relatively soon. Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve accepted and almost look forward to in a sad way. But for some reason whenever I see someone else who is suicidal and depressed I feel sympathy and want to help. I want to give advice and see them get better. I donâ€™t want to see other people end their lives early but Iâ€™m fine with doing it myself. Itâ€™s weird and hypocritical ik. I guess I understand that feeling of not having anyone to talk to or rely on that led me to where I am now.
