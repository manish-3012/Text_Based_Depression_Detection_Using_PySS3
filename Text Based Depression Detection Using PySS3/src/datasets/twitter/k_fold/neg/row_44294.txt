Looking for someone to end this existence with. Take the trip out of here with me.I just joined Reddit im suicidal and i was looking up legal euthanasia on google anyway i saw a post with a kid who was committing suicide in two weeks and offered to pick anyone up who wanted to go with him. So i was down and i just joined hoping to connect with him and go for it. Unfortunately his post was over a year old. Two weeks later he never messaged again. He did it and im looking to end it myself but want to end it with someone or multiple people who are serious about ending it and want to work with me to do it as painlessly as possible. Hit me up if your done with this plane of existence and want to escape your body and consciously travel to the next world. I do believe in reincarnation and believe every end is just a new beginning.
