Why not?Why the fuck not? Why shouldn't I kill myself???

Life is all about  just making/ chasing enjoyable distractions for ourselves until our inevitable death. Its just so empty. Academics. Socializing. Jobs. Money. All of them feel so meaningless. How does any of this get better? I've been through years of meds and therapy to no avail. My resolution is the same. In fact, its only worsened.

Why the fuck should i continue without anything to live for...
