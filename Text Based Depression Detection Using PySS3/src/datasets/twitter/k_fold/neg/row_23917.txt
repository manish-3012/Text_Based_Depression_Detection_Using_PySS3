I've created a plan and that scares me.I've dealt with depression before, including taking antidepressants at one point in high school. I thought that was all behind me, though, and that I was back to a mentally healthy state, but now, five years later, things have been getting worse again.

Before this past week, my worst moment was when I had a fleeting thought of suicide back in high school. But as the moment was occurring it scared me so much that I completely pushed it out of my mind. But on Wednesday, I was sitting in the middle of one of my college classes and came up with a plan. I wasn't even freaking out or anything, I just calmly came up with something that would work well. I've also been unable to hold myself back from thinking about cutting myself, but thankfully I haven't actually started that again.

I keep telling myself that I need to talk to one of the college counselors, and that I need to tell my super supportive boyfriend about the plan and thoughts of self-harm, but I can't bring myself to do that. He's the only one that knows I'm at the lowest place I've ever been before, and he's always willing to talk with me and try to help me in an unjudgemental way but I feel like I can't talk to him about this because I'm scared it will hurt him. I'm also scared that my depression will end up dragging him down, too. I'm afraid of repeating what happened to my mom when my biological father was going through his depression. I don't want to hurt him. I just want to be better.

And I think that might also be the only thing holding me back from going through with the plan I created.
