This might be goodbye.Hi there.

I'm not good with words at all but I'll try my best.

I've been suffering from depression for most of my life,getting worse as time goes on (also Autism,hate me all you want, I don't care anymore.)

My family sees me as a dissapointment and a failure,saying that I'm a disgrace as a person and that I should be ashamed of myself for turning out how I did,with desire to kick me out even,I have no job,no money, and nowhere to go, I have nothing.

I'm not on medication and the therapists and counselors I've talked to haven't helped me at all.

I had two friends that I loved to dearest to my heart but I'm about to lose them.(cause of my depression driving them away and them not wanting to be with me for the same reason.)

I frequently have anxiety attacks where I just start breaking down and crying for what appears as no reason. (One of those cost me my friends.)

Most people I know irl don't like me (a few even telling me to go kill myself)

I'm giving myself till sometime in December/January for things to be better but after that,if things don't then I'm done.

I've already tried to kill myself twice,might as well go for a third.

I already have an idea on how to do it (probably an exit bag,I've tried pills before but obviously those didn't work.)

To those that tried to help me, thank you so much and I'm sorry I'm such a failure that I can't beat this.

If my friends are reading this,then I'm sorry, I love ya'll with the bottom of my heart and I'm sorry I was such a worthless piece of trash,undeserving of any love that I drove you away.

Anyone want to talk to me right now,go right ahead I'll try to respond,I don't expect it though :(.
