I can't find anything redeeming about myselfEverything I can do, someone else does better.  My grades are absolutely shit compared to everyone else in the school I go to.  My parents pressure me a lot about the SAT's, the classes I take, my grades, and college.  I hate this so much.  I hate being surrounded by girls prettier and smarter and generally more talented than me.  My brother is the special one in the family, and my parents are planning on sending him to a Catholic middle/high school because he is so devoted to baseball, at the expense of his grades.  My mom yells at him almost every night for forgetting an assignment or failing a test, and I get to hear all of it.  I can't talk to any of my parents because one of them is Chinese and the other is American, which makes it hard for me to relate to them.  My dad is so smart and I feel that I can't live up to him (MIT grad, MBA from Berkeley).  The few who I do talk to don't know that I fantasize about suicide and self harm.  It feels like nobody cares.
