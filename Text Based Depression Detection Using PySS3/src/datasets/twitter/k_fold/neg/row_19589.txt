I don't know.Do we all matter in the long run? Are we just meant toâ€¦. die? Idk but I wanna die. My depression has peaked to the point where cutting myself doesnâ€™t give me pain. To be honest I kinda like it. It feels nice and the pain gives me warmth. Like a hug. A niceâ€¦.. warmâ€¦.. hug. Its kinda like a drug. You know it isnâ€™t good for u. but it feels nice, nice on the inside but in my case on the outside too.

Idk where im going with my depression. Guess im just, waiting, allowing it to fuel itself to help me not be afraid of death. But I feel im close. The next trigger is probably the one. Idek who I should go to for help. I donâ€™t want to go to my friends because I donâ€™t want to be known as the kid who wanted to kill himself. I know they wont say it infront of me, but I would know, that more people would get to know and I would be called out for giving up.

Guess im just, waiting, for the next trigger now, by finding new spots to cut myself. Im tired of screaming for help, mom just says the problem is there but now what can we do about it. Fuck my dad, coz he is the problem. I donâ€™t want to stay here. I might just, run away, but I guess im too scared to do that aswell. Idk what I should do to solve this. I just, donâ€™t fucking know.
