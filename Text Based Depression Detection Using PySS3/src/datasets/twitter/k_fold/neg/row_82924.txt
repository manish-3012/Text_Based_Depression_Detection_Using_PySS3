Sometimes I regret not killing myself when I was younger...I've been depressed for a seriously long time. I always thought it'd get better but instead it only gets worse. I wish I would've just ended this in high school before I had any friends to give a shit.

In the 10 years since high school I've managed to get a worthless degree, 1 girlfriend that was toxic, rejected at least 10 times. Ghosted by friends countless times. I'm not nothing but a worthless piece of shit that didn't take the hint a decade ago and suffered for it. I'm too ugly to make a family, too stupid to help myself and surrounded by friends and family who care but it only makes me feel worse. I wish they'd let me end it...
