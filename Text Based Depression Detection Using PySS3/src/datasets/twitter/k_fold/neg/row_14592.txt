Life just feels pointless.I'm a high school student. I hate my job. I have no friends. I sit at home alone all day whenever I'm not working. I'm not good or talented at anything. I have anxiety that makes it so fucking hard to develop relationships with people and just genuinely afraid of everything.

But for the past week I just feel dead almost numb. Why should I live for 70 more years working myself to death, I know I will never find love I'm butt ugly. I can't make friends. I just don't see why i should stick around just to be in this lonely bubble of mine. 

I've never ever considered killing myself until tonight.
