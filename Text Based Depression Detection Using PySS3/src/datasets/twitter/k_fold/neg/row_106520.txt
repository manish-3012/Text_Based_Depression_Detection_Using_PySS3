i dont know how to live with myselfive always been scared of everything, ever since i was a baby. this is natural, i know, but i never got over it, i cant swallow pills, i cant keep my head underwater, i cant choke myself out. only recently have i gotten over my fear of cuts but even so all i can do is little scratches that only bleed a little, pathetic little fucking scratches that dont even capture a fraction of what i wanna do to myself

ive caused so much pain to others, i cant better myself, no matter what i try to do to better myself i cant do it, ill be called an asshole, ill have to hide in bathrooms on lunch breaks because nobody wants to talk to my dumbass. i dont know how to deal with people and i dont even have the option to kill myself

my friends!! why are they still there!! im such a shit friend, i dont know how to talk to people!! i can almost guarantee you people are only friends with me because im that one person its fun to make fun of, to shit talk. "oh, hey, you know my "friend" animalcrossing2019? guess what he said!! what a fucking dumbass, i hate him"

its so easy to guilt me, im so fucking scared of everything, but life has become so monotonous

i cant even do the things i enjoy cause ive gotten so shit at the only thing i can do halfway decent lately, and anything i try to pick up i'll manage to fuck up entirely. im talentless!! im boring!!! ill never amount to anything, ill never be able to die when i want out of pure fucking fear and guilt

im just living life hoping to be hit by a car

peace
