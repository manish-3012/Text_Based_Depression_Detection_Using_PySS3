Killing myselfSo yeah this is it. Sick of all the problems, loneliness and shitty thoughts. I've made changes, but I still feel like crap. No one loves me and yeah, people don't seem to love sad people like me. I'm downing 10 zyrtec tablets (it's the only pills I have). I hope it gets the job done. Peace.
