Feeling certain that I should go with itI'm honestly tired, tired of failing,  tired of being a failure and a disappointment, tired of not loving those I should, and tired of hurting those around me, I'm tired of antidepressants that don't work, and of coke that takes the edge  off wanting to end it for just a few hours,  tired of the oblivion of alcohol, and of the mistakes you can claim on the next morning,  tired of the everlasting physical fatigue,  tired of the eternal overwhelming emotions, tired of my aspergers,  tired of my anxiety,  tired of my depression,  and tired of being disappointed every morning I successfully wake up, and each of those mornings makes me more tired than the one before it, I'm tired, of being tired
