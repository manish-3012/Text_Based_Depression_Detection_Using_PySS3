Im going to kill myself. I'm just not sure howIm a 29 year old female and made some bad choices due to alochol in January. That mistake hurt some of the most important people in my life. It was an accident and I didn't mean to. However it's my fault and when it comes out it will be unforgivable. I rented a hotel room and tried to hang myself with an exersise band. Kinda like Chris cornell did but it didn't work.. 

I've never hated anyone more than myself.. I really just wanna hang myself and call it a day but i don't know how to make a noose and there's nothing around me that's gonna hold my weight. I don't think.. Im gonna try self strangulation. If not the only option left is buying a gun and shooting myself through the mouth. I just hope it actually works

I just need tips. Please someone help me end it
