I need help...I'm a 15 year old female in the United States. I have cerebral palsy and I am on the autism spectrum. I just feel comfortable giving my life story so people understand my mindset. My life has always been hell, my childhood I grew up with verbally and psychically abusive brothers. I had to watch my mother drop dead in front of me from a heart attack at the age of 10, my dad was at work. I had lost all my friends and 2 years ago I was raped by one of my old friends. I started smoking cigarettes because they helped but then they didn't so I resorted to self harm. That didn't help so I tried dating. I met a nice guy but he was abusive. I soon met a nice guy I'm still currently with but I was toxic and mean to him and I managed to fix everything. I don't want to hurt anyone but I don't want to be the problem anymore. I need someone to talk to. I need a friend. I'm too scared to talk to someone I know in real life.
