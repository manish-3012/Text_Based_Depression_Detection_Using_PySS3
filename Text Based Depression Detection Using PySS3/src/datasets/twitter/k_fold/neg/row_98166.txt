Is there an answer?Why isnt there ever anyone to talk to, too have a real conversation with. Ive tried sharing my thoughts and problems with what seems like everyone in my life, they all just say dont do it or it gets better. It Doesnt get better it's been declining for years, I don't know why I haven't had success yet. But I guess it's my fault for trying to get help from people who dont know how. But theres the question, are there answers, are they're people who dont just regurgitate the same lines to "make you feel better" are there people who will talk about this problem like it's a normal problem. Is there some kind of therapist or somthing I dont know about? Is there anything? Or am I just another lost cause. I understand that it's scary to people who haven't felt any way like this or even the ones who have but why is everyone too scared to just have a conversation?
