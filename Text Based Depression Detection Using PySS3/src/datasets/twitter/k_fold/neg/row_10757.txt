beyond terrifiedI let the stress of my phobias pile up until I snapped with a manic episode, thus losing everything from myself to the only person and friend I had in real life. For whatever reason, the cycle's once again repeating even though I've only had a month since the comedown. I'm back to pacing my room every single night and the doom n gloom seems impossible to escape. People have attempted to reach out to me but I already feel so dead on the inside that I think the idea of making them put up with the remaining shell is troublesome and I'm better off disappearing, so I do. 

I lost the person I feel safest with. I think I've cried every single night for the past 4 months\-\- my eyes are beyond dry and experiencing symptoms themselves. I've been to the eye doctor and everything but the trouble with them doesn't stop because obviously crying is the culprit and I seriously can't stop haha. I can't stop, and I can't stop being afraid. For my vision. For myself. For being alone. For not having anyone, anywhere to go. There is a constant fear eating at me. My medication isn't responding properly and I'm too agoraphobic to even think about the psychiatric waiting room or mental hospital right now. I can't handle the thought of already being so scared and then getting thrown into a busy world with people prodding at me, asking me questions I don't want to answer out loud right now. 

I am so stuck and afraid. So alone. Stupid anxiety and stupid tears. Sleep is just an abstract concept at this point and so is the idea of ever not being by myself again.
