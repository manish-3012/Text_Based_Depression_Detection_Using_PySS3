Please give me a reason to liveThe woman I love, also my best and only friend in the world, is sleeping with another man. I hate my major and am sick just thinking about the career to follow, but I can't back out. I live in constant pain because of ankylosing spondylitis. I've called the hotline and seen a therapist and it's done no good. I have 10 grams of liquid nicotine ready to ingest, which is 10 times the estimated lethal dose. I need a reason to not abandon my little brother and sister, please give me some kind of alternative. For years my spirit has been fighting a war against my mind and body and I just don't want to fight anymore
