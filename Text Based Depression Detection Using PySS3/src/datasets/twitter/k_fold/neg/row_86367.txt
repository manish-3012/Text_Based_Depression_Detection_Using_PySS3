Need someone to talk withI think I just need to talk with someone who's going through the same situation - depression, suicidal thoughts, feeling like there's no point in living... I just think normal healthy people can't relate and don't like you to bring this sort of stuff to the conversation. I'm 24 male, unemployed, no future in sight, made terrible and stupid decisions in my life... I was such an idiot, took a worthless college degree and now I feel stuck... I don't really wanna die but I don't want to live either. I know, it's such a conundrum.

I'm poor asf, I feel like I don't even have money to have friends and I'm so depressed that I don't even care about getting a SO, in fact, I think I'm an aromatic asexual, so I don't even have that going for me... 

Nothing brings me joy, I'm filled in despair and the future seems pretty bleak. I'm afraid I'll become homeless or something... Die in the slums... And no one will care, no one will help me, this a stupid, cold and cruel world. 

I feel like my life is doomed one way or another anyway... Am I being over-dramatic? Probably... But I'm desperate.
