My brother told me he wants to die and that he has no reason to live, I need help fast, Reddit. You might help save someone's life whom I love.My older brother is 27 years old and he has had it pretty tough in life. He was made fun of quite a bit growing up for being overweight, nerdy, etc... He has been diagnosed with bi-polar and he has turned to smoking weed and drinking for help over the last 6 or 7 years. He was prescribed meds by the doctor that my parents made him see, but he says they don't help him (that doesn't really surprise me, I am somewhat skeptical of anti-anxiety and anti-depression meds). He snapped today and I could tell he was in a really horrible mood. He told me that he had a dream that he had died and when he woke up he said he was disappointed that he was still alive. It about broke my heart to hear someone I love say that.

I told him he should try and ask reddit for help and he laughed in my face (through text message) and asked if that was the best advice I could give him. I told him that he was being selfish and that he didn't realize how many people he would hurt, and he says that me and my family are the ones who are being selfish because we want him to be alive when he doesn't. I want you guys to prove him wrong. I really hope reddit can come through. I don't know what else I can do. It breaks my heart knowing he is in pain, but I can't seem to do anything about it, it doesn't really seem like anyone can. He doesn't want to get help, he doesn't want advice offered. So maybe if I can convince him that hundreds of redditors have advice for him who have been in this situation or known someone in a similar situation, it might change his perspective a little bit. I am begging someone to give me something to show him to realize there is SO many reasons to live. He's at work for another 6 hours, and I am kind of convinced he might actually kill himself very soon if not tonight. I don't know what else to do as I am sitting here in my own tears typing this. I'm afraid if I tell my parents, he will just resent all of us even more and that might push him to do it that much more. Please help me

I'm sorry if I broke a rule or am not following proper reddiquette. This is my first post. I have been a lurker for sometime, but I never thought I would be posting something, especially something like this.

**edit** - I moved this from askreddit, I apologize if I did something wrong.
