I Think I Really Messed UpI just turned 18, and pretty much all I do is play guitar and sing. Iâ€™m an ok guitarist and can play a few solos, and Iâ€™m actually a really good singer (if I do say so myself). I just quit college, and a very expensive and prestigious one at that, and wasted all my parents money and Iâ€™m kinda fucked right now. 

I know my parents hate me because all I do is sit in their basement and play guitar all day, but theyâ€™d obviously never say it. Although my dad has before. Iâ€™ve never had a real job, and I have no interest in having one because I hate dealing with people and donâ€™t want to have to pretend to be happy or be something Iâ€™m not. I just wanna do something creative with my life. I donâ€™t want to be tied down and forced to live in the same area doing the same job with the same people every fucking day.

And now that Iâ€™ve hit a wall, I really have no idea what to do anymore. I feel like me being an asshole has pushed everyone away from me and nobody really cares about my bullshit anymore. I really want nothing more than to die, but I donâ€™t really want to kill myself, but I think I wouldnâ€™t hesitate if I ever even came close.
