I feel I have no friends, I am always bitter and depressed and I just want to end it allI feel I have no friends, either online or offline, I have lost them all in a set of sad coincidences that include me leaving a religion, coming out as LGBT and having only the online communities to confide in.

My parents were meant to help and support me but they just call me lazy or inactive.

I want to make friends, and feel ok in live, but I can't make friends or fit in anywhere and it has been going for 20 years now, I've been following every single friend making and fitting in tip and advice, but it's not happening, I've also been in and out of therapy for 2 years now and I am still not feeling better, I feel no advice can help me anymore, I feel threatened by every single thing and my intrusive thoughts are getting worse and worse. Why does this have to be me, I literally envy people that are popular and have friends.

Please help.
