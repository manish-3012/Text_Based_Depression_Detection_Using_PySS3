Lost brotherHello. I was alerted by some friends that my brother tried to commit suicide a few hours ago. They found out by following him (because he was saying things which made them think he might be up to something) and when they got to where he went there was emergency responders there. My brother had already been taken to a hospital and apparently is ok, but I don't know how to find him or contact him. He is 19. This is the US, CA. Not sure if contacting hospitals would help or not. Any advice appreciated.
