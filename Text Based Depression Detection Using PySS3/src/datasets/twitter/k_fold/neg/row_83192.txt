Am I worth it?Iâ€™m been suicidal for a long time, Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself plenty of times and itâ€™s never worked. And Iâ€™ve been feeling so much worse lately. No one ever tries to help me they just ignore my calls for help. I started taking meds but ran out and my parents wonâ€™t take me to get more. I think I see the ending coming and I donâ€™t know what to do.
