This afternoon, I finally told my mom the only reason iâ€™m still alive is her.Growing up, my mom told me about the stories of her stillborn, a girl..the only one she thought she would have. Two years later she had me, another 2 went by and she had my brother. I love her to much to destroy her world. 

I wake up every morning and try my hardest to put a smile on my face. I try to talk to people in class, the library, the dining hall...striking up conversations to try and fill the void. College has been the worst in experience of my life, finding myself dropping to new lows at all hours of the day. I spend all of my time in my apartment. My roommates are moving out next semester so the realities of being even more alone are hitting fast.
