You know the feeling?You know, when you just feel like disappearing into thin air. All day Iâ€™ve been on the brink of a mental breakdown. Iâ€™m trying so hard to put a smile on my face, I hate having everyone else worry about me. Iâ€™m not okay, but I donâ€™t want anyone else knowing. They donâ€™t deserve to be burdened with that. I feel sick to my stomach. I donâ€™t want to be alive. I want to just vanish off the face of the planet and never bother anyone with my existence again. I hate living.
