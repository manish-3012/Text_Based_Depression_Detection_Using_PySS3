Life's fucked, planned to kill myself, tried and couldn't go all the way with it. What the fuck do I even do now?My life is just fucked and I had everything set to finally kill myself but I just physically can't go through with it. I attempted it a year and a half ago and my best friend talked me out of it and ever since I've always had a buried hatred for the doing so. Things are just fucking ruined for me and I got part way through but I can't bring myself to do it fully.

Just what the fuck can I even do? Everything is fucked for me, no one can help me and after finally building up the courage to do it i pussy out of it and am left a mess in the middle of the shit I'm currently in.

I'm sure there's someone getting their rocks off to this sub so any effective, unable to quit, methods I can't find on google would be awesome.
