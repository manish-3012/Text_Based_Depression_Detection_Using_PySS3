Looking forward to itSuicide is looking good every day. We all go day to day hoping the next will be better but fuck that. I just want to be numb because I spend every fucking second trying to make others feel better and I get nowhere. I've stopped 3 suicides to my knowledge and honestly I question if it was right. I get it but I think I just need to float away to where people and everything else is just gone.
