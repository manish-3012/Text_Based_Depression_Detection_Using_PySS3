I just tried to to kill myself.I am a failure, i can never perform well in school and get better grades. No matter how hard i study , i just cant get more than 70% in any of my tests. Education ruined my life , i got terribly sick because of the stress from it , i lost many things in my life because of these damn grades. I study around 8 hours a day but i am unable to memorize anything. My teachers , my parents , my whole family just tells me how worthless i am all the time.

I went to my garage and tied my belt with the door knob and wrapped it around my neck and applied maximum pressure downwards, i managed to get up after like 3 or 4 seconds because i couldnt see anything , now i have this red mark around my neck.My throat hurts so bad after this attempt ,it hurts when i talk. i dont even know what to do and who am i supposed to ask for help. 
Last week i skipped school 3 days because i couldnt prepare my tests even after studying like 12 hours straight and now in this week , i skipped school yesterday and did the same today. Now i have 3 tests tomorrow and i cant prepare anything. Idk if i failed tomorrow,I will have to use my firearm. I just cant take this pressure anymore .
