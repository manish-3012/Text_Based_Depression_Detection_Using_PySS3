Would anyone care?I have great, awesome friends...but I only really see them a few times a month. I live with who I thought were friends, but they're a bunch of assholes. They use passive ways to communicate just like my abusive dad. If I died, or got hurt...would they care? Are they that heartless? I'm only an hour away from my friends, but they feel like they're on the other side of the world.
