I think people want me to dieEveryone will be better off without me being sad and lonely around them these past couple of weeks straight. I can't find anyone that likes me when I'm positive and happy and try to be friends with everyone and I know no one wants me around when I'm like this. But being like this is being myself. I am externalizing the actual despair over not having anyone and because of that no one wants me around
