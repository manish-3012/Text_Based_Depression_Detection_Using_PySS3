After giving birth In December I feel like it will be better for the baby and my husband if I were just to kill myself.I feel like I will be an awful mother. That my husband can find someone better to be their Mom. I would love to be their mom and be the best mom but I feel like just like with everything else I'll fail.I am not happy at all and haven't been for a while. I'm sick of searching for it
