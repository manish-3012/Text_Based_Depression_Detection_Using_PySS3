PTSD is gonna kill meI'm sick of being triggered by everything. I'm sick of being surrounded by the trauma, all the time, everywhere, in every way. I don't want to do it anymore. It's not getting any better. I'm in the same town and the same house and sleep in the same room. I found his Twitter and he's happy, with a girlfriend by the same name as the girl I'm trying to make things work with. I wanna die. I want people to watch me as I'm dying and tell me they wish they could've been there for me. I want them to try and save me and hurt like hell when they can't. I want my rapist to feel personally responsible for my death, and I want his girlfriend to break up with him when she hears what he did. I want to bleed all over the place, and I want people to scream and shout and condemn him for what he did to me.
