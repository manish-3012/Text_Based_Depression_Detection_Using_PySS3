I tried to overdose a couple weeks ago, going again soonA couple weeks ago i took the remainder of my pills, zyprexa and zoloft, but wasnt affected other than being really tired for a couple days. 

This time I'm going to do it right, take 400 milligrams of each, 800 in total. 

The only thing im wary about is death. Im terrified of whats beyond.
