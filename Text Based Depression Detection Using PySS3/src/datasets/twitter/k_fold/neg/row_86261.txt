I have a wonderful husband and daughter, am going back to school at the end of the month and have wonderful friends and family. I still feel like killing myself.I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD when I was around 12 and my mental health goes up and down.   Lately though I have been feeling not only depressed, but that I am going insane.  I am always talking to myself and yelling at myself in private...When something stresses me out I feel like I am just losing control.  It also doesn't help that I am scared shitless of climate change and everything being automated.  I literally have no hope for the future and it really makes me feel sorry for my daughter.   I just wish that mental illness didn't exist and I could live a normal, productive life without feeling insane.
