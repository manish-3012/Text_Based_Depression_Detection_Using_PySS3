Life is gradually losing it's meaning.Hi, I just want to talk about what's bothering me. I have all my life been that nerdy kid who was a bit weird. I am shy and extroverted at the same time, but I have always had friends. I was the science kid and had great ambitions about my future and I am musical too. I never did anything wrong and did really good in school. I never did well with the girls though. That was kind of sad, but I got over my crushes. I wasn't very popular either. Then I went on to what in my country is equivalent to high school (15/16-18/19yrs). I began studying the general subjects along with physics, chemistry and math. I really got into science and its way of thinking and I grew on that. But my self-esteem has always been low. I am very self-conscious about my appearance. I've had moderate acne since I was about 13 and am now 19. I've tried many kinds of methods and medications, but nothing worked. I am a very emotional person and tend to fall pretty hard when I fall. After I had my heart broken by the most perfect girl (yea I know, clichÃ©), things started to go downhill. I was 16 then. After that I got very focused on the meaning of life. From the scientific perspective I saw life as meaningless. We're here because universe is infinite and infinite possibilities ensures our existence. After we're dead everything we've lived for and done doesn't matter anymore. I got into that way of thinking. And then the inevitable happened: I hit the wall. I could no longer go through school with ease and without any work ethics. I began doing worse and worse in maths and physics. I felt like I was gradually losing my identity. My once so clear university plans seem to fade and I don't know who I am anymore. And of course the clichÃ© of another girl had to happen. I am hopelessly in love again. I feel like I can't be the smart physics guy anymore, but I can't be a normal person either cus I can't get a girl and have lost interest in most things. Now there is one semester left before high school is over and I feel like I'm falling apart.

Thank you for reading this. I know many might think I just whine about small details, but I just can't see that there's any meaning in living. I write this also for myself to just get it out and maybe get a new perspective of things by writing.
