Not thinking of it now maybe in the futureI just had my final exams before college and I have definitely failed them. I will have to repeat them again and the nearest school is about an hour or 45 minutes away. That means waking up early every morning getting the bus to it etc etc. Just sounds like torture. I know you might think I'm just lazy but there's more.

I used to have alot of friends and now I just have one(irl) and I talk to a few people online that's it. I don't really go out because of that and my parents just get on my case about it constantly.

As I don't go out I'm quite socially awkward I can admit that so I most likely will never get a girlfriend and be alone for the rest of my life.

The 2 thingd  that's stopped me doing it are new dog. I love him so much. And the second one seems really stupid. I want to see if my football club signs a player, Nabil Fekir. Weird right? 

So the future does not look bright for me. I'm probably going to have a shit job with no friends and no relationship. I just don't want to go through that.

I will probably end up doing it when the exam results come back. Sorry if this was long and wasted your time but thanks for reading this far.
