I read so many posts here and wonder if iâ€™m reading the last words someone ever said. And I cry, every time.I cry for all of you, for all of the people here and everywhere else who canâ€™t take anymore. Who canâ€™t live with their problems, their woes, their self doubts, their debts, their worries anxieties.

I cry because Iâ€™ve suffered for years and still am. I know how much it hurts, it all hurts so much and I would give everything I have to take away that pain, I would shoulder every burden on this planet just to see all of you smile. Because you deserve it, you deserve it for just being here.
