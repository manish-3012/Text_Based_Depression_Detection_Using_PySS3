Not sure what to look forward toNote: I don't mind if people reply to this. At the very least, I'm venting my feelings and that helps.

I'm 19m and an SNA/nurse in training. I'm sick of my life. I don't have any good excuse to kill myself other than I'm just sick and tired of life. I have a good family, decent friends, and a good education. The only thing keeping me going to date has been looking at the kids with disabilities and telling myself "If they can do it, so can I." But now I'm at a point where I'd rather not put up with things. I don't want to keep going. I can't interact with others, and when I do, it's like putting on a mask. I know them, but they don't know me. They don't know that the person who sits in their class or looks after their kids, is a self implosive time bomb ready to go. I need help. But I can't see advice helping. I don't want a counsellor. I don't want to spill out my thoughts to somebody I only met that day. Even in a good mood, I constantly have to remember "Yeah, I still want to die." Given the slightest opportunity, I'd give away my life. (Had a current problem of how to kill myself and preserve all my organs, as I would like to donate them afterward). I really do need help, and I accept that. I just don't know where to get it.
