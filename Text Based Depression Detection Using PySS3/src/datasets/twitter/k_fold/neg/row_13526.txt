House to myself tomorrow, the perfect time to end it allI am a 26 year old failure. I posted here a few days ago and managed to find a way to pull myself out of the darkness. Now I have fallen right back into even deeper than before.  I have been unemployed since October and have been unable to find work, little did I know the trade school I went to was the laughing stock on Long Island. Every heating and AC company I have applied for has laughed at my resume once they see the school I went to. I did not know if I was going to get unemployment so I went on an interview in December for a seasonal position at Macy's. They had no clue I was coming in, some 16 year old girl gave me a tour of the store and keep repeating "umm I don't know what I'm doing" so we went back to the human resources department. I filled out some forms on their computer and I was sent home being told they would call me later in the week. They never called or returned my phone calls. By some miracle I was able to get unemployment but I've been waiting for something to go wrong. Today was that day, Macy's lied to the department of labor saying I refused their offer for a job that would have ended the day after Christmas and now my unemployment benefits are suspended. I have applied for numerous other positions in every other field possible but have not gotten a single response. I have family members in management positions that could get me a job tomorrow but I am the black sheep and they refuse to help me. I'm a failure, a loser and a waste of life. My family is going to a party tomorrow and I will be all alone. It's the perfect time for me to hang myself. My family hates me, I have no friends. There is no hope when you're the black sheep. I am a damn good person but I can never ever get ahead. I don't want to live anymore I want the pain to end, and now I have my chance.
