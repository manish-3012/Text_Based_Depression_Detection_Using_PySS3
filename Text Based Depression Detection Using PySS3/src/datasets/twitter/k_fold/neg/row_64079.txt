I have only posted here a few times and hope this is ok....I have been getting really bad again.Last August I posted here and told my therapist what I posted and actually spent a week in a hospital and it did me some good.  
I go through waves of feeling great then suddenly feeling like killing myself and really wanting to go through with it.   
I also over eat and drink a ton of monster energy drinks sometimes wishing I could have a heart attack and die without it being seen as suicide.   I am abnormally scared of the future.  
I am afraid that the 
Earth will be uninhabitable in my life time,  
I am afraid that we will all become dependent on technology and lose what makes us human
I am really afraid of majoring in what 
I really want to major in (radiology) and finding out that robots have taken over

I am afraid of automated cars and hate the idea of not driving
I hate the idea of losing all my privacy
I also resent being told I am weird for liking to work with my hands, muscles and brain and not have to rely on technology.   I keep wishing that I was born in the 1950s  even though I know that is stupid.  
I also really resent being a woman too sometimes.   It sucks being weaker and more emotional.   I just feel like I will never, ever be happy.
