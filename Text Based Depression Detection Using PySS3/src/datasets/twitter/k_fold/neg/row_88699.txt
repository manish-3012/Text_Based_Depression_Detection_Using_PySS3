I'm trans and I just can't do this anymoreI'm transgender, and I've been out for a while, and my family's really supportive, but I just can't fucking take this anymore. I'm constantly upset that I don't pass for a girl, and I'm always certain that I'll never be passable. People I know always tell me I look feminine, but people I don't know completely disagree.

I always feel like complete shit, and my dysphoria is so bad that I can barely take a shower without wanting to fucking cry.

I just don't know what to do anymore, and it seems like suicide would be better than living a life where I constantly hate myself, and I'm most likely going to be raped and/or murdered. I'm just done with life.
