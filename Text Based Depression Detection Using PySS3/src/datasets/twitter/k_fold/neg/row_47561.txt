Self care sucks. What's the point?My husband still resents me. Won't even be honest about how he feels about me. My kids are still going to end up fucked up by my bullshit. I'll still be a fat balding troll with chicken skin. I still have no friends and my family has cut me out. I've been eating better, I've been going to the gym, I've been taking showers and brushing my teeth and going to bed on time and it's all fucking pointless. Just a waste of resources. I'm going to end my life soon. I have a plan, and I think I know when I'll do it.
