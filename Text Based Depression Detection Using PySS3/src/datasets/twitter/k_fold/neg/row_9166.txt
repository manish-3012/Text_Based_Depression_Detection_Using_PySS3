Honestly I just really fucking wish I didn't want to be aliveI just really wish I didn't care about how it would make other people feel. I don't say that in like a romantic out dramatic way, I just really wish I didn't know anyone that cared about me. I wish I didn't worry about how killing myself would make them feel. I don't want to do this anymore and I honestly can't figure out any other solution. I hate that my brain wants me to keep living. I wish I didn't have that urge to live so I could just finally go through with it. It makes me so fucking mad that I'm the only one holding myself back at this point even though all I have left to live for is pain. Why should I want to be alive? There's nothing here for me. I hate that even in the midst of thinking about how to end it all I still feel so much shame. I just want to let go and I can't stop stopping myself.
