Am I overreacting?Hi reddit, so recently it has dawned on me that some people just donâ€™t know anything. So a little backstory, I had depression for about a few months where I physically was not able to get up and moving and has suicidal issues . I never did get proper treatment as I never really came out about this because my parents are very religious and theyâ€™ll just say â€œgo pray some moreâ€ and nobody really cared and thought I was just an arrogant, spoiled, brat and this adds up to the fact Iâ€™m agonistic and didnâ€™t tell anyone but my uncle who doesnâ€™t care about how religious I am. So recently, my parents were trying their hardest to figure out why I was such I guess a weirdo. So they were basically telling me to stop being so moody and start being more mature. And me not having any of it started yelling and I stormed off crying in my room. Later, my older sister said that I was acting like such an asshole to my parents and that I was overreacting(She already knew about my depression and my thoughts) and to stop making others uncomfortable. I told her she can go Fuck off and to leave me alone as I still have reoccurring memories of me wanting to die and Iâ€™m very sensitive about it and all sheâ€™s doing is making it more stressful. Iâ€™ve tried coming to terms with my parents about my depression and they just told me to shut up and go away.So reddit, you tell me did I do something wrong because I need advice and some support.
