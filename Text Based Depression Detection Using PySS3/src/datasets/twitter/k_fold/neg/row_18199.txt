Need an OunceI've recognized several signs of depression in myself: suicidal ideation, lack of interest in activities, feeling worthless, not to mention the brief survey indicating moderate to severe major depression and/or a good possibility of bipolar disorder.  The only time I self harmed was on accident and I didn't really enjoy it, so all I really want right now is an ounce of prevention.

In my [earlier post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/m5ryk/i_sometimes_feel_i_may_be_too_considerate/), I mentioned that I don't want to burden my family financially by asking for therapy.  I know I need a professional psych eval at the least, but what's the best way to break this to my parents?  My father is often the source of my lack of self-worth, and I think looking like a pussy in front of him is part of why it's kind of embarassing for me.  *&lt;EDIT&gt;: This is also why I don't want to call the suicide hotline.  I worry about having to explain myself if walked in on.&lt;/EDIT&gt;* I'm sure I need serious help, though, but for all I know, it might just be raging teenage hormones.

I will also post this to r/depression, but I post here for this alarming reason:  I have a clear, well-formed idea of how I will kill myself, though I lack the will to do so.  Also, note that I am 16, and for the most part, puberty has wound down.
