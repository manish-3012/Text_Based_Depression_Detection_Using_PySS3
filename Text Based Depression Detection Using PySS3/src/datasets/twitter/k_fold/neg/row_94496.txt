My ex got engaged tonightTo the girl he left me for. He left me a year ago for her - someone prettier, smarter, more successful, someone normal and fun. And now, what, they get to keep being happy, getting everything that I wanted, while I lay over here planning my death?
That was supposed to be me. And it all was taken away from me. Because I wasnâ€™t fucking good enough like always. I was positive that he was found to be my future - finally I had something secure and loving and something to look forward to. No. Wrong. But now she does. 

You can spare me the cliches about moving on and finding someone else because Iâ€™d rather just kill myself. I donâ€™t want someone else and I havenâ€™t for a year, time hasnâ€™t healed me at all. 

I feel like this is the icing on the cake to my pathetic life. And Iâ€™m laying here with a lump in my throat and hot tears streaming down my ugly face. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because of my cat. But itâ€™s getting really hard for me to keep going and now I really donâ€™t feel like itâ€™s worth it. Him leaving me was a punch in the gut, finding out he was dating her was a punch in the gut, them taking trips to places I dreamt of going was a punch in the gut, them moving in together was a punch in the gut, and now this. Iâ€™m done.
