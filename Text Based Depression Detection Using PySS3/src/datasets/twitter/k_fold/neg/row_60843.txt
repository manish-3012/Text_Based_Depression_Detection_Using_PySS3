I feel so sickLast night I was at a friend's birthday party where I stayed the night. I have trouble with social situations, especially when there are so many people that I don't know around. I was on edge before I even arrived, and that feeling stayed for a big part of the night. When it really went away was when I decided to get drunk to try and ease these feelings. Once that happened I felt so much better - at least, until I sobered up. By the time I was in bed, I was having an anxiety attack. I was shaking and dizzy, so without saying anything I left for the bathroom and sat on the floor, hyperventilating and trying to get my shit together. Didn't work so well. It got to the point where I was slightly delirious, drifting in-between horrible daydreams of rotting meat. That's when I realized I wasn't getting any sleep that night.

I can't even hang out with friends without losing my fucking mind. I wish I could be normal and do normal things, but I'm so messed up that I can't even do those things without ending up a total wreck.
