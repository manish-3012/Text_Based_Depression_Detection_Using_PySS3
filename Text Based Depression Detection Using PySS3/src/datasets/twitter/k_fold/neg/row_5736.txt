I need help all is falling apartI've have come from a long history of dealing with my parents marriage, it has been a roller coaster of depression and abuse. I thought this year after my father seeking help, getting a new job after not working, me going to college and the thought of us moving into a new house. All would be smooth sailing but no in the transition of moving into this new place and my mother having her vacation It has been nothing but yelling and being told me and my mom are fuck ups, no good and disappointments all because I slept in for work and my mother's vacation to see her family landed during the move period, which she deserved by the way after working two jobs for so long I still made it on time by him taking me and yelling that i cant drive despite all the practice ive done and they won't let me drive. and keeps bringing up the past even though its all over with. he says he just wants to leave us here and start a "new chapter" and doesnt want to know what I do after. I just dont know how to feel. So now I dont know where ill be in a week or if my belongings will be in storage or not and still trying to keep up with school and work is killing me this sense of not knowing creates the worst anxiety for me.  Even worse he says my mother won't have her car either when we have 2 ?? I don't know what to think anymore, I have just lost so much motivation to keep going, in school, my hobbies I couldn't even enjoy my mother coming home from her vacation. I just keep getting rides from friends trying not to show my emotions. I just want peace and stability , but what I get is just me on a bench at college crying trying not to be noticed. it seems when ever its in my grasp I somehow fuck it all up. why can't I be happy?  Im tired of this anxiety and stress id rather be painless then feel nothing but pain pretending to have smile on my face.
