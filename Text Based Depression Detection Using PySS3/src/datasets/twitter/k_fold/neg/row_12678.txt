On the verge of itSo Back in January this girl Iâ€™ve been awkward snap friends with (I liked her back last summer, but my friend who knew this went behind my back with her for a month until he finally told me and I just never got to know her better, they broke up about a week before I first talked to her again) got home from a party and had no one else to talk too, and since we were already snapping she FaceTimed me. After that things just sorta kicked off with us and for the next 3 weeks we were basically dating w/o calling it dating

Come Valentineâ€™s Day, she calls me in the morning and tells me she canâ€™t be with me right now because sheâ€™s just not ready to jump back in and has too much going on, which is understandable. So for the next 6 months we just keep getting to know each other and weâ€™re now basically each otherâ€™s best friend. The whole time though I had been waiting for her to make her decision about us, and today she finally made it

I was over at her house and just kinda bugging her about telling me cause she had said she was gonna tell me soon. So as Iâ€™m about to leave she looks at me and says â€œIâ€™m sorry but I just canâ€™t date youâ€. i stayed at her house for another 5 hours or so talking until I had to leave. Now Iâ€™m home, just feeling so empty and lonely, and Iâ€™m completely distraught.

She was everything to me. Sheâ€™s the most beautiful girl Iâ€™ve ever met and I just love everything about her. I just feel so worthless right now. The possibility of being with her was the only thing keeping me going during the last few months and now Iâ€™ve lost it and I canâ€™t do this anymore. Nothing good happens to me my whole life is just shit, sheâ€™s the only good that the world has given me and any chance with her is gone

Please, I just need help
