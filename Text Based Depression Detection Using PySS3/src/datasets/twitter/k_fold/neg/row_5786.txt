Why do you keep making me live?I'm so physically and mentally tired. I can't do this any more. I'm going to a psychiatrist today and he is going to force me into a ward. I can't do that. I want to die. My brain keeps telling me to tear my ribs apart and stab myself and kill myself. I'm too afraid to leave my house. I need food. I'm starving. Please let me die. I keep hurting myself. I want someone to care about me. I need to take my pills someone please make me do it. I'm having a hard time even moving my hands. Do I do it? I don't want to go a psych ward.
