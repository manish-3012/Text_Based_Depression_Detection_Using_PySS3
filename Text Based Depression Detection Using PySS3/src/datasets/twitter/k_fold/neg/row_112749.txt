Advice on what to tell my boss?Hi all, new to this page.

Female, 25

In short, I tried to OD on Valium on Thursday night. Itâ€™s now Saturday and it obviously didnâ€™t work. Iâ€™m Currently battling alcoholism and it all just got to me. 

Feeling much better and more positive etc etc. but
just wondering what I should tell my boss as why I had a day off? My partner texted my boss when I was not lucid and said I had been rushed to hospital and wonâ€™t be in tomorrow. 

Itâ€™s now been two days, everythingâ€™s worn off and Iâ€™m home. Iâ€™m wondering if should just make something up? I really want to go back to work, so please just suggestions about what I should tell my boss. Thanks all x
