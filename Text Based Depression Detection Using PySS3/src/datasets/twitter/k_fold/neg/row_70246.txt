Just ventingI tried a few years back.. Ended up in the hospital with cracked skull, 3 ribs, right arm and knee. I rode my motorcycle off a cliff. I know. I am stupid. Shouldn't have ruined a good motorcycle. The scrap metal from the bike is worth more than me.


Went back to college. Very few people knew about it. I remember feeling ashamed all the time. I was disgusted at myself for not being able to kill myself. I could feel the growing hatred inside me. I hate myself, still do. I am so ducking incompetent that I couldn't do one little thing. Whenever I saw myself in the mirror I got angry. I would slap myself. I would kick a wall with my knee. I would bang my hand on a table or wall edge from time to time. Ended up in the hospital again. Stupid me didn't know that bones joined together by screw don't react well to impacts. Had to stop that as well.

So far I have ruined a perfectly good bike. Wasted my family's savings on repairing thus shitty assortment of flesh and bones. Twice.

Now I stab myself with a Phillips head screw driver. Since everything else has become a financial liability.

I will kill myself someday. Just don't know when.
