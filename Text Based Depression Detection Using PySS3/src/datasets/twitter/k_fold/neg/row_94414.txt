Being suicidal for a sustained period of time is a very very lonely and isolating experienceNo one can help you or save you or share this world with you... I literally donâ€™t go out at all because the world is such a dangerous place to me - because people exist. And I thought I was sheltering myself from problems this way from the external world. 

But all the dangers are in my head. I live them all in my world. They are in the house With me. They are living in my head with me. Thatâ€™s one thing I canâ€™t run away from... and thatâ€™s my main reason for wanting to end my life. End all this


I suffer from severe depression... my brain chemistry is not right.. so I know.. I know meds will help.. I might be feeling all These through a contaminated lens now... no one helps u. Not even docs. Everything is system bureaucracy and just a stat. Follow protocol and red tapes.
