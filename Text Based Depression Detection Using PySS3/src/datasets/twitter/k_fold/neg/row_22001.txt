What's the point of living if your life is objectively bad?Yesterday I came closer to actually killing myself than I ever was before. I am inflicted with a genetic condition that affects my appearance and has no cure. It can disappear and come back whenever it wants to and I have no control over it. I have zero self-confidence and zero will to live any longer. I'm only 21 but I feel my life is already over. I'm watching my younger relatives surpass me and it's embarrassing. My little sister got a boyfriend recently and they'll probably have a longer relationship than I ever will. I am so pathetic and inexperienced in every way, I can't even look an attractive guy in the eyes without feeling self-conscious and ashamed for even thinking he might be attracted to me. All I've ever wanted was to feel like I belong, and now I don't even have that because I truly do not belong anywhere. I will never be able to even have kids if I wanted to. I want to die so badly, but with my luck I'll probably end up botching my own suicide and end up permanently damaging my organs or something. As if people don't already think I'm super pathetic, imagine their reactions when they find out I tried to kill myself and failed. 

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess it's sort of comforting knowing that 1-2 people will have read this.
