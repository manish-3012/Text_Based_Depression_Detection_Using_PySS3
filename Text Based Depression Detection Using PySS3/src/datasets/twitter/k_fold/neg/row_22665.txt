Hey, Iâ€™m actually feeling okay today.I took some medication a few days ago, a cocktail. But it wasnâ€™t enough to kill me. I stopped when I came across a TED talk with this psychotherapist woman who said, â€œwhat if thereâ€™s really nothing wrong with you?â€ 
And really.. what if there isnâ€™t? What if this is who Iâ€™m supposed to be?
