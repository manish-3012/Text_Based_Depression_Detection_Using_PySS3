I just od'd on blood thinnersHi, 43 in Pittsburgh, PA. I just took about 2000mgs of lovenox, I am sitting in station square and was going to head down to the river and slit my wrists. As luck would have it, I lost my pocket knife sometime today. Now I'm thinking I should go to the hospital, but I'm too embarrassed to call ambulance and I can't walk, any locals willing to help a lonely very depressed guy? I don't want the pain of a hemorrhage. Thanks for reading
