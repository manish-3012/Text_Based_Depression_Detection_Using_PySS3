I've decidedjust wanted to put this out in to world that I've decided that if I fail my math final I will die .. because that means I'm being held back yet another year .. I'll never hear the end of it from my parents and Frankly I dont think I could do it anymore I'm not where i pictured myself to  be I'm exhausted  and I love my degree I love learning I just lost all motivation I never acquired the discipline it's too late I wasted all opportunities I have no friends no one is going to miss me but my parents but they'll get over it .. i have 3 more final exams left .. I'm going to do my best I could .. I had one today and it was so easy to get an A .. and I shouldve started studying earlier .. and i hate myself i hate myself i hate myself 

**I know it seems dramatic but I do base my worth on my grades and if I dont make good grades I wont get a good job that I like and what's the point of living then ? Like I said I dont have friends .. the only thing that prevented me for so long was that I was embarrassed because I live in a small town and yeah ... I know initially everyone will be like 'oh that's sad &amp; why etc etc ' but that's just one day compared to my next 40 + yrs of misery
