So bored I want to kill myself :)'Killing myself' may seem a bit over the top, but I honestly feel like it right now. I'm actually only 9 years old, everything is way too boring for me. Video games just don't fit me anymore since I have been playing them since I was 5, toys/board games are way too boring for me that even playing them makes me want to kill myself. I can't think of any ideas, any video games or even board games that are fun will help, thanks!
