 Mooching Off Of A Friend And Suspended From College: This is a long story btwHey Reddit. I just finished my Freshman year of college and my last semester went terribly.  My family kicked  me out essentially in the middle of the school year and now have moved away, eventually they said I  could stay with them again when I was having issues finding a place, but I don't wanna be with them since we have issues and I'm not wanted there. Also from what my brother tells me they  are mostly apathetic towards me and the offer is out of a sense of responsibility they  feel for me, not because they want me anywhere near them or anything.                                                                                So now my friend and his mom are letting me stay with them but I'm having issues finding a job and his mom is getting on me for not trying hard enough, and is upset that at my friends urging i withheld telling her about my suspension  (which I didn't know about until two weeks after getting here). He thought it was best for me to wait  until after his graduation party since things are hectic here. I really am trying, I must have applied to a dozen places but I've only had one interview so far and no ones given me any phone calls (im calling most of them tommorrow.), I need to work quicker but i dont have any energy and its a struggle to just out of bed most days. I can't tell her that though because I don't  think she or my friend understand about depression and will think I''m just lazy and making excuses.                                      To make matter even better I don't have any family nearby anymore and none of them ever talk to me. (NOTE: the family that kicked me out was my sister and  her husband who took me in when I was 15) my mom has stopped talking to me and I've lost all of her contact info. I know she can get in touch with me and the fact that  she hasn't makes me not want to talk to her if she can't be bother either. My dad is an evil  bastard and in prision. My living grandma doesnt talk to me (or any of my moms family really) and the only thing my  grandfather has said to me in the past year is  that I'm disappointing the family name but not having all A's in school. I feel alone, I don't have any family aside from  my brother and he's  not that close to anyone.  I have a wonderful  girlfriend, but I can't talk to her about all of this because she doesn't know how to deal with it and has her own issues.

I Feel Alone, more alone than I've ever felt,  and I feel like the biggest screwup in the family  besides my dad. Though I haven't  planned to kill myself by any means I think about it more regularly, often imagining eating a bottle of asprin and walking out into the woods lying down and just dying there in peace and I don't wanna do that. Without a job I can't  afford a shrink and I can't ask my friend or my parents for help with it.     

I'm not sure what to do here.
