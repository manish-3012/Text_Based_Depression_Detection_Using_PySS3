I'm lostI'm autistic. I struggle with emotions and because of that I'm very private. When I open up to people, they leave. I have serious trust and abandonment issues. I have been depressed and suicidal for a long time because I'm very lonely. A few months ago, I met someone. We bonded over my struggles. He rescued me. He promised to always be there for me. He promised to protect me. We fell deeply in love and I let my guard down. A few days ago I went to see him. He made our relationship official, he had sex with me,he said my search was over, and we fell asleep. It was the happiest moment of my life. He abandoned me in my hotel room a few hours later and is now acting like a totally different person. He says he'll always love me, but now he won't even talk to me.

I'm 40. This has happened to me over and over and over again and I never understand why. My therapist doesn't understand why. The person above didn't understand why anyone would do that to me, and now he won't tell me why he did it.

I'm struggling to go on. I can't work. I can't eat. I can't entertain myself. I can't sleep. I just stare into space and think about nothing but ending it.
