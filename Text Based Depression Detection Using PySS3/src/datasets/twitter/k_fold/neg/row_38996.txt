Just because I got better, doesn't mean I became okay. I've never known what it's like to be okay.So what exactly is it that you're suggesting? More/different pills? I'm already drugged up on 8 different medications a day, and it took me nearly four prescribed batches to get here. I can't afford to be grasping for medical solutions my entire fucking life. The real solution is right there, calling to me everyday. But I'm too much of a goddamn good person to do that to my family. So I suffer every fucking day just so you selfish bastards won't have to. Its really not fair. I never asked to be born. I just want to end it. I never wanted it to start in the first place. I thought everyone felt this way, and we all just sort of put up with the lives we were forced into. But no. Its just me. I'm the fuck up. I can't keep "making the best of it" because it's bullshit. You don't throw a birthday party for someone who hates birthdays. Worst of all, this party never ends and there's no way out.
