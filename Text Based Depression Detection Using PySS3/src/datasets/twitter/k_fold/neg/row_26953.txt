quarantine and not working is making me want to milk myself even moreat least when i was working i had a little bit of purpose. it wasnâ€™t much as iâ€™m not great at my job. 
but now im stuck at home, with my thoughts all day. i live with my sister and we fight all the time and she makes me feel completely unwanted. 

no one would even care if i died. my dad and i barely have a relationship, i donâ€™t even know how to talk to him. 

iâ€™m not in a relationship and have zero self confidence. iâ€™ve ended every relationship iâ€™ve been in because i feel like iâ€™m not worth anything and they deserve better. 

this has just all been going on inside my head and i desperately want to end it all. just for it to be over with and for everything to be quiet. i want to sleep
