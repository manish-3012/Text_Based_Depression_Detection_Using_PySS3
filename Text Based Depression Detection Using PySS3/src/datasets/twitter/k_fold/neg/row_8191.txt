I made my planI know what Iâ€™m gonna do now. Iâ€™ve never wanted to make a negative impact on people, despite the impact theyâ€™ve made on me. I figured itâ€™d be easier if I were kidnapped or killed in a freak accident, so nobody could call me weak or manipulate the situation for attention. The way that people act when another person kills themselves disgusts me. 

But I finally have my plan. I know exactly how Iâ€™m going, and it will be like I never left at all. I was never really here to begin with. Figuring this out gave me a sense of relief I havenâ€™t experienced in years. Iâ€™m ready to go now, I wish it could be today.
