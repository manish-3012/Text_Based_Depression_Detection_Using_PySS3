Making my final plans.I just want to do as little damage to others as possible. I have some sensitive friends who I worry might blame themselves or otherwise just take it really hard. There's no way I'm going to be able to hide that it was intentional from them.

I want to know how I can try to soften the blow when I do it. Should I write them a message? If I did I'd want to send it immediately before so there'd be no time to intervene. Would having some last kind words be a comfort or would knowing I'm attempting to die be more likely to cause traumatic stress? I could also write a note for someone to deliver to them after I'm done, maybe when the news is broken to them. Would this be gentler? With this method I'm also concerned about any potential messenger not delivering it correctly, not discovering it, not knowing how to reach them, or just not delivering it at all. Is it better to leave nothing?
