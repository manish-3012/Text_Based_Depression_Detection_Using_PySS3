I don't know how much more I can handleI don't even know what I'm trying to say with this post, except I need someone to talk to and I don't know where to turn. My husband thought he was helping (and maybe he did) by taking the kids out of the house so I could get some quiet. But it didn't help and I've spent the last few hours trying to figure out if I can kill myself before they get home. I feel so out of control and everything is going well, or at least well in ways that I should be okay with. I just can't do it anymore. I don't want to do it anymore. Getting out of bed has been a chore for weeks, my house is horribly gross because I have no effort to clean. I just want to cry. I should go to the hospital but I can't. I won't. I don't want medicine even though I need it. I just want to be okay. I'm tired of not being okay. I'm tired of not knowing when this will hit me and how long it will last. 

I don't know if any of that made sense, I just needed to get it all out.
