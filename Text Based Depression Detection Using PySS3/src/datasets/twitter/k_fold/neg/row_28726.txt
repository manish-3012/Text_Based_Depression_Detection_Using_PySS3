I'm uselesshello. I'm here because I can't hold it anymore, my life is a piece of shâ€¢t. to get started my girlfriend wanted to breakup with me because she's not happy, we managed to hold on but I don't know what the future holds about it, she talks to other guys daily and I'm not comfortable with that but I don't want to take her freedom. I'm failing everyone, friends, parents, I just keep messing up thinks. I'm toxic and everyone abandons me, my only refuge was her and I'm not sure I will have that much more. I can't keep it together no more, I want to end this I have no use in society. just keep failing and bad memories keep tormenting me. I can't take it no more.
what do I do?
