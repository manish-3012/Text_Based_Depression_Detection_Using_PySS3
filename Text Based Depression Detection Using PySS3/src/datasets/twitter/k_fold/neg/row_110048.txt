Hate meNobody really seems to want me around. One of my closest friends just â€œforgets to text meâ€ and my best friend basically said that he was doing better without me in his life. My boyfriend (now ex) broke up with me because i was having a day to myself. He sexually assaults me and drinks and never respects me but heâ€™s still there for me. Itâ€™s tempting to reach out to him but i know he doesnâ€™t treat me well. Instead i reached out to my other ex to see if he could get me anything but found out he could care less what i want and is now trying to start a drug empire. I hoped that posting to subreddits, getting validation, as well as dms would give me something to look forward to but it didnâ€™t. Adding to that one of my rats passed away and itâ€™s my fault. Mom and dad think that Iâ€™m sleeping on the couch because itâ€™s difficult to sleep in my room since Quincy passed but really itâ€™s because i have a fully made noose in there and intend on using it. Cutting myself doesnâ€™t work anymore. Usually my coping strategies are either hurt myself or kms. Now since sh doesnâ€™t appeal to me anymore all i want to do or need to do is kms. I donâ€™t want to be hospitalized again. That doesnâ€™t help. I tried to order stuff online to give me something to wake up to but i couldnâ€™t decide what i wanted. And then i tried to reward myself w donuts for being 2 months clean, the second longest Iâ€™ve been in the 3 years Iâ€™ve been hurting myself, but somebody ate them all. Mom didnâ€™t want to change my medicine because â€œshe just doesnâ€™t think she can handle itâ€. I donâ€™t even know what she meant by that. She canâ€™t handle me switching medicine? I canâ€™t handle being on these meds. It sounds so petty but i just hate myself. I made a promise to myself three years ago that if i was still heavily suicidal and crying to sleep that i would kill myself. Because no matter how my life will turn out it canâ€™t be worth this. And Iâ€™ll more than likely go through with suicide. This is the closest Iâ€™ve been to dying since the age of 7 when all of this started. 

TLDR; everybody is better off without me and i canâ€™t find something to live for.
