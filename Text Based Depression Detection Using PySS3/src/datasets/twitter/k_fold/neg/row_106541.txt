Not at risk, just need to vent.My name is Quaid. I am 22 years old and I have suicidal thoughts on a pretty regular basis and have so since I was about 10. I would seek professional help, but literally my only prospect in life at this point is joining the military, so I don't want to fuck myself out of any chance of being able to enlist. I was psychologically abused for most of my childhood by my stepfather and several family members. Grew up in a very religious community in southern Arkansas that had pretty much 0 tolerance for anything but strict adherence to the word of God. I was a fat kid throughout elementary school and hit puberty very early, which led to a fair bit of bullying from my peers. My mom married a man 16 years younger than her when I was 12 who proceeded to emotionally abuse her and myself until I managed to move to California in 2012 to live with my half-brother. I lived there for a while and managed to do well.

My mom had a stroke in 2013, got dumped by my stepdad at the nearest hospital, and then was forced to move into an RV with half of her body paralyzed. I now I'll sound like an asshole, but this pretty much completely fucked my life over. Being the only person in my immediate family capable of dropping everything to move to Texas to take care of her, I had to move to San Antonio in 2014 to essentially be her full time caretaker. I have no possessions outside of my few suits of 8 year old+ clothes and my PC, and I am unable to find work as I have no license to drive. My mother has received physical therapy and now has pretty much fully recovered, except mentally. She is 50 years old and behaves like a child. she frequently shits herself and hides it from me so that I don't make her wear her adult diapers. She doesn't bathe for days and days at a time. She spends her SSI on cigarettes and junk food when I am not around. I have had to consistently do everything I can to make sure she has enough money to make rent and electricity every month for the past 8 months, and the only thing I ever hear from her is how she can't wait until I am gone fro her home.

I was an honor student and National Merit Honor Scholar in school and now I have nothing. I generally feel like a failure at life. I don't want to kill myself as much as I just want to die.
