I write a suicide note every night but can't go through with itI'm just tired of living. I have no ambitions, passions, hope left at all. I've moved across continents for people but it is never enough. There must be something about me that is just inherently not likeable. Why must I live this unhappy and draining life? I just want to end it without my family getting affected or anyone else blaming themselves. I just want it all to end. Everyday I write a new note thinking I'll end it tonight, saying my good byes to people I love and people who don't love me back. But I can never go through it. It's my birthday in 4 days maybe that could be the day I do it on. I don't want anyone to blame themselves but I can't take it anymore.
