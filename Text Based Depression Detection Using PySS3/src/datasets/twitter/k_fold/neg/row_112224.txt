My behaviour is affecting my family and IIâ€™m gonna be honest here, Iâ€™m a bratty kid who is sensitive. So whenever I get yelled at, I always feel like crying and I also feel mad and sometimes I talk back. Somebody please tell me how I stop this and Iâ€™m too afraid to tell my family. I told my mum once and she had a disgusting response, â€œif you want to kill yourself, just kill yourself and go to hellâ€ (My family is filled with Christianâ€™s).  Somebody please tell me the answer and how I can change my behaviour completely.
