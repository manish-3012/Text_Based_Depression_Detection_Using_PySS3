Feeling suicidal again.Basically put I have I feel just, lost I guess. I have this thing where I change interests and ideas rapidly. I lose track of my interests. For example, today after I got out of school, I ran into one of my old coaches, he asked me if I was playing football. I have liked science and been a big sci fi nerd for a decent time now, but this made me feel like rejecting that and being all jockish. I go through phases really fast, and it feels like I don't even have a personality or any interests that define me, I'm just kind of always going from one thing to the next. 
My childhood sucked a lot too, by brother was a nut, he would go into fits of rage all the time and fight with my dad and me and hit my mom. Last year my girlfriend made out with a friend of mine at a party, I don't think I ever really got over that either. I really just feel like I'm crashing aimlessly through life. I'm fat too, and I hate myself for it. I also have really low self control, it's a struggle to push myself to do daily things such as homework. I don't feel like I really have an identity, other than that formed by the negative parts of me. I've always been fat, lazy, and impulsive. Help me out guys, I just want to be myself and suceed in life, instead of constantly flipflopping and falling behind. I want to find out who I am and what I really am interested in, but so far I've failed. Life just feels hopeless for me, like I'll never be able to just enjoy one thing, like i'll always be constantly changing, except in where I fail. I just want this shit to stop, and I feel like it's my responsibility to make that happen. I can't live just constantly in a state of indecisiveness, failing at everything I do. Help me :( I'm running out of will to continue this shit, and I'm scared I'll carry through with my suicidal thoughts if I can't somehow fix my life.
