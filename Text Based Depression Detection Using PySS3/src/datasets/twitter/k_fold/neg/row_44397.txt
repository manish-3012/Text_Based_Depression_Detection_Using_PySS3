Do people ever commit suicide on the fly without explicitly making any plans to?

At the most actively suicidal Iâ€™ve ever felt, I knew it would likely happen that week given how hopeless I was, but I was kind of just waiting for the right moment (whatever that means). I guess I had the method sort of down.

What scares me is not so much that my â€œbaselineâ€ mental state constantly has suicidal thoughts. Itâ€™s been like that for as long as I can remember. What does though are moments where Iâ€™m present with myself (either being neutral/meditative, or generally just okay and feeling content) and that emptiness and hopelessness creeps in so fast that I hardly notice until itâ€™s too late. Iâ€™m afraid that one day I really will just say â€œscrew it,â€ sick of the constant battle with myself, even if just an hour earlier I was doing so well.

Iâ€™m okay right now, not feeling actively suicidal or anything. Iâ€™m back in therapy and taking my meds regularly. I just feel like my future is going to be bleak no matter how much I accomplish, do good, or am loved etc. Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve always wondered.
