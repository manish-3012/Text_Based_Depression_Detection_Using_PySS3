HelloHello I am a 32 year old man from the U.K. I am just posting here on the off chance I might get some advice or, well I don't know really I suppose there is nowhere else I can really say any of this. I have called Samaritans many times but it never really changes anything and I always feel like I am having the same conversation. 
So basically I am 32, at home with mum and dad, university drop-out, cannabis addict, fired from every job I have ever had except one (I have had around 20 jobs) girlfriend left me around 7 years ago been single since then. Have been trying to get mental health help from the NHS for the past 3 years and all I have discovered from my appointments with several people during that time is that I don't have ADHD and I am not a danger to anyone. 
Long term mental health care is impossible to find if you can't afford to pay, the Tinder culture has ruined my chances of ever being in a relationship, my career prospects are zero, I have no friends and spend every night at home on the PC either playing video games or watching pointless youtube videos until I fall asleep. My parents have made it clear they can not afford to finance my living at home but they will continue to try until I am able to "sort myself out" which is a possibility I really have no belief in. The only thing stopping me is the fear of a painful death or of something going wrong and having to live with a permanent injury. 
I suppose I thought maybe talking to some like minded people might make the long nights a little easier to manage. 

Thanks and best wishes to you all.
