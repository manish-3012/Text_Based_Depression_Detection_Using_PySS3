I'm so sick of this, I just want to, want to be alive, why can't I just be content?It's been a rough couple of weeks, until I had a good day, I didn't even realise I'd been spending every day depressed, now tonight I've had an anxiety attack which made me realise how seemingly messed up I am. It's so hard to make it through everyday, I just got off the phone with my parents and it helped a little knowing they care, but it's the only thing keeping me here, the fact that people care about me and I don't want to let them down. 


Why can't I live for myself, why can't I enjoy things? Everyday suicide becomes more an option, everyday I care less that people care about me, they feel like an anchor keeping me here, and I hate being so selfish about it. I'm waiting for a call from my therapist to set me up an appointment for help, and it feels like forever.
