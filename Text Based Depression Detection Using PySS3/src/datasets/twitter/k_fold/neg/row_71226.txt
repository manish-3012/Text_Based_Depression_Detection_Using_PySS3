I've been thinking about it, but due to pure logic and not mental health issues.Most people think suicidal thoughts come from mental health issues but this isn't always the case, especially in my situation. I'm 38 and am in the process of losing my mother who's currently in hospital, there's not long to go now. My father is in his 80s and despite his health being somewhat ok for his age, he's old and his time is also limited. I also have no brothers or sisters. I have extended family but they have their own lives. I also have no partner and no children and this doesn't look like it's going to change anytime soon. In fact, the more time that passes the further away this possibility becomes. Once my parents go, I'm going to be by myself so I don't see the point in carrying on. If you're someone who has close people in your life, then by all means you should keep living. But if you're like me who's soon to have no one, then what's the point? Suicide for me just seems like the next logical step.
