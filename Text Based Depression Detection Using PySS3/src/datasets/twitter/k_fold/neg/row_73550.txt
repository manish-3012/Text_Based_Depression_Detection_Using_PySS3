Belts &amp; BedpostsOn occasion I'd browse this sub to reply to people's posts to try to help out in some small way but there is obviously a reason that I come here - I'm also suicidal.

I read a post a while back that details how you can actually successfully hang yourself with a belt from your doorknob but I didn't really think much into the method before now.

I just looped my belt around my bedpost and did a little experiment - pulling myself back just before I lost consciousness.

It's weird, that such a simple method was just sitting in my bedroom this whole time. I don't really know how to process it.

I know that there are dangers of surviving it: what of the belt breaks, what if someone finds you, what if you survive but get brain damage etc.

I live in the UK, so I've never even seen a gun here before, it's crazy that I have this method right at my fingertips. All I have to do, is lean forward and let it take me...

Just now, I put on earphones and started playing the song that I want to hear as I die ("Farewell" by Arkadiusz Reikowski &amp; Mary Elizabeth McGlynn) but before I do that, I thought that I'd better post here, just to see if I could get someone's thoughts on the matter.

I kind of sucks that nobody could even guess half of the effed up thoughts the plague me every day, but I won't be around to care so who cares!

Anyway, I just need some time to process this, then we'll see what I'm gonna do - I'm honestly quite excited! :D
