I give upKind of here looking for some guidance. I know that the answer I will get is "don't do it!" but as anyone in my situation would know, that's just a laughable response.

My life is full of ups and downs, mostly downs. For years I didn't get along with my family and now, for the most part, do. So, that's not much of an issue.

My big issue is that I feel I am a total drain and waste on society. Every person that I come in "more than casual" contact with, I leave in a bad situation. 

-My one relationship ended badly - I was an ass and hurtful to him.
-I go through friends like water. Make horrible first, second and third impressions and if I actually wind up making someone a friend, usually wind up pissing them off within a few weeks.
-I go through jobs quite quickly. I get hired but then quickly fired (usually during the six month "trial period") for not being able to get along with any of my co-workers. I constantly fight with them and do a pretty good job of offending them. I can't be professional in any way.
-I couldn't get a date if my life depended on it. I am not 300000 lbs, but I don't have the type of personality that allows people to see beyond the "asshole" that lies on top - if there is anything below...not too sure.
-I grew up with a total lack of friends. Got picked on all through elementary, jr high, high and even college. In Jr. high, I spent most of my time upside down in a garbage can.
-I have  pretty short temper. I don't like seeing people get away with things like cutting me off in traffic, dumping work on others and cheating systems.

Yes, I am on meds. I am on Welbutrin, Bruspirone, Pristique and once in a while I pop a xanax if I need to sleep and can't b/c of a running mind.

I have seen a few shinks and the answer I always get is "don't say stupid things to people, just stop". I think that's the shittiest form of advice ever. That's like telling someone with HIV to stop having a lower white blood cell count. These are things I can't control.

Trust me, I have tried. In meetings I place a large red X on my paper. I still speak up with irrelevant, stupid things that don't have anything to do with the topic at hand.

What has brought me to my edge is that yesterday I was informed that I have one last chance at my current job to "be on my best behavior"  and that I had better start looking for a new job.

I'm done. I'm tired. I can't keep hurting others, having them spend time and money on me only to have me fail. I am only a drain on society. I just don't know what to do short of ending things.

Why don't I? I don't want to hurt the few people I actually do care about ,my mom, dad and the few (FEW) folks I have actually found that don't care how much of an ass I am.

Help.
