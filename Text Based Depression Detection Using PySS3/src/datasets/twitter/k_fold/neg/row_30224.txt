The "Living for My Family" Excuse is a LieWhen contemplating suicide, I've always told myself that I have to stay alive for my family, but I've now realized that's BS. 

If that was my true motive, telling my family about my suicidal ideation should just up the ante and make me feel even more obligated to live, right?

Nope. Now that I've told my family and more people than I really wanted to, I just feel trapped more than ever.

So why don't I end it? Well, it's for the same reason I didn't kill myself in the past: fear. 

I told myself all that moralistic crap because I didn't want to feel afraid. I didn't want to face the fact that I'm a coward.
