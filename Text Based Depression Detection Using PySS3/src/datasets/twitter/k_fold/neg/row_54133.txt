I was hospitalized.So close to two weeks ago I was on the verge of killing myself. I wasn't quite ready to go so I decided to wait but it freaked me out so I went to my priest and told him about my experiences. I was quickly sent to a physciatrist the next day and hospitalized later. It has been  11 days since I have been hospitalized and today is the first day back. I don't know how I am going to be able to make it, I know feel like I am being micromanaged and constantly watched. I haven't even returned to school, which I am expecting to be the same situation. It bugs the hell out of me since I just want to be left alone but that's probably not going to happen. Now I am pondering if I should have even told anyone about my depression and just keep it to myself. Any suggestions?
