Feeling down on XmasFeeling down today I know itâ€™s Christmas and should be in a good mood but this year has been shit. My cousin passed away and two people I went to school with passed. The most recent one a few days ago to suicide. Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression and I just feel like giving up and just ending it. I really donâ€™t have anything or anyone to live for I have no kids and no one really gives two fucks about me. Iâ€™ve tried calling the hotlines and it helps some then the feeling comes back. What would be my next step?
