I'm almost thereI've been suicidal since I was about 12. I wrote about it in my diary and I even made videos (never published, I deleted them right after) talking about wanting to commit suicide. I'm 18 now and it's gotten worse. The fact that I could go directly to my bathroom that's right across the hall and hang myself from there is quite scary but also a nice thing to think about. There's no purpose for me, there never has been. I've always imagined myself doing great things and the closer I get to reality, the more I want to just end it all. I'm incredibly lonely. I have only one friend in real life who I barely talk to anymore and online friends just don't cut it. I get tired of them, they get tired of me and the cycle starts all over again. I gave myself some bruises and bled a tiny bit from using rubber bands and I have to say, it felt really good. I used to just hit myself which also helped the self hatred but there's just something about using rubber bands as well. I'm not asking for any sympathy. Not asking for you to be my friend because quite frankly I could care less at this point. I just wanted someone to hear me in case I do try something one of these days. I have no one and I wouldn't wish this on anybody. Thanks for reading
