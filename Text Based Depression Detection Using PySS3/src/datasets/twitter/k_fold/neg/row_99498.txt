I don't want to be alive.I'm sick of tired of feeling forgotten. I want someone to care about me. I always feel alone. I always feel left out. I look after everyone, yet no one does the same for me. A simple "how are you?" is all I ask and I never get it. I'm so scared of the things rapidly approaching. I'm scared of my upcoming internship as a student teacher. The loans are going to roll in. I'm going to feel even lonlier because of time constraints. No one has ever loved me. I want to think that life gets better, but that dream gets farther away with every passing day. I want to be happy, but I don't think I'm allowed. 

I want to end it all so badly. I can buy a cheap gun and be done. I made my friend a promise that I would get help, but I regret making that promise. I've regretted it from the moment the words left my lips. I feel so alone and I want to die. I cut myself to keep myself calm. I carry scissors with me to keep myself calm. I want to die so badly. I feel like I have to make everyone around me proud and I can't. I can't handle the pressure. I feel like I can't make mistakes. I screw up once and everything is done. I have to be perfect or else everyone will see me as a disappointment. I already feel like everyone hates me and making a mistake will only make things worse. I want to relax, but I don't know how. I'm so paranoid about everything. I know someone is going to say "things get better" but I've been hearing that through out my whole life. I don't believe that things will get better.
