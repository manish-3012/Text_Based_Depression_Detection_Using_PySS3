i genuinely don't understand why suicide is wrong.every day for me is spent trying to convince myself that life is worth it and that maybe one day i won't feel so miserable but good things don't happen to me and i am completely alone. my mom was the only person who ever cared about me and really my main motivation for living but she had an aneurysm last year and is a vegetable now so i have no one.

i try to listen to this small part of me thats wants to live and as such started walking more, doing fun things for myself, learning korean etc. and i just got a job as well but at the end of the day i feel like i'm lying to myself. every time i feel ashamed or guilty or disgusted with myself it try to counter those thoughts with positive ones or i'll write about my feelings but ultimately at the end of the day i just feel like i'd be happier not existing. 

i just don't understand why i /have/ to live. if my pain matters to no one why is killing myself wrong? people always say those who attempt suicide are irrational and aren't thinking things through but i've been thinking about this for over 20 years. there are things i'd like to before i die for sure but at the end of the day i have no interest in living a long life. no amount of happiness or success seems worth living another day. never mind another decade.

idk, i just want someone to tell me that it's okay to want to die. 
i hope as a society we can get to a point where suicide isn't seen as taboo and terrible because i don't think i'm meant to be alive.

this pulse of mine is only a reminder of my suffering.
