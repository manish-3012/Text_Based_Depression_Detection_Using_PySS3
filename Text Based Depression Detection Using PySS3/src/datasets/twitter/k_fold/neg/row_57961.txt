i don't know why i was lied about how it gets betterit doesn't get better, not in my case. it just gets worse. in this past week ive had a page on instagram made that was dedicated to bullying me, my dad is about to have another affair, my mom vents to me about it and uses me as her therapist, i'm falling behind in school, i can barely get myself up, someone i trust and consider close to me is basically just ghosting me completely, i had a fight with my group of friends, and now my best friend irl hung out with someone that sexually assaulted me- she also knew about this.

wow.

like, the world tells me over and over again that i mean nothing. i'm just finally getting it. i feel like drinking myself to death.
