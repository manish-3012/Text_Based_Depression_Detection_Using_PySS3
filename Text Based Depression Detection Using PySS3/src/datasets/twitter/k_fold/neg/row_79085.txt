I am alone today. With the noose in my hands.I found some twine/rope in my dads garage... I am alone and quite anxious and upset. I thought i was doing well, but im not. Yesterdays small victory of choux paste making doesnt mean shit now. My heart is hurting.


I am debating on wether to do it around the nearest doorhandle/waldrobe, or getting showered and dressed nicely and finding a tree.

Yes my dad will never be proud of me if i do this. Yes it will upset a lot of people. Im sorry about that, but i dont think i can chage that. Alive or dead.

My ex hasnt spoken to me in nearly two weeks, despite my attempt the other week, he doesn't care. I just cant do this. There is too much pressure. If he could be here to talk me down from what im about to do, i probably wouldnt. Fuck this. Please somebody help me
