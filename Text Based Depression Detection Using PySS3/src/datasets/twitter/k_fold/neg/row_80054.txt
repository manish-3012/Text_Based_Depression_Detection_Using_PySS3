I have no immediate plans but I suspect I will go down that road againThrowaway fo keep as anonymous as possible. But I'm 16 living with severe depression and anxiety disorders. I've had suicidal intentions and the like on the past but that was over a year ago. Recently as I get older and I realize more abojt the real world, the more suicide doesn't seem like such a terrible idea. Very few things in life make me happy, and those include making music and entertaining people. Both of which are extremely difficult to succeed in. Desk jobs and similar jobs drive me further into my depression and anxiety. As terrible and as much as a pussy thing as it seems like, my general idea is attempt to do something with music or entertainment and if it doesn't work, just off myself. I don't want to at the moment nor do I plan to. But seeing how life is going omcnot sure what to do. I'm simply writing this to get my thoughts out and to potentially act as a resource to go to to talk to people or vent.
