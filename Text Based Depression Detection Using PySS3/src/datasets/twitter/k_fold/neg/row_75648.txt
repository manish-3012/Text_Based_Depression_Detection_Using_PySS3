I'm so tiredI just want to die. Life is too hard for me. I want nothingness, I want nonexistqnce. Nothing good can come out of my life. I hate everyone. I hate the world. I wish I could just go to sleep and stay asleep- forever. That's all I want. Just to rest. I'm so tired all the time. I hate my family. I hate my fake friends. I hate myself. There are a few reasons in my life that make me want to keep living. But like a candle they are easily existguiajed by a small burst of wind. My candle keeps going out. It keeps extinguishing. And I'm tired of it. I just want to live my life happily. But that is near impossible. I'm going to kill myself and no one can stop me.
