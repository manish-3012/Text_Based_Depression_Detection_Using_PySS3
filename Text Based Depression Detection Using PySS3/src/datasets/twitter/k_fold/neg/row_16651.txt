Fuck itThis isn't the first post I've left here, but it may very well be my last. If you're that interested, you can read up on what's been stewing in my head for the last decade or so.

Just when I thought I was on an upswing... Now I'm out of a job. All the shit I had planned out. Gone. One of the last crapshoots I had at happiness. Gone. There ain't any similarly paying jobs around that will get me the money I need in time. If you're wondering what that is/what the situation is, look through my post history.

Universe, you cruel son of a bitch; bring those armed thugs I so feared a couple of weeks ago. Bring the punchline by which this joke of a life may end.

I'm fucking ready.
