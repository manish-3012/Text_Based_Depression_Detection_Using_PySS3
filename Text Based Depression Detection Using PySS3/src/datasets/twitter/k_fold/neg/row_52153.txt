I wasn't accepted to uni and I want to dieI don't know what to do the whole year. I've been dealing with a lot of issues and I really tried my best to get in. This isn't my first time not being accepted to the major I applied for and I just feel so tired. I don't even want to live anymore. I'm just so tired of being strong all the time.
