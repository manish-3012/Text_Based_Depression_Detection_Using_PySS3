DoneI've set a date, my birthday in about a month. I don't want to live my life anymore. I'm starting to write letters and get things in order. Now my only decision left is how. And how to say goodbye to the one person I miss most. Do I just leave get a letter, do I try and call, or do I do nothing? She refuses to talk to me, so there's not much can do
