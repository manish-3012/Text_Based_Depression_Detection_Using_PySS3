Iâ€™m Stuck HelpI was trying to enjoy myself and went to see a movie. I was watching the trailers and I saw â€œJune 2020â€ â€œMay 2020.â€ My mind kept saying â€œyouâ€™re not going to live that long. You wonâ€™t live to see that far.â€ My depression and Suicidality is hitting hardcore and I have no idea why. These spells, these whirlwinds wonâ€™t stop. I want them to fucking stop. Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t know why my mind is dragging me to this place. My brain wants to kill me.
