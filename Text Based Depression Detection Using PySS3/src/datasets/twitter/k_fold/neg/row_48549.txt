Exams tomorrow, doomed, want to die.I have finals starting tomorrow, and I am so damn screwed. Iâ€™ve spent the entire semester lying in bed, letting a kind of â€” cellular, physical â€” misery work itself through me, thinking myself towards death. No friends, no parties, no studying. I have achieved excellence only in my commitment to nothingness. 

 And come tomorrow I will be as good as dead. I can't leave college but I don't know how I can stay. I can't even think in the future tense anymore. 

A couple of times, Iâ€™ve practiced tying a hangmanâ€™s knot and slipping it around my neck, perching on the edge of the chair. Each time I expect it to be terrifying and to stop my heart cold, but it never is and it never does: Instead, I have this impossible feeling of warmth. The first time I almost cried from how good it was, standing there yet so close to *not* standing there, the noose holding me tight. I am really thinking I should quit rehearsing and take the step.
