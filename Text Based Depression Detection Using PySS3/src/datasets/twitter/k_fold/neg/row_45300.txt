I hate my life fuck everythingI'm really running out of hope and I don't see a decent future. Im 20 years old. I have no friends, no job, lpr reflux food will come up throat sometimes and I think it's ruining my lungs too, aspergers, low IQ 85-90, ugly with good looking parents, possible heart problem alright that's enough I can't list anymore problems there's too many. Poor me fuck life sick of it, why continue living when my luck is total fucking shit? Everyone around me has a better life than me. My only regret in life is not being someone else.
