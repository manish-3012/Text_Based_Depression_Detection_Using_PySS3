I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it.It's a long crazy story that I seriously don't feel like getting into (because I could write a book about my shitty life), but the title pretty much says it all.

I've been suicidal for a long time, but no more than I've felt in the last few months. I really can't imagine myself getting old. It just doesn't seem worth it, and I don't want to be a nasty shitty old man.

I fell in love with a girl, and after five years, she left me. Before the breakup, I was actually excited about my life for a while, and I was able to picture myself getting old and having dreams and whatnot. Then she left me and I can't help but feel like it's because I'm a fuck-up and she realized it.

I've been suicidal for years, and I always pictured myself dying before the age of 27 and I'm starting to get close (I'm 25). Sometimes I just wish I owned a gun so I could just pull a trigger and end my life like that, but I don't. I'm on a cocktail of antidepressants and antianxieties, and I seriously contemplate swallowing them by the handful, but I'm too much of a cowardly bitch to go out writhing in a nauseous pain, with my gut eating itself alive. I probably wouldn't even succeed, and just end up falling into a coma, going through a stomach pump, and suffering the reality of failing with stomach ulcers and medical debt.

I never asked to exist, and this shit is really getting old.
