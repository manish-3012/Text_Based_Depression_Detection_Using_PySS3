it hurts so muchi was forced to move to a different country. my dad didnâ€™t even tell me we were moving. he said we would â€œonly visitâ€, but that a lie, just like everything else he says. i had to leave my friends behind without saying goodbye. i left my cats. i left my house and my instruments, only to be forced to move into a homophobic and transphobic country. iâ€™m so tired of it all. i donâ€™t understand why i should live anymore. thereâ€™s nothing left for me here. anyone i talk to will play it off as a joke, or say some stupid bullshit like â€œit will get better somedayâ€. itâ€™s not getting better, and with my situation, iâ€™m not sure it ever will. i just wish someone was actually fucking there for me. i feel like everyone hates me. even though i have friends, i feel so unwanted by them. like an annoyance. a burden. my whole life has been flipped upside fucking down. i hate all of this. no one wants me around, not even my parents. they hate me, and even if they say they donâ€™t, i know they will if i come out. i feel so alone and worthless. like my life has no meaning, and no matter how hard i try, i can never get out of these stupid thoughts. i just wake up, go to school, come home, eat, do homework, and lay around the rest of the day. nothing matters to me anymore. i have nothing to live for.
