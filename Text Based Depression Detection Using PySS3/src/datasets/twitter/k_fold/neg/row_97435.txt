i feel like i have nothing to live for.Iâ€™ve been hospitalized twice in the past year and I donâ€™t plan on getting hospitalized again so Iâ€™ve decided to keep my feelings and suicidal ideation to myself. It feels as if nothing is working and that Iâ€™m going to feel like this forever. Iâ€™ve had several therapists and tried a variety of medication over the past 10 years and Iâ€™m tired. Holidays and my birthday always hit harder than other days. I know I donâ€™t truly want to kill myself but I think about it constantly throughout the day. I wish I could be happy. Iâ€™ve fantasized about all the different ways I could kill myself and it scares me. I donâ€™t enjoy any of the things I used to and everyday is repetitive. I feel hopeless and I want to feel like I have something to live for. Iâ€™ve explored so many hobbies but I feel nothing. I have no passions and I feel like a failure. I want this to pass but it feels like Iâ€™ll feel like this forever and I donâ€™t think I can live like this anymore.
