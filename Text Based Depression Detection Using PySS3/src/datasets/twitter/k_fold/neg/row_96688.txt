Living with mentally ill people has worsen my mental healthEveryone in my household has some kind of mental health-related issues (diagnosed) and it's the worst. I'm pretty sure I do but I'm not gonna get a diagnostic because it makes it "real". I'm also scared that one day employers will look at my medical chart and judge me based on my mental health (if I managed to survive past 20)... so I'm probably gonna suffer till my bitter end, which is not too far away. It sucks because sometimes they have manic episodes and they start being offensive and telling you horrible stuff and the other day it's like nothing happened... it's hard to ignore something when you're around it 24/7. I wish I had a talent or at least an attractive body so I could make money and leave this hellhole.
