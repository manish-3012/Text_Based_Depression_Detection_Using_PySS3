Decided to do it, then talked myself out of it.Some quick background, I am active duty military deployed overseas. 

Been struggling with depression for about a decade now, and I haven't reached out for help because the military is still a vile place to have mental health issues. 

My wife of about two years tells me she doesn't want to be married anymore, and when I get home she is leaving me.

The short version is that I decided to go back to my shit hole of a barracks room and kill myself so I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore. I bought a bottle of Jim Bean, a bottle of sleeping pills, and a razor. I decided, to enjoy my last few hours of life. So I went and ate some fast food, I walked around and just kind of did whatever I wanted. I came home and set my plan into motion. I watched some TV and ate some snacks, and I did something I haven't done in a long time. I laughed, genuinely, and loudly. I don't remember the last time I actually laughed. I'm usually the one making people laugh, and I'm always in a good mood.

The perspective from others is that I am the comedian. I  bring the laughs, I keep morale high, and I cheer people up. But I feel like a hollow man, a shell, an actor. I am this character that I've carved out because I see the need for him to exist. But in my many years of living this lie, I have seen two of my friends take their own lives. These two friends were almost like me in every way, never a problem, never a frown, never a bad day. But they eventually did what I've wanted to do for a long time now. One in Japan, one stateside. Neither of them was expected, they were both shocks to the system. But nothing changed after they left, not in the military anyway. I see higher-ups talking to people who have attempted to take their own lives, or said they had the desire. To their face, they care and they will do 'whatever' they are needed to. But behind their backs, they are ''faggots, pussies, selfish, wimps, needy, whiney, pretenders". This boils my blood because I mean it when I offer help. And these so-called 'leaders' see these men and women as another burden to bear.

But, I digress. I had an enjoyable evening. I laughed, I ate, and I started to think about all the reasons I should stay alive. Call me crazy if you like, but my number one reason is my Dog. I know my wife hates him, and she only keeps him because he's mine. But he's my best friend, and I don't want him to end up back in the shelter because of me. His welfare and safety were just enough to keep me hanging on. So once that reason set it, I knew I couldn't do it. 

But more reasons came to mind after. If I kill myself, every person I hate wins. It may be spiteful, but I'm alive. Fuck those people. I also think about the good in the world, if I take away my contributions of good, then evil won anyway. The world won't improve by taking good people out of it.

I'm now trying to map out the next couple of months, and years. I know a divorce is coming my way, and if I can make it through that I can probably handle anything after that. I am still hesitant to seek help, as my clearance can be taken away and I'll become a military pariah.  I wish I could see a civilian doctor, I acknowledge that I'm probably hanging on by a thread. But I also realize that if I throw in the towel now, I'm guaranteeing that it will never get better. 

Here's to recovery, I wish you guys luck. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.
