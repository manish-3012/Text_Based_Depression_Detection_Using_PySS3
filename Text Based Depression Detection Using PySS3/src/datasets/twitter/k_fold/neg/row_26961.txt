Success in LifeFirst off I would like to say, I don't think I would commit suicide, but you just never know. I have struggled my whole life to get ahead and always came up short. It does not matter how hard you work  in this life to get ahead. Some people will just lose. I boiled down the ingredient to success to three things. It has to do with luck, timing and persistence; however, all three have to be present. You must have luck along with persistence and the perfect timing. So, I'm to the point of why even try. Because without ever having the luck and the timing you will remain in the rat race of life because persistence in itself is basically jacking off with no ending pleasure. I don't want to live an average life. I have tried to do this for 15 years and Im bitter, worn out and jaded. I don't want to roll out of bet to just survive. I want to thrive. I have always wanted to start my own business because I know its the only way out of the rat race; however, I always fail every time I try to start one. Along with the items above, I recently read zero to one and have came to the conclusion your business needs to be a monopoly or have extremely low competition, which is near impossible nowadays. Any other type of strategy you will be chasing your tail for business. So, I just hope and pray one of these days I can figure out the right business. So I can have the freedom to do my own thing and not have to punch a time clock and listen to the bosses shit.
