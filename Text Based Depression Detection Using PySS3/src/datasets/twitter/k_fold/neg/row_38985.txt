I'm probably going to kill myself in a couble of hours.I wrote a note, and currently heading out. If I'm that sure, then why am I writing here? Some faint glimmer of hope maybe. I dunno. Most likely won't read or respond to anything. That's a shitty thing to do, I know. I will delete the post if I don't do it.
