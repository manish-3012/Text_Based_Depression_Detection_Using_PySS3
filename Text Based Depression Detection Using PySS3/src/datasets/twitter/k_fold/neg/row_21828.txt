I don't want to kill myself, but I don't see how to end the torment of loneliness. I have no friends, I'm too ugly to date. I hate every day of my life and it only gets worse.I am not going to kill myself, but I don't understand what other options there are, when nothing I do fixes anything. I'm so lonely.
