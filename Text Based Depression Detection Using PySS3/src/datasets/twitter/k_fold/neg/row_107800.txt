Can't stand living one more minuteI seriously have no motivation in life anymore whatsoever. A little background, I come from a middle class family and we weren't really super close. My parents are both successful chemists which is awesome, and my brother just graduated college for EE a year ago and is working in Kansas City. Super successful and I'm proud. Me on the other hand, I was honors all through school, great outlook. I had plans for college and everything but I fucked it up and now I'm 20 years old, going on 21 and I'm pregnant, moved out when I was 18 due to a fight with my dad. 
Fast forward, I live with my boyfriend and his cokehead parents. I'm so sick of being around drugs it's not even funny anymore. His mom gets on my last nerve every day just because she literally complains about the same thing EVERYDAY in the same order. ("You guys wash the same clothes all the time" No we don't wash the same clothes, we both own lots of clothing, we don't even wash clothes everyday, and we haven't really repeated clothes in so long. We have a literal pile of baskets overflowing with clothes that we haven't washed because when we wash one load she will start bitching.) I'm getting so fed up with her ways and I know the only reason she is like that, is because she's on drugs. As I said, I'm pregnant and now I feel trapped in my lifestyle. I smoke cigs so I have had a few while being pregnant and it makes me feel horrible I've even smoked them but damn, I didn't even want to be pregnant at this time. I'm so depressed I can't even afford conditioner or soap to shower. I have no job and no car due to my ignorance a few years ago. I'm so done with my life it's gotten to be a joke. I miss my old life sincerely. All I ask myself is why did I have to fuck up when I was so damn close to succeeding like the rest of my family? I feel so ashamed and embarrassed. I can't even tell my parents I'm pregnant I'm so afraid of disappointing them even more than I have.
