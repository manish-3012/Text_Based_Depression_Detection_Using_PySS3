Why is it so funny to give someone hope and lead them on, and then destroy every ounce of confidence they had?I always knew I was a joke, I knew I was a loser, I knew I wasn't worth loving. I never was loved, and this world is a lie. I'm not fucking real. I'm just going to fucking od or just dissociate more. I can't believe I was so naive and so fucking foolish to think I was actually going to be given a chance for getting better, to think I wouldn't be manipulated to look like a monster and abuser again. Yeah, have fun pussy hopping, fucking jerk. Thanks for destroying my fucking last ounce of self esteem and making me actually think I was worth something and worth being loved by you. Thanks for hitting that last final blow. You don't love me, you want me dead, just like the fucking others. I thought you were mother fucking different, I guess not.
