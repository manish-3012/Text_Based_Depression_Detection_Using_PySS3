Eating disorder ruining my lifeiâ€™m 17, my eating disorder is ruining my life. I already have other mental illnesses but my ED is making everything worse, iâ€™m insecure to the point i cry everytime i leave the house because iâ€™m embarrassed of people seeing me. I see doctors for it and am medicated but i donâ€™t see the point anymore, iâ€™ve been abusing laxatives for years and whenever i eat i cut myself and go further into a depressive state. Itâ€™s making my anxiety and panic attacks get so so awful everyday is just recovering from the last, My doctors know and theyâ€™re trying to help me but for what? iâ€™ve been this way for years and it hasnâ€™t gotten better. Iâ€™m just so tired
