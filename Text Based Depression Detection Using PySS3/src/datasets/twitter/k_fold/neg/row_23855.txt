Posted this in the depression subreddit. Need to speak to someone or somebody somehow. I don't think I have much time left.Here is my story and my background

---

I've tried talking to therapists, psychiatrists, I've been in the ER for suicidal thoughts 10 times at least in that time, I'm on endless medication.

The only thing left that my family can say to me is that I should try getting ECT. That's how bleak my life's outlook has become.

I love my ex-girlfriend more than anyone I've ever known in my life. She is the only person in my entire life that has ever made me feel cared about or loved. She suffers from borderline personality disorder which has caused her to behave erratically for a while. But I still love her despite it. I know I have my issues as well so I can't just dismiss her for that; otherwise, why wouldn't I just say I deserve the same?

I feel sick constantly, like I'm going to puke my stomach inside out. I can't sleep but I still can't get out of bed for half the day. At this point my brain literally cannot process the pain anymore and it's manifesting in extreme physical pain.

This is it. I don't expect this to work, but I also don't have a choice. I have to take the chance, for myself, even if the odds are .1 that something good comes of it.

At the same time I realize that's probably the real odds that I have to continue living after this. I feel like I'm staring down the barrel of a loaded gun. 

I have to do this. I need this to stop, one way or another. I'm fucking scared. Help.

Today has been a nightmare. I was hoping the holidays would make things feel easier for a while, but this is the hardest it's ever been for me. I don't want to be alive anymore. I just want everything to go away and to just stop existing.
