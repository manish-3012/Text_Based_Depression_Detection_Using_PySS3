what will happen if I tell my psychiatrist?i attempted suicide last night (with sleeping pills and a plastic bag), and now I am glad that I survived. I was running out of air before I was unconscious, and I took off the bag, since that is the instinct. I passed out for a while and woke up feeling so sick, I drank a bunch of glasses of water because I read that's something to do if you're poisoned. however, I am very sick still. I feel a lot of pain and like I have the flu sort of. and I don't think I am emotionally stable yet. so I know I should tell my parents and my psychiatrist but I don't know what will happen. I'm afraid to go to a psychiatric hospital. I'm sorry if this is badly written, I can't think clearly.
