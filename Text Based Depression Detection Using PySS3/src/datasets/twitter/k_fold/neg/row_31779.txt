I am close to the edge (repost)My childhood has been filled with every type of abuse (sexual, physical, emotional) and I have suppressed it so long I think Iâ€™m going crazy, at school and at home people see me as this popular girl and I am in too deep into that persona I donâ€™t know myself anymore, I have also been self harming in ways that I can easily play off as normal and knock myself out with sleeping pills and nearly overdosed twice but still no one knows

I have no one to talk to about any of this and I think an anonymous AMA will help me Ask ANY questions, there is nothing OTT you can ask I want to spill everything
