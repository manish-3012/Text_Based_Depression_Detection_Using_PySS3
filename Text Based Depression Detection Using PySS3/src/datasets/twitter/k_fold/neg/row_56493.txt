Iâ€™m confused about myself...Primarily, I donâ€™t mean to mislead you all with the clickbait-esque title. I didnâ€™t know how else to phrase it. This post probably doesnâ€™t 100 percent belong here on sw, but it is. Anyways, on to what I made this post for. While I donâ€™t have the constant urge to kill myself, it does appear in my mind a lot. Every so often per week the urge will (for a short period of time) come up again. In those moments I find myself lying on my stomach on my bed, my hands either stiffly folded behind my back, so that I canâ€™t do anything to myself, or out in front of me gripping the edge of the bed, so that I can not in any way get up from my bed to harm myself. I find this tactic works, but I wish I didnâ€™t have to use it. You see, thereâ€™s are times that I really, really want toâ€”no I need to cry, but no tears come out. Itâ€™s awful. Iâ€™m not dehydrated, so my body can afford to cry, but it just doesnâ€™t. Instead I end up fighting to suppress tears at the most inconvenient moments. I feel so over-dramatic for making this post, because others who make these types of posts have such better reason behind theirs, and I feel as if my "reason", which is stated in the first few sentences, seems pathetic. Ugh, not this really sounds like some sort of woe-is-me pity party. Please forgive me. I guess I donâ€™t know how I feel.
