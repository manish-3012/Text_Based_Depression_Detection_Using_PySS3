I'm too broke for anything else anywayI'm tired, I can tell it's not laziness with a certainty now. I'm paranoid im going to die violently when I go outside. It's partially why I'm unemployed. If I lived alone I would just wait for an eviction notice. My obligation to my roommates was my driving force to sidestep the issue. I don't even care, I'm fully aware that tomorrow rent will be late thanks to me but I'm hoping they yell at me because it'd make me feel like I'm apart of society. I'm too broke to exist. I want to find a way to tell my parents. my teeth continue to fall apart, and I can't tell if that pain outweighs my desire for medication. I can't afford these problems. I want to dry up and die so that I have a shot at being pitied in death.
