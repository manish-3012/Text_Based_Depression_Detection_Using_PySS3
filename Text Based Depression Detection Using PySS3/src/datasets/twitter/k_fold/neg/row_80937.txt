Thinking about everything I want to put in a noteA little over 3 weeks ago, I made a half assed attempt, after my best(and only) friend of 10 years told me she was â€œover it after my birthday passed and you said nothingâ€. I said nothing because she left town last minute with no warning, and I had a card to give her in person. Anyway, in the weeks since, Iâ€™ve gotten over that. If you can end things like that, you were never the friend I thought you were. I was able to talk the hospital into letting me go home after a couple days. I had been committed against my will. Our mental health department was supposed to call within a few days to get outpatient treatment going. Iâ€™ve been depressed for several years, coupled with severe anxiety. Medical problem after medical problem, with seizures starting the week before the attempt. Which was I think likely just another trigger. Anyways, my family doctor has been on sick leave for months now, and over 3 weeks has passed with mental health not contacting me. Iâ€™ve stopped self medicating. I havenâ€™t had a drink or any weed since before the ambulance showed up.(Downing pills directly in front of my husband wasnâ€™t the best choice to go with, but I was drunk and just beyond having any hope that night)

Anyways, if youâ€™ve gotten this far. I just, feel completely alone. My husband is gone for work 730am-6pm, at minimum. I have no friends. No one to talk to. And the thoughts just became way too much again last night. Iâ€™m trying to rationalize that I do love him, and I donâ€™t want him to have to live with the images of coming home to find me. And I donâ€™t really want to leave my dogs, or my pig. But Iâ€™ve spent the last 24 hours coming up with a mental list of actual effective ways to get the job done. Iâ€™m writing this here in the hopes it convinces me not to write the note Iâ€™ve been thinking about. I cried myself to sleep thinking about the things I want to say. I just. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I canâ€™t leave the house alone anymore because of the seizures. We had to take insurance off my car because Iâ€™m legally not allowed to drive now. Iâ€™m just, stuck. Even more than I had been before. My days are empty.
