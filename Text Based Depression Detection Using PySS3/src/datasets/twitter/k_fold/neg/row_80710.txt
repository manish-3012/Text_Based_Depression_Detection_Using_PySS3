I'm DoneMy friends have abandoned me.
My family treats me like shit.
The one woman I let myself love in years crushed me.

I've tried to move on and see the bright side of life, but it just doesn't exist for me. I'm 21 and I have a good career path, but I really don't see any kind of future for my self. I've tried just living day to day but it isn't working anymore. I've even reached out to someone who I thought was my best friend and told him I was thinking about killing myself, all I got was radio silence and its been 2 months. I feel like I just bother everyone around me by being alive. I've been struggling to keep my self together and the whole "fake it til you make it" thing isn't working anymore. I have no one in my life, no support system, and therapy has never helped me. I'm not sure I'm going to make it another year. I even have a plan of saving money and going somewhere out of the country where no one will know me so that I can end my life and not have to worry about the fake people who will say they missed me .
