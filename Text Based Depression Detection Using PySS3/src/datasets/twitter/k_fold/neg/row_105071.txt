I have given up and I regret itHey random person,

I just can't anymore. Day by day I drag myself to school. I goof around with my friends and actually, it got somewhat better compared to me a year ago, but I feel worse. I started to be a more active user on Reddit, browsed there and posted that. Life felt like it got better. But still, those feelings linger next to me every second in my life. As soon as I have just a moment of bliss, those feelings come back. I tried seeking treatment, but it was just talking. I talked to my psychiatrist, but it did not feel like I had any progress even after three months. I dropped it because my dad got concerned that my psychiatric issues are interfering with my studies. My mother was not really better, all she did was blame herself since she did not notice my problems. For a moment after I "finished" therapy, cuz that's what I claimed to get away, my parents were nicer and caring, but now they just went back to the regular. I have an older brother who I admire deeply, but I don't want to tell him. Fucking dammit, my brother was more of a father figure most of my life than my actual father.  I just don't wanna burden him with my problems since I think he does not deserve it. 
The worst thing is when people I consider my best friends tell you that I just say stuff like this because I want attention.

As soon as that thought manifested it also frequented my mind. Am I just seeking for attention, the kind I never got from home? Well, a lot of people would claim that my family is loving and caring, but actually, we are all busy with our own problems. And when I ask my parents for REAL help. Not because I got into an argument with somebody or something like that. When I reach out to them as a human being to another. When it actually needs consideration and not just talk, I am not taken seriously. I learned to live with it, even started to be the fool in school or when I am in private with "friends". It's just easier if I make crippling jokes about myself because those give me some kind of attention, although not the kind I want. Still, every single moment I have those torn feelings. I feel empty and hollow. Like someone who has given up playing the game and waits for it to end. All the time. Being told that I just seek attention just deepens my doubt and self-loath. Am I really that much of a sick human being that I do this?

Since New Year those feelings got stronger and stronger. No one noticed that I changed. 
Just recently the last place I considered somewhat of a home turned its back to me. I've never told anyone of them, but yesterday I was told that most of them are irritated by me. I knew why. I knew that since a few months, but every single time something inside me said "Do this, show yourself" something else just acted like a complete moron and did the usual, acting like a fool and making people detest me. I tried to apologise before that, but I won't be forgiven. I opened my heart and I was told to work on myself. That's it. I wanted to complain. I wanted to get mad, but I didn't. Being told that most just don't care when you open your mouth and are even annoyed by you. Just getting negative feedback. I forced myself to say goodbye like a normal person would, I even said thank you and told the person it helped me a lot being told this. It just hurt.

I don't even know why I post this. Part of me wants help, but the other, stronger part just tells me again and again that I want attention, that I'll duck out again anyways.
I feel like a prisoner inside my mind and some lunatic managed to infest it, every time I am normal, like the normal kind person I am. The guy who cries when he watches sad commercials, I am not around others. Around others, I just make cynical, often self-crippling, jokes.

Although my parents are both professionals in the branch that should be able to best deal with cases like me, I think they have better things to take care off than me. I won't do it yet, I still have to keep going for my brother at least. He deserved better than a parasitic brother who has never paid him back for anything he did for me.

At the end, I think I just had to say it out loud once, hoping that at least one person takes me serious, yet every time I am told that I am being taken seriously I don't believe it. Do I loath myself that much, is my own opinion of myself that low, that I can't take myself serious? Do I fear that deep down, I am just seeking attention?
