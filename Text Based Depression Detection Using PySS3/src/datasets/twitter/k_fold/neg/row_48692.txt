Last night was awfulOkay so basically read my latest post if you want to know the full story but ill sumarize

im a 12 year old boy and go read my other posts to know why i did this

yesterday i posted how i had a plan to kill myself by hanging because it sounded like the least painful and i tried it a little early. I was planning to on sunday but I tried yesterday night. I waited until 12 to go outside and i found a sturdy branch fairly soon. I tried a bungee cord but that didnt work. Then I remembered my mom has some rope in the garage so I took advantage of that. the thing is I suck at tying knots. I looked up how to and I still suck, I eventually got it right and i got off the chair i was standing on to get up to the branch and i could still stand up. The best thing that could do was make me pass out if i restrain myself. In other words it was 2 hours of me struggling so that sucks!
