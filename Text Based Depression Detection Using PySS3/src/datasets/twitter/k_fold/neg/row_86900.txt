If I could will myself to die...In the last 5 years, I have found myself at the point of suicide several times. It is a cycle, always returning to the beginning point. It is not illogical. The person I love more than anything, definitely more than myself, does not love me. He says he loves me. But he does not.

His birthday was today. Mine is in 6 days. I gave up every bit of my birthday presents in order to provide him with one. He told me I have never given him anything, ever, that he wanted. But, alas, it wasn't enough. Despite my sacrifice, it wasn't enough.

That sounds so petty, but the thing is, it is never enough. It will never be enough. I cannot leave. My life is entwined with his, based on his. I cannot live without him, but I am nothing to him and only worsen what life he has. 

I am at the point where I am completely and utterly willing to end my life for some hope of having sacrificed enough. Or at least putting an end to not being enough. 

My life is not worthwhile enough to celebrate. I am 28 years old. And I am nothing.

I have a plan. I have the intent. I have the means. I have no reason.
