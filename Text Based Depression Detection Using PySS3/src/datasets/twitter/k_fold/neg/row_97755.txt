Can't find anything to live for anymoreMy depression these past 4 months have brought me to a new low. I no longer am motivated to work or study in order to make extra income. I also was sticking around to take care of my mother. I don't care about that either. If I'm not here, my family will have to pick up the slack. She won't remember much in any case because her memory has gone to pieces. 

I know she would be sad but I can't bring myself to care. She never listens to me or believes me. No one in my family does, yet I've been proven to be the only logical one. My friends are never around when I'm in a crisis. When they do talk, they don't help or give an opinion (I ask for it) and just tell me all will be alright. 

The only thing keeping me distracted lately is a new guy who ignores me nowadays. He's too busy apparently.

I don't deserve to be here. I'm probably alone for so long because everyone has picked up that I'm a nut job. I hate myself and my life.
