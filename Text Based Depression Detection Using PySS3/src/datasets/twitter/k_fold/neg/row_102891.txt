My friend told me women donâ€™t deserve jobs and now itâ€™s 2 am and Iâ€™m contemplating suicide againMy friend is a Jewish white guy who works in hollywood and thinks he is oppressed. Today he went on a rant to me when he found out I got a film grant just for women, that it was inherently sexist towards men. When I asked how, he went on a rant about how when he was in film school, his teacher said he was a man so he could never be a director. I said I found this totally hard to believe, and that i hadnâ€™t heard of such a thing. He started screaming at me, saying â€œHow dare you discredit my lived experience?â€ When I threw that right back at him, saying in film school women were chosen to direct less than men, he said I was lying. Eventually he made me fold within myself and pretend he was right so he would stop screaming and causing a scene. Worst part was, all the other women at the table agreed with him, and shot daggers at me. On the way home, I cried my eyes out, and now I canâ€™t sleep at its 4 am. I havenâ€™t been able to find work in a year and he still works at our old company. He says I havenâ€™t had work because I suck, not because Iâ€™m a woman. I said well what about the film grant? He said â€œthey just feel bad for you and itâ€™s not fair.â€ I wanna commit suicide anyways because of the long term unemployment and repeated humiliation. I have no one in my life to lean on, not even mom and Dad, and Iâ€™m really getting suicidal tonight. On what grounds are womenâ€™s film initiatives repressing men? When men are 80% of the field?
