I don't think it will ever end.For context:  I am a 30 year old male.  Growing up, I was always the life of the party.  Sure, I drank more than my fair share, but i was never angry or abusive.  Everyone loved me.  I can't think of a day that i spent alone.  2 years ago, i decided to take my ex back.  We had broken up 4 years prior for numerous reasons - i told myself i had forgiven them.  We caught up, talked, apologised and a couple of months later they moved interstate and moved into my apartment with me.  A couple of weeks later, the fighting started.  The fights were over drugs (them, not me) and not working.  Getting tired of being the only one trying in the relationship, i cheated.  Honestly i know it wasnt my smartest move...but i did it.  I kept it a secret.  I found out my SO had cheated on me and i berated them and yelled at them, knowing full well that i had done the same.  One night whilst fighting, my SO punched me in the head.  In that exact moment i became withdrawn, reclusive, introverted.  I stopped talking to friends and family.  I stopped leaving the house.  A month later, i admitted that i had cheated.  My SO went through my computer, including social media, my phone, everything. They texted everyone and posted all over the internet what i had done.  This has been ongoing for the last 18 months now.  They still do drugs (pot and meth) and everyday i am yelled at screamed at.  I only go to work.  I don't leave the house for any other reason.  I have tried to.  But i came home to holes in the walls.  My things smashed.  When we argue they take my bank cards, my public transport cards.  They have thrown out my passport and ID.  I am the only one who works.  Everything is in my name.  I can't leave.  I can't throw them out on the street.  I can't be that person.  Not after what i did in the beginning.  I can't leave - they will destroy my life.  The only thing i can think of is just... going.  I don't want to, but i don't see any other way.
