I've been thinking about it more and more lately.I'm a 22 year old guy from the southern usa.  I got my GED when I was 16 because my high school was shit and my superintendent knew it and loved me.  I blew 2 years at a worthless for-profit school because I was a young idiot and I'm in about 50k worth of loan debt.  I have no job, no car, and no real way to do anything.  I'm living at home with my dad with no real prospects of doing anything...  I even tried to join the military, but was discharge and diagnosed with [Cyclotymic Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclothymia) which for me just makes me really depressed easily.


Because of our rural location and only owning 1 vehicles which he uses for work, there's absolutely nothing I can do for myself.  If our location was more ideal, I wouldn't mind having even a shitty minimum wage job.


I just feel stuck.  More and more my 9mm Luger seems more friendly because it's really the only escape I have.  I've chambered it and looked down the barrel more than once while trying to think of a reason not to do it.  I never get nervous or scared while doing this.  I think the only reason I haven't is because of my Dad.  I wouldn't want him having to deal with all of that.


I can't really think of any other reason why I shouldn't just disappear and do it.  Other than him, I don't mean anything to anyone.  I contribute nothing and I feel like I'm just a drain.
