I don't knowI don't know if this is a note or a cry for help. I've been stuck in a downward spiral since I was a teenager. I keep thinking "well this time I've hit rock bottom" and then the floor crumbles under me and I continue. For years I've struggled alone. For reasons I don't want to get into (family, upbringing, the same sad story you've all heard a thousand times) I just can't seem to connect with anyone. Enter the girlfriend, let's call her Lala. She's an absolute angel and for whatever reason, she seems to love me. I love her too, and that may just be the reason I've been systematically and one-sidedly doing everything I can to destroy the relationship. I've cheated on her more times than I can count. I told her once and she was heartbroken, but she forgave me and begged me never to do it again. The look on her face broke my heart. It didn't stop me, but I no longer have the heart to tell her. I don't know why I do it. I don't even want to do it. As far as she knows, we're a happy couple, but I'm dying inside. I keep telling myself she'll leave eventually. It'll get out and she won't forgive me a second time. She says she'll forgive me as many times as it takes, but that's bullshit. Everyone has their limit. I'm a coward. I disgust myself. I don't deserve her. I don't deserve anything, not even death. I deserve to sit here in this hell I've created for myself until I don't even have a shred of identity left. I deserve to stay alive and suffer until she's gotten whatever justice she needs. Whatever justice she deserves. I won't, though. I'm just working up the nerve to quit my job. It should be easy, but part of me enjoys having some purpose even if its just slinging food to whatever fat load wobbles into the door. I can't make any decisions. I've heard that everyone has at least one positive thing about them, but I'm probably the exception to that rule. I'm the worst person I've ever met.
