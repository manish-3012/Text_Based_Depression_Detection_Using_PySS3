How do you get the courage to take the final step?I'm so terrified to do it. I know I want to, I know I dont want to actually live. I'm just trying to smooth sail through life. And somehow just survive. But honestly tired of just surviving. I feel like one foots constantly out the door. I need to decide. Should I live. Should I not live. I started occasionally taking a few extra sleeping pills just to see how it feels. to slowly practice.
