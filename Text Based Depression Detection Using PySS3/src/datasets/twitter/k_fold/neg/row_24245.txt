I'm such a burden to everyone around meThere are days that I just suddenly feel incompetent and a disappoint to the point where I just want to die and leave everyone. I don't care what happens to them after. It's their fault. But then I think about my family and I'm hit with guilt. My education is not cheap and my family has to adjust financially and to die before I finish it would be like throwing all their effort, time and money for me. This makes me even more disappointed in myself. I don't know if this is depression. I don't think so. But I strongly believe that everybody else's lives would be so much better without me in it. I try talking about it to a friend but I feel like I'm just adding to her own problems.
