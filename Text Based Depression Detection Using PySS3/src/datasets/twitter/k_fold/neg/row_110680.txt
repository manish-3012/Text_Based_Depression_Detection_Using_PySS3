I just needed to ventOkay so Iâ€™m not trying to get any sympathy from anyone but I just need to vent so Iâ€™ve been feeling really fucking down the past month or so cause basically on The last day of school I was riding to work and I fell off my bike and I ended up breaking my collarbone unfortunately the funny part is I didnâ€™t even know it was broken after I fell off my bike I literally got right back up and rode to work with a broken collarbone... I mean donâ€™t get me wrong my shoulder hurt but I genuinely didnâ€™t think it was broken but yeah I guess Iâ€™m just really tough anyways this has me so fucking down cause I gotta be out of work for at least another month and a half I had surgery on my collarbone June 13th so about 3 weeks ago It was very scary like I was supposed to fucking move to nyc this year ðŸ˜” Because I just graduated Iâ€™m 17 turning 18 in August and like yeah I probably wonâ€™t be able to move to nyc until like April or March... depending on when I can get a job... Iâ€™m so fucking Terrified I wonâ€™t be able to get a job tbh... my goal is to get a job by my moms house cause thereâ€™s a lot of like stores and fast food places by my moms house and itâ€™s only like 1 mile away so I could easily walk there everyday but Iâ€™m so scared I wonâ€™t be able to find a job in that area ðŸ˜” Iâ€™m sorry that my grammar is so bad my apologies but yeah if you guys could make me feel better it would honestly mean the world to me like honestly I was doing so fucking good in life and honestly I could say I was fucking HAPPY for once in my life and then this happens... so Iâ€™m back to being depressed ðŸ˜”
