i have no friends. i'm 150% sure that i lost one of my friends over something extremely foolish that i did (although i'm taking the blame, i wasn't alone in doing this) and she won't forgive me even though i had profusely apologized to her. she's one of my best friends.

all my friends are her friends as well and they are too nice to take sides. 

i've been severely depressed and anxious over losing my friends and i don't think she'll talk to me ever again once school starts tomorrow.

all of this "drama" epitomizes why i would never succeed in life and why there is no point in trying to live. nobody ever likes me enough to stand by my side and help me. i'm better off dead. i'm easily replaceable. 

i've set the date. it's going to be some time in april after i finish some school business. 

i'm writing this as an open letter for help. i'm the only child, i have no pets, i have no friends. at the end of the day i just want a non-judgmental somebody i can talk to, you know? 

UPDATE 2/21: everything is getting worse. i didn't fall asleep until 3 am (which is a first) because i was so sad over everything. i didn't do homework. and she's still not talking to me and deleted me off of friends lists. she still has to sit next to me in science but it's just gotten worse because she doesn't help me put up chairs or get calculators anymore (she used to do that a week before, even when she was mad at me) i went to the counselor and he told me to hang in there (i didn't talk about my depression; lunchtime is too short) i can't seem to find the strength to though
