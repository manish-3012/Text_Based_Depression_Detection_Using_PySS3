im completely alone. iâ€™m sad. iâ€™m dumb. i wanna die.iâ€™ve drifted from everyone. i donâ€™t have my family to talk to. my parents are shitty. my boyfriend and i have been having some issues and talking about splitting. and to make this even fucking worse my absolute best friend of 6 years is drifting from me too. 

weâ€™ve never drifted like this. sheâ€™s the one person who iâ€™ve held onto. i met her when i moved schools in middle school and weâ€™ve been inseparable since. until now. we barely talk. i fucking hate it. 

my dad has a gun and i wanna just take it and get this over with. thereâ€™s a little park near that same friends neighborhood that would be perfect. we walked there all the time in middle school. iâ€™m gonna miss her and iâ€™m gonna miss my boyfriend but honestly they deserve to find someone better. i just wanna die.
