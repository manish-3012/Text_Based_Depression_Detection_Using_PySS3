Husband is trapped, but not as much as I am.I canâ€™t act tonight, but I'm planning. Husband feels like our bedroom is dead and it's making him feel trapped and unhappy. He doesn't get why but I've been suffering from depression essentially forever. Telling him I'm depressed doesn't help, he accuses me of exaggerating to avoid sex. I have next to no sex drive, but we generally have sex once a week, which feels fine for busy late-20s people. 

Anyway, I know how to fix it, and I'm going to help make his life better. I had to get it off my chest, but I can't tell anyone IRL because I'm worried they'd try to stop me out of obligation.
