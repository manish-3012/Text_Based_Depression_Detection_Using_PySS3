Sorry everyone I knowEven though people I know probably won't read this and know who I am, but I just needed to get this out there. I am sorry for being such a dissapointment. I am sorry for never being good enough. I'm sorry I couldn't do more. I'm sorry that i'm just leaving all of you, but I just can't take it anymore. Sorry.
