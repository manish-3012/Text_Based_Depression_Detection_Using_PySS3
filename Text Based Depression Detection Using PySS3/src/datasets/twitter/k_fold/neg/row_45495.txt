Alan watts makes dying peacefulIt used to get scarier each time but right now feels easy.  Washed down xx mg of clonazepam with some whiskey. Fhinking i might go out to get more drinks, come back and finish the rest of my benzo pile. They worry less the longer youâ€™re ill. 9 yeaes of this shit and these psychiatrists are still genius enough to allow me access to these pills even after i survived the first xanax od in 2014. K is the first therapist iâ€™ve been able to connect with, but heâ€™s sick of me now i know it because my BPD ruins everything.

As it goes
 â€œOther friends have flown beforeâ€”
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.â€
            Then the bird said â€œNevermore.â€
