Started new medication but feels like I'm falling backHey everyone, I don't ever know what to do with this stuff but I feel like shit and have for a very long time now.  I started taking zoloft 2 days ago and I doubt that it's the side effects that could be tipping me off the edge but I feel like I'm on the verge of self harm again.  I want to be alone and cut myself but I won't be able to find any time alone tonight because I'll be visiting my SO.  I have a fishing knife in my backpack.  I wish I could do it but I can't tonight.  I just want to shake this feeling.  It's horrible. 

I just want it to end but I can't do it.  How can I shake this feeling away for the night?
