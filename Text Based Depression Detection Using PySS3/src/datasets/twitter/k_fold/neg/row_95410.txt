Hopefully my situation will help you feel better about yours (very long)I realize that for anyone to be posting on here, some serious pain and suffering has to be taking place. I figured I'd share my story with you in hopes that you'll realize things could be worse. There are times where I think God hand-picked me for suffering. Anyway, here's the long and short of my existence - you can't really call it a life. 

 I'm 33 years old, have Asperger Syndrome and am more or less crippled by rheumatism. I also have Crohn's Disease, so it's no exaggeration when I say I live my life in constant pain.

In addition to the AS, I have a congenital right brain hemisphere defect that causes a portion of my occipital lobe to cease functioning at random, making me virtually incapable of performing any job. I've been fired from more jobs than I can count and have tried and failed numerous times to make a living through self employment.

I have never had nor will ever be able to have a sexual/romantic relationship as an illness I developed in childhood has rendered me permanently impotent. I was sexually abused throughout my early childhood and I'm at a point now where it constantly plays like a video on loop in my head and nothing has worked in getting it to stop.

I've gone to most every kind of therapist you can think of, tried nearly every kind of neurological and psychological treatment, been on a host of medications, all of which have failed to cure even one element of my suffering.

I live in government funded housing and the only bills I'm able to pay on my own are my cable/internet bill and car insurance. Even that will soon be beyond my capability as the inheritance I received when my grandfather died is about to run out. Going on disability is not an option as I've already drained enough of other people's hard-earned tax dollars.

As far as the Asperger Syndrome goes, I've had it for all of my life, as did both of my siblings. It began to manifest itself pretty much as soon as I entered school (though at the time it was labeled as "Non-Verbal Learning Disability) and consequently, I spent a lot of time in special education classes and nearly every special ed program the schools had. Needless to say, this made me the target of incessant bullying, even more so than I would have naturally been.

My parents chose to hide the diagnosis from all three of us, instead choosing to berate us whenever our symptoms showed up, screaming at us for not making friends, calling us lazy when we struggled academically, and saying we robbed them of the chance to have friends by not being able to play sports and introduce them to other kids' parents.

I only found out about my diagnosis when I was 16 and applying for my first job. I was looking for my birth certificate and in the search found a mountain of paperwork about me detailing my disabilities and the results of all the tests I'd taken in school when my parents were "trying to find out why was so lazy and apathetic".

To this day, they deny ever hiding anything from us or having known anything about the situation, even though they were caught red-handed. I sought out therapy on my own when I was old enough and was formally diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when I was 23.

I've tried DMARDs, physical therapy, and holistic methods, but so far no luck. Cimzia is the only Crohn's medication that has been able to do much for me, but at best it's about a 10% relief. I've tried many different diets too, but to no avail.

In regard to the brain function, I have trouble with visual processing but also with the integration of information, especially when it is presented too quickly. As I've been told by neurologists, the different parts of my brain don't communicate in the fashion that they should, especially with oral directions or carrying out a process. Even when I know exactly what I'm doing, there's a portion of my brain that basically shuts down at random, even if only for a few seconds at a time.

As a result of this, carrying out a multi-step process is very hard for me to do. For example, let's say I'm trying to make a spreadsheet. I know I'm supposed to read the information, enter the data, save the document, print it, and close it out. Even though I know the process by heart, my brain can skip out on me between steps such that I make the full spreadsheet but then skip over saving and printing and immediately close it before saving and the whole thing is gone (or alternately I may save it but never print it). That's not the specific situation that's led to be me being fired most of the time, but just an example of how my impediment works.

I spend hours every day scouring job boards, putting out applications, and either never hearing back or being rejected. When I try to be more aggressive and give a call or e-mail as to the status of my application, I'm always just told to be patient and that they'll get back to me, but it's very rare that this happens. Since my resume is mainly self employment and comprised of skills that have since been eliminated by apps, I'm not qualified for many jobs. Even when I do get hired, my troubles are just beginning as if I'm not fired for my incompetence, I eventually will be for absenteeism caused by my illnesses.

As far as the permanence of the impotence is concerned, it seems to be just that. I've seen many doctors and tried many medications but none work. This may be in the "too much information" category, but I've had a loss of erectile tissue and while I can briefly maintain an erection, I can't get much sensation during sex so the only experiences I've had have ended in humiliating failures and the women involved thinking I just wasn't attracted to them. 

Due to this, I've never had a real relationship in all of my life.
I've been on a lot of medications to address the PTSD resulting from the sexual abuse I suffered, but again, my efforts have been an exercise in futility. Clonadine (sp?), Klonopin, Amitriptyline, and Xanax are enough to help me get a few hours of sleep per night, but that's about it. The memory cycles ebb and flow, but right now they're at an extreme high. I live in the USA and I'll be fully broke by June if I can't find some way of generating an income. I'm on Medicaid (I had better insurance in the past) which doesn't cover a whole lot, so when it comes to the best of the best treatment, it's out of reach.

I'm reluctant to go on disability because I know how hard people work for what they're able to take home and how so much of it is already taken away by way of taxes and employers providing sub par wages due to the economy. I have a great degree of respect for anyone who puts in a hard day's work and the last thing I want to do is indirectly penalize them for it in order to keep someone who doesn't contribute anything of worth such as myself living.

I don't have much of a family. My sister died of alcohol poisoning in 2008 and my brother died of natural causes as a teenager. My father is alive but I haven't seen or spoken to him in 6 years as he's disowned me for not providing him with grandchildren, as having his last name carried on means more to him than anything else. He's gone as far as to accuse me of being homosexual, which I'm not and saying that my sexual health issues and PTSD are just a cover for my sexuality. Please understand I have nothing against LGBTQ people, but he does and when he makes these accusations they're meant to be an expression of scorn.

I see and talk with my mother a few times per month but we're not all that close. However, she's the main reason why I have any qualms about suicide as she's very religious and thinks it's a one way ticket to hell. She considers my sister's death to have been a suicide (it may have been, but I don't know) and frequently states she can handle the death, but not knowing that her only daughter is in hell.

The only meaningful relationship I have is with a nurse who I see three times per week at a neurology clinic where I go for services. In addition to being the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, she's also the best person I've ever met. She's the most kind, caring, compassionate, selfless, and giving person I've ever known and she goes above and beyond in trying to help me. Needless to say, I'm head over heels for her, but knowing that we'll never have a relationship beyond nurse and patient and the fact that she'll never see me as anything other than a poor creature to be pitied is heartbreaking for me.

I guess what I'm hoping is that as bad as your situation may be, you can benefit from my story by seeing that things can always be worse. Maybe that won't bring much solace or peace to you, but if there's any possible way I can make myself useful, I want to try to do it.
