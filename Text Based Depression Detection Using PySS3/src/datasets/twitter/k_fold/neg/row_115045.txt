I believe to be one of the most intelligent and rational thinkers that is alive today. This is a serious statement, please treat it as so.I strongly believe myself to be one of the most intelligent human beings alive. My mind operates mostly in the rational and logical state. I say "mostly" as I try to not speak in absolutes. This is my first ever thread on this website. I have messaged one individual on here a few months ago (with this account) to ask about his depression. That was the first time I posted on the internet since 2009. I have not had any friends since 2011. I rarely leave my bedroom. I have been heavily contemplating suicide for many reasons. You can ask me about ANYTHING. My thoughts about religion, laws, politics, education, anything. I am not sure about the proper way to word this, as I lack significant human interaction skills. I understand I will get many insults as this is the internet. All I ask is that you write WHY you think that about me.
