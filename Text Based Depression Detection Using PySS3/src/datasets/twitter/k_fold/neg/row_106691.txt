I am just going to become a burden, and I don't want thatHi

I have a decent job. For now. I don't see myself being able to keep it for long. I can't work anymore. My arms become lead whenever I have to work. I can't move. It used to be from anxiety, but now it is more apathy than anything. I don't care. I can't will my arms to move.

I had a breakdown a few months ago. I spent some time in hospital. And then I had a month off of work. I though I was ready to come back. I was feeling less stressed.

But now I feel just as useless as I did before. I don't think it is the anxiety as much anymore, but a complete and total lack of motivation. Nothing motivates me at all.

My doctor has been trying me on several combinations of medication, but nothing has worked so far. If the last one he put me on doesn't work by next week, he is talking about taking me off of my job.

I won't be able to get a new job. I screwed up my post grad when I was studying, so I don't have the qualifications to get anything decent. And I don't see myself being in a mental state to do any job properly.

I am going to become a burden on my parents. And I don't want that. I know that they love me. And that they will support me. But I don't want to do that to them. It would be easier for everybody if I just disappeared.
