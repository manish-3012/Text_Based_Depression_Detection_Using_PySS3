I'm so tired of itI don't why I'm even here. It feels so pointless. I feel stupid worrying about what I worry about, and feeling sad about the dumb shit in my life, but I guess I can't help it. I don't feel anymore, besides an aching sadness in my heart every once in a while. I'm so alone. No one will ever love me and my future is bleak. I'm just sitting here contemplating if I have the energy to end it all, while posting on this site because I needed to say something, anything to anybody, because I have no one. I'm just pathetic, too tired to even kill myself.
