I feel like no one cares about me. Like I could disappear and it would take a long time before anyone noticed.I have a single person in my life, however they are busy all the time and have their hands full of their own problems. Outside of that I don't have anyone to talk to. No one to ask for advice or help. I feel so lonely and unwanted.
