Posted to every other sub I could find any no replyim drunk and this is the only way I can ever talk about the fact that I actually want to commit suicide. I think I've tried but I'm too scared to actually do it. I just want to end it all. Any advice on how to do it? I've tried getting help but no one acually cares. People pretended to care for a few weeks after I told them, but now they're back to normal and don't give  a shit again. So there's no point even trying anymore. I've tried and it failed so there's no point doing it again.
