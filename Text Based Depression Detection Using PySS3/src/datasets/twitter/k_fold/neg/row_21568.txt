Not feeling it anymoreHey guys,
I'm not about to kill myself right now. But I've been close to it more than once. I'm still naive and have a lot to learn, but I've been exposed to all the dark corners of this world.

I'm tired. I'm aching. I feel like there's a loose screw or a fried circuit in my head. I can't keep going much longer. Everything has me stressed and worried and filled with angst. My mood fluctuates from downright depressed to overly excited for math problems. It happens constantly and I don't know why. 

People ask why I look so sad and I can't even answer.

Please help me figure out why life is worth living. Why do you continue to live your life?
