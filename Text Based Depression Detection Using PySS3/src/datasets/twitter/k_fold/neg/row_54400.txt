I will never be accepted by my family.Hello random persons who decided to read this. Iâ€™m fucking done. Iâ€™m done with life and everything else thatâ€™s been happening. Iâ€™ve officially given up. I will never be loved or accepted by my family. I can no longer be around them for they donâ€™t want to be around me.  Just cause Iâ€™m gay. 

Iâ€™ve tried always my best to fit in and not come out. (Cause I knew this would happen) but that shit has gone down the fucking drain. Someone in my family has outed me. Along time ago but it has affected me so negatively beyond comprehension 

I have trust issues cause of it. I have just been changed so drastically as a person because of that one action. Iâ€™m no longer happy. I can no longer enjoy the things that I used to. I feel shitty when I canâ€™t do anything but I just wanna do something!

My family is extremely homophobic. I can no longer be around small children in my family cause they think Iâ€™ll give them a homosexual disease. I canâ€™t literally wear rainbows or anything pastel colored for that manner for â€œThatâ€™s Gay Propaganda.â€  They just dislike me so much just cause Iâ€™m gay and it hurts. It really does. 

So Iâ€™m finally done. Iâ€™m gonna relieve a burden off there shoulders and mine. Itâ€™s not like there gonna miss me anyway. Iâ€™m gonna finally be free. I finally feel happy after all this time. Iâ€™m gonna just go and find a gun and shot myself. Quick and painless. Iâ€™m gonna buy ammo for the gun tomorrow. So if you made it here. Thanks for reading I appreciate it. I love each and every one of you. Yâ€™all are such a better family than what I have. Thanks for supporting me goodbye.
