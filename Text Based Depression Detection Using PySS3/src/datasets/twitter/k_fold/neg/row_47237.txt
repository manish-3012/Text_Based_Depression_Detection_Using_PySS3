Almost attempted tonightSo my fiancee and I have been in a really hard place this year and have been fighting almost without stop lately. I had a really fucked up childhood and young adult life and have been taking it out on everyone and everything since, including him. Lately, after a family death, a family "break up", multiple lost jobs, and financial hardships, he's reached his limits and has been threatening to leave. I have not dealt with any of those well and have taken it out on him unfairly. On top of it, I have been too ashamed and dealing with my emotional shipwrecks to get myself into a better place in life. Tonight in the biggest fight we have ever had, and after I had already spent about a good hour crying hysterically, he said that I have been an abusive asshole and have just been using him for money for years, that I don't listen to anyone else and that I can't get my shit together no matter how much he tries to help me. It broke me. I ran into the bathroom sobbing, feeling like the grossest piece of shit on Earth, locked the door and actually had one of his flat razors in my hands at my veins before I realized I shouldn't do this. I've struggled with my depression, with anxiety, and with cptsd my whole life. He's seen me go through a lot of it but has never been exactly great at helping me deal with it. He has his own problems. Don't we all? I just couldn't handle hearing so much ugly truth about myself when I already have such a low sense of self worth and when I am truly trying to overcome a lifetime of very fucked up stuff. My grandpa took his own life when I was 11 and I swore I would never do that, knowing how bad it hurts those you leave behind. I feel like I slipped tonight. I hope I can get back to more stable ground soon.
