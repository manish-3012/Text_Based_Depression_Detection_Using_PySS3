It's bringing me down. I can't get out of it. i never feel like i'm enough.## I Love A Depressed Person,I'm Also Depressed, But I Can't Let Go.

*How many mood swings? How many times has he lied to me? Why am I not good enough?*

I love this person, and i'm willing to look past their depression and help them through it. I'll spend countless hours talking them through it, but we get to my problems and 5 minutes just turns it into him saying "**sigh"** and i feel like i'm ruining their life. I feel like every time it's me trying so hard to make things better they reject my help. They don't make an effort to make themselves happier, they give up.

I will do anything for them. I'm so patient, I tell them nice things, I give them space, I never blame it on them, I never make them feel worse. I try my best to give new information and tailor to how they prefer things. I change my schedule, stay up later than I should to talk to him. I tell him he's loved, I defend him when others are being rude, I can do just about anything for him.

It's bringing me down that he wont do the same. He can be so sweet, he can be so kind and nice. He loves to make me blush, he talks about our kisses and movie nights. We play video games together, we spend so much time together, nd in those moments everything is okay.

He'll treat me like a queen, but he'll just give up instantly if everything isn't working out. Every small problem makes us fall apart and I have to rebuild it all so he can be happy. I can't let go of him, i love him too much, but what do i do to be a better girlfriend
