i dont know where to go from herei fucking hate my body so damn much. I'm 5 feet and im thin, curvy, and got thin arms and weak shoulders and it fucking sucks. My friends all joke about how i'm the weakest in the group and how im thin and how "cute" i am and how high of a voice i have. theyre not wrong. i know i cant come out, id just end up embarrassing myself and looking like some tucute tiny special snowflake who wants to be special. but my friends arent transphobic, hell theyre trans women. but i refuse to make a fool of myself. my hands are too small, my bodys too thin and small my face is too feminine, etc. i cant go anywhere. and my friends only make me fucking hate how goddamn sensitive and weak and small and girly i am even more. at this point i have no options. i cant come out because id look like a special snowflake but i cant stand being stuck like this forever and being the small cute one. if i just had some fucking balls idve killed myself by now, but im too weak to even do that. ive been working out and lifting weights, but even with that im just too far behind. all my friends joke about depression and i mean they have depression and all that but i swear they have so much more control over it. and that makes me feel worse cause why are they better at managing their feelings? why am i the pussy of the group? am i weaker and just trying to feel special? i dont want to be some fucking sensitive pussy always talking about how goddamn sad i feel all the time. so of course i never talk to them about my feelings. i still talk a lot but like "hi im just so happy and cheery and loud" kinda vibe. i just dont know what to do. hell to be fair i dont even know if im trans. i could literally just be some butch lesbian. im so worried about being fake,lying to myself. i just know that everytime i look in the mirror i just see some weak pathetic sensitive girl and it makes me want to just kill myself in hopes that ill be reborn as literally anything else.
