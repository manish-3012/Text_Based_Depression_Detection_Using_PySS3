I think I'm the exception to the ruleI know the rule is that suicide is never the answer but I think I'm the exception
I'm manic depressive and according to my husband I make everyones life hell, I have young children who are exceptional but being home with them I don't think I'm doing a good enough job for them, we have very little money but I have $100,000 in life insurance. 
My husband does [this](http://i.imgur.com/wiU4f.jpg) to me about a few times a year when he really gets sick of me. I know that seeing this even only a few times a year is so bad for my children but I dropped out of high school and have no skill and/or work history so I wouldn't be able to support them. I've gone to my mom for help an she sides with my husband, my father used to do the same thing to me so we all know it's me. 
I think it would benefit everyone in my life if I just jumped off a bridge, my kids would get a bug chunk of money and their dad wouldn't have to work so much to try to pay the bills and everyone could live a happy uninterrupted life without me.
