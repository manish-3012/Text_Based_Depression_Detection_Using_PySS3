Logically, Shouldn't I Just Kill Myself Now?I've been seriously considering suicide every day for a month. Every day I spend hours here or on suicide hotlines just trying to convince myself not to kill myself. I have little room left for anything else besides sleeping.

What kind of life is this? Why should I bother fighting? Shouldn't I just kill myself now and get it over with?
