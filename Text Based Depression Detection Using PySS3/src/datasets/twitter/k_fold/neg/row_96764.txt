Life shouldn't have to be this way.I recently moved in with a friend of mine after my parents kicked me out for doing poorly in college. It was awesome at first, because I was finally able to feel independent and in-control for the first time.

After the first week though, things started to go downhill. My roommate invites over his obnoxious friends every night. When I tell them to leave or to be quiet while I sleep, they call me an unreasonable asshole. Now I'm *THAT* roommate. The killjoy. The party pooper. The wet blanket.

The more I try to get them to stop, the more they insist that *I'm* the crazy one. I end up losing hours of sleep, and then I have to get up early for work in the morning. 

Now that I'm a full-time employee at the hardware store, I have no flexibility with my schedule. Sure, I get a more decent paycheck. But it's nothing compared to the paycheck I could be getting if I had just forced myself through school and got a degree. 

Now I have to live with people I don't like, work with people I don't like, and try to squeeze out any slight trickle of enjoyment from the rare moments that I get any time to myself. 

It's like I've hit a dead-end. It's going to be this way for at least a year. The lease doesn't expire until then, and I have to stay full-time if I want to pay the rent, which is fairly expensive.

I try to drown everything out by listening to music on my headphones at night, but it's just not enough anymore. No matter how many times I temporarily escape for a few hours, I will always wake up to many more hours of agonizing stress the next day. Kill me now. I can't stand to go another day like this. I don't feel happy anymore, and I'm forgetting what that even feels like.
