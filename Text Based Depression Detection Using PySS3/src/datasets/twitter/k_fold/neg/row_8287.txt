I don't feel part of the human race anymore but I desperately want to be.I really love life, just not my own. I don't want to cause anyone pain in life or death but I am extremely concerned for my own mental health because it feels like a life or death situation. It feels like I'm holding on by a thread, I've got a good grip but I've got nothing else to grab onto if my hand slips.

I started seeing a therapist and psych but I'm pretty scared of them not diagnosing me correctly. I've only gone twice but they want to put me on lithium and from what I've heard it doesn't have very good side effects. I'm so afraid that they wont be able to help me. I wanted to be committed originally because it feels like I have hours of things I need to say for them to understand me, I think about it constantly.

I am scared of burdening anyone with my thoughts, I wanted to ask for advice in other subreddits but I'm afraid it wont belong there. I was even thinking I shouldn't post here. I don't feel like me or my thoughts belong anywhere.
