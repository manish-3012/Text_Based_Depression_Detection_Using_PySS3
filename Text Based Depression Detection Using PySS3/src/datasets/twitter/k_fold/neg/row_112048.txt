The people in this sub who have diedYeah, I get it, people talk about this a lot. But I really wonder how many of those are here who have gone and died. It pains me all the time to read someone write stuff like, â€Iâ€™m going now byeâ€ and then no comments, posts or anything on their account after that. And no, I wonâ€™t doubt them or anything, wonâ€™t call them attention seekers, why? So what if they were posting for attention? If they were fine, they wouldnâ€™t do that, so either way they are just seeking for help, people to understand, comfort, talk and know of their existence.

Sorry for the little rant in the end.
