i hate myselfI think im so ugly but idk why people tell me im cute and good looking i just really dont get it anyway when i look in the mirror i do find myself good looking but i just think that girls find me ugly and i never had a girlfrienr or touched a girl i had a bad past (i suffered from severe anxiety and depression for mt entire life) i feel like no matter how many people tell me im good looking this feeling still wont go away and i dont approach girls because of this i am still a virgin and i wanna stay like that for the rest of my life.
