what a jokei recently told my mom that i am tired of living, i donâ€™t see a point in life and she basically told me itâ€™s because i need to eat more vitamins , like what the fuck, i honestly started laughing, youâ€™re telling me that i want to die because my body is lacking vitamins???????? she tells me go out, talk to your friends, write down your dreams but i keep telling her that i donâ€™t see the fucking point and she repeats all that shit again and again, she tells me find reasons to be happy, well i donâ€™t see a fucking point in all that, i just donâ€™t give A SHIT!!!! and she really isnâ€™t a bad mom, but her approach to this shit is fucking nerve wracking and annoying, idk i just wanted to vent...
