I don't like to make excuses...But I have no reason for living anymore. Literally.

I have my degree. I have a good job. But why do I feel so useless? I always thought I should be happy by now.

I drink a lot now. More than I should. I have a shotgun in my bedroom and I can't help but think how easy it would be to just leave all this stupid shit. I don't care what I do with my life anymore. 

I know this thought process should be wrong, but so far I see no fault in it. Anyone care to enlighten me?
