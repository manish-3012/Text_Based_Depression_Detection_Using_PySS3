How do I tell my mumIâ€™m having trouble trying to tell my mum that itâ€™s too much and I canâ€™t take it anymore. Itâ€™s not I want to die or anything I like living but dealing with all these problems like family issues and friend and school issues itâ€™s to much and I canâ€™t take anymore I just want to sleep and never wake up or hope I just wake up in a nicer world..I never had the guts to tell her I tried to attempt with pills but I couldnâ€™t pull through after 4/5. I just want to come clean and get help but Iâ€™m scared she might react negatively
