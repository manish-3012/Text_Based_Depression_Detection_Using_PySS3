Feeling casually suicidal again and nothing is helpingThis started happening again Wednesday afternoon, I don't particularly feel like trying to kill myself but just wanna dissappear like wanna be asleep or unconscious all day, there's literally nothing I wanna do or anyone there, I used to write a lot when I felt like shit but not even that is working anymore there's no one to write to and reddit is stupid, someone just end me please it's okay it'll be like 4 days before anyone even finds out or checks on me
