I just wanted to be loved.Love is all I ever wanted. Its all I ever need it. I had a really shitty childhood because, of course I did. But none of the trauma, none of the abuse, nothing ever hurts as much as the fact that I'll never ever be loved. For weeks now, whenever I think about girls... they're so aesthetically pleasing, kind. Some are like warm hugs and rays of sunshine. Some are witty and sarcastic and can make me look stupid any time they want. Some are shy and sweet. Some are bold and strong. But they're all beautiful. 

I been thinking about that shit with a loaded gun to my head for a long time. I keep pulling the trigger, but I've not had the courage to cock the hammer and then do it. Im scared of death but its my only way out.

It's my only fucking way out of this miserably shitty existence. I can't live a life where I will never be loved. Where I'm never meant to be loved. I can't fucking do it. I can't live like this. It hurts too much. I'm in too much pain. Even my therapist has given up on me.

I just want to show a girl I love her. I just want to feel wanted. I just wanted to love and be loved. Was asking for that really such a sin, that I had to endure nothing but pain for no good reason?
