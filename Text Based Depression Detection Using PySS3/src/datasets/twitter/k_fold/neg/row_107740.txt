Grandfather from my mother's side of the family had a heart attack. Currently the doctors are making an effort to revive him. My mother is devastated. How do I help her?I hope the title is enough in-depth. I want to help my mother cope without doing the usual stuff like in rule 1 which is ineffective. Thank you for reading and in advance for the help.
