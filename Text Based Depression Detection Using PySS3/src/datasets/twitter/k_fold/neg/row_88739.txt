finding peace on the face of deathMy birthday is coming up and i am not looking forward to it. It will simply remind me of the things and the future i lost. There's nothing to celebrate anymore. I wake up every morning without wanting to. I'm thinking that my birthday would be the best day to leave everything behind. I already made peace with the thought that my family and the people who care for me would be saddened by what i am about to do. I tried to go to therapy. During the session, i thought i was getting better  but as soon as i'm alone, the memory of what happened and how it happened leaves a pain worse than a bullet piercing through my skin.

I tried to overdose myself with sleeping pills about 2 months ago only to be frustrated when i opened my eyes 2 days after. I wish i died that day. The bottomless pit of suffering only gets deeper and deeper every single moment.

People kept on telling me that everything will pass but everyday seems to get even worse. I have already reconciled with consequences of my life and the end of it. I think it's about time that the persons around me consider my own peace. I can never be the same. I just need to tie up a few loose ends then i'll gladly embrace the end of my existence. Whatever people tell me, there is nothing for me here anymore. I planned my future with only person i truly love only to watch her walk away from my life like i never existedâ€¦  Reality is, life is not worth living anymore.. I am already deep into the abyss of my depression and i can't see any way out..
