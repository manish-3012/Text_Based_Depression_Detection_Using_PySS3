Its pretty painless, I think i'm going to do it one day soon.I've been trialling simple suspension with a belt. Its so easy to do. If you have it positioned right it only pushes on the arteries not the trachea. 5-10s max and you'll peacefully black out. I have it so when my full weight is on it it stops so I usually wake up 10-20 seconds later on the floor. Fuck no one takes me seriously they just want me to pay for some shitty psychiatrist when the last two school councillors haven't done shit they just don't care they just want their paycheck what a fucking joke. And people think I'm insane. Existence is a NIGHTMARE it is hell one of these days I'm just gonna check out. Its interests me thinking about how people I know will react. I will prove them all wrong. And those that 'love' me will forget within a year. What a cruel joke. Fuck.
