My demons &amp; voices came to visitI was feeling lonely during this confinement so I guess my demons decided to knock. Now I'm being kept awake laying in my bed with all these uncontrollable terrifying thoughts. I feel so lonely yet these screams make me think other wise. I just really want some comfort-- i cant sleep and im just not good. I don't wanna do this.. Im so sorry yall. I just can't handle it at all
