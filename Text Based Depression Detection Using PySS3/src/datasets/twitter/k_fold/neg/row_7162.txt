The end of a very long roadI've had suicidal thoughts for literally years now, but never had the courage to actually act on them. I've gotten to a point in my life where I've realized I'm no longer even believing I can possibly have a future. Every new swing into depression is a step down the asymptote towards killing myself (fuck, that's a heavy thing to write). Honestly, the minimal traffic is what attracted me to posting here. I don't think there's any way fucking Reddit could stop me from doing this, but I personally need the catharsis. I don't get joy out of my days anymore, I don't even like to listen to music because it reminds me of how far from enjoying it I've come. I can smoke weed and forget, induce myself into chemical numbness for a few hours, but really, it's just getting closer and fucking closer. Every new day is just a higher probability that I won't see the next. Fuck, this was a stupid place to put this. I don't expect to be around much longer but it was good to get this off my chest.
