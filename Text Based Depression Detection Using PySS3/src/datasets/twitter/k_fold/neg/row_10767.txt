I hate that I'm here right nowI hate that I'm in this subreddit right now. I hate that I feel this way. I hate that I feel so alone and hopeless that I have to talk to the Internet instead of a person.

I'm sick. Really sick. I don't remember what it's like to feel okay. I don't remember what it's like to not be in pain. And I want out. When I feel like there are people in my life who love me wanting to wake up the next morning is a lot easier. But everyone gives up on me. I feel like this stupid illness is so big and awful that I can't fight it alone. But everyone gives up. No one wants to fight with me. So many people have made it clear with their actions that I'm not worth fighting for. If I'm not worth fighting for the why the hell am I still fighting? Right now I don't remember why I'm still trying.

I am not sure if I want to be reminded why to live or if I want someone to tell me it's okay and that I can let go.
