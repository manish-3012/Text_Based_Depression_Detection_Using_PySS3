Would it be selfish?So a little over a year ago I had a bunch of health issues start...

Prior to that I was awkward, never quite fit in, had a substance habit, but at the same time found a great group of friends and finally got around to dating an amazing girl.

But now I feel that person has already died. Due to my health issues I am constantly in pain, cant exercise (bad for slow metabolism people like me), brain fog, cant drink/smoke/take any over the counter meds/vitamins... 

Constant electric buzzing, weird visual glitches, partial simple seizures, exhaustion, sexual pain. Many times I have had partial seizures just from the euphoria/stimulation of feeling happy for a change. 

I struggled to be happy before all of this but what that equated to was BIG ups when I finally found happiness. I can't really sing and play guitar anymore without my throat swelling. Cant work out. Had enough trouble dating before this and now I feel like it won't happen for me again. My attempts to date since have just made me feel like I am wasting her time. If she is great enough for me to fall for, she is great enough to deserve someone healthy. 

Every close friend I have reached out to with full honestly either brushed it off or started ignoring me. The only girl Ive fallen in love with said I was lying and that she doesn't care... and I dont blame her for not wanting to give me support when we are not dating but it makes the separation from who I was and what I am now that much more distinct. I do truly hope she is happy, though.

Since then with new people I just lie and pretend everything is okay... I have made a lot of friends that tell me I am hilarious but it feels like a lie and it's exhausting. It's empty. For me, life was always about the future and now I have trouble imagining one. I feel like I am in a ditch and can't climb out. 

I don't believe my condition can be cured and worst case it can progress into blindness and deafness and not being able to breath on my own. Looking over the past year I think it may have gotten worse. 

I have never made a plan to kill myself, but when I think about how I feel now, and the fact that this could get even worse. At what level of suffering is it logical to just opt out early? Do you think people would understand if I did? 

Again I am not going to kill myself so please dont call a hotline on my behalf or something
