Anyone else have no other option?Iâ€™ve seen eight different therapists, been hospitalized four times, done two outpatient programs, tried a couple different medications, participated in a few anxiety â€œexposureâ€ groups, and I still havenâ€™t made any notable progress. Iâ€™m still depressed, suicidal, and hopeless. I still donâ€™t have any friends. I still have just as much social anxiety as I did when I was diagnosed at 12. 

I have no one to reach out to anymore. Life is just getting harder and harder and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
