Everything in my life has been ruinedIâ€™m just gonna get straight to the point. Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed for a while and now itâ€™s the worst itâ€™s ever been. When I try to tell my parents they belittle my problems. I recently moved away from my girlfriend and now Iâ€™m convinced she is cheating on me. I donâ€™t have any friends because they all turned out to be assholes and abandoned me when I turned for the worst, Iâ€™m really behind in school and my future doesnâ€™t look good. There is no meaning to anything in life. Iâ€™m broke and now Iâ€™m searching for a job and I still donâ€™t have my license when everyone else does. Most nights I cry myself to sleep and Iâ€™ve just been living in constant pain for the past few months and Iâ€™m done. Also I have extreme social anxiety so I canâ€™t make friends or get a job. At least I wonâ€™t have to deal with it tomorrow.
