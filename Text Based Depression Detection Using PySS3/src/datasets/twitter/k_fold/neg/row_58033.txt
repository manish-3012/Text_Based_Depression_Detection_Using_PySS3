Too tired to go on.So here it is...
I've been going through relapses, some larger than others, for the past 4 months, after going through a prior 5 months of feeling like absolute shit. I'm only in college, so let alone the real world, and I'm already feeling too broken to continue.

I don't know how to go on anymore and I just feel empty.
