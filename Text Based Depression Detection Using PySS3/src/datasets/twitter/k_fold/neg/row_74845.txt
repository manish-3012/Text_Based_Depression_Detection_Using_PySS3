Dear r/suicidewatch,This last year has been the toughest year of my life so far. I feel like has gone right for me in the past 365 days. Between treatment for  alcoholism and losing loved ones and my significant other, I feel like my life is just meant to be full of pain like this. I've thought about ending my life more times than I can count. I suffer from chronic depression and the medicine they give me just doesn't seem to help at all. I often ask myself what my purpose in life is, and I can't think of a single thing I could do well in my life without just ending it. I feel as though my life isn't of value to anyone anymore, I've alienated so many friends, family members, and other loved ones. I know my story may not be as poetic as others on here, but right now I just can't bear anymore of this pain.
