"get help" is a fucking joke.I've been in and out of inpatient care for about ten years of my life. It's been a long time since I've been out now (I'm 25 now, first went in when I was 12) and I'm finally seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist again.

I have vivid hallucinations and PTSD. I'm scared of myself and my flawed perceptions. I've been seeing these new doctors for four months now and it's just.....bad. My new medication makes me even more suicidal than before. It's no longer 'passive ideation'. It's plotting and planning and hoarding my meds. It's eyeing scalpels on Amazon even though, hilariously, a portion of my purchase would benefit a suicide prevention institute in my hometown. I can text my psychiatrist when I have an 'issue', and when I told her I've been more suicidal since taking these meds, she told me that maybe she's not the right fit to talk about that, and redirected me to my therapist. He still hasn't answered. It's been a week.

I feel this constant drive down, down towards death. I died once, for thirty-seven seconds, when I was in my late teens. Car accident. I was on my way to Disneyland with my friends and a drunk man drove us off the road. I was the only survivor. 

I'm sick of just surviving. I want to live. But maybe it's just not 'the right fit' for me. How do I submit my two weeks notice?
