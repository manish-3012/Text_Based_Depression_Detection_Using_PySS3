It keeps getting worse.Ive never been the happiest of people but these past few years have really drained all little hope I  had left.  I don't feel safe or comfortable being where I am or really near anyone around these parts. I can't remember the last time I smiled and was feeling good inside. It's been too long. I cutt out of frustration and the fact I did that frustrates me because I do no want to hear anything about it from anyone. I just want out. I'm tired of being a failure. I'm tired of looking forward to nothing I just want it to end.
