I'm a spoiled little brat who thinks the smallest inconvenience means it's all overEveryone on here, in the mental hospital I got checked into, on other depression forums make me realize that *holy shit* I have it easy. My parents are funding my freshman year as a computer science major at a respected university that was my *fall back* school and I'll skate by in thanks to my 37 AP credits and above average intelligence. I'll have no problems here thanks to my tall, able body with a strong immune system and no chronic diseases. My loving family's only demand is that I stay in touch with them so they can tell me how much they love me. I'm making friends really easily here. Only a month in and I've got several circles where people seem to really like me. I see people copying my jokes, laughing at anything I say, and enjoying talking to me. My biggest problem right now is how tiny my iPhone 5's screen is to type this out since I don't feel like grabbing my expensive MacBook Pro my parents bought me. Damn. I have a really good, solid life.

So why does it all hurt. Why do I feel so much sadness. How come I got bullied today on the internet and my reaction was "I should kill myself I'm so worthless". I flipped a mental coin whether I should jump from the stadium roof or make this cry for help. Why am I crying silently right now. Why isn't the medication working. Why can't I be happy.

I just want to be happy. Why am I not happy.
