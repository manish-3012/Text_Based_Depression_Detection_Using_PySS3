I've ended a relationship with all my friends because they were trying to make a kid commit suicide, now I'm alone and my family believes I should forgive them.I've had the same group of friends for a couple of years and we were inseparable, I'm not used to having a lot of friends so this was the first time that I've felt surrounded by people who actually liked me. The thing is that one of the kids in our group was suffering with suicidal thoughts a lot lately, he was kinda new to the group so I didn't know much about him. A couple of weeks after school ended I started seeing depressing posts on his social media and decided to go ask him about it, he told me that my friends were inciting him to self harm and commit suicide. I (what I think was the obvious response) decided to cut my relationship with the rest of the group and support him. Now, these guys call me a "traitor" and talk bad at my back even if they know that what they've done is horrible. The problem is that after talking about this with my family and only friends they seem to not really care about it and insist in me forgiving them. This is really messing with my head, I thought that I've made the correct decision but now I'm completely alone and no one seems to see this with my point of view.

Please I need help with this, I know that I would never forgive these actions but everyone is telling me otherwise, am I an asshole or did I do the correct thing?
