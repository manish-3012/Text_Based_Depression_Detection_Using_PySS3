Is hope real?I donâ€™t really want to die. I have suicidal thoughts a lot, and things just keep adding up. So much stress in my life, and I just canâ€™t sleep right now. I have a wonderful wife and baby girl who I love DEARLY. I just feel so sad all the time and hopeless. My anxiety/intrusive thoughts and such, relentless worry and anxiety and shame and guilt and ANGER ruin so much of my every day life. I keep thinking Iâ€™m making progress only to realize ... Iâ€™m not any different. Every second of my day is overshadowed by feeling worried and sad constantly. I make people laugh and my family loves me, but I just feel exhausted and worthless. I have a hard time keeping a job, and I feel like a joke of a human being because Iâ€™m always bouncing around. I keep thinking I will find a â€œcureâ€ to feel better or kick the depression/anxiety but I donâ€™t think there is one anymore. Is this how itâ€™s gonna be forever? I am going to fight for life because I love them. I just wish there was a way for us to all feel better. Itâ€™s been 10 years or more since I really noticed the extreme mental health issues and I know they are not going anywhere. I just wish I could learn to be happy despite them. 

Not sure if anyone can help me, just need to vent.
