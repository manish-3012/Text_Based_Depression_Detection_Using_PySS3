How do you make friends as an "adult"?? 21mI've been very lonely due to not having many friends. I don't think I can go through life alone without anyone to really enjoy life with. I meet up with a few close friends but only every 2/3 months and other than that i have no social events.

 People at work already think I'm quiet/weird and when I tried to be more outgoing recently they just talk amongst each other. It sucks when youre in a group of 3 people and two are talking amongst themselves not even acknowledging you. 

I've struggled with social awkwardness for my entire life and I honestly don't know what to do. Live like a hermit? I'm working earning a load of money for my age, getting strong and good looking in the gym but for what?  I dont even know how to start making friends. Ive never really known how, it just happened at school. I only have one friend at work but i only have lunch with him every 1/2 weeks. Otherwise ill sit and read on my phone downstairs.

 People of my age are having fun with their friends, drinking, having sex and I'm missing out. I feel like I'm wasting my life and thinking what have i even achieved? I think everyone needs some companionship to enjoy life and popular people have a better time, get more benefits and everything. 

To be honest ive been really down and seriously considering suicide. Im not posting this for attention but for help and i guess at least some reassurance. I don't think guys get much sympathy(two of my friends told me they were depressed) but does anyone want to talk?

To put it bluntly, i want to die because im lonely
