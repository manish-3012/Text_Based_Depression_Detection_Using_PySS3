Going to kill myself tonightNot even sure why I'm posting this. I guess it's cause I have no one to tell in real life. I've been procrastinating it for weeks now because something kept putting it off. I'm so confused. I'm not even totally sure why I'm doing it. But I'm going to at least try to do some damage. There's an urge inside of me that is making me want to do this. I've got a whole bunch of pills ready.

Goodbye
