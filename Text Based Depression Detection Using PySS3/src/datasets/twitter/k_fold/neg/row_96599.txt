Is there anyway to get rid of the contention period on life insurance?I have 100% completely given up, don't even wanna argue about it tbh, but I have student loans that need to be paid back. My family has already done so much to help me get through college, I can't give them that financial burden, I just won't do that to them. Is there any other way I can make sure they get paid if I die?
