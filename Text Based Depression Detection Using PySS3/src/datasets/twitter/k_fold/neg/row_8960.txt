It's been a real tripI just took all of my pills and mashed it down with three Budweisers, working on four right now. I have a pain in my heart that won't go away, and I want to kill it with poison that's supposed to help my little flaws. I just wanted to say I love you all. I have no one else to say it to, so I'll tell you again: I love all of you. You're all beautiful, and the world needs you. Keep fighting for all of us. See you all at Okie Dogs.
