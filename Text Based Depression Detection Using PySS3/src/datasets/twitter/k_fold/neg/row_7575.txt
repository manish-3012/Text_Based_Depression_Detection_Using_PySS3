My own family hates me and I've been thinking about suicideSo, this actually goes back to when my mom initially got pregnant with me, my dad said something along the lines of "Great, we need another kid like we need another hole in our heads" according to my mom, everyone was disappointed when I turned out to be a girl, fast forward to now, everyone is distant toward me except for my step mom, they're constantly arguing with me, and I'm thinking about just making it all stop, I feel like I'm not wanted in my own home and I just want any amount of approval but no matter what I do I never get it and I don't know what to do
