I cant escape suicideI'm sitting in a train scrolling and kinda feeling like shit and when I look out the window at the forest the first thought I have is a little song "1 2 3 on which tree should i hang my bo-dy"

It's been 2 months since my suicide plan and attempt why cant I just live peacefully without these thoughts
