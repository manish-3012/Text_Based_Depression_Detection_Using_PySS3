Having some very bizarre and puzzling health issues. No one will help me and Iâ€™ve given up trying...No one will help me and they all say itâ€™s â€œstressâ€ despite inadequate testing. Their is also no mental health help available near me and I love my boyfriend so much that I donâ€™t want him to watch me suffer if it is something serious. 

But no one will help me anyways despite trying and taking trips across provinces to go to my family doctor who says itâ€™s just â€œstressâ€. Like fuck you itâ€™s not stress. I know itâ€™s something serious and I donâ€™t wanna wait for it to get worse. Iâ€™ve also been a really shitty partner to my loving bf. Although he is young and naive and doesnâ€™t know what he could be potentially getting in to. I was finally happy then I started getting worse and it doesnâ€™t seem like itâ€™s getting better Iâ€™m cursed..,

I donâ€™t know how much longer I can last , itâ€™s something neurological I get numb and tingly and my neck is stiff and I get ice pick head aches my arms and legs have random pains Iâ€™m weak and shakey and my legs feel like sand bags. I have twinges and spasms  my fingers and they go numb and Iâ€™m TERRIFIED itâ€™s not stress Iâ€™m 21 and Iâ€™m scared. I havenâ€™t had the energy or motivation to get out of bed in weals and NO ONE will help me...and if it is something serious then what? I was a foster kid I have no money for treatment and Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m so scAred life was great and now itâ€™s not again I was happy for ONCE and itâ€™s being taken away probably because i wasnâ€™t great full when I was healthy. 

I canâ€™t do this it feels like my sanity is slipping away from me..
