I don't know what to do anymore. I hate so many things. I'm such a terrible person. I don't want my boyfriend to talk to girls even though it's not up to me. We constantly fight. I fucked up the best thing that has ever happened to me. My family life sucks. I don't have any friends. I just want to die. I suck. I am too afraid to kill myself, though. I don't know what to do, Reddit. =/ I'm sorry for such a shitty post. I'm not thinking very clearly right now. Help me. Please.
