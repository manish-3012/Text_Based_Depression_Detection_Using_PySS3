im sorryMaybe my first post here. and first time posting on reddit. never spected to post here.

but here i am, i think.

Maybe i am not in a bad sittuation, compared to other people here... but i have to discharge myself

Im 29, about to turn 30 on a month...and i dont want to.

why bother? the things i loved to do, now i hate them. i studied a career, focused my entire life on something that i cant do even if i wanted. i had dreams, silly dreams; but achieve them now i see as the worst idea ever.  Im pretty useless, there is nothing i can do right; even the most simple task. there is no future for me.

Every person in my life tend at the end treat me as an annoyance, like a dead weight. It happened with my friends, my coworkers, my girlfriend...now ex.  
I know im not normal; im boring, annoying, repetitive, unable to express ideas correctly - i am a problem; and im scared to turn away more people, the few that still have.

i cant cry. i need to, but cant. my eyes and my chest hurts a lot... but i cant.

  
About my family...we dont really talk...and havent seen them about a year now - we had a big fight.   
Getting cyanide, a stab, hangging...day to day thoughts i get, and they come to my mind more frecuently.

the silly part? it doesnt matter if it hurts, but i dont want to give much work to the person who will clean after they find my body...  
And a funny one? im so useless, that even if i try to, i fail misserably. i have tried 4 times? and even that i cant do right  


i feel like an idiot.

i just wanna die.

im sorry
