There really isn't a point to my lifeI'm going to try to be short as possible.

My N-Dad started a fight with me over something trivial, I was in denial about him being a narc for the past decade. (I kept brushing this off because he wasn't as 'crazy' as any of the other stories I have heard) I am **Tired** of him acting like he has it worst and his "woah is me" bullshit whenever something doesn't work out for him or if he's not getting an ass pat for everything and then for him to pick a fight over a "perceived reaction" (I "flinched" at him when he was talking to me and wanted to shake me down over why I act that way) I'm so tried of this. I'm tired of all of it and I feel like he hates me. I'm fully convinced of this because every time I go into a depression episode (both before and after I was diagnosed with clinical depression) he would tell me how it is all in my head and I need to just "get over it" and I have to listen to the same sob story I mentioned earlier. I don't mean to be so callous at him... but for him to give me this 'I have it worst then you' speech is irritating.  I'm not going to say I have it worst because that would be stooping to his level. We both live in a first world country so the problems of a 54 yo straight man with rotted teeth and digestive issues (probably made worst by the bad teeth) aren't any worst then a 26 yo gay trans man with no support from anyone and has clinical depression. 

--That fight that happen on Saturday got worst because it escalated. I don't remember what he said exactly, but i heard him say something along the lines of "oh and that's my fault now?" in that same aggravated tone that he does when he's about to turn something around on to someone. I lost my temper and called him out. And along the way, he called me a bunch of things (a cunt, a loser, ect.) and he strangled me. At one point he wanted to call the cops on me to throw me out. I threw back in his face that he's not working and before I could elaborate how throwing me out would be a bad idea, he headbutts me. "ok fine, call the cops *points to where he headbutted me* you just assaulted me!" "OH YOU SEE THIS SHIT, THEY ARE TREATING ME NOW!!!" he says to my mom who watched me get headbutted only to reply that she saw me get headbutted and that he's in the wrong.

I'm now at my Cousin's house, he's in China on a business trip, I'm watching his cat who hates my guts. (This cat always hisses at me, even when I'm not giving them attention I have done nothing to it except enter the house.) I also have been staying here because i don't want to deal with my dad, but this fucking cat hissing and yowling at me as I go by is just feeding my depression. "Everyone hates you, including this dumb animal. They know your a piece of shit."

--A few months before all this, I cut off all my friends (except for one) because of various reasons. From the fact I viewed them as 'more successful then me' to having a crush one one of them but they didn't feel the same way back. I would normally have an easier time brushing it off, but a month after they rejected me they came out as poly and my brain shifted the rejection from "they are just a friend" to "your broken and not good enough for them, that's the real reason." I ended up cutting down my hours to one day a week because i was going to start transitioning and I work with my mom. When I was about to say something to my boss, my mom went to my dad saying she was afraid to lose her job over me. Cue my dad going off on me and saying "YOU KEEP SAYING YOU WANT TO DIE! JUST KILL YOURSELF ALREADY!" after that I went to go get his gun and before I grabbed it he strangled me. (and that was the first time he did that to me, up until then he only would verbally and emotionally abuse me when i was depressed or 'wasn't grateful' to him.) 

I'm so fucking tied of this... I cant have friends because if they have an s/o they gush about or reblog/retweet/repost any ships or romantic bullshit I get repulsed and bitter. As far as romance goes I feel its all bullshit. I don't want to fall in love over someone because it has happened enough times that I let someone have this power over me an they just throw my feelings in the trash or in some cases take advantage of me. Anyone who does show interest in me always sees me as a woman and I immediately shut them out of my life. My parents say they want to help me, but the second I bring up I'm trans they get frustrated immediately when the subject comes up and tell me "I cant help you!" Leaving me here to just deal with everything. And I have been struggling because I don't drive because of really bad anxiety and the closest center is an hour and a half away from me. And uber is expensive for me now since I only work so little. I have a letter to get on Testosterone, but this letter said i wanted to start in August. Its October and everything just keeps getting in my way. I don't even know if is any good any more. 

----I feel like at this point I should just kill myself because im just going to be alone forever. And if its not that, its going to be some crazy when wants me to die. I don't care if someone wants to murder me now. Because my life only purpose in life was to be a punching bag. I'm out of the school system now and now its my dad who is tormenting me now and not the bullies... I have out lived my purpose... I have no support, I have no friends. The only friend I have is in an equally bad situation and the last message I got from them they said they where suicidal too. They don't need my shit on top of there shit. And they have more of a reason to live then me. They will eventually move to Canada and then I will REALLY be alone. So it doesn't matter if I dont kill myself by the end of the year, it will eventually happen...
