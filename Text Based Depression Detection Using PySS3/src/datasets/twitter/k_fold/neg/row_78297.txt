I'm useless.The last 3 year's have been the best year's of my  life. It was so good that I stopped thinking about suicide everyday. Instead I started to get better. I stopped being super insecure and started to get comfortable in my own skin again. But even after those 3 years. I can't apply myself to anything. I held jobs and stuff but when it comes to studying. I just stop being proactive. Nothing in life brings me joy. I don't really care about anything. I go between bouts of caring and then bouts of nothingness. Today is the first time in three years where I started to plan my own death again. At the moment I've started to disassociate from my feelings again. My face straight and feeling nothing but tears keep falling from my face. There's something wrong with me and I don't know how to fix it.
