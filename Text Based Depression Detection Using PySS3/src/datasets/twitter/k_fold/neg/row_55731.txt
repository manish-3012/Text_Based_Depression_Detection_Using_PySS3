I feel emptyI don't know what to do anymore.
Transitioning feels good, my family doesn't react well to it, tho. My dad tries to get me to apologise for his abuse. I feel lonely and broken, scared of what the future holds, just waiting for another punch in the face.
My therapist doesn't take me seriously, says he doesn't see me being depressed while I'm telling him how I'm constantly isolating myself and how broken I feel.
I've been hallucinating and having several panic attacks. It feels like the world is going to end.
My existence hurts.
I can't go on like this.
