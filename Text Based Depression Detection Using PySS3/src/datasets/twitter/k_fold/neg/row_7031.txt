What could happen if I stopped trying at school?Keeping up good grades in homework seems like a hassle, at least for now, but I absolutely hate doing long pieces of homework, studying for tests, and further yet exams, and thinking about what universities I want to apply to. Since I'd like to end my life before school ends, I don't really care about the impact my results will have far in the future. But in the near future I am worried that people might suspect I'm doing it on purpose, or that I'm going to be forced to take extra lessons and thus have to suffer through more work.  


I understand this is nothing compared to the things many people here have to deal with on a daily basis, but for me this is one of the worst things that I have to do in my life so far. And if I'm not capable of dealing with this, I'm sure I'm not capable of dealing with anything worse, so why not end here?
