Do yâ€™allâ€™s ever want to kill yourself over a minor inconvenience and that makes you want to kill yourself even more cause other people have it way worse?Like, Iâ€™m reading posts on this sub where peopleâ€™s siblings/loved ones have killed themselves and they want to follow, that one guy was a pedophile, people are extremely lonely/ugly/poor/abused, and itâ€™s just an overall Shit show.

I dropped like 5 dishes at work today and that was enough to almost make me go over the edge. There are literally slaves that have known nothing but agony their entire lives in this world and Iâ€™m just your average clumsy 18 year old who, in the grand scheme of things, has nothing to be worried about. Fuck.
