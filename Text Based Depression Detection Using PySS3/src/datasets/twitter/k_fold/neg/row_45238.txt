Could anyone help me speak to one of my steam friends?Okay, A guy i know on steam's friend just died recently and he is talking about suicide. I need help on how to speak to him. He tells me about how he thinks hes going to grow up to work a dead-end job and ruin his body with drugs. He told me that he feels like hes "living behind a mask" and that hes always felt like it.
