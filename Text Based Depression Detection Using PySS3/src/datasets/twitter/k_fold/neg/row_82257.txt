I deserve to die.I am a horrible person and I wish that I could just kill myself without my family getting upset. Honestly, if it weren't for my parents and brother I would already have done it. I am such an awful person that I don't deserve to be alive anymore. I'm not intentionally cruel or anything but I feel like I ruin everything and I'm pretty sure that the world would be a better place without me in it. My life is just a series of regrets.

I got to see my friends for the first time in ages on Friday night and even though I was happy to see them I spent much of the night feeling incredibly anxious and guilty about all sorts of things, and I could barely enjoy the night.

I feel so trapped because no matter what I do I will only wind up hurting people. I wish I could just disappear and erase myself from the minds of everyone who cares about me.
