I dont know who i am anymoreHey I'm a person who dosent know who I am anymore ....

When I was young I love being pity so I will always try to make people pity me. I will cry for no reason sometimes there was a reason . But I always had this happy attitude that will always be excited and always make dumb decision thinking  they were smart . I also had a angry side that will be angry alot but I will not really like show that much. I bullied two people I was idiot and as I got I see what I did wrong but that still didn't change me from being a idiot

Then I kept the happy attitude of mine people will think who is that crazy person talking too loud. as I gradually grown older I stick to the happy attitude because it made people worry less and if a problem came up I would be like I don't care and people will not notice what I really felt

Then at 6 grade then it change I became more lazier more angry at the little things  because my teacher will always give us work and I wouldn't do it because she will never checked it at all . I didn't cared about test because I will cheat on them or just guess the answer . My grades got lower but didn't cared because I thought I was better at everyone


At 7 garde I became more lazier more stupider I became so proud of myself . I didn't cared about my mom my studies I just cared about myself always myself ....  Then I started feeling hollow inside but I didn't cared because like who careds..... 
I feel like I should not be here because of the fool I become


So please someone out there be help
Please help to find myself . To stop be lazy . To stop hiding myself. To stop being angry so easily . To stop being angry at my mom for the little things . To stop being a idiot who always thinks of them selves ....

So please someone out there please help me
