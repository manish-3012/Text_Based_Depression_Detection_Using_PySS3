Nobody cares about me until I'm dying.Everyone treats me like shit until I have a suicide attempt, then they act like they're so close to me and stuff, I'm done with this shit. No more "suicidal gestures", no more 911 and hospitals, I'm really dying this time.

I cannot wait for this dumb thing so I can finally be dead, please God let it be soon.
