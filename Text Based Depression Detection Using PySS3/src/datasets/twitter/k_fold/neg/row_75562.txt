Does anyone else feel split?I donâ€™t want to actively kill myself, because I know this feeling will pass it always does, but Iâ€™ve relapsed into self harm and I feel like thereâ€™s 2 parts of me. One rational one not and the non rational is the one in control when I self harm. 

Like I donâ€™t feel safe being alone because what if the bad side of me takes over and I end up doing it. This is how itâ€™s always been when Iâ€™m suicidal does anyone else feel this?
