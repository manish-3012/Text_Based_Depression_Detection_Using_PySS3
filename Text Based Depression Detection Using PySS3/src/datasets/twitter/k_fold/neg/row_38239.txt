EmptinessEvery day is a long drawn out battle in my head.
Everything has been in place.
I will hang from the highest strongest almost fail proof exposed beams in the house.
There is no turning back once I do. 
But damn, I just don't want to fuck up.
I still have a strong fear that something will go wrong and it'll fail like all previous attempts.

I can't connect with anybody around me anymore.
Not even my children.
I can't focus on any of the million tasks I have each day.
I don't want to take care of myself anymore...or keep waking up.
I'm so empty.
