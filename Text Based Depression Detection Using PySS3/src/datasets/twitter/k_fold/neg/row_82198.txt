I want to feel worthy enough to live.And the end of each day I ask myself: *why are you here? You don't belong, you fuck up over and over again.* and when the thought comes i sit and think about all the shitty things I've done. I'm a failure, and I'm tired of feeling anger and sadness every single day. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself and it just makes me angrier. ( *sigh* don't even know if that's a word...)
