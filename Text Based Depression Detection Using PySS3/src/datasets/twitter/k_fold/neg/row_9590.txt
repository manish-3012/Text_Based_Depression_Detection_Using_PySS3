i can't keep goingI was engaged with the love of my life. I'd messed up before, just as she has. That's love; it's moving on as a team. I can't keep going anymore though. She's chosen somebody else over me, and after finding this out there's no way I can see the light of life anymore. The carpet ripped out under my feet and there's only an abyss. It's calling for me and my whole world is gone. I don't see any other way out but leaving on my own accord.
