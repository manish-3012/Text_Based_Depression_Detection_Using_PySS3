I love you all. All the people I have known, all the people I know. From the moment I understood you, I've loved you with whole my heart. For ever hoping that I could feel like I belong, like I am also unconditionally loved. Since the elementary school it has been a dream that kept returning to me. It's the oldest one. Do you know the "Steppenwolf" by Hermann Hesse? Do you remember the part about suicide being a part of a man?

I plan to buy a one-way ticket to Reykjavik. The rest of the cash is going for a taxi driver to drive me as far north as it is possible. I will get off of the road and go as far into the white as I can. Take a jacked of. Hat. Sweater. Go and freeze to death.

I want you to change my mind. I beg you.
