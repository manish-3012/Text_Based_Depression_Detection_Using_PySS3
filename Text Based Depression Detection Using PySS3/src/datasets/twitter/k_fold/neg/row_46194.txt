Why do I feel this pain in my heart!Why does it hurt so much! Why, it makes it so I canâ€™t sleep and itâ€™s getting so late and I have school tomorrow. Itâ€™s all just too much I feel like Iâ€™m freaking out. I just wish the pain could be over, someone just stick a knife there so that I just die and donâ€™t have to deal with any of this.
