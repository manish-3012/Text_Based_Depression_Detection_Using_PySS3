Closer every dayI'm (18M) always on edge now. I have bipolar ( diagnosed since 15 ) and so does my mom ; though she's been mostly manic for these last couple of years. honestly its hard for my mom and i to talk since i look so much like my dad , she kinda just forgets ( 99% of the time ) that i'm not him. i used to see a psychiatrist or therapist ( what ever you call them i always get them confused ) but now shes says that if i'm going to do it , "hurry up and do it and stop wasting my time and money " every time i ask for the therapist number to make an appointment. so now i have a glock hiding in my AC vent trying to figure if i should do it before i'm a counselor for the summer or after it finishes ( cuz i doubt any of the kids will remember me if i go missing ) 

i made a new account because my friends know my reddit name and i dont want them to stay behind for college cuz of this
