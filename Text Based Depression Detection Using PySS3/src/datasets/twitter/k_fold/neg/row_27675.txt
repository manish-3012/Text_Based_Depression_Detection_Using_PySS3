27 and hopelessI just don't see why I keep trying. I keep coming back to the same conclusion. I'll never be happy enough to want to live. My life consists of work, meaningless one night stands, and a lot of weed and I'm just kinda done. I've posted here before, and some of you guys are really supportive. And I greatly appreciate it. But I just think I might be done with it all. I hope everyday that I just don't wake up. But my luck isn't that good. Idk...I just don't wish to exist any longer. Deaths gotta be easy compared to this
