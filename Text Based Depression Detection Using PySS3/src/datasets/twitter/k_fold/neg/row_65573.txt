Things might be looking upI am alive after a few days from my suicide attempt and things might be looking up for me for once. I got good news for the first time in ages that I will get the apartment that I have hoped to get for a while. I have tried talking stuff out with my mother and tried to open up her mind with being accepting of everyone despite sexuality and identity. But even when all is going upwards, I can still not trust myself enough to be alone. now that I might feel ok for once in ages, I might fall back. I am scared of what is to come in life. I will be moving in two weeks and I am scared of the amount of stress that will come with moving for the first time. what if I feel more alone than I already do? What if I decide that now that no one can stop me, I won't do something bad that will be irreversible?
