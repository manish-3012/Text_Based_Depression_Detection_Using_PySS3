I dont know what to say.I am diagnosed with chronic ptsd, I see a specialist weekly. My partner is supportive and trying her best. 

I get too attached to people socially. I find a friend who is warm, can talk about light and dark, i make her laugh and she makes me laugh. I get more into makeup, i get more into whatever stuff they are into. I talk to them daily. 

 Then, its always the same. I either fuck up and become too needy and they vanish. I then spiral. I think about suicide constantly. I end up wanting to die so badly. Ive been taking 5 showers a day to just feel some warmth inside but I can only think of breaking up with my partner so she isnt as affected when I die. 

Its no ones fault but my own. I'm the one in the wrong. I just need to keep living till my appointments... the problem is if I am too honest im afraid ill get put in a mental health hospital... but id rather die than be put in a cage again.
