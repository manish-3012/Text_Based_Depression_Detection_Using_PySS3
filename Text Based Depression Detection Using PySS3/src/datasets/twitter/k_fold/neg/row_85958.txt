What's the fucking point anymoreIt doesn't make sense. Why are we here. I find my self going back to this same thought over and over again in my head. As a religious believer, I think it's whether or not so go to heaven, but it's hard. Even as a 13 year old, I find my self thinking I have the same maturity of a 23 year old. Other people don't get it, neither will they even talk to me. I feel as if my friends are only there for pity, and I fucking hate my life. Even the school system. I see books like The Giver making it seem like the community is awful, but then I look at our own society and it isn't much of a change. I look at all of the students in my school and it's hard not to look at them, and even myself as robots. We are brought here to learn, past tests, and rinse and repeat. We all are here to just learn and make money and die. I want to kill myself so badly, but I know I'm bot strong enough to do it. Maybe that will change one day, and when I think about it, I wonder if people will even care. Will they care that the 13 year old antisocial gamer and lack of better terms "memer" killed himself. I think they will have a better life without me in it, cause who cares about me right? Sorry for ranting, but I just needed to get this out.
