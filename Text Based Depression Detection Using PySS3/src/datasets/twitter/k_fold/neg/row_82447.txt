Desperate for escapeI need out of this world, I can't take this pain or anxiety anymore. My life has been one big humiliation and I'm sick to my stomach from it all. I'm still figuring out a reliable suicide method and my next opportunity to attempt is a couple months away. I feel trapped here and it's making me panic every day.

I thought life couldn't get worse but then my anxiety started to skyrocket and I couldn't believe it. Where's my break? I've only ever degraded since I was a child, straight downhill. No more.

I hope that my suicide attempt is successful. I don't want to wake up in general or inside a hospital. My social anxiety would destroy me, I need to die. I can't handle any more, I'm broken. Please no brain damage, just death.
