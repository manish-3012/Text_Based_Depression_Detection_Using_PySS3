i try to stay positivei try to establish a routine, do things that make me happy. i go for walks, i eat well, i exercise, iâ€™m baking. just in general doing things that bring me joy and happiness.  i try to find joy in the small things, like my cat or my plants or the nice weather. 

but at the end of the day, itâ€™s still not enough. at the end of the day i still want to die. i just want to have a long nap and never wake up. 
 i canâ€™t handle much more and i feel pathetic because my life isnâ€™t even that bad. iâ€™m just weak. 


itâ€™s going to happen soon, my breaking point is near
