I can't do this anymore...I really need someone to listen. From an outsider's perspective, my life is fucking perfect. Inside, it's so broken. I forgot to take my pain/depression meds for the past two days, and I'm breaking down... I'm thinking maybe I should just take a bunch of them all at once, or just go take my dad's race car out for a joy ride, hit top speed, throw it on cruise, and aim at something solid. 

I've been majorly depressed for the past eight years... When I was 12, I used to start crying, lock myself in my room, wrap a scarf around my neck and pull both ends to choke myself... My mom is a fucking psychiatrist and she has never even realized that I've been so down. It's so easy to put on a fucking mask and smile and keep going every fucking day in the same fucking routine, but I can't keep this up...

and then getting cancer two years ago doesn't fucking help either. Yes, I'm cured, but I didn't ever want it. Now, I'm fucking dependent on these stupid meds for the rest of my life. And the fact that the cancer is a secret too. I like to pretend I'm over it, but I'm not... 

It hasn't just been this past weekend either, this past month has just sucked. Every time I drive to and from school, I think about throwing my car on cruise and just aiming for that telephone pole or something.

I don't think I'm going to kill myself, but I really just need some help right now... I just need someone to talk to please.
