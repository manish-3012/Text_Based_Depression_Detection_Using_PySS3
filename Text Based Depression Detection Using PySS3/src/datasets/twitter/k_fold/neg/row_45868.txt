Suppose this is goodbye.I am not looking for a reason to live, nor am I looking for someone to talk to. I tried to kill myself four years ago, I was "saved" by my now ex girlfriend. She stayed with me for three years, a year ago she moved back to Norway. We were in a 'LDR' for a year, the distance sucked but she was worth it. This morning she called me and broke up with me. I did the one thing I promised I wouldn't, I lied to her. Haven't been able to get a hold of her since, to explain myself. But really I don't deserve her, and she'll be better off without me. Only reason why I am making this post is because she knows my username. This is my way of saying goodbye. I love you, I always will. Don't blame yourself, not your fault.
