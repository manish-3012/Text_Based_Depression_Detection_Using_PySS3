I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. please help meiâ€™m overweight, ugly, 16, and questioning my sexuality. my dad is extremely homophobic, and despite knowing that I might be gay due to when he took my phone and read throw my personal messages to friends, he denies that i am and is still very openly against gays. I got contacted by an open bi kid from my school, telling me he wanted to hook up, and because iâ€™m stupid and desperate I didnâ€™t consider that fact that I am very ugly and heâ€™s attractive, so I assumed it was a genuine offer. I sent him nudes, and he told me we were going to meet up and make out and maybe more and iâ€™m so stupid that I believed him. he left me waiting where we were supposed to meet for hours, and unbenounced to me he screenshotted the pictures I sent him, and then sent them around to some people. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do if iâ€™m outed, and I canâ€™t face the humiliation iâ€™m going to get on monday from my peers and my parents. please help me I canâ€™t live with this humiliation
