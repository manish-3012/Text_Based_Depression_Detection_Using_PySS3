I will kill myself in 30 days.Hello. I turned 28 this September and have been toying with the idea of killing myself lately. The idea is growing stronger every day.

I am a high school graduate and itâ€™s been almost ten years since I did that. I had got a scholarship after my high school which didnâ€™t materialize at the very last moment. Something happened to me and I didnâ€™t continue with the studies. I have always loved the world of stories and filmmaking. I have been teaching a primary and lower secondary level of students in my local school for almost half a decade. I want to go abroad and study or do something but am not being able to do so. I am writing a script but I am not pragmatic enough to make things happen. I realized I am just being a burden to everyone around me. I wish I would get some financial assistance from somewhere so that I could apply somewhere abroad for studies. I would even sign a contract to pay it back afterwards. Maybe things would open for me again. The itsy-bitsy things I am doing nowadays just is enough to make ends meet. I feel so frustrated. I have given myself a duration of 30 days.
