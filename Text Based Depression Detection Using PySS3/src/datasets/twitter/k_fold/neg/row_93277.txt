To the redditor who posted "I would rather be dead than live with this fear"I noticed that your topic was deleted just after I posted a comment on it. I'm not too familiar with how reddit works, so I don't know if you would be notified about my comment. I'm sorry I didn't respond to it sooner. I've copied my response below. If you need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to reply here or to send me a message.

I'm so sorry you're going through such agony right now. While I can't say I have the same fears you're having, I do know exactly how you feel in terms of not feeling in control of your own brain. Your description of "clawing at the sides of my skull to get out" is spot on to how I've felt plenty of times before. Sometimes it feels bad enough that I can nearly feel it physically.
Other times it's like there's a wall in my mind that stops me from getting to the right thoughts. Like there's something my brain needs to process and I'm beating my head against that wall desperate to break through. And still other times it feels like an infinite loop in programming - but at least a program crashes when that happens.
All this is to say that, although I may not understand the same fear you have, I do understand the same pain it's causing you.
Have you ever talked to anyone about how you feel?
