Can't get over a breakup. Haven't talked to her for 14 weeks and 3 days.I'm thinking about suicide. I'm only writing this because I miss my ex and I've been depressed for the past 3 months. I was always there for her but she was never there once for me when we were together.

I'll feel like if I die, she'll miss me then.
