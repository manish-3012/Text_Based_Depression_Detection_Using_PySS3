Existing is just annoying(I'm not native English speaker so sorry for my mistakes) 

Do you know the feeling when you are waiting for something but u don't have anything to do. Like in a dentists appointment you wait for hours and it's just annoying with this sickening headache.

That's what life is for me. Every day I just wait for death. Hoping that it will come soon. I was planning to kill myself before this year started on my birthday but I am not brave enough (and I was stopped).

Recently my friend tried to strangle me to death but I was too tired of living that I even helped him.

I can't thing of anything else to write other than to thank your support.
