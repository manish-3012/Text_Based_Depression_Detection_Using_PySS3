Please take me away from this

I fell in love and I had so much hope I was bursting with it. And today I found out that he had a girlfriend. I've been through this so often.. but this time? They all knew I had feelings for months. They all knew I was trying to get him to notice me.

But nobody told me he had a girlfriend. Even he didn't mention it once in all the days we spent together. Not once. They all just watched me struggle. I'm a joke. My feelings were futile and they were laughing.

I hope I die, I want to die, I deserve to die. I'm so awful I can't even be happy for him.  I'm pathetic. Pathetic. Disgusting.
