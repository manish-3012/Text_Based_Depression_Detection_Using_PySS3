Thank you SWHey there you wonderful people who post here. I just wanted to thank you all for being so kind, and for giving your own time to help so many people.

I've been having a rough go at it recently, and today something snapped in my brain that I need help, or I'm not going to be able to live.

I stopped here first, and looked at some of the material you all have posted on the sidebar. Then I perused through, wanting to talk about my thoughts but was not sure where to start. So I just read a lot.

So just me seeing the kind words you have said to others, and the general consensus being "Seek professional help", i've begun looking for  a professional to speak with. 

So thank you again SW. Here's me hoping that everyone here finds the help and support they need to make it through.
