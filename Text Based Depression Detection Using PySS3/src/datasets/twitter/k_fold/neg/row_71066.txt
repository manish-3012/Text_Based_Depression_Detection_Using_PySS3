Getting tiredThrowaway account since I donâ€™t want this on my actual account.   Iâ€™ve been struggling with anxiety/panic disorder and all the others on the anxiety spectrum for the past three years now. Not to mention depression. So many things have happened in my family life that it has made me even worse mentally. I have only one brother, and older half brother. Heâ€™s been kinda in and out of my life for years and heâ€™s always had a shitty life; but Iâ€™m not going to get into that right now. Anyways, he was the person I was closest to although it probably was not that way because we rarely ever talked at all, and he barely tolerated me even though I have never done a single awful thing to him in my life. Heâ€™s always been my favourite person but heâ€™s never really cared about me as much. In October, he murdered someone. I wonâ€™t disclose too much info but he murdered a boy in cold blood. The news hit me as hard as anything in my life has ever done. I never knew the victim but the fact that my brother is a murderer and the boy is dead hit me in such a terrible way. I stayed up for three days afterward, the longest Iâ€™ve ever stayed awake, and I had a massive panic attack which has resulted in some of the worse DP/DR that could ever be experienced. I have never felt so fucking sick in my life and I just donâ€™t know what to do. I cry for that boy and also the grief that my only brother murdered him and is going to prison. Iâ€™ve never craved death so much in my life. I hate being alive right now.
