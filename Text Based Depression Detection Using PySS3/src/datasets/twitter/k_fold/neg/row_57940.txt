I'm ready to die...I've fucked up this life beyond repair. I'm fucking bipolar and suffer from depression that went untreated and it caused me to push everyone I love away. My birthday is Christmas Eve, and I would love to die the same day I came into this world. The only problem is, I don't want to ruin the holidays forever for my family. I'm also too big a coward to kill myself. I wish I would just die in a horrible accident or something.
