Very good friend 'crying wolf' don't know what to do.So long story, no so short... when I was 18, met a guy, fell in love....dated for almost 4 years and eventually broke up because I just couldn't handle the nothing anymore. He had no job, no ambition, no desire for a family, did nothing around the house... played video games.... NOTHING. FF over 5 years later, I'm now married but he is one of my best friends, and also very good friends with my husband... problem is he is depressed.... always has been and I know this... and threatens suicide to ME all the time.... I'm his person. But he's been threatening it for years now and I just don't know what to do. He doesn't trust doctors and I'll even admit life has dealt him a very shitty hand.... where to turn now. I do my best to always be there for him, but I can only repeat the same positive words over and over until I realize they have no effect. Any advice?
