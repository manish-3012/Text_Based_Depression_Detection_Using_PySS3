still here because of pawsi was very much ready to go today. ive been crying for two days just ready to give in and i thought today was gonna be the day. so as i started actually doing it, i heard fours paws and then felt them on me moving my hands away. i looked at my dog and he just stared at me back as if he knew what i was doing. 

i dont know what to do now. the urge is very much still there but i just dont know.
