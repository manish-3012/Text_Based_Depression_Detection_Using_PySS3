Im making meticulous plan to kill myself, so planned out afraid I will do itIm fantasizing how I could die soon. Sometimes Im giving myself time to a New Year, and then drop the plan to kill myself, and then fantasizing sometime near in the future. 

But Im planning a lot. What are best buildings to jump, how to pass security in building, how to make a hanging rope, where can I find the gun illegaly.
And then Ill give myself a month of time, and wondering Im how would i spend this last month? What could i do? What can i do?

I just dont see a bright light anymore. Everything is so hopeless for me. I dont have job, no college, no relationships and no friends. My whole life was a mess and childhood a horror story. I tried antidepressants, but as luck would have it, I have resistance to them (its rare, but it happens). Group therapy in public health care just messed me up more. I dont have money for individual therapy. Only family I have is my dad, and he is in poor health and really old, 71 year, and when he dies, I could die freely so I dont bring any pain to him.
The way I see it, living for me right now is just pain and torture, insurmountable heap of never ending anxiety to get over through day, no meaning at all, and rush of suicidal and depression thoughts. I feel like dying would be a mercy thing to do, and if people knew with how much pain I live in my head, they would say that too.
And I really, really, really want to die. To end the suffering. But there is little part of me, tiny as a particle saying: maybe, somehow, somewhere you will be happy one day. But I dont see that light. I just dont see it.

I just want to die
