I started writing on tumblr but then realized I love reddit more. Help?My wife doesnâ€™t want to be married to me anymore and the only thing keeping me alive is my two kids. Iâ€™m posting on a new random tumblr because I donâ€™t really have anyone else to turn to. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a danger to myself, but I wish I were. 

Does that make any sense? 

My kids are great though, and I love them with all my heart. Theyâ€™re still young enough that whatever happens should be something that they can recover from, but the â€œdream lifeâ€ is dead and I donâ€™t know if I can ever bring that back for them.

My wife will be fine though, once she gets her shit together. She is way hotter than me and she could easily settle down with a doctor or a lawyer or really anyone she wants. But me? Iâ€™m not hideous, but Iâ€™ve let myself go. I started working out this month in a desperate stab to get her to be attracted to me again; itâ€™s slow going.

So this is it. This is the end for me. Iâ€™ll post as long as I can while I try to figure everything out. Iâ€™m overwhelmed right now. Our house is very expensive and I think itâ€™ll probably bankrupt us. And starting over? I donâ€™t even want to think about that.

7 years gone. Nothing to show for it but regret, debt, and a poorly aging body.
