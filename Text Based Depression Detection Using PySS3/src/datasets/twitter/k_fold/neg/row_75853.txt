I'm lost and feel like there is no hopeI've always thought about suicide. I've always been, what people used to call me, "melancholic" when I was a child. From 15 to 17 I suffered bad with anorexia to the point I didn't get my periods for 9 months so my mom took me to a doctor and they made me eat again... I've gotten better (though I still feel like I'm huge at size 4) from the anorexia but not from the anxiety and depression. I'm now 27, I have a job and used to live with my boyfriend. In this period we've been together, I called the Suicide Line once, but I never told him that. I had a breakdown while he was out with his friends and cut my arms and destroyed a notebook I had trying to distract me from hurting myself even more. Today he broke up with and he's moving to another country, whereas I'm going to stay in this hell hole I live and die here... We've planned all of it together. We were going to get married but he went crazy today thinking that I cheated on him with an old friend from college with whom I had a thing once, way before I started dating my boyfriend.  And now he won't believe me, I see no future ahead of me other than staying in a job I don't, making barely enough to survive and depending on my parents forever. I am back at the point where I imagine all possible waya of dying without it looking like suicide... So my family won't feel like it's their fault - because it's not. Sorry for rambling, I'm a mess.
