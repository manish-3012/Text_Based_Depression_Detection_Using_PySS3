Does anyone else share this habit?Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts my entire life, but I truly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever do it. I just want to know if anyone out there does something I do from time to time. 

Sometimes when I get really sad I stick an unloaded shotgun in my mouth and just sit there thinking for a while. Iâ€™ll pull the trigger if Iâ€™m especially upset. For some reason this gives me a euphoric feeling and I can kind of fantasize about â€œwhat if it was loadedâ€

I have other â€œsuicidalâ€ habits but this one is my go to. Does anyone else do this or something similar?
