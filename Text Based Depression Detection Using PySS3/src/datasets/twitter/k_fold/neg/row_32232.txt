Thank you Suicide Watch for helping me not make a huge, irreversible mistakeA few months ago I almost took my own life. I made a post here in some last ditch effort to express my feelings and I was met with some of the most inspiring and helpful advice I could have received. It kept me going for another day and looking back at those comments gave me hope to keep trying even though it was so hard. I have social anxiety and have been alone for a long time. I had no peer support and it was nice to hear from people so understanding and caring. My depression is more under control now since I started antidepressants, which gave the the courage to seek counseling services (mainly for social anxiety). I have been so alone and isolated for so long but now I actually hung out with a group of students at my college. It was nerve wracking, I had no idea what to say, but at least I did it. Hopefully they will want to do more stuff together and I'll finally have some friends. For the first time in a long time suicidal thoughts don't plague my thoughts constantly. I no longer need alcohol and marijuana to cope with theses unbearable feelings. I feel like I have come so far from where I have been.

One thing that still bothers me is my inability to form a romantic relationship with a woman. I am only 20 years old and I always hear the "you have plenty of time for that" but I don't want to wait. I want to experience it now. I want someone who I can hold and share everything with without holding anything back. I have never had a romantic relationship before so maybe I have a warped idea of what it's like but I want to experience it for myself. On the rare occasions I meet women my SAD prevents me from getting past the casual acquaintance stage and my lack of experience in this area doesn't help. My inability to succeed in this area makes me feel so unlovable.

Again thank you. It is great that I can be sitting here writing this as oppose to lying in a box 6 feet underground.
