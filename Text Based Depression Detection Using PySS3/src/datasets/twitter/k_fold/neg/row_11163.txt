If onlyTwo years ago I had pneumonia and I wish it had taken me then and there, but here I am emotionally feeling worse than I ever have before and Iâ€™m not able to talk to anyone because then to me it sounds so stupid and petty. I saw a counsellor and the entire time I felt like she thought I was an attention seeker and that my problems are stupid. I wish my life ended back then so the last few years never happened.
