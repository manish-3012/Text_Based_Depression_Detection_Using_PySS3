everyday i feel like dyingI canâ€™t believe that there are people who wake up with a smile on their face and genuinely enjoy their days. Iâ€™m so tired of these demons inside my head keeping me from sleeping at night when I need it more than anything. Some people would pray to a god that they grow stronger but I pray that the universe kills me in my sleep. I lay awake at 3 in the morning trying to fight the urge to slice my neck open and society expects me to suck it up, do my daily dosage of homework and attend school a couple of hours later like nothing happened. I canâ€™t think anymore, Iâ€™m always tired, my body is giving up. I used to be a straight A student, I used to be smart. This is beyond ridiculous, Iâ€™m being punished for absolutely nothing at all. Iâ€™m a kid, please, I just want to be innocent for just one day of my life. I never had a childhood, what am I supposed to look back on? Iâ€™ve spent all my days wishing I was dead, how can I just pick up and forget them? Iâ€™ve never been happy a day in my life. I canâ€™t even remember anything from before age 13. Why canâ€™t I just die? Why wonâ€™t they help me? Is it because I am female? Puberty? hormones? What would society like to label me as? weâ€™re all just statistics. nobody cares. whatâ€™s the point of seeing tomorrow
