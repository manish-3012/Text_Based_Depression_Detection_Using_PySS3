I'm fat and alone.Everyone that sees me, *everyone*, their first thought is that I'm lazy, stupid, and gluttonous. 

I'm morbidly obese. I have been since I was a child. I have tried everything. Everything. Yes, I have tried that. I tell people this and they don't believe me. They assume I'm just being lazy, or I'm stupid, or I can't control by gluttony. 

I live alone in a tiny apartment. All of my friends and my spouse live many hundreds of miles away. I haven't seen any of them in months. I don't know anyone in this new city. I work, I eat, I sleep. That's all I do. 

I will never not be fat. I'm like a walking neon sign that says "you are disgusted by me"
