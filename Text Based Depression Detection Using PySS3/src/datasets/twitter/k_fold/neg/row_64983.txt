No hopeI'm going to kill myself in the next couple of months hopefully. Things in my life are just too horrible and are not getting better. I dom't want to go into detail because I'm uncomfortable doing so/lazy, but I just wanted to say this somewhere.
Hopefully I'll be able to starve myself before doing so, not eating is so euphoric. It literally feels like meth.
