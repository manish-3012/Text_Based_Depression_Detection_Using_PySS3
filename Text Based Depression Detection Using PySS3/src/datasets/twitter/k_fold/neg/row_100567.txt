Itâ€™s okay to not be okayI have been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety since 17. I am 23 now and still not over it. I have always been emotional and sensitive. Overtime I have realized nothing will change who I am. Maybe itâ€™s meant to be this way; a struggle. I have come to accept it but itâ€™s disheartening. Will it ever go away?

I have no idea. Theyâ€™re tides in the ocean, high and low. I have learnt to flow. I still feel suicidal but it goes away. The not knowing and emptiness scares me so I donâ€™t kill myself (or maybe I am a coward). 

What Iâ€™m trying to say is, it sucks and it sucks less sometimes. And itâ€™s okay to not be okay, I hope we learn to embrace all that comes and let it go.
