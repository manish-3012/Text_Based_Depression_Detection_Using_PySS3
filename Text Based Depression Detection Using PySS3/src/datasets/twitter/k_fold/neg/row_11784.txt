I need helpBefore you get upset I am leaving for a few hours with friends to try and cheer myself up and may be find a way out of my mess.

However, I am suicidal.  I know what I need to do to get my affairs in order.  I have picked a day and a method.  The day is significant as it is my anniversary.  I am hoping I do not go through with it, but I see no other options.

I am in too much debt to leave my husband.  He is not happy with me...to say the least.  It's turning abusive verbally.  I have kept silent for much of the day because anything I say will get me screamed at.  

I have about 100k in debt and currently have no job.  Have had no job for a year about.  My husband is 100% supporting me financially.  If I commit suicide all of that debt disappears...because it was only in my name.  

I own my home.  I own my car.  Paid off outright.

If I sell my house my children will have no where to live.  If I kill myself the debt disappears and they will have a home to grow up in.

Divorce is financially out of the question.  Leaving my home, which I am the only owner of...my husband married me after I purchased it many years ago...is out of the question.  I am trying to figure out how to write the will to make sure only the kids get any assets I have in case I can find no other alternative.

Give me some suggestions that will give me hope please...I will try anything that will let my children live in their home.
