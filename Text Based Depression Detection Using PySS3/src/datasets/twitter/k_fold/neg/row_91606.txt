Don't know how to talk about my problems, but keep thinking about suicideI'm not really sure how to start this. There are a lot of things that are eating me up inside, but I don't know how to express them. I just can't tell anyone whats wrong with me or whats going on. I try to hide a lot of my personal issues from my friends and family because I don't want to ruin their days and I'm also not sure how things would get perceived. I even called a hotline once, but I just blanked out, I tried chatting, but once I started to type, I couldn't stop crying and had to stop. It's gotten to a point where I'm now thinking weekly about committing suicide and disappearing. So far I haven't made any plan, until tonight. I don't know whats going on but I constantly get these thoughts about methods and I even started pacing the room and measuring things and a lot of other things. But I still can't talk about anything. I was interacting with my dad just an hour ago and even the thought of telling him that there is anything wrong makes me feel guilty and ashamed. I'm sorry if this is a little unclear or unfocused, but I think I'm gonna stop here for now, it took me a lot of energy to type this. I'm very sorry if reading this made you uncomfortable.
