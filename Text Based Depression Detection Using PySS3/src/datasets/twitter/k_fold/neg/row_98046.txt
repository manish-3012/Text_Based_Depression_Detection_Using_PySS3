I messed up my life and I'm daydreaming of suicideI've been depressed for something like 8 years now.  On and off medication.  I managed to get into a good university, but once I started school my grades tanked. Was put on probation after first year for a gpa of like 1.3.  Second and third year, I managed to find some friends to curb my loneliness and my grades went up a little.  But they abandoned me in fourth year and i almost didn't graduate because i had to get all my exams deferred because I didn't get out of bed for weeks on end.  Managed to graduate with a CGPA of like 2.3/4.3

Now two years out of school and I'm broke, living at my parents house and working at a shitty thrift store.  Making minimum wage. My mother constantly tells me that I'm a failure, I'm not good enough and I'm ugly and fat.  I have no prospects of ever going back to grad school or law school or anything to better my chances of getting a better job because of my grades. 

I'm at work right now on my break and I keep daydreaming about just ending my life. I've been thinking about it non stop for a month.  I can't fix how massively I've messed up, can't get a job or go back to school at 24. My friends are all successfully doing other degrees (law,teaching,etc).

Everything hurts.  I'm not good enough.  And i never will be.  What's the point in trying?
