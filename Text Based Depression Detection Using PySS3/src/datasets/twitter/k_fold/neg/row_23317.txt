. . .I just canâ€™t.. 

Iâ€™m staying over a friends house and they have antifreeze downstairs. 

I fucking went down there and grabbed it. 
I just stood in the kitchen.. looking at it.

Itâ€™s late at night so every fucking sound is exaggerated.

My heart screamed drink it. 
My mind screamed not here. Not now. 

The voice just kept screaming. 
And screaming.

Heâ€™s still fucking screaming at me. 

I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can take this!

Iâ€™ve drank antifreeze before. 
I barely escaped death. 

I had to be put in a coma, tubes in my throat, dialysis etc. 

My life has just been nothing but lies. 

I can never be happy with myself. 

I donâ€™t know who or what I am.
I donâ€™t fit in anywhere.

Iâ€™m just made to die.

Iâ€™ve tried everything. 
Therapy.. psych wards.. meds.. 

Nothing can fill the void in me. 
Pain makes it all go away 

Death is my solution.

I donâ€™t know how much longer I have..

All I know is that soon Iâ€™ll kill myself.

Just after I finally loose this fucking weight. 

I think I just have a few weeks left in me.
Itâ€™s all I can take.
