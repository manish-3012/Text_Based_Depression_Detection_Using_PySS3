My failuresAlright guys this is my first time trying this.. im 24 and started to hate life at 16 it began when i was embarrassed to be in special ed because apparently i have 1% autism and im still embarrassed to this day no one knows i think just my family, but when i really started hating myself was in senior year when i tried joining the marines but failed the asvab test multiple times i didnt have a plan B to go to college im not good at school and no subject really interests me that much to pursue later at 20 i went to a short term college i finished but i was pressured by my parents to do something i didnt want, i still owe money so thats affecting my credit another thing that sucks, next i started working in refineries its good money but i hate it, then decided to try border patrol, ive been trying for 3 years and failing.
Today i got scammed its mostly my fault so now im broke and hating every molecule in my body im gonna start saving money and pay the expenses to my funeral in secret when im done idk how ill do it but im done, exhausted, frustrated of failing countless times but im a really simple guy that loves anime and guns and my cats and family even tho they frustrate me and i dont want to be a burden or financial problem even after im dead i dont believe in god tbh i believe its just been unlucky that simple no complex theories i was just born unlucky. If you read this far thank you my name is rodrigo.
