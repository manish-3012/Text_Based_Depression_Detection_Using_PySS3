I might fail collegeI been trying my best and been putting as much effort as I can but everytime I do something It would be like taking 100 steps back . I watch other classmates percead onto the next task but I happen to not even finish the first task. I just want to make my parents proud but it seems as if I fail they will be disappointed. I sometimes want to die because I feel as if this would separate me from all this stress.
