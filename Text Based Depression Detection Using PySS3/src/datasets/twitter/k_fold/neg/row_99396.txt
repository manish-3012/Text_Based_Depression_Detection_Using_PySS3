Who can I talk to openly about rational suicide?I've tried therapy but they're all about fixing the suicidal thoughts. I am more interested in having a rational discussion about ALL of my options including suicide. If it turns out not to be the answer, fine, but I don't want to take it off the table without sufficient consideration. Who can I discuss this with (preferably face to face, not online)?  If a therapist, how do I find one who will be willing to discuss without trying to fix the suicidal impulses?  Thanks.
