idk what i feel anymorei feel nothing. i had emergency appendicitis surgery over the weekend and i wasn't worried bc i didn't care if i ever woke up from it. i have nothing i care about anymore. i don't care if i died. i know people will miss me but here's the thing, i don't care about that either. 

i've just become such a disappointment, i have nothing going for me. i have no friends they've all left me. my parents don't want to listen when i would talk about my problems with suicide they just brush it off and think i'm just joking. at first i didn't want to be a statistic but now i just really don't fucking care.
