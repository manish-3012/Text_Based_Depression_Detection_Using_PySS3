If my daughter leaves idk wtf I'm going to doWhat do you do if your daughter is taken from you? Have you ever watched a four year old fight cancer? It's horrifying.





How do you not react poorly when your sense of fairness and "karma" is shattered? Have you ever held your child down while she was forced to receive an I.v? 

Have you heard her beg you to "please stop daddy" while you had to look the other way because tears were streaming down your face?




What do you do when in this day and age you have to be retarded to believe in a religion? God is great? Allah ackbar eh? Everything happens for a reason? 


Have you ever held a grown man who was a stranger while he wept and told you he wanted to die because "God" just stole TWO of his babies? Yeah.....fucken allah mother fucken ackbar.



Have you ever snapped on your sick possibly dying child because she's done nothing but scream at you and tell you she hates you? I HAVE! I yelled at her to stop talking to me like that? Fucking dope right?! Except she was acting like that because a bone marrow transplant with (mucositis)[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucositis] is painful as fuck and she couldn't speak properly because she has mucus pouring out of her mouth and nose. Fucking dad of the year here, idgaf how horrifying this is for you I'm irritated! I fucking hate myself for that moment. I think about it a lot.



"Oh just talk to people and reach out" OH FUCK?!?!? REALLY?!?!? THAT CURES CANCER? DOPE!!!!!


"God has a plan" I will and i can not stress this enough kill you and then if your "God" exists i will find a way to kill that piece of shit too.




"You have to be strong for your daughter" No shit faggot, that's wtf i am fucking doing.




"You need to live two lives, for her and you" cool, so you're saying " be sad all the time, live your entire life devastated you fucking coward" fucken dope advice.




What the fuck am i supposed to do?! Just give up? Just fucking kill myself and black this shit?!?! 


Or do i just be sad forever? "Oh it wont last forever" fuck you, just all kinds of fuck you. There is no fucking way i can lose my little girl to this and be ok with it, f.u.c.k. y.o.u. you're a monster if you can skate away from that.



What

You fucking move forward until you can't. Never stop swinging and never stop moving or you're a fucking coward who gave up, or so i have been told my whole life.
