I dont know how to move forwardI feel stuck in my life and I dont want to be me anymore. I donâ€™t want to be, anymore. My life seems to be continuing forward on autopilot, with things happening in spite of my existence instead of because of it. I am slowly losing everything and losing touch with everyone I know, and I donâ€™t know how to build on this and move forward. Some days I wish I would just get hit by a fuckin truck. I dont know what to do anymore.
