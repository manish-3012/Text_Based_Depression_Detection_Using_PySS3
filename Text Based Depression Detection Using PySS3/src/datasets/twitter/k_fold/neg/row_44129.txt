I've been a failure all these yearsI'm 25 years old and havent done/achieved something that i should be proud of. 7 months ago i had job, something that i am grateful,thought of finally my life has some directiin. but i've lost it because of my envious co-workers. Now im stuck on bills over bills, my car that i couldn't pay anymore, and im back living with my parent, christ!

Actually, i did try on killing myself few years back, and guess what! I also failed on that one. Here i am wide awake thinking what i did, how life can be so cruel, eeeeehhh.

Lately, i've found myself staring on my parents and sibling somewhat like a one last look or goodbye, i will miss them, my parents, siblings, girlfriend and my pets!( Dogs and rabbits). 

And I am truly sorry, i am weak and worthless. :/
