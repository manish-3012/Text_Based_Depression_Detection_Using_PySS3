This summerThroughout my life I've been very unhappy. My first attempt at suicide was when I was 7 and I've attempted twice more. I'm now in a position where I have felt completely worse. My family had always hated me, but I had friends, however I do not have friends anymore. College has brought out the worst in me and I've been so miserable. I'm failing everything I do. I am in debt. I have no social life, and I'm the only one from my highschool that went to this college. So I started fresh, which could have been good, but it's proven to be really terrible. I'm the only one out of my past friends to be doing terrible in college. And I don't have any friends here, I am very unapproachable as I'm ugly. I've never had the problem with making friends until uere, although I never have been in a relationship but I had many friends. I don't know what to do anymore. Counseling does not help me at all, and I have tried to be open about it but I just can't handle it. If things do not get better, I plan to commit suicide this summer. I have never been in a worse position and it doesn't seem to be getting better so I guess I'll see what will happen, but it just sucks to be a failure academically, socially, physically, and financially. I just want a chance, I just wish someone actually cared.
