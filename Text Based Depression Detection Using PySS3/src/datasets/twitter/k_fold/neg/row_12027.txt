I am screwed should I just kill myselfI am completely screwed in life, I have no job, no friends, no family, nothing to do, I was trying to move away from this horrible expensive town and then covid hit. 

I can't just move away because a landlord will want me to have a job. I can't get a job away from here because employers want someone local to their area. And they want people with experience but won't train you. So how are you supposed to do anything. 

I don't want anything apart from a job and some direction in life. Everything is out of reach. I don't get a chance at anything. What's the point in living. 

I'm thinking of jumping from a cliff nearby. I've tried hanging myself but it's too uncomfortable. I wish I could shoot myself.
