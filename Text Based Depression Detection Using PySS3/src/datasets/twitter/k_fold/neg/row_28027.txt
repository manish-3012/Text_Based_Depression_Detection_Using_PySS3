Socially withdrawing from everyoneEven the people I like I can't even bring myself to socialize with. I just go in my room and lock the door. Don't even eat sometimes. I hate every aspect of who I am and how I look. Physically, I look like absolute shit and my face just looks puffy and bruised like I got punched in the face. But internally I'm already gone and lost in the darkness. Only a matter of time before it consumes me entirely and I'm 6 feet under.
