I'm not ready to die yetI hate my life.  I hate what I've become.  I feel like the paradigm of a loser.  I live with my parents.  My job is a bullshit go-for piece created by my dad to fill a gap in my employment history.  I'm so damn lucky to have people to care for me but all I want is for them to kick me out so I can die without guilt.  I won't try to die until they have passed.  I saw the parents of friends who had commit suicide and I don't want to do that to my parents.  It was so painful to see. 

I just want to disappear.
