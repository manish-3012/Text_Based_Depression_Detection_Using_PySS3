Im not even sadI'm not upset or distraught, I don't feel in distress or like the world around me is crumbling. I just don't want to live. I love my family and my friends, they make me happy, and when I'm with them I am perfectly capable of being alive. But when I'm alone, allowed to think, when my brain only has itself I can only think about death. I feel so effortlessly suicidal, as if it would be as simple as making a sandwich. I wanna die. No matter how I think about it, how selfish it is and how unfair to my loved ones, I just can't imagine having to continue this ridiculous cycle of living because I was forcibly given this "gift" of life. I hate it. It sucks. MY life doesn't suck, it's great. I'm just tired of living.
