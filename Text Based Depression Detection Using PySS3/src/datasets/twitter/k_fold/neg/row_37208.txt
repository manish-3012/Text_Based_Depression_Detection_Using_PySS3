AM I ALONE?Do yall ever want a friend that understands all your insecurities? Cuz i do, I'm struggling and hate myself more than ever. 
I hate going thru life alone honestly. 


I don't even feel like a person
And the things i think about and do arent normal. 
Guess im all kinds of screwed up.


Im scared to die and don't want to but i feel like i have to kill myself so im not constantly feeling like this
Im aloneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
