I would rather kill myself than make a phone call. I wish I was joking.
I'm 20 and I'm transgender,mtf. My mother told me to go to hell when I came out to her, and my father has avoided all discussion of the situation despite being initially upset-but-accepting. He said he'd help me, but that quickly turned into talking to religious people who were not there to help.

I told myself it was ok, I could get help myself. I got a better job. I bought a car under my own name, so my parents could not take it. I've saved up money and will have my associates degree next May. I have friends who understand my situation whom I could live with until I found a place to stay, should my parents kick me out (and they will, once they find out I've gotten HRT).

And I'd rather kill myself than phone the informed consent clinic and get an appointment. It's honestly pathetic, that anxiety would hit me so hard. I've been sorta suicidal for years, which is also pathetic. My mother is abusive, physically in the past and currently both emotionally and verbally. I can't shake the feeling that she'd find some way to screw me over, but even that's not it.

I'm only alive because I'm a coward, and I'm too scared to make any move at all, so I'm just gonna sit in my current situation, too scared to move, until I get around to killing myself. I've got one of my father's handguns in my room, and every night I sit there and hold it and I genuinely want to die. I just can't do it. This has happened every night for over a month, and honestly I now just want to die so I don't have to go through it every night anymore. Idk what to do. External help is not an option as my mother watches my every move like a hawk.
