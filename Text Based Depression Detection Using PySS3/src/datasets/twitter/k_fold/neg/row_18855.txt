Nothing interesting.Done living being rained on every night is not worth sleeping outside is hell, Iâ€™ve tried everything possible in this town to get assistance but everyone puts on a fake smile just to brush me away as fast as possible. All I see is dull colors that void the whole perspective of reality into black and white. Emotions have left my mind and have left nothing but an empty an expressionless being.
