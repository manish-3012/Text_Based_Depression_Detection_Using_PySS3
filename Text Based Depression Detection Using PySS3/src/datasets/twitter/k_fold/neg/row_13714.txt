Feeling DarkJust broke up with my boyfriend, and, although I have felt like doing it for a long time, I am still wondering if it is the right more. I'm always suicidal, and I am known for pushing people away that would be good for me. I think about our lack of common interests, and how much he annoyed me. Was I really annoyed at him or myself? 
Regardless. I am feeling pretty dark tonight
