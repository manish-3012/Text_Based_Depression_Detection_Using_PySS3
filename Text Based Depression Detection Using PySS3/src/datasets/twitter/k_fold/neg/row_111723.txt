I got this message from a friend today, and I have no idea how to respond...Please help, i'm in a terrible loss of words.
"i can explain, and I'm in a place where i can now. Ok so I've been in and out of ____hospital on their unit. Which basically you stay there and go to group therapy, see a psychiatrist, and i went there for suicidal thoughts. The whole story i needed to tell you. Basically i smoked marujuana, it was laced, i hallucinated ( which the experience i will share later if you want to hear it) and ended up in the hospital. after that i was never right again. anxiety maxed out, and was experiencing panic attacks and depersonalization. Then i had a bad panic attack, cut up my leg with scissors, thank god i called my mom before doing anything else stupid. and, went into that hospital i was telling you about. now i am in there intensive out patient program. I came out literally the weekend after or before i was supposed to hangout with you i can't remember, but yeah. then i had to go back in. BUT I'm am out and doing good as of today. this should be in a phone call. but you know i suck at those. you deserved an explanation. and i don't want to lose you as a friend. although recently strangers, i miss you. and that is all"
