NervousAnd restless, the anticipation of my inevitable demise. 

I drink quite heavily, enough that I'm actually surprised that even just from 2 years now I'm not physically dependant on it. 

Death is seemingly so unknown, but from what I've heard it must be peaceful. In the end; if we chose to be here, we shall ultimately be our own critique as to how we played the game. 

I'll be leaving in the coming weeks or possibly months (hopefully sooner), and still coming to terms with it. As everyone has to. We all die someday, obviously. 

And I've decided to go early.
