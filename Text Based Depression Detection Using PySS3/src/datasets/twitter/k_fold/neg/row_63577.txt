Need helpI am so deep right now. It's one of those moments where everything that can go wrong, is going wrong ... My grandmother and brother are in the hospital. I was supposed to leave on a vacation tomorrow but my flight just got cancelled. That was one thing I was really looking forward to and now I feel like there's just nothing left ... Nothing that makes me excited to be here
