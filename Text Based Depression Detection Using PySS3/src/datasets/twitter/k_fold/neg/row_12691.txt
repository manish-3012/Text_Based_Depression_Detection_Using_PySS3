im just over everythingI've stopped caring entirely, I thought I had one last thing to live for and that was my best friend but it feels like I've just been talking so much to her and she's just seeing me at this annoying thing that constantly bothers her. ive taken 6500mg of paracetamol and im planning on taking more... idk if it'll kill me but maybe liver failure will. if this doesn't work I'll probably just drink bleach or jump from a building
