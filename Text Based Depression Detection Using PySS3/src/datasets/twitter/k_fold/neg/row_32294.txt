The weight of my responsibilities is haunting meI've made grave mistakes.

I stood idle when I should have acted, I let rage act for me when a calm mind would have done the job.

And because of this I've lost everything I was working for, my future.
The idea of ending it all is getting stronger every day, and I can't resist much longer, I'm at my limit.

I can't change the past, and I don't want to see this future, I feel there's no point in breathing anymore

Xanax won't do for me anymore, my body is getting used to it, and now even with higher doses I only get sleepy, which is not an option because of my job.

Can't keep this up much longer, I feel my time is getting shorter and shorter. I'll do it soon, not now but soon

Thanks for listening
