Impulsively booked two nights in a hotel by myselfMy mum wonâ€™t be on to me now. She knows now that Iâ€™ve booked it and so does my mental health nurse. Hopefully my end will be soon, not that Iâ€™d do it in the hotel, just that I have less people on my back over the weekend in a hotel without my mum.
