A little venting I'll try to not make it longMy name is Bryce, I feel like that makes me more comfortable that you all know. I've been struggling with diagnosed depression since 8th grade (I'm a high school junior now). Life has been so great this school year, found a boy I like, averaged a 4.3 GPA last quarter. I love my friends and my band family. Taking 4 AP classes I love. Seeking help for my mental health. About a month ago I started cutting and started burning. In my second period class, someone asked me about how the hand sanitizer+lighter trick worked. I showed them(This was one of the ways I would burn myself) someone was recording me and I got called to the principal's office and now my expulsion is in the process because I committed arson. when my mom dropped me off at home. the first thing I did was grab my Zoloft pills and took about 30 of them.

About five hours later I was throwing them up and was hallucinating. I didn't do my research I guess because overdosing is actually really hard. I spent two days recovering from that. I tied a simple noose to my doorknob and am looking to try again tonight. Made a program to upload a tweet with a google doc that's my suicide note. I tagged one of my friends so it will spread to my other friends. Looking to make a convo before I do it 2nite.
