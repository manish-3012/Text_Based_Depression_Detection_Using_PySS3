Delusions of insanityHello._x000D_

My Name is George.  Ok, it's really not.  But, I do live __ _ ______, figuratively speaking.  Well, not just any old figurative ______.  Its a Truman Show ______, as my ex-girlfriend thinks of it.  See, she is fairly good friends with a relative of ___ _______.  This concerned me.  See, I received an anonymous email.  Get it, anonymous?  Hur hur.  My quasi-joking manner is an effort to mask the pain of knowing the delusion of insanity._x000D_

See, I believe that people have this grand idea.  "Let's make a post, perhaps on reddit."  It will be for the lulz.  Hur hur.  Someone will get the message.  Especially if his name is George.  Yes, that is me.  Of course._x000D_

Yes, I do not want to live anymore.  This is why I am posting here.  I think people are facking liars.  I think you are probably a liar.  Maybe you are not.  But, what am I to believe?  I know she was a liar on some level (my ex, that is).  I know that she was under the spell of the relative of said person.  So, among other reasons, this was too much for me, and now its over._x000D_

I do not want to die because it is over with my ex.  I want to die because of the lulz.  Because of the diner.  I hate going to the diner.  What it means to me, to go to a diner, and see the lulz in action, to see the connection to my redd-ality.  _x000D_

Are aliens real?  I see this little alien dude in the reddit log.  So let's talk.  How else could it be?  This is the only logical reason I can see.  Aliens must be real.  People do not have the time.  Or do they?_x000D_

I cannot explain it.  But I can explain this.  I Want to die.  I will not do it.  I too scared to follow through.  Perhaps, thankfully.  Why?  Because I am still alive._x000D_

But, the insanity is too much.  The people do not give a shit.  You might, because you see someone in pain.  But, it is not so simple.  See, I want to die because, well, what I have seen is a mystery.  Knowing that I do not know, and that I will likely not ever know, is too much to bear.  Maybe I could accept Jesus, Allah, or someone.  I have no facking clue.  Maybe I should accept technology something else.  I don't know.  _x000D_

But, I know that I am in pain.  I would ask for your help, but I do not need it.  I just need to try to understand for myself.  Why?  Is it just a mental illness?  Not likely.  I observe.  Theorize.  My observations are based on reality._x000D_

I would like to say thank you, and to those 'other ones', fack off._x000D_

I am sorry for the strange post.  Good day.
