DAE wish they could actually get encouragement to commit suicide instead of bullshit mental health advice?Because honestly I'm fucking sick of not being able to talk freely about methods or ways of acceptance. Sometimes it truly is the solution.  We all know in some cases it is.  
Recently I rewatched a short documentary on a young woman in Belgium who applied for assisted suicide due to mental illness. Probably a lot of you have heard or seen it.  It's on YouTube (search "24 and ready to die).  All I felt was jealousy that I don't live in Belgium and I have to DIY it in a painful way.  
No amount of positivity can change my mind that I have to kill myself. I'm still scared though, and all I really want is someone to encourage me to do it. I don't understand why it's so bad to die.  We are not all special little snowflakes worthy of life. Life is for yourself to live,  but what if you don't want it? 
IDK I might get in trouble for posting this but whatever.
