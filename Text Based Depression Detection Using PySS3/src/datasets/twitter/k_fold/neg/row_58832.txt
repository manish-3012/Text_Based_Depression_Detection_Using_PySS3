I want to try itI was just walkin and saw a truck. A big one. Was so hard to try not to jump in front of it.

Didin't. My youngerbrother was there, wanted to spare him. Or maybe I'm just a coward, making excuses. Either way, I really want to get that kind of a change again. I just don't have the strenght to continue...
