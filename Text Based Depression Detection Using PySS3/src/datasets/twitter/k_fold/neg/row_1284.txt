my brother attempted suicide last nightI live in a different state than my brother. I got an email from a woman saying she was a friend of my brother's and had stayed at his house last night. She woke up and went to say good-bye to him and he was incoherent. He admitted to taking a bottle of sleeping pills. She called 911. If she hadn't then he would be dead now.

I called the hospital, frantically trying to get information about him and the whole time just thinking "He's dead. He's dead. They're going to tell me he's dead." 

Luckily he failed in his attempt. He's stable and being transported to  a psychiatric unit. My mother and grandmother are driving across country (the also live in a completely different state) to see him. 

He had absolutely NO history of depression or mental illness that anyone knew of. He is the most level-headed, intelligent person I know. And I feel like I've just been punched in the gut. In a million years, I would NEVER have thought of him doing something like this. I'm so sad he didn't come to me for help. We've always been close. I'm so angry he put our family through this. I feel so helpless. So I'm just drinking and crying.

I don't know why I'm writing this. I'm just lost. My family is heart-broken and confused. I'm unable to go see him because of work and my own recent health issues.
