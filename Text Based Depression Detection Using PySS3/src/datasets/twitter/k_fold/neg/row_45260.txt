Losing my soulmateHey all,

Sorry to bother, I just needed to get some thoughts out into the aether. P and I met in year 2 and have been inseparable since. She is the person I have always admired most and love with all my heart. She is unequivocally my best friend, through and through, though I have not always been a good friend to her. Especially now when she needs it. 

She was diagnosed with Stage IV glioblastoma in December of last year - when we still werenâ€™t speaking after an argument a year earlier on my birthday. I found in January of this year when she called to tell me. It completely shattered my world, still nauseated me to think about and is despairing in the extreme. I cannot imagine what she has been through, after 3 craniotomies, several rounds of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. Seeing her degrade before my eyes is traumatising, and my inexcusable instinct is to withdraw and avoid everything. Escape the reality by shutting down completely, which is what I have done. When she has needed me most in life, when she was deal the absolute worst of cosmic hands and needs physical, emotional and mental support - I was not there. 

I am an awful person, and as soon as she passes away, I will kill myself. There is genuinely no point continuing on with life if I cannot spend it with her, as we had always intended. We had so many plans that will never come to be. The pain is unbearable and she doesnâ€™t deserve it. I want to take it all away from her but I canâ€™t. Life is not worth living if she is not here to share it with, sheâ€™s the love of my life and genuinely my soulmate. Sheâ€™s just everything. 

Love you P.
