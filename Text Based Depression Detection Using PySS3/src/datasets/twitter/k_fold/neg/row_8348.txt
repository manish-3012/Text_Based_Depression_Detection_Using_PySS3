I need somewhere to rantQuarantine has been really tough these past few months. I've been in quarantine since the start of 2020, meaning that I haven't left the house in 8 months.

My mental health wasn't very prestine even before this Covid-19 stuff. Quarantine is making it worse.
Recently I lost something very dear to me, something that helped me vet through tough times. Ever since, there are times throughout the day were I just feel overwhelmed. I know its horibble, but Ive been thinking about SH. I've been doing substitutions, like ice and digging my nails into my wrists, palms, thighs. Im just scared and overwhelmed with whats happening. I hate to admit it, but it's getting worse and I've been looking to reach out to someone.

I cry myself to sleep. But the problem is that I live with my mom and sister. Our rooms are next to each other and the walls are fairly thin and you could hear whats going on in the other room. Because of that, Im forced to cry silently.

 I've put up a facade. My family doesn't know anything about this. I can't talk to them, so im hoping I can talk about this to you guys. Id appreciate some advice.
