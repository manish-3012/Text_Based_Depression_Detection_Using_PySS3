tl;dr I am a walking suicide case. I have had clinical depression for more than half my life and despite therapy, meds, etc, see no end when I have spent more of my life suicidally depression than not. If I didn't worry about the people around me, I'd commit suicide in a heartbeat. It is as if I am waiting for my last social contacts to disappear so I can end life as non-obtrusively as possible.
