iâ€™m not going to bother attempting because my eating disorder is going to kill me eventually anywaywarning if you have an eating disorder: weight related numbers. idk if this sub needs warnings but either way

i was going to attempt via overdose or shallow water blackout but as i keep losing weight why fucking bother

anorexia is pretty much a long-term suicide plan lmaooo my goal weights keep going lower and lower. i remember i promised myself not to get underweight... then not below 45kg... 40kg... 38kg... now itâ€™s 36kg (dw iâ€™m still 41 at 160cm hahaha) and iâ€™m still not fucking happy with my body so thereâ€™s no real point

iâ€™m fully aware iâ€™m going to die if i keep going on like this and sometimes it makes me feel like my heart is going to break from the fucking pointlessness of it all. no matter how much weight i lose body dysmorphia will keep me from enjoying it. i will never be pretty to myself. and i really do not want to recover, looking at all those anorexics who switch to binge eating disorder after recovery fucking terrify me, i never want to go back to being overweight again let alone obese

so i guess my only option is to die

at least iâ€™m suicidal so this is a silver lining
