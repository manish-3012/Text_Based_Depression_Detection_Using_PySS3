Bedridden with ideation. Anyone on Runescape 3 to play and talk things through/distract each other?I've been suicidal for a long time, usually ideation. I've finally took the courage to call a crisis hot line, and after 3 calls I've found they are just too scripted to be of help. They're probably suicidal too :(

So I've taken back to Vid games to distract me. Vid games help distract the thoughts, and I just recently got back into Runescape 3. I'd love to have someone to play and chat with on there. ( I'm free to play servers)
Maybe make a few good online friends this way like I did back in the day! 

 I know these are coping mechanisms but I'm trying. And I'm also here to listen to you empathetically, because obviously if you're gonna respond with a username or so you're not in the best place either.

Looking forward to helping each other through video games and active listening â¤ï¸
