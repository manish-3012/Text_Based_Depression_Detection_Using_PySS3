For the first time in my life, suicide feels not like a possibility but an inevitabilityI feel like Iâ€™m slowly but surely sinking towards rock bottom. I went to film school and got a degree and it has done exactly dick for me. Iâ€™ve done numerous internships, all unpaid, and despite my employerâ€™s claims that they would help me get a job in the industry they have either said they were â€œtoo busyâ€ to help me or they outright refused to answer my phone calls. All of my classmates have gone off to do things in the industry, even winning awards. I work at a cafe, making coffee for people I canâ€™t stand, or bartending. My body and mind are exhausted by the crazy hours I work. I am slowly realizing that I am a complete failure at life, and even though Iâ€™ve half-heartedly looked at different avenues like being a flight attendant or something, I know now that I will never achieve what I always wanted to do and I will have to settle for being a fucking loser waiting hand and foot on assholes who are living their dreams. Currently I lack the strength and constitution for suicide, but I know now that it is only a matter of time before I gain the courage to slit my wrists in the bathtub. I want to die, because at least in death I donâ€™t have to be aware of the fact that I am a complete and total failure.
