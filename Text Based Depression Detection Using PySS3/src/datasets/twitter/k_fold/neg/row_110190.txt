Iâ€™m L and i donâ€™t know what to doever since i was 12, iâ€™ve been majorly depressed. i most likely get it from my mom who deals with depression as well. my relationship with my mom has me even more fucked up because she left me as a baby to pursue her alcoholism. imaging growing up without a mom, itâ€™s so fucking hard. i donâ€™t even know my brother and sister cause of her. 

and i want to kill myself. but iâ€™m too afraid. iâ€™m afraid of hurting my dad and the two friends i have. my dad has a bad temper but i still love him, but iâ€™m afraid to leave my animals behind with him. iâ€™m scared of what would happen to the people around me. everything is just so painful. the meds and therapy donâ€™t work, i have no idea what to do anymore. i attempted suicide over the summer and that fucked my life up even more. hell, my dad was even making jokes about it while we were in the hospital. i just feel like no one truly cares about me. my main fear is that i, an ugly duckling, will never find someone. iâ€™m scared and sad and i just have no idea what to do anymore.
