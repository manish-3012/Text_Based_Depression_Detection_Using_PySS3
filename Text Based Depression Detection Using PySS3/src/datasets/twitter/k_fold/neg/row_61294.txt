For the last five years, Iâ€™ve stayed alive only for my younger brotherI have a lot of problems, that started in high school with a sports injury that is very painful every day. Iâ€™m already at my max dosage for pain meds. No treatment plan that hasnâ€™t yet been done - except surgery, but they wouldnâ€™t know what to operate on plus the risk of it becoming worse.

Anyways, after the first attempt I realized that my death might affect my brother more than I thought. We arenâ€™t *too* close despite living together since birth (our family is more like having roommates - we donâ€™t share our problems with each other or do normal family stuff).

But now, he is doing well in life. Girlfriend, back in college, working out. I think he could handle my absence. 

Is this still selfish? Besides to my parents, who I fucking hate and think is okay to manipulate us.
