im living on borrowed timeit's awkward being in my skin because i feel so much like an impostor. it's like one day i just woke up in a stranger's body and now i'm supposed to carry out its life as if it had been me all along.

it sucks being so dissociatted from my past self. its like being an actor without a script. the second and third acts of my life were thrown in the shredder because i forgot all about the first act. i have no setup or motivation or drive and i feel so lonely and lost and confused.

the universe used to throw me a bone once or twice but i blew all my chances and now i get nothing. thats fair enough, id just squander all my chances again anyway. i dont really deserve anything i do have and i feel bad the people who met me ever did.   


i dont want anyone to miss me. i just want to stop being.
