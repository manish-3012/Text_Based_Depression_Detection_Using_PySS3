Only redeemable quality.I'm trying so hard to not be so negative towards myself and I suppose it's working to some regard. Nothing really has changed in terms of my feelings and plans though. I still mess with the gun from time to time. I don't know - one step at a time I guess?

Anyway, one thing that I feel is essential to me still being here is getting stronger. I feel like that is my only redeemable quality - it's the only way I can *really* change how I look. Everything else about me if garbage - I've come to accept that. This is my only chance I have. If I can just get stronger then maybe my confidence and self-esteem can finally rise. Maybe I'll be good enough to talk to. Maybe I'll stop being so alone. It'll take hard work but I'm dedicated. I'm hoping if I sink enough effort into this and get on a routine going everyday after work I can change how I feel about myself. I don't know why I bothered to share this - I suppose to offer some support in that clinging to one thing can save you?
