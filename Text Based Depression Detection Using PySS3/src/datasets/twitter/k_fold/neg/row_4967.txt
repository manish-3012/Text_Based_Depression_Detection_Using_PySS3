Anyone else get an almost instinctual need to kill yourselfWhen I feel suicidal it feels like every cell in my body is screaming to go blow my brains out or OD or something. 

Does anyone else get this? 

Itâ€™s really bad right now. All I can do is just cry. But just a silent, constant cry because iâ€™m too tired to cry normally
