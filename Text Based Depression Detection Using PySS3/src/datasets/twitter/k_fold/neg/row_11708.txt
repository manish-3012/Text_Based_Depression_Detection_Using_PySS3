i inadvertently caused my guinea pigâ€™s death and i feel so fucking guilty i donâ€™t know if i can go on.this sounds frivolous and stupid but iâ€™m already depressed and one of my guinea pigs passed away. i love them all dearly. i left the lid on their cage open and my kitten went in and wanted to play. he caused my pig to have a heart attack. i wasnâ€™t home and i had to drive 40 minutes to get back to bury him. he was freezing cold by the time i got home. iâ€™m fucking sick. i canâ€™t fucking believe that i caused this. he would still be here if i hadnâ€™t fucked up. i cannot handle that i killed him. i took a life. a pure and innocent one. how the fuck am i going to go on having this on my conscience? iâ€™m vegan because iâ€™m so against hurting any animal. and i fucking killed my own baby. i want to curl up and fucking die. i want to swallow all of my pills and just be done. iâ€™d literally give my life for him to come back. jesus christ.
