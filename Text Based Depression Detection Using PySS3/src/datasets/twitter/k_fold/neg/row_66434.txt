It's all coming to a boil...I use this account as a way for me to be completely honest, even if it means I'm extremely hurtful to others. I'm not a bad person per se, but I do this anyway. And I've been banned from several subs. You can see why based on my previous comments.

I'm emotionally detached. And most of my relationships are based solely on logic rather than emotions. Even my relationship with my current gf is actually structured around a contractual obligation rather than love. Been together for a couple years now.

However...I realize that this is due to my own steadily declining mental health and I'm quickly coming to a severe breakdown. I honestly think, as soon as it happens, I'm gonna end this. 

Just need to take care of things so as to not be a burden on my family when I'm gone.
