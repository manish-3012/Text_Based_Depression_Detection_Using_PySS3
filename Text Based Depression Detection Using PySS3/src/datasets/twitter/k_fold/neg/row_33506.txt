I think this is it. This is the final stretch.I hate my job. It's hell. Well, it was. I think I lost it. Three days passed by and I no-call-no-showed on each. The whole time I was paralyzed in my bed in a vague sort of terror. I'm still in bed, this being day 4.

My phone would vibrate and I would jump. The voicemails started piling up, and my boss would text me, but I wouldn't open them because he has an iPhone and they have that "read" checkmark thing. I like my boss. I don't know why I did this. I always had a feeling this might happen though, knowing me.

I don't know what I'm going to do now. I've been learning some programming languages and finally feel like they make sense, but I have an apartment and bills to pay for. I don't know how I'm ever going to leave this bed. I don't really want to. There's no drive. I don't want to live anymore. For me, life isn't worth the pain. I don't know why it's so painful for me when others seem to be functioning well through the pain.

I don't know what my girlfriend is going to do after I'm gone. I have 2 months left tops. I have felt suicidal for most of my life, starting when I was about 10, but I have never followed through. Now it doesn't feel like a dare anymore. Just a glowing exit light in the basement of a burning building.
