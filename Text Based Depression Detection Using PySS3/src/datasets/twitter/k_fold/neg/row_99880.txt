Worthless, hopeless, and unloveable.I feel absolutely worthless. Hotlines donâ€™t do anything for me and I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even trying to prove to myself itâ€™s worth living anymore. Tired of therapy and medication not making a dent despite 25 years of trial and error. I just wish I could get death over with without pain or survival instinct holding me back. I feel so completely alone and even if a hundred voices told me they understand, Iâ€™d still feel my life is pointless. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even writing this. I just seriously want to die. Why canâ€™t I just do it? I really want to do it.
