How are you supposed to live happily?Like even thinking outside of my own personal problems and my own stupid little life - the world is falling apart. Humanity is *awful*, not only to each other, but to our *beautiful* planet... amazing animals being (cruelly) poached to extinction; factory farming and all of the horrors therein; intrictate and perfect ecosystems disappearing due to climate change... and the people in power, the ones with the money who can *really* make the changes... they don't care about anything except their money and power.

Add to that the hamster wheel of being the average human. I work a mediocre job so I can feed myself and my pets and pay my bills, and then be broke between paycheques. There's no room to even really *live*. Is this *living*? - working a meaningless job so I can pay bills and do laundry for the next ~40 years? I'll never be able to retire or escape, and that's just reality.

And the fact that I can even *think* of something like retirement would be a luxury for some people. How can we be so awful to each other? How can one live their day to day life happily, knowing that there are 2M+ people in concentration camps in China right now? - through worldwide racism and ignorance and cruelty? - knowing there's no real justice in the world, and that most of us are powerless to do anything about it? 

Even if I didn't loathe myself to the point of suicide, *why* would you want to live in this world?
