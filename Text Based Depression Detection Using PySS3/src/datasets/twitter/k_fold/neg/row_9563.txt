A train could either kill me or save my life......Since Monday I have been homeless. I am a 42 year old male and had been staying in an abandoned apartment but had to leave on Monday and I had nowhere to go. I have no friends nearby, no family and no money to arrange accommodation. I have been a member of suicidewatch for a couple of months now and found much support in helping others, listening and just talking to fellow depression sufferers who are feeling suicidal. I thought I had accommodation until mid December but the apartment I was in is being demolished and I was told last week that I had to leave on Monday. Thanks to the kindness of a stranger here I was able to afford a cheap room for three nights but last night was on the streets for the first time. I have one large suitcase with all my clothes and stuff in but no money to get a cheap room anymore while I try to get help from the council. I did not sleep last night through worry and I am writing this in the hope that someone can help because I have tried to kill myself before and am worried that I will try again if I find myself on the streets. I feel like there is hope because I'm told I will get an emergency benefit payment next week (probably Thursday) but until then, with no money, I will be on the streets. I have somewhere to stay, but it is over 50 miles away and I have no means of getting there. If I could get there I would be safe until the benefits payment comes in. So a train could either save my life by taking me to safety or kill me if I get so desperate that I throw myself beneath one. Is there anyone who can help me purchase a train ticket so I can  secure safe accommodation for the next week while the council sort my benefits and find me somewhere to live? Thank you for reading.
