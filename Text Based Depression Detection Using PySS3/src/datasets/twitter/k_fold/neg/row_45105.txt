My son is the only reason I donâ€™tThis year has probably been one of the worst years of my life. Iâ€™m incredibly unhappy and feel like a failure just about every day. Iâ€™m going through the motions but I just wish I didnâ€™t exist. If it wouldnâ€™t complicate things for my family I wouldâ€™ve already done it by now.  Sometimes I lay down at night and wish I wouldnâ€™t wake up the next morning. I tried therapy and I really didnâ€™t get anything out of it. Right now, I donâ€™t plan on doing anything to hurt myself because of my son. I love him more than anything and I donâ€™t want to see him hurt. But I fear Iâ€™m just one bad day away from making a plan and ending it. When I think about my son, I donâ€™t want to. Heâ€™s the only reason I want to keep on living.

Iâ€™m sure this paragraph wasnâ€™t structured very well. Iâ€™m just in a really bad head space and needed to get some of my feelings out there. I donâ€™t feel like I have anyone else in my life I could talk to about this stuff. Thanks for letting me vent. To anyone else in a similar situation, I wish you peace of mind and the strength to keep fighting the good fight for the ones you love.
