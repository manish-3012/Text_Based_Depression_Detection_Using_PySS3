At a low point in my life. I just want to talk / have someone listen.
On November 5th of 2012 my former best friend and I were arrested for possession of marijuana.  I got let off easy as it was not my vehicle nor my weed, but he got a 1500 dollar fine.  To this day he blames me for the entire encounter and has since then completely betrayed my trust, essentially leaving me without any friends.

But let's put the events of that day aside and focus on today.  I only have a couple of friends and they are all out of state and I rarely get a chance to speak with them.  My former best friend has recently blocked my number, my facebook, and my steam account.  He never gave me a reason why, which has been tormenting me for a month.

He and the rest of my former friends made a decision to exclude me and cut all contact with me.  They were all aware of my history of severe depression and anxiety.  They did not take this into consideration at all.  Not only that but I've dealt with heartbreak with an x-girlfriend fairly recently and my father turning into a drunkard that is threatening to kill people, and I  fear for his life.

Sometimes I just close my eyes and wish I would just die, as in the next time I walk outside I wish I would be struck down by lightning.  My pain isn't anywhere near comparison to some others, but I'm just slowly losing my will to live.  I sleep in everyday because my dreams will always be better than reality.  My previous reasons to not kill myself (family that possibly still cares) are  starting to disappear in favor of doing what I *really*, want, which is to no longer be a part of this fucked up world.
