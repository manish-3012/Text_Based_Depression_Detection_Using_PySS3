Crying again, helpClinically depressed since 13, now I am 22 and it never seems to get any better.

I feel suicidal every day and night, I wish that something would happen to me. 

I have a girlfriend (whom I felt has been the only one to ever understand me) hates me, and doesnâ€™t care about me (decided she wants a break) 

Recently graduate from university, and failed to secure a job despite hundreds of applications.

My friends have all vanished, I have nobody to talk to, nobody to see and I feel completely isolated and alone from the world.

Iâ€™m living at home and I feel so suffocated and trapped.

Every day seems to be a struggle, Iâ€™m a guy and find myself crying most nights because of how alone and shit I feel. My suicidal thoughts have been stronger than ever and I genuinely hate waking up in the mornings.

I feel I have nothing and honestly want it all to end.

I feel lost, alone and I hate myself constantly.

I donâ€™t know what to do, but all I know that I want is to not walk this earth anymore. 

Crying as I type this yet again, I just need help
