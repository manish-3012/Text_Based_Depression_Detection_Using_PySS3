Is the hotline really worth it?I won't get into too much detail about myself but the hotline is probably my last resort. I've read quite a lot of posts from this sub and the hotline is mostly depicted as being unhelpful or bad. I know there're probably good people working at the hotline but I just wanted to know if it's worth it. I really don't want to get into trouble like having the cops called on me. Please, any reply would be greatly appreciated.
