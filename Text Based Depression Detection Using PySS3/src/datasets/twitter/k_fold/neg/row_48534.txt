I don't think I want to live anymoreI don't know. It all just feels so pointless, I guess? It just feels the most logical--I'm not happy. I get up, go to school, go to bed, repeat, all whilst feeling like shit and anxious. At this point I just don't want to continue. I want it to stop, and I feel like I should start taking action to do so, rather than moping about in my own goddamn self-pity.
