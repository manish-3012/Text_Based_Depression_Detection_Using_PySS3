Why is suicide always lingering in my mind?Ever since I was 13, I started my downfall on my mental health without realizing it until 4 years later. Iâ€™m now 19 struggling with suicidal thoughts every single day, even though you could say I have a perfect life, a friend who cares, a decent family, and a decent job. I just donâ€™t know anymore, I just wish these thoughts could go away permanently, itâ€™s been fucking with me for so many years, and every day that passes, I get closer to acting upon these thoughts, and Iâ€™m fucking scared. I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. I cry every single night because of this, and feel like shit the morning after. I try to distract myself with games, and watching streams, but even thatâ€™s not really working as it just makes things even worse, and makes me reminisce of the past. Iâ€™m just done with this shit.
