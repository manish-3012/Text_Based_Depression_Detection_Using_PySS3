It just doesn't even seem worth talking about anymoreIt just really doesn't matter. Yes I've made detailed plans in the past and yes I still think about it every minute of every day but it doesn't even seem like it matters anymore. I'm become totally indifferent to even my most extreme and dangerous thoughts and I don't even flag them as problematic anymore it's just a normal thought that's in my head like anything else. 



I've had times where I had a day, place and method all decided and everything squared away, I've been to the hospital twice for it (one like a few weeks ago idk) and it's just whatever. Yeah I wanna die, o can't say for sure I won't do it, but it doesn't really matter to me. I don't talk to anyone about it anymore it just is what it is. I don't have a therapist and I don't see a point in getting one. I need a medicine refill and I just can't be bothered to pick it up. I couldn't care less about any of it.
