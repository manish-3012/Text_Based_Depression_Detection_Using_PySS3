I'm actually alone.This is so fucking stupid. I can't talk to him about anything. He doesn't believe me or trust me. He thinks he so fucking perfect. He said "don't say you want to die to me". I told him I wouldn't kill myself because of him. I said " you don't mean so much that I would kill myself because of you asshole." 

I don't think that was a lie. 

I finally got my phone back after so many tests and being at the doctor's for the past week. I feel so hot and sick. I threw up so much. I want to die guys. Honestly. I know you're out there and you feel alone too but I can't talk to someone I love. I can't tell them things. I fucked up the relationship and now they are looking for what they need else where. 

I want to die. Please I wanna kill myself so fucking much.
