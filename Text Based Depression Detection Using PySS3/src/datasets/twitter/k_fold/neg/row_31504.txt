UghI feel as if I have no need in this world. Iâ€™m just another 13 year old boy that gets picked on by the guys and is laughed at by the girls. Everyday I feel as if Iâ€™m getting uglier and uglier. Iâ€™ve never been in a friendship with a woman and Iâ€™m simply done. All of the women in my school complain that all boys care about is looks but then proceed to turn around and dismiss me as â€œjust another ugly boy.â€ Thatâ€™s only 1/2 the issue, for all of the boys expect nothing but â€œnot being a pussy.â€ So I get picked on all day for enjoying things such as physics, music theory, and geography.

I know this is desperate but Iâ€™m just looked for a bit of advice. Thank you.
