It's timeI've put off killing myself for 8 years and I'm at the point where if I don't die, things will get worse. I don't feel angry, sad, or hurt. I just know that what I say, what I do, and who I am, is completely void of any worth, and that to be cost effective, I should die ASAP. That's why tonight, I plan on going to a restroom at a park in my town with gasoline, and I will self-immolate. Note that I'm not doing this for a political or religious reason, but simply because the best thing to do is kill myself.

(Also, I know I upranked this post, it was an accident)
