FItâ€™s hard when you want to die so badly but you donâ€™t want to see anyone heartbroken. I plan my death every night. I push everyone away and try to get everyone to hate me. I feel pretty much like a liability as it is already but I donâ€™t want anyone to live with guilt of thinking itâ€™s their fault. I was planning on doing it tonight but I donâ€™t know how to avoid anyone elseâ€™s hurt.
