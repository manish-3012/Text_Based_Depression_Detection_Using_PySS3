How does the canadian psychiatric system work?My long-distance friend is 28 and I've been super worried about him. He's incredibly depressed and he has these emotional spikes where I'm worried that he'll do something rash. I can tell he's in a pretty severe spot. I'm on his speed dial list and I made him put a suicide hotline on his phone as well. I have his local police and hospital on my speed dial as well. 

He had psych treatment all throughout K-12 but since he got out of school he's been unable to get help, assuming that the public healthcare system didn't cover psych and that it'd be way too expensive. He doesn't have job and has been in and out of jobs probably because of this. He may have a few chemical imbalances (obviously I'm not a doctor, I'm just guessing)

He has a little girl he needs to stay alive for and his friendship to me means more than the world. I can't find consistent material: how can this guy get the help he needs?
