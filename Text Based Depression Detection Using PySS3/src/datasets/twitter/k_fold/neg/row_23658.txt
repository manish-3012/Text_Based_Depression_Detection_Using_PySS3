I feel my time is coming...My mind isn't right I'm always down. I just had 3 break downs. I am exhausted and burned out (I get pushed around n shit at home) noone ever reaches out to me only one friend does talk to me everyday but I stopped tell her when I have these days as I feel like a burden. I made a friend on reddit and it was awesome someone new in my life, today out of the blue she left me and blocked me.... i sleep only three hours a day cause even in my dreams I get told to kill myself.... 

I been broken for years (when and how my fiancee left me) 

I always wanted a dog (when I played with my cousin dogs I'm at peace) but im not allowed a dog at home. Im 30/M but where i live it is hell expensive to afford a place rent or own and Covid didnt help at all.

I honestly feel like killing myself will finally give me the peace I want, no more broken feeling, knowing I'm a failure and let down.... I am just extremely tired.

Thanks for reading....
