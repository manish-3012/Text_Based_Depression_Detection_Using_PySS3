giving myself time until next weeknext week i will end this shit. i'm so fucking tired of disappointing, boing a useless burden and a piece of shit friend. i live next to a train station so I will either fucking throw myself under a train or hang myself in my room. these thoughts are consuming me, nobody fucking loves me and my family never fails to remind me how pathetic and useless i am. if nothing changes in the next few days it's game over. life is absolute shit and i know that i will never change, so why make myself suffer?
