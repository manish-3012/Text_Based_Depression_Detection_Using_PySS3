Iâ€™m tired of living for other peopleThis is going to sound really selfish. I know people would miss me but Iâ€™m really starting to not care. Living a life that doesnâ€™t bring you anything is not a life Iâ€™m going to continue living. 

Anyone who would care about me being gone has done something to contribute to me getting to this point so no Iâ€™m sorry if I could not give any less of a shit if you get sad. Rather then helping me when I needed it you all just reminded that suicide is selfish. Iâ€™m sorry but thereâ€™s nothing left for me now.
