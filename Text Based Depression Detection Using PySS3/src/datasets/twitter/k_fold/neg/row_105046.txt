EverydayI haven't had a truly good day in 8 years. Everyday is a struggle to remain concious, I can't grasp the idea of living my life for longer than the next day. And then when I'm still here, I'm dissapointed. I'm 15 years old, and I've been cursed with my own mind. I've been a clinical major depressive and insomniac since I was 7, and have been labeled as "Existentially Depressed" for about 2 years. I have only a few friends, people that I don't even care for, but can't let go because they care for me. The only person I have ever cared about. my best friend, lives very far away, and is not mentally capable to help me or show the amount of support or affection that I need right now, so I have turned to the internet.
A brief synopsis of me;
I'm currently failing highschool, I'm a Jehovah's Witness who does not know whether or not I believe what I have been taught my entire life, no one to talk to that could fathom the demonic visions my head torments me with, feelings of isolation from my family, and I enjoy coffee and Spaghettios. 
I live everyday, wishing that at night, I could shut my eyes and dream about a better tomorrow, but there is always the nagging feeling that it will rain the next day. 
Or maybe I should just bite the proverbial bullet with my skull...
