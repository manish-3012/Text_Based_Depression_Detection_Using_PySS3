Every single belief I've ever had betrayed meI remember when I was younger, and I was 100% sure on my beliefs. Respect people, help people, obey my elders and teachers, study and be a good boy, don't drink, smoke or do drugs, forgive when others hurt me, ignore negative things and focus on the positive ones, etc.

Now... I don't know what's true or false, for almost all of those beliefs failed me. I'm a prime example that having good grades doesn't mean that you'll triumph in life.

If almost everyone I used to know moved on without me, or I kept losing friends (either by conflicts or just letting them fade away into acquaintances), then that must mean I'm in the wrong (or at least, I hold most of the blame).

Sometimes... I'm angry at my family. Because they raised me with old fashioned beliefs, and they overprotected me a lot when I was younger... But at least they didn't have malicious intentions,and I know that they tried to do their best.

Also... I'm angry at my old high school classmates. They did everything they wanted to me, as they bullied me, manipulated me, used me as a tool, ignored me or treated me like trash, and now I'm the one who needs to pick up the pieces, the one who's wrong when I say that the pain is too much, or get told that I act like a victim...

In this quarantine, I've realized that I'm more alone than I've ever been before... And I realized I lost most of my good qualities...

Before, I would have said that I would've been there for another person no matter what, but now... My fear of rejection is stronger than my wish to talk to other people...

If other people already moved on, and I went to apologize or to reconnect, they would probably think I'm making everything about me, thus I would make things even worse...

I'm the problem, it's a very easy answer. 

I'm the problem, I've always been the problem.

I was stupid, so stupid...
