I hate everyoneI donâ€™t find joy in anything. The only people I love are my husband and daughter, but my light is fading out. Iâ€™m so unmotivated to live. My family is a completely toxic mess and Iâ€™m stuck living with it. Everyone expects everything from me but I get nothing. I GIVE MY ALL TO EVERYONE EXCEPT MYSELF AND GET NOTHING IN RETURN. Yes theyâ€™ve done their duty to make sure Iâ€™m clothed and have a place to sleep but what the fuck does that even mean if Iâ€™m constantly emotionally and verbally abused. What does it mean when I canâ€™t relax in my own home without sky high anxiety or irritability that someone is gonna gripe at me. Iâ€™ve done better than my older brothers my entire life but itâ€™s still as if Iâ€™M the problem child. I am 20 years old and I take care of: my 2 elderly grandparents (late 80s), my mother (gremlin of an alcoholic), and my child (an angel) and husband. While also living and putting up with my asshole alcoholic druggie brother.
I take care of everyone but myself. I donâ€™t even care about myself anymore, I donâ€™t see a point of this fucked up life. Iâ€™ve never been this fed up. Iâ€™m not just sad but Iâ€™m really fucking angry. Why THE FUCK does no one else have to change?!? Why the fuck do I have to change how I feel and these people donâ€™t have to change their shitty behaviors. Iâ€™ve never wanted to hurt people so much, or myself (Iâ€™m not going to). I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can tolerate living a life like this.
