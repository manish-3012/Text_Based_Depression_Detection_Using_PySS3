Nobody will ever love meAll of the relationships I've ever had were just internet relationships, and none of them ended well. The one person I had a crush on, who was my best friend, already found someone else that they are in love with. I feel like I will never have anyone. I'm transgender and I have social anxiety too, which doesn't help either. I just want someone to love me but obviously that's never going to happen.
