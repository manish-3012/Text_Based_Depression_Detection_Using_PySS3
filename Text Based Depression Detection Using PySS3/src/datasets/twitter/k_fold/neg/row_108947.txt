I'm not going to live to 16...Hi. You might remember me from a post I made on this sub a while back about plans of ending my life, and how things ended up relatively ok. I wish that were still the case now, because I'm shifting back down into a horrid, terrible mindset and my life has totally fucked me over, plain and simple. 

I guess I'll start off by saying I don't plan on doing anything tonight. I don't think I'll do anything tomorrow, though I very likely will make an attempt sometime this week, and I can guarantee I will try multiple times before my birthday, on October 31. For those of you who aren't familiar with me, I'll give you a little summary of who I am because it might help in understanding why I want to be off of this earth so fucking badly. I'm Lilia, or Lily, and I'm a 15 year old transgender bisexual girl who suffers from severe anxiety and depression. I've tried to kill myself about 5 times already, but failed all of those times due to mistakes in setup or being almost caught. I have no hobbies. No talents. No future. I've been on hormone therapy for about a year now and I can't say I look good in the slightest. I still feel grotesque and my body sure as hell doesn't lighten that feeling.

I want to die. I really want to be off of this earth. I lost all of my friends - they got sick of my behavior, I'm anxious and depressed and they couldn't stand that; and I can't say it wasn't for good reason. I stopped going to my school for the bit that was left and did my finals at home to avoid the vonit inducing panic attacks day to day I felt going to school every day following this incident, and I was left in a state of total loneliness. I have no shoulder to cry on. Anyone I talked to from the last time I've posted I pushed away due to anxiety and downright fear of making and ruining another connection with someone. I don't remember what having friends feels like... it feels like something I used to do years ago back when I was someone else. I feel empty. Like a husk of whatever pile of shit I used to be. It's better to eat rotten food and live than eat nothing and die, right? I've gotten to a state where my old self, which I can compare to rotten food as it's disgusting and unhealthy but not totally a lost cause, is actually better than my now entirely hollow empty self. I need friends. I need something but I don't know how to do anything anymore. 

That brings me to the topic I originally intended to discuss: I am going to kill myself soon. I don't want to hurt anybody but I can't think of any way my life would start to gain meaning. I tried to pursue drawng but failed due to hatred for my own work. If I can't do that, which I've always admired and wanted to do for a long time, I doubt I can do anything fulfilling. Life isn't for everyone. I'd be better as a corpse fertalizing the ground than whatever the fuck I am now. I don't know where else to turn but reddit once again. I'm sorry to bother you all because of my own pathetic self. I should just fucking rot. I don't get afraid of anything anymore because death is a comforting thought. 

Thanks for any advice.
