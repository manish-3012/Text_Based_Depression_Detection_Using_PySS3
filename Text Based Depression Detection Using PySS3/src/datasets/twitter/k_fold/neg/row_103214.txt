my spirit feels completely brokento be honest the fact that iâ€™m even writing this scares me, but iâ€™ve never been this low before. i woke up with this feeling of sick dread in the pit of my stomach like i just received bad news, and it just wonâ€™t go away. iâ€™m trying to distract myself but all i want to do is cry or sleep. i donâ€™t hang out with my friends as much because i donâ€™t want to be seen. i want to disappear completely. 

i was in a place recently where i was doing okay. i felt like i was slowly building myself back up, then someone i trusted really hurt me. itâ€™s been months and the pain wonâ€™t go away. it makes me feel so so dumb. the fact that i could let someone else almost control my well being, or at least cause pain to it. but it was a friendship i cherished and now itâ€™s over. i had to end it, but i still think of them all the time. doesnâ€™t help that i see them at work once in a while, and they act like everything is okay. makes me feel like they never cared about me at all. i almost donâ€™t want to get close to anyone ever again.. like the cycle will keep happening until i canâ€™t take it. 

iâ€™m starting to feel numb. iâ€™m becoming angry and cynical and cold. i hate it so damn much because this hopeless feeling is something i never thought iâ€™d get to. i said i could handle it all on my own yet here i am wondering why i canâ€™t just get into a car accident or something so i wouldnâ€™t have to hurt the people around me, but i would also just be gone. but i canâ€™t tell anyone. i donâ€™t want to put that burden on them. and my mother would be so angry and so disappointed. 

sometimes i think back to when i was a happy kid and just sob at where the hell i went wrong. why canâ€™t i handle the smallest things anymore? why do i almost want to stay here in the dark? i know itâ€™s not healthy. but iâ€™m so exhausted and it just seems easier to let myself go. i really donâ€™t know what to do anymore. this sick sick feeling wonâ€™t go away. i hear myself telling all my friends how wonderful things can be if they just keep going, and i believe it, but i canâ€™t make myself see it for my own life. itâ€™s not the worlds fault. itâ€™s just me. i personally canâ€™t handle it and i donâ€™t want to be here anymore. my heart feels tired and i wonder if someday itâ€™ll come to the same conclusion as me and just stop beating to save me the trouble. 

i donâ€™t know how i got here. i donâ€™t want to be. but i also donâ€™t feel like trying anymore. it all feels very pathetic of me. i canâ€™t see myself getting older, i just have the sinking feeling iâ€™m going to die young and soon. but i am still afraid.
