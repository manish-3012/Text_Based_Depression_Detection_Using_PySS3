Help me move in the right direction.I understand that I need to be alive to feel relief. I think I can wrap my head around that. But... how? How do I actually get it? 

I want to get a job. I want to get into Design school. I want to act again. I want to get over all my past issues and toss out the skeletons in my closet, and grow my hair out and adopt a puppy and knit a blanket and learn Chinese. I want so badly to magically jump one year ahead in time, to this place where I'm happy and productive and have all these things going already. I look at how far away it all is, and how hard it's going to be, and how exhausted I am, and I just tremble. I feel so discouraged, and that stops my progress, and I waste day after day not getting any closer. Each day I fail, it makes me feel shittier, and so the shitty feelings make more days failures, and I don't know how I'm going to get my momentum going the other way again.

When I look at the facts in the present, I want to give up and end it. When I look at the future, I want to be alive, and be there so badly. They are two different worlds. How do I get there?
