exhausted. every year i am becoming a worse person. trying so hard. no progress.i've spent my whole life hustling and trying to do things right. coming from a very fucked up family (physical and sexual abuse, mental illness), i always knew i'd have to try harder than people around me to achieve the same things. so i've worked my ass off. got a college degree while working full time and getting no financial aid. $30,000 in debt but supposedly on my way to a decent job. except there are none...trying to get my foot in the door places and by some miraculous turn of fate i make less money now at 25 than i did at 20...when i look at my folder of cover letters I want to vomit. i have a lot to offer, hard and soft skills, but nobody is really interested. going over expenses with my partner, and we consolidate every few months, the bills have racked up so much so fast that I'm never even going to be able to make a dent. I have three jobs and they all suck. there's stuff i'm passionate about but i'm too busy working my shitty jobs to ever get a chance to enjoy my life. i don't even have a life right now. what's the fucking point? I feel like i'm in a horrible computer simulation. every choice is the wrong choice. im in a nonstop cycle of unsatisfying experiences and it's all leading me nowhere, it's totally futile. wanting the simulation to end. ready for game over.  
i get happy thinking about the relief of not having to continue these pointless exercises. no more struggling. finally some peace.
