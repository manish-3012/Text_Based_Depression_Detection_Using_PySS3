I am such a FailureI can't  do anything  right,  can't  protect  my loved ones, can't  even care  for myself  ... Hell I don't  want to care for myself,  I don't  fucking care if I loose my apartment,  I already lost my electricity  and have more debts than I can ever repay bc I rather spend my money  to make others happy , They deserve it more than I do. It's just a wast spending anything on myself,  I don't  fucking deserve  this life,  useles  waste of space...  I am just taking away resources  better spent  on others bc I can't  do anything right and even the things I might be able to give back I simply can't do bc I am not strong enough.... 
I just want this useless ecistance  to end and someone more capable  to take my place 
Don't  even have the strength  of trying anymore.
