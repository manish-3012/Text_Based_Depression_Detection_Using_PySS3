I want to be selfish. I want to be done.I don't want to be in this reality anymore. I don't trust anyone. I feel like no one wants me or wants to put up with me. I feel so unwanted and alone and sad. My aunt who was like a second mother growing up died and her funeral was today. My wife's former lover died of a heroine overdose. One of our best friends recently took advantage of her too and I just got over being sick for 10 days. I feel like I have no friends. Everything is negative...the only reason I haven't killed myself is my wife, my kids, and my mom. I feel like my wife isn't as there for me as she should be right now and she makes me feel like a burden....and I just don't want to be today. I don't want anything but to not feel any more today. I want to be done. I'm trying to hang in there for my mom and for my kids....and yet part of me feels like they'd be better off. My wife and I are poly. She'd just find someone else. Someone to replace me with....someone more stable and more financially able. 

There are few times I have felt so low.
