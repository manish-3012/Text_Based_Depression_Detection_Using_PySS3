M29 parents labeled me as a total failureI'm on the brink of calling off a wedding which involves a lot of guests. The news has been spread, lots of money has been spent, but conflicts between my fiancee and my parents keep on rising to the point both parties cannot take it anymore. 

I'm gonna lose a person I really loved so much, maybe my parents are gonna hate me forever, I'm gonna lose a lot of money and probably gonna lose my job as well. Not to mention I have to inform my relatives and friends that my wedding is cancelled.

I don't see any point in living anymore. I gave a lot of thought about this, I even prayed to God every time I'm about to make decisions. But ending my life seems to be the best solution.

I once tried to cut my wrist but failed. Probably because I was too scared of dying and didn't cut deep enough. Now I'm not sure whether I'm gonna use toxic or rope to end my life. It's just too painful to carry on.

I wish I could give more to the people around me and to the world. But I don't have enough energy left. Thanks for reading.
