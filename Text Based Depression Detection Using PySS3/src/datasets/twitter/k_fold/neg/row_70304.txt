Why play a zero-sum game anywayIt's a zero-sum game as in we only do things because we convince ourselves they're worthwhile, but they aren't, because nothing is. There's no meaning unless we make one. Only reason things are enjoyable painful funny sad annoying extraordinary etc. is because we're wired to perceive them that way. Might as well let go of all that. There's no inherent value in nothing out there. One could easily delude himself and make a random small thing the most important thing in the world and find all meaning he wants in it. So why bother chasing the primitive ones imposed on us. Sorry for rambling, it's hard to express my thoughts in english.
