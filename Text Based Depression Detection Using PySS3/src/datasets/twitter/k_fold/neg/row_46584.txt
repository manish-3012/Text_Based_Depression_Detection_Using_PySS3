Every thought hurtsEvery night I look at my belt and wonder when I'm gonna be seen hanging from it. I get closer and closer. I just keep it around my neck and just keep it there until I am between life and death. I don't want death to be a comfortable feeling. And when I tell mu mother she pulls me out of my room pouring holy water on me and says prayers in Italian. Like what the fuck? I don't want to feel this way anymore. I want to be able to live life without the long for death. I'm not one to talk about my true feelings. I'm glad I can just get this out now.
