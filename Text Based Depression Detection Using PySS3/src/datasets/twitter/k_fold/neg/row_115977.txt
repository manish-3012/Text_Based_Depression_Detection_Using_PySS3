How do people care so littleRight so the other day I electrocuted myself, classic metal in a plug socket trick, clearly nothing much happened as Iâ€™m still here to type this but what really bothered me is the situation. It was in the middle of a chemistry lesson, and few people even noticed let alone cared, people always say â€œplug sockets killâ€ so what if I had fucking died in front of them. Would they care then? And if your wondering the teacher didnâ€™t even notice until one girl shouted at me for knocking her arm whilst I was you know, getting electrocuted.
