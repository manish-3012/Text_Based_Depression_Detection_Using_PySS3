I think suicide is not that bad for me after all.I am not a great person and I lie to people so they won't know about the wrong things that I've done (like skipping college for example). Also, I still want to create my own game but I realised that even if I will create it, its going to be my first game ever that nobody will want to play because its my first game and its a pretty shitty one. I should just die I guess.
