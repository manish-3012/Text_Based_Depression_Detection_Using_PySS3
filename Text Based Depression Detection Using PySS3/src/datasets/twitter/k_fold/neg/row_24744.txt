I don't have any reason to still be on Earth.I just feel so hopeless, worthless, and a waste of space. I can't get my shit together in life. I can't move forward, I can't move back. I'm in limbo Hell and it's sucking the life out of me.

I just want to die and be done with it. Just fall asleep and never wake up.
