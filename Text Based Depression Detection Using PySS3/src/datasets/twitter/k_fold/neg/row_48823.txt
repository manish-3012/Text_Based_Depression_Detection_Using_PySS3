What should I do?Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymore. Iâ€™m only 14 but I just find my life to be pointless and meaningless. I just feel like Iâ€™m a burden to everyone around me, and that my parents are just wasting their money on me. When I feel depressed and hopeless I just cry and canâ€™t fall asleep for hours. I tend to think about killing myself too often but Iâ€™m afraid of how it will impact my parents. The more I think about this stuff I tend to eat less to the point where I barely eat anything some days. I just find life to be hard and I just canâ€™t seem to find the motivation to keep on living. Iâ€™m afraid to talk to people about this problem I even had a hard time just posting this. I just donâ€™t know what to do with my life anymore.
