Can't do this anymore.I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of being blamed and not being able to be happy. I'm tired of having no one to run to or talk to. I'm tired of ending up alone because I refuse to be used or manipulated. I'm so tired of feeling stupid. I'm just so damn tired. I just want to die. I really really just want to cut myself and take more pills or just shoot myself in the head. I'm so tired.
