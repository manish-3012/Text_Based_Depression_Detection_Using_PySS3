What's the point/My life is shit. My family is shit. I have dreams of someone killing them just so I can be free of them. They fi\]ucking hate me. They bully me. They say I don't do shit and I do a lot. My dad left when I was born and his side of the family hates my guts. If I met them, they'd try to kill me and I'd let them fucking kill me. At least that way, I'll be rid of this hellhole of a shitty-ass life. I hide my depression from everyone because they'd "try to help" and I don't want no "antidepressants" or any of that shit, I just want out of this shit life. I HATE EVERY-SINGLE-FUCKING-THING!
