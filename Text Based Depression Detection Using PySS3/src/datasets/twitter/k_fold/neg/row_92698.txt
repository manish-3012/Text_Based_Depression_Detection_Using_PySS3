i want to do it but im too scaredi dont have anything else to live for. my family doesnt care about me, my friends manipulate me, school is pointless and making everything worse. i havent felt genuinely, properly loved within my social circle for a decade, and im 17. i cant even do things that can make me feel some small degree of joy any more. for the last 5 years everyones been ignoring my depression, my anxiety, and more recently my disordered eating, so ive forced myself into being a husk of the person i used to be so that they can still pretend im normal. i cant tell anyone. they treat my issues like they barely exist. ive tried to but nobody ever understands because their lives are preoccupied with better, happier things and me conforming to their idea of health is more important than helping me. all they tell me is to 'be happy'. i want nothing else than to die but im a fucked up bitch whos scared of the pain and the subsequent oblivion. i dont know what to do anymore
