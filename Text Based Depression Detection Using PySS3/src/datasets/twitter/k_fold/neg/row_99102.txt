Me again.I have the plan of what I should do. But part of me knows I might not have the courage to call the ambulance. And I'll just let myself die. Maybe its better. Maybe I shouldn't waste the NHS time and money. Maybe no one would want me to survive. I wanna do it. I wanna swallow every pill I have rn and bleed out whilst I'm dying.
