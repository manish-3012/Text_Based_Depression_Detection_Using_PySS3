I've lost my sense of selfEvery day I feel like my life isn't my own. I had purpose at some point and my life did feel like it was mine to live. But now... I wake up, groggy and dissonant.  I try different forms of self-help, therapy, meditation, etc... but nothing works. I don't recognise myself in the mirror anymore. I don't like the person I see. I go to sleep in tears... Sometimes with reason -- I can sort of get a grip on my feelings. Other times I can't figure it out and I'm just crying because I don't want to do any of this anymore. I want to sink into nothingness.   
Am I a coward for wanting to leave this world behind? Am I a coward for not doing it already? 

I'm writing this and doing my very best to get through it. I'm avoiding the water works because my fiancÃ© is on Zoom on the other side of some ocean I can't remember the name of, on her phone doing whatever she feels like, and I don't want to let on that this is where my heads at. 

A part of me truly wants to stick around. But I don't really know where that part of me is lately.. and I know that sentiment doesn't belong to the man in the mirror.

I want to ask for help. 

Someone?
