Fuck Bipolar Disorder. Just let me die.Some days I wake up and it feels like a surreal experience. I ask why I have to get out of bed and participate in the day. I ask why I matter at all. Why does my one life, among billions means anything? I'm a 35 year old doctoral student and just quit my job at a university. I am preparing to end my life. I'm Bipolar II and on the Autism Spectrum. Unfortunately, I worked for a homophobic Muslim woman who did not take my accommodations request from HR very well. Ever since she received them a few months ago (I've been at this job for over a year now.) she has made working here a living hell for me. She has spread things about me and now my colleagues and even my supervisors, who were fine with me before, are now rude and distant. I feel so alienated, disrespected, and worthless. I'm not the best socially, so I tend to be introverted and only speak up when I am sure what I'm saying is socially acceptable and necessary. She recently filled out my yearly evaluation late, and gave me a horrible review. I have never been reprimanded, given a verbal or written warning, or asked to do anything different that what I have been doing. It was shocking and I cried during the evaluation, which seemed to irritate her more. She told me I was too emotional and I shouldn't bring that into work. I have only cried once before, when she made me join a Zoom meeting with her, turn on my camera, and tell her what was "wrong with me" because I had been a minute or two late to a few meetings, literally one or two minutes. My supervisors tried to comfort me in a way, by telling me about all the good things I have been doing there. My manager, the one causing all of this, told me later she spoke with them about praising me when they should have focused on my "growth and improvement" and not on my successes. After she received my letter of resignation, she called me and was very happy, and simply told me to bring my equipment back. She immediately told the rest of my team and no one really seemed to care. She also put in my resignation to HR about an hour later and my job was posted the next day. I feel like people disliking me is just normal at this point. I have a wonderful fiancÃ© who would be devastated if he were to lose me, but I am so unhappy. I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel lost and disconnected. I feel like this isn't real. I'm not real and I want to end it.
