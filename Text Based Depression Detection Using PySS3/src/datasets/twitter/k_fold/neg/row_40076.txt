Thinking about death but still wanting friends Dealing with agoraphobia, depression and social anxiety. Not working at the moment so plenty of time to communicate. I don't play video games or watch much Netflix. I have nothing against either it's simply that I have lost interest. Pretty intensive when it comes to friendships or relationships from the beginning. Not a strong small talk connoisseur but it you want deep and long lasting conversation I am the guy for you. I am an avid reader and enjoy listening to podcasts as well. I am not a problem solver but rather a problem supporter who will always give my best to help you through whatever is going on.

I find that helping people keeps me from the dark places of my mind but it's still hard to live every day.
