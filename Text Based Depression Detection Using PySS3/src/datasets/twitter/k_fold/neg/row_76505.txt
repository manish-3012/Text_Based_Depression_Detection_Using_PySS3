Not Pessimistic, Just Realisticâ€ªI hate when people try to convince others that thereâ€™s a way out of every situation. Itâ€™s usually those who have never gone through a single hardship. Itâ€™s like they live in a bubble. They donâ€™t understand that it all depends on your circumstance. You canâ€™t create your own reality, you can only live with it. Some things you just canâ€™t change.â€¬ Antidepressants can only do so much, and sometimes they make your life even worse. Itâ€™s not the same as taking painkillers for a broken leg. Yes, youâ€™re numb but you still having the feeling. People who have never gone through depression or suicidal ideation shouldnâ€™t speak on such topics unless theyâ€™ve felt it firsthand. If someone decides to end their life because they canâ€™t deal with the pain anymore, then it is their right!
