Every morning, I see myself dyingEvery morning when I wake up, the first thoughts in my head are how my day is gonna go, and all I can think about is how I donâ€™t have to do it if if I blew my brains out. The thought of dying is such a huge comfort to me now. I used to be scared of what it would feel like, I used to worry about my pets and friends Iâ€™d be leaving behind, I used to think of all the reasons I should stay.  But nothing matters to me any more. Iâ€™ve been fading away for almost 8 months now. Iâ€™ve done everything I could to help myself and Iâ€™ve read all of the blogs and websites about reasons to live and how to want to live and how to be happier and manage depression. Iâ€™ve gone to counseling, Iâ€™ve tried the pills, Iâ€™ve done the programs. I feel like I just post on Reddit all the time because no one in my real life cares, and every day is harder to even care about myself
