Despite my life being pretty awesome on the outside, I deeply deeply want to dieThis is my first throwaway. Thank you for listening and please understand that I lead kind of a queer life (you'll see).

I have been terribly depressed since around age 14 (age 20 now), along with some anxiety problems, including a phobia. Though I feel the depression acutely almost every day, I also understand that on the outside my life is awesome: I go to college, have my own place with some friends, am in a great and non-monogamous relationship with a really quality guy (he works with children), and I have a pretty good-paying job in my future field. I have only seriously contemplated suicide a couple of times, and I think the last time was in high school, though I don't remember why.

Two years or so ago, I came out to myself as transgender. Since then, I have been slowly socially transitioning, and the result has mostly been positive and has helped me feel more comfortable with myself. Most of my friends now accept me as a regular guy, including my boss and coworkers. However, the day-to-day grind of feeling deeply uncomfortable with my body really wears me down, and the few reactions of disgust or disapproval, depending on who they come from, can really really really hurt. Just had to deal with this today: a friend who I thought I could trust very politely told me that she is "conservative about these sorts of things," pretty much meaning that she thinks transgender people are somehow "wrong" and I am actually devastated. Random strangers being dicks just make me feel disdain, but when friends do it I wonder what other thoughts about my gender people are hiding.

Around October of '12, I began to get sick of my depression. I was bored of letting it define me, disappointed that I often did not have the energy to do my schoolwork, and it hurt my boyfriend's feelings that I slept all the time instead of spending quality time with him. I went to go see a doctor, who prescribed me Zoloft, and I have been taking a relatively low dose since. It helps my anxiety a LOT, but it has barely touched my depression. Recently-ish I fucked up remembering to take it, but it was a catch 22 because my sex drive came back (and the lack thereof had been causing relationship stress). I am back on it again but I'm probably gonna need to go back to the doctor so she can help me experiment more to figure out what's right for me.

This weekend was really hard: my boyfriend was out of town, so on Friday I slept alone which was nice because I sleep like a starfish but also really lonely, and the next night my friend and sometimes lover A slept over, which was very enjoyable. That same night, though, I was forced to deal with my phobia in a big way, and so as not to look bad in front of my lady friend, I chose to try to swallow my multiple panic attacks for the most part. She left in the morning and later in the day Boyfriend came home from his trip, and we immediately got into a huge fight about irrelevant stuff. I guess when I say it like that it doesn't sound very stressful, but this is also on top of housemate drama, a complete lack of energy, new work responsibilities, etc.

For the first time in a very long time, I find myself thinking things like, "Well, I don't have to do this homework because tomorrow I'll be dead" or "I wonder who they're gonna get to do this at work after I'm gone." Sunday night I was very very serious about curling up in the snow and freezing to death (I live in the most Canadian part of America), but the weather was actually too warm.

To deal with these feelings, I like to get new piercings. I can feel pain in a way that is constructive (instead of just the usual self-harm), I make my body more like I want it to be, and I have something to keep track of and take care of as it heals. I got two new piercings Monday (numbers five and six) and it calmed me down for only like, five hours. So basically it didn't help like it has in the past.

I managed to type this out pretty calmly and everything, but I am so desperate here. I really don't want to hurt the people who love me, but I really really can't go on living. I have absolutely no energy, have been doing the bare minimum in classes (when I even go), and have really been straining my relationships with my constant bouncing between clingy neediness and outbursts. I sleep more than 12 hours on most days, but always feel too completely exhausted to function. After six years with maybe only 3 months total of "remission," I feel completely hopeless about the possibility of ever feeling happy or even normal. Over the 7 years that I've been depressed, I learned some ways of dealing with it, but none of them are working. I'm just totally at a loss of what to do.
