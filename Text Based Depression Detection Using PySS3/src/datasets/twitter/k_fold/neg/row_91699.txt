you know what's funny?how people fucking tell you shit that they "care" but the truth is they only "care" once you're dead. you people who are supposed to make me feel safe fucking make me feel worse about myself and i fucking hope that all of you feel guilty and lost and so fucking horrible because the damage you've inflicted onto me can never be undone. i fucking hope you feel guilty because the amount of times i've cried because of all the bullshit words all of you told me is nothing to that. i fucking hate all of you
