I failed todayI guess I'm posting here because I know I'll try again. I drove my car off a bridge today and managed to walk away from it. Of all the things I'm terrible at dying doesn't seem to be one of them. I'm not going to list all the things I'm bad at. You saying "you don't suck at such and such" isn't going to suddenly make me not be terrible at it. I just want to know how some of you find the strength to keep going.
