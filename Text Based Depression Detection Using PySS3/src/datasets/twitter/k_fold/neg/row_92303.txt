The Story of This YearIâ€™m a 22y/o male and Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression and anxiety since before I can even remember. I was put into the foster care system in Australia when I was 3 and stayed there till I was 18. Thankfully I didnâ€™t cycle a lot like most kids and I found a foster family who I now call my real family. 

Iâ€™m having a really difficult time at the moment, this year had been really really tough. Iâ€™m in my 4th year of uni and Iâ€™ve failed the last 2 years because of my mental state, Iâ€™ve been seeing counsellors and doctors and Iâ€™m on medication. 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with Bipolar II and now been medicated for that. But I just need to vent so Iâ€™m going to talk about my year and howâ€™s itâ€™s been the worst and best year Iâ€™ve had in a very long time. 

So the best year started on the 31st of December 2018. I was at college by myself over Christmas and in news years eve I wanted to spend it with someone because I couldnâ€™t with my foster family. I invited 2 friends that were in my town at the time who came over. We sat and chatted for an hour and they started to get bored, my mate asked if he could invite a friend over to join us, I agreed. This friend ended up bringing a fair few people, I would say around 10. Me being anxious as all shit over everything in life, freaked out and stayed silent. I ended up having a few drinks and with each one became more confident and less anxious. Turns out these people were pretty amazing, I made a friend who was 7ft tall and he was honestly the big friendly giant. I made another friend who Iâ€™ll call Max, we hit it off straight away and Iâ€™ve never connected so well with someone. We instantly became best friends, he stayed over my place for an entire month until we decided to move out with 2 of our other friends, one of those who was homeless and was desperately trying to find someone to live. 

A little back story before we get rocky, I lived at a university where at the time our â€œflatâ€ (8 bedroom house sorta thing) was located on campus. All 8 people were and still are my closest friends. They are a very important part of my life and they mean the world to me. They are very honest people and they told me before moving that I shouldnâ€™t, that it wouldnâ€™t work out and that the people Iâ€™m moving in with arenâ€™t who I think they are and it wonâ€™t work out. Me being stubborn ignored all their warnings. I have this bad habit of meeting someone and when I get along with them as well as I did with Max, I latch on and I just want to hang and spend all my time with them and it always ends up ending badly. 

Back to the story, I ended up moving in with these 3 people. It was bloody fantastic, I had the most amazing time with them. We would spend all night and all day talking and having fun and it really did mess with my studies and sleep. I dropped studying all together and ignored it and my insomnia got worse. On May 21st we planned on going out, we drank a whole lot and went to the club. My house mates and I decided to take MDMA which we had bought the same day. There was 2 capsules and a rock. Now Iâ€™ve done drugs before, I do it recreationally, when Iâ€™ve taken MDMA Iâ€™ve only ever had it in capsules so I asked to have the 2 capsules just because it was familiar and I get very anxious trying new things. Well, we all took our share, went on the dance floor and thatâ€™s all I remember. I woke up in hospital the next day and the doctor spoke to me about what was in my system. The capsules ended up being MDMA, ketamine and ice. My body couldnâ€™t handle the adverse reaction and basically shut down. The doctor send me home and I had the biggest come down that Iâ€™ve ever had in my life. It got around that I had taken the drugs and I got into a lot of trouble, I got banned from the uni bar and I was ashamed to show my face at uni and the colleges so I actively avoided it for about a month. During this month Iâ€™ve never been so miserable. I cried everyday, I never left my room, I avoided everything and everyone. There was parties in my house and I just laid in my room and cried while the world went by. It may sound ridiculous but I havenâ€™t had a great life and the smallest things get to me. 

After the month, I kinda got over the overdose and went about my days. Life started getting a bit better again, there were more smiles and laughter. One of my house mates during the time we lived together was terrible with money. He gets paid at 12:30am every Sunday and goes out every Saturday night so usually he spends all his pay as soon as it comes in on drinks. Because of this, my room mates and I had to cover his rent and food throughout the week. This lasted for a few months. Things started getting worse with the guy, he gets very angry and started masking his problems with drugs- specifically weed. He would go out everyday and get really high so he didnâ€™t have to deal with his problems, my room mates and I were getting very broke trying to support him and it got to the point we couldnâ€™t anymore. He never paid us back after countless promises and he never did anything around the house. One night we got into a massive fight and I kicked him out, we stayed friends and we spoke all the time and we learnt it was better this way. We became closer not living together because we didnâ€™t have the tension and added stress. 


(Iâ€™m sorry this story jumps a lot, thereâ€™s so much content that I canâ€™t really focus) 


I didnâ€™t realise till after I kicked him out how much I spent time with him. My other two room mates were sleeping together since the start and they would spend 60% of their time in bed. Because of this, the room mate I kicked out and I got really close because we only had each other. After kicking him out I was very lonely. I donâ€™t deal well with being alone and I constantly need company so I feel okay. The male room mate out of the 2 that were sleeping together ended up finding another girl he liked and he spent a lot of time with her; which left me and the girl to get very close. Now all these people I consider my close friends, but the girl and I became really close and spent a lot of time together. We were just friends, and thatâ€™s the way I liked it. We would spend every night chatting and laughing and having a grand old time while my other roommate was off with the girl he liked. The girl he liked who studies nursing ended up leaving for placement. She had to move away for 6 weeks to study so he spent more time with us at the flat. I started getting more and more depressed, just little things getting to me and stuff playing on my mind. One of my biggest stresses were bills and money. Our first electricity bill was close to $700 and that was for one month. I was so stressed about the next one that it made me really depressed. About 5 months after the first bill, our second one was due. About a month before I knew we would receive it I tried my hardest to start looking for ways I could pay it in case it was as high as the first. I desperately were looking for jobs, I started thinking about selling my stuff and I couldnâ€™t think of anything. So I came to the conclusion that I might not be able to pay it, and that if I could, when the next bill came out I would have to do this all over again. So I decided it might be best for me to move back to college. I ended up telling my room mates and they werenâ€™t happy about it, we got into a fight and upset me so much. I was so stressed and sad that I thought I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. So I went to my medicine draw and grabbed every pill I could find and took them. It ended up being about 70 different pills in total. After doing it I freaked out and called my house mates, they both had left to go to a party. The girl came home and rushed me to hospital while the other one stayed at the party to get drunk. The girl was very supportive and stayed with me the entire time at the hospital, my other room mate, Max, didnâ€™t visit me at all. I considered Max a brother too me, I loved him dearly and I tried to do whatever I could for him to show how much I appreciate him. When he didnâ€™t visit me it really got to me and upset me. We spoke and he was angry and upset with me for doing what I did, so I left the house for over a week and stayed at the flat where I used to stay. I waited for him to calm down and I went home, I didnâ€™t want him to be angry and upset with me so I thought I would give him the space. 

I started seeing counsellors and psychiatrists. My counsellor helped me quite a bit, she was the first counsellor Iâ€™ve actually enjoyed talking too and looked forward to seeing. We worked through my problems and she came to the conclusion that leaving the house would be for the best and she supported my decision of going back to college, so I did. After I told my room mates I was doing this they hated me. They didnâ€™t want to speak to me or see me. They said some pretty nasty things to me, and I back to them. 

I lost my two best friends, and my brother. 

Itâ€™s been just over 2 months since Iâ€™ve moved out and Iâ€™m still miserable about it all. I think about them everyday and I see all their Snapchatâ€™s together and it ruins me because we used to do everything together. Because I left my lease Iâ€™m in debt up to my eyebrows. I had to come up with a bond and 2 weeks rent for my college and I have to come up with money for the bills towards the house that I still havenâ€™t paid, and unable to afford. Iâ€™ve taken out 3 loans since leaving which has put me through further debt and I donâ€™t know what to do.

The last 3 weeks have been the worst for me. I havenâ€™t stopped crying, Iâ€™ve been using drugs and alcohol to mask my responsibilities and now everything has creeped up on me. I canâ€™t stop reflecting about everything this year and the pros and cons and itâ€™s hard to see the positive ahead. Iâ€™ve lost my dog, my 2 best friends, Iâ€™m a couple thousand dollars in debt, Iâ€™m failing uni and my head is so fucked up I canâ€™t think straight. Suicide is constantly on my mind and I canâ€™t help but think itâ€™s the only way out. I donâ€™t know what to do or who to speak too. I canâ€™t take out anymore loans and I hate asking for help from the people I love and care about. So Iâ€™m coming to reddit for some advice, some positive thoughts or anything. Iâ€™m lost and hopeless and I think itâ€™s coming to the end of my time. How do I get past this? I donâ€™t think I can do this anymore. 


Sorry for such a scattered story, thereâ€™s so much thatâ€™s happened that I tried to fill all the important parts and Iâ€™m writing this while crying and have realised it might not make sense or it be all jumbled.
