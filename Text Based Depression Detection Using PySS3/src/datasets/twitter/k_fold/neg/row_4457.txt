Leaving this worldI hate myself and everything I am, Iâ€™m so selfish for going this far. Iâ€™m so selfish for doing this and only thinking about me. I donâ€™t want to do this shit for a life time, I wasnâ€™t made to live long. I hope Iâ€™m forgotten and erased from everyoneâ€™s memories, I hope everyone can be happier without me. I hope the world is a better place without me, I hope my parents and my friends are all happier without me.
