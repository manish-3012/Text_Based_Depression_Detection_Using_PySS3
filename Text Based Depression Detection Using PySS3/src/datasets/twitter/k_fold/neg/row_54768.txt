Why canâ€™t I be born again in a better countryMy lovely shitty Poland is vetoing the European COVID budget, probably will get kicked out of the eu, all I want to do is to finish school, and move to France for university, I just want to be with my girlfriend, study to become a doctor and help people, meanwhile my country might get kicked from the eu, so I likely wonâ€™t be able to immigrate, and even if I will, itâ€™ll still cost me so much to go university.
I bough a helium canister, I guess if we get booted out before I finish school, Iâ€™ll just asphyxiate myself, apparently itâ€™s a really peaceful way to die...
