I want to quit therapyI understand it's good for my suicidal thoughts. It is inconvenient. I don't like calling off from work for it. Exploring my insecurities makes me feel vulnerable. I don't feel I can be honest about my suicidal thoughts without being hospitalized. I think it will come off as crazy how obsessed I am with my ex. Do I have suicidal urges? Probably everyday. I think of hanging myself often. I love my younger brother. I wouldn't want to hurt my family. I'd like to use sex to medicate. It's against my religion and serves no purpose.. I've tired and I'm never happy.

I fear hell too.

What do you think I should do
