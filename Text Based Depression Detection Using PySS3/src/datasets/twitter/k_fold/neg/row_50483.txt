Therapy fixes short term sadness not real depressionI finally gave therapy a shot after dealing with depression for a few years after not being able to hide it from the people around me (typically can fake happiness and normalcy pretty well). Everyone around me that has felt with depression or anxiety sees a therapist and Iâ€™m happy that thereâ€™s less of a stigma about it these days. However, I knew it would not work for me. My thought and feelings are just too dark. How am I supposed to trust a stranger with these thoughts when I donâ€™t even burden my family and friends with them? 

Anyways, after giving therapy a shot I can say I shouldâ€™ve trusted my initial instinct.Letâ€™s just say my first session included a lot of crying and an intervention with another psychiatrist insisting I share my suicide plans when I stated I wasnâ€™t ready to do so. I lost trust just as quickly as I gave it, so my next few session I made myself shut up, explain â€œIâ€™m not feeling great but Iâ€™m doing okayâ€ just as I tell everyone else in my life. I take my anti depressants and I shut up.

Maybe itâ€™s ignorant for me to say this but itâ€™s just my perspective: therapy is great for people that want to talk through their problems and have someone acknowledge itâ€™s ok to be sad. Maybe they even get put on some meds and then itâ€™s just a check in on their mental health. However, if youâ€™re in a true depression, talking it out isnâ€™t gonna help and it may even hurt you. I think this is why I canâ€™t relate to some other peopleâ€™s versions of depression. 

I envy the ease of that process and how it works for the people around me. I envy the people that are just depressed from the pandemic and have something to blame it on. I envy the understandable version of depression.
