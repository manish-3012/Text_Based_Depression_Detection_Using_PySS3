Just realized I've been having these thoughts for a while now...I keep getting bombarded with the thoughts of "its all pointless" blah blah blah.  It seems everyday I take the thoughts in a more serious manner, and for the first time right now I actually considered killing myself.  However, I'm in college and have no means anyway.  What I need help with is, how do I stop thinking like this?  People will say get a hobby or whatever, but my college life is taking all my time.  If I'm not doing school work, I'm sleeping.  I don't know what to do. I used to be happy in high school (when life was easy).  I guess this post isn't as serious as everything else here, but I still need a little help.

Thoughts, help, encouraging words all appreciated
