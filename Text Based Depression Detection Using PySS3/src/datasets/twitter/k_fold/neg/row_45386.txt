Sorry I'm back to whine some more.Nothing works out. I told my mom that I was willing to go to a therapist but then a bunch of actually important stuff happened.  I was crying on my bed a week a go and no one even cared. Brother still wants me dead and still have absolutely zero friends. I don't even no what to do, I just feel too tired to do anything and I such a pussy I'm afraid to even talk to the cashier at a store. My mom has to drive me everywhere because I'm to incompetent to know how to drive. I don't even know what to do and to be honest I have essentially given up. Sorry for the rambling, I'm going to bed.
