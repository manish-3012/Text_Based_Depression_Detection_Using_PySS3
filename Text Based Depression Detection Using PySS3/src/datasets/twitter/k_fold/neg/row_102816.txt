Letter to my dadEmail I just sent my dad:

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, whenever I think about what you guys have done for me and how supportive you are, I just end up feeling really, really sad. I'll demonstrate how I feel with this story:  
I'm not sure where I heard this, but to this day it still makes me sadder than pretty much anything else---like make me tear up at the thought of it type sadness: The basic gist of the story is that there's a young kid who really likes Minecraft and doesn't have any friends. His dad knows he's kind of a loner just by seeing that he spends most of his time playing Minecraft, but doesn't actually know that he doesn't really have any friends. It's a saturday night, and the dad comes in to his son's room to see that he's just playing Minecraft again, and wanting him to get more out of life and be happy, he gives him some money and tells him to go out for dinner or a movie or something with his friends. The kid---not wanting to disappoint his father/let him know he has no friends/make his dad feel like he's helping him---decides to hide his laptop and gaming stuff in his backpack and he tells his dad he's going out with friends, only to head to a starbucks or something and use the money to buy a coffee....then he just plays minecraft.  
I think the reason why this story gets to me so much is because I can remember tons of times where you guys have done something similar and I either:  
A) Went out and used the money to buy and smoke weed, thinking that that would be the actual only way to feel better  
2) Either never actually did what you told me to for whatever reason or I actually did do it and felt even worse afterwards  
3) I've hidden how bad things actually are from you and mom to protect both your feelings/mental state as well as ensure my own ability to continue usingÂ   
D) The very act of hearing you or mom say "here, take my card and why don't you hit up Griffin and go to a movie" or something along those lines as a response to me feeling down makes me incredibly sad to hear. To this day, the scenario where I'm feeling really down and you guys tell me "why don't you go do X with this friend/here, this idea/thought/activity will make you feel better" regardless of if money is involved is just a really, really sad thing for me. It's hard for me to actually understand and articulate why this is.Â   
I know I casually brought up over break that I've always wanted to just up and leave the country for a while and not tell anyone, and to be honest I've never actually wanted to do that as much as I do now. It seems life my whole has been a story of escape and a battle vs me and reality and that's pretty much the reasoning behind this desire. I'm at a place in my life where I can either be sober and thus really depressed/almost suicidal due to wanting to escape the pain....for a whole year....and even then things might not look a whole lot better, or I can keep drinking/smoking till I inevitably encounter health problems very early on and/or kill myself because I'm just tired of it all.Â   
As we've discussed before, I can't imagine a life in which I'm both happy and sober, but it's not really about that....sometimes there just seems to be too much pain and misery in the world to manage. Not even my own necessarily, but I often wonder if life is just sort of a cruel joke that people are able only to tolerate at best, and most people never even make it to that level. Sometimes I think there's too much pain in this world to justify my continuing to live, like if it's this shitty, not even for me but for a hell of a lot of people, and there might not even be an objective purpose or order to any of the suffering if there is no god, then why even deal with any of it?Â   
I would say I'm in a pretty bad place mentally right now but I just emailed the counseling office I used to go to and asked when the therapist I'm trying to see is free. I want to get through this but it's not going well. I missed a class today but overall I'm doing pretty good in school, but I just feel really trapped and like no matter what I do I'm just kind of screwed. I get that it's on me for making the poor decisions that led me to this point, but the thing is I constantly question whether or not it's even worth it to put in the effort to be happy/improve my life/better myself if it might not even work and it's gonna be really hard.Â   
On top of all of this, I'm concerned that even if I get through all of this bs and come out on top, find my calling, become happy, "make it", it still won't matter because I'll die 30 years after that or whatever and either there was no god so it all really didn't mean anything or matter in any way or I chose the wrong faith and despite FINALLY becoming happy in my life I get to spend eternity in whatever hell ends up existing.Â   


  
I don't really know how to end this email because it's just a stream of my consciousness at 1:25am on a Tuesday night, but yeah.....hope things are better up north.Â   


  
Love you a cloitÂ
