The days are stretching me thinThe longer the days wear on my mind will turn to suicide more and more often. My girlfriend can't help. I refuse to swallow pills from the Snakes in white coats. 

The prospect of death hasnt been this attractive in a long time.
And the holidays haven't even arrived yet. 

Suppose saying something about it will subconsciously influence the time i have left, leaving me with some sort of makeshift floation device that i can cling to while i wait for the emotions in the deep black waters of my mind to drag me to my bitter end.
