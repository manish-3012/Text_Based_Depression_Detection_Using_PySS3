What happens if I get caught with buying Nembutal from China ?Ok,  long story short I've been experiencing a spiritual awakening which was misunderstood by the psychiatrist as psychosis. He prescribed me anti psychotics which made me really weak, and killed my taughts , emotions, feelings , empathy , and libido . ( I was against treatment from the very beginning but my parents forced me. I was actually handling life really well with law of attraction videos, positive talks and affirmations from YouTube mixed with kickboxing classes, going out and swimming at night - that was very therapeutic for some reason - Life was worth living for a while)

So it really feels like it's time to move on and am ready to buy some Nembutal but with that being said I'm afraid that it might get stopped by customs. Would I face jail time if that happened ? (I live in a European country)
