Bout to go pick up a few bottles of wine and drown myself in alcohol today.I've also been weighing my options of overdosing or driving into head on traffic. I suppose if I overdose I wouldn't physically harm any innocent people. I haven't cut myself in years, and even that seems tempting to me. I'm craving it like a drug. Since he won't hear my words to understand my hurt, he needs to see it.
