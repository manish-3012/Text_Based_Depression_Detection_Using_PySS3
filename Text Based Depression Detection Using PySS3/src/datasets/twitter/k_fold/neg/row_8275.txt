24 and I fucked over my own dreamsI peaked for about a year. I almost got out of my depression and then realized I'm a fuck up that couldnt fulfill my dreams. I'm 24 and about to finish college with a usless degree - knowing I can't function in the real world and it is making suicidal. I cant even get to grad school because my teachers dont know I exist nor do I have a job. 

Im socially inept with an array of mental illnesses. I dont want to work. I hate the real world. I hate myself for letting my life get no where. My sister is making crazy bank and I'm a fuck up with no self worth or aspirations. I'm lazy. I  want to hang myself.
