Nothing left, future is full of sufferingThe only thing I have in my future is hardship. My mental health will prevent me from ever having a career in the field I dedicated my life and finances into.

The marriage of my best friend/love of my life is always looming over me like some awful ghost, slowly destroying what remains of me.

I can't keep burdening the few people who I care about/care about me.

I've run out of treatment options.

I don't see how I keep going for much longer. I've tried, I really have, but this feels like it's it. There's just no reason to keep on fighting.
