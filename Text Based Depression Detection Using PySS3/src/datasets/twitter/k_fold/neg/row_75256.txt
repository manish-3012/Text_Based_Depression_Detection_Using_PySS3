I'm not depressed, I'm just physically illI know why I want to die. I am just physically ill to the point I can't live a normal life anymore...and the big problem is that my illness probably won't kill me anytime soon. I am just very sick, and I have been for over three years. Long story short, I have a systemic auto-immune disease, which means my whole body is affected and getting destroyed by my own immune system. There's no real cure, and the meds are either pointless or they trigger even more symptoms. I have to see countless specialists all the time. Go to hospitals all the time. I'm sooo tired of it. I often lose the ability to use a part of my body, either my arm or voice or whatever. It's so annoying, and most people don't understand. I'm also a fucking burden, because I can't take care of myself fully most of the time. I mean, I can wash myself, eat by myself, etc but I have no physical strength and I sometimes can't get up due to extreme tiredness/dizziness. 

But if I could choose between dying and living a healthy life, I would definitely choose to live...the issue is that my illness is not curable, and I'm tired of being this way. 

Sure, some people have it worse than me and make it work, but I've always been pretty negative, so THIS happening to me is not going to make me any more positive. I'm aware that I only have one fucking life, and it's going to be shit. All I wanted growing up was to have a simple life. I never asked for "big things", never cared about money, never cared about having lots of friends, being famous or whatever. 

I have the health of a 90 year old, and I'm only in my 20s...it's not acceptable. There are so many things I want to do but I can't because of my dysfunctional body, so I naturally condition myself to not want anything. And I HATE when people try to "find" miracle solutions to my problems, as if I had never tried/thought about it, like "have you tried cutting X thing out of your diet? Have you tried this herbal supplement?" etc I know it doesn't come from a bad place, but it's so infuriating when you have tried everything under the sun.
