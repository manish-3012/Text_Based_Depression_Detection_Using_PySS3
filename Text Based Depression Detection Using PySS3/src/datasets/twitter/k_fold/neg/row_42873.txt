Techno-failsAnyone else feel like technology failures play a huge part in their suicidality? Sometimes for me, if my computer freezes or my phone kicks me out of a website, it takes me from being sad and weepy but semi-functional to flopped on my bed sobbing and unable to get up. I feel like if the makers of technology realized what a trigger this can be, maybe theyâ€™d make it suck less?
