It just hit me.I made a new account for this so no one can find out its me. I realized the other day.. how easy it is to kill yourself. I can tie a noose and ill be out, nothing to it. I've had a shit life, not going to type the whole thing. Short of it is abused while growing up. dirt poor. bullied badly. Drug problems. MAJOR panic disorder. Self harm that has gotten out of hand but has gotten better. Abusive relations. People say they care but really they dont. Things dont change, things dont get better. Im normally the one talking someone down of a suicide. But here I am. Its going to happen. I dont know when, But within this month. I will be gone.
