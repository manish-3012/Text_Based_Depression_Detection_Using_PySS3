This sounds silly, but I wish the BirdBox monster was real...(spoilers?)

At least I could stop thinking about doing it and just do it... No more work, no more having to keep up with what others expect, I could stop disappointing my husband and he could just take care of himself instead of me...

It's weird to watch a movie and feel jealous of something so morbid. But yeah. Has anyone related to this kindve situation? I see a lot of people wishing they could be murdered for the same reason basically....the not having the courage to do it themselves or to disappoint people once you're gone.
