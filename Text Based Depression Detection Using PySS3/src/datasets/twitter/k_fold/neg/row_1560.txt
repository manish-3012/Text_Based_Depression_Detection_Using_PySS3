my thoughts are killing me.thoughts of what couldve been. of what couldve happened. but instead things just end. and the relationship is over, just like that. maybe i put too much emotional investment in things, i do. i just dont want to feel anymore. i want to feel like i never met him. he wasnt a bad person, it would just be better that way
