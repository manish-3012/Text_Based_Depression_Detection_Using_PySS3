Canâ€™t deal with this foreverHello. This isnâ€™t my first reddit post ever (yay me). This quarantine started out great. I was productive, exploring new things, just generally having fun. But then in July, I ended up in a fight that could have been avoided and luxated my tooth. At first the dentist told me that the tooth would heal in 2 weeks (and it did move forward a bit) but then I came back, had negative pulp vitality tests, and needed a root canal. The week up until the root canal, I was a nervous wreck and completely suicidal, but once I got it, I felt a massive amount of relief. But a couple weeks after that, I started to worry again, google again, and become suicidal again. I keep waking up in cold sweats, Iâ€™m afraid of eating and drinking, and I fear Iâ€™ll be judged because of my front tooth. The dentists said I shouldnâ€™t worry about it too much , but Iâ€™m so fucking afraid that the tooth wonâ€™t last. I need braces if I want to push the tooth back into position, which would require me to wear a retainer for the rest of my life. Worst part is that Iâ€™m 16, a girl (not saying girls canâ€™t fight, I mean look at me, but that society doesnâ€™t really expect us to), and I feel like Iâ€™ve completely ruined my life. What point is there to living anymore when it feels like everyone else can handle their shit while you canâ€™t? I was so outgoing, but now Iâ€™m depressed. I donâ€™t know what to do.
