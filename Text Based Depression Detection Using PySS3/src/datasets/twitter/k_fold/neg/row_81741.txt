Options.I hadn't killed myself thus far because all my methods involve something inherently painful. Like stabbing myself or strangling myself. That is until recently I was prescribed antibiotics. It's really opened up my options. My parents aren't going to count how many I take despite me trying to signal to them that I could seriously fuck myself over if I get depressed before taking them. It probably wouldn't end in death though, just some form of suffering. At least the way is there.
