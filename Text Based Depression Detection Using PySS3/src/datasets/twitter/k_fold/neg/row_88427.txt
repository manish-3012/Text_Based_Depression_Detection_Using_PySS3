I hate myself...and I'm beginning to think everyone else in my life does too. Whether it's the overt hate or the deep-seeded passive-aggressive type. I can't really tell and I'm getting tired of trying to. I have chronic thoughts of ending it but I tend to be too much of a pussy go through with it. Thanks to recent developments in my life, however, I am rapidly reaching the false sense of courage I need. I can't live with myself anymore. I can't. I hate myself. HATE........ Thanks for listening. That is all.... Please don't comment, I just needed to type this.
