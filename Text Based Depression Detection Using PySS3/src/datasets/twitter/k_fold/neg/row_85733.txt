I'm so tiredI'm so tired of everything, so I guess I'll just rant a little here and see if this helps a little.  I'm a trans man living in a Christian household, I found out I was a boy in 7th grade. I constantly feel like a freak and that I don't belong, Even amongst other transgender people. I've tried to kill myself many times before and I want to still kill myself. The only thing tying me down is my best friend, But even with her I crave dying. I'm so so tired of this all, I don't belong in this stupid body and I want it to all go away. Nothing feels real to me anymore either, It just feels like a blur. All this stupid shit on Tik Tok Like "This is all a simulation" doesn't help at all. I'm a pathetic fuck still grasping for love that I don't deserve and is probably not even real. I'm a huge disappointment and I want it all to go away. I don't deserve to live. I need to die. I WANT to die. I have a  box cutter in my drawer and I consider cutting my throat constantly, And I'm so close to doing it. I just want it all to stop. I want to stop hurting people, I want to stop being a disappointment. Life would be so much better if I die. No one will care about this and that's okay. I needed to rant and ultimately chose this site under a stupid name. I deserve to die.
