How do I fix my life?Iâ€™m 16 and suffer from strong social anxiety, for the past 5 years Iâ€™ve wanted to throw myself off a carpark rooftop and die. I always feel like I get in the way and amount to nothing, I have very few friends and we donâ€™t see each other often. Iâ€™ve tried turning to God 2 years back to see if thatâ€™ll help even a little and hearing that if I decide to kill myself Iâ€™ll be subjected to even more torment after death is really fucking with me. I just want this all to stop and be happy. Is there anything at all I can do to fix this mess?
