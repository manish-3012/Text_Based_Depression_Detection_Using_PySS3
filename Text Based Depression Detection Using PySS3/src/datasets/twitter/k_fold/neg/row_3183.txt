Goodbye!I have serious mental illness, accompanied by many physical illnesses (mainly overweight, high bp, problems with my spine) and I'm only 28. Which is surprising. 

My memory and intelligence are destroyed due to psychiatric illness and drugs, it's quite difficult to recall even recent events. 

I don't have disability and probably wouldn't be able to make it quickly however disability paycheck in my country don't cover even basic physiological needs. 

Recently I've got from ophtalmologist a note that my eyes are fucked up due to high bp. So +1 disease. 
  
That's just too much drugs and too much medical advice for me. Given that I don't have any savings and currently unemployed (though I don't believe that anything will change in the future) I believe soon I wouldn't be able not only to pay for health but even to buy myself food. 

So I'm deeply fucked. And there is no hope, no way to get out, nothing to be changed. Well, there are some people for whom suicide might be quite an option. Rationally speaking. 

I'm definetly going to do this since my departure would make some people's life only easier. The other wouldn't be bothered. 

The only thing that bugs me - the whole transition phase. I've always been scared to die in my sleep, I've always wanted to experience death in real-time. Just to be able to kind of observe my last moments in real-time. 

But looking at chances and suicide statistics - well, It wouldn't be possible. I'm too scared of ropes. And there is no way I could have find a gun. So I'm going to die being unconscious. My last experience would be falling asleep, not experiencing death. 

The last couple of months I was hesitating, struggling back and forth - whether or not to do it, maybe I would somehow adapt, maybe I would be able to live. Now I'm finished with lying to myself.
 
Good luck.
