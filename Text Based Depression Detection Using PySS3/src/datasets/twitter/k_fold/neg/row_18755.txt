I feel so helplessOne of my closest friends is trying to commit atm and I canâ€™t get hold of his sister . Iâ€™m 17 hours hours away from him by flight so Iâ€™m no help and we donâ€™t have mutual friends and Iâ€™m not sure where they are so I canâ€™t send someone to them . Iâ€™m scared and terrified and I canâ€™t lose him
