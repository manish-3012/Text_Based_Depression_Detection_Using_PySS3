I'm so scared please help meI can feel a low coming, I'm on the brink. It feels so pathetic, nothing is remotely interesting me tonight. That's a sure sign things are about to go downhill. Things have been so terrible lately but I thought I was coping. 

I'm terrified, I don't want to cry and scream and hurt but it feels like it's destined to happen. I'm at my parent's house but I'm tempted to drive home just for something to do. But being alone scares me too...what if being alone makes me more likely to lash out at myself?

I'm not worthy of anything, I'm so scared I can't cope
