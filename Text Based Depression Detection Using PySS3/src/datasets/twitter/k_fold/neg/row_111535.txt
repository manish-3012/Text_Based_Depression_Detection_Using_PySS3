i canâ€™t do it anymoreiâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for years now iâ€™ve just never had the courage. my mum is terminally ill and i have to care for her part time and my friends treat me like shit, with my â€œbest friendâ€ making me cry and have panic attacks every single night. i feel so isolated but i canâ€™t do anything about it because i canâ€™t move schools or classes so i have to see my friends and her tomorrow and  every day for the next year and a half. i tried telling my best friend how i feel and more specifically how she makes me feel and she turned it on me and blamed me once again i canâ€™t stand her but i canâ€™t leave her because sheâ€™s the only person i can hold a conversation with. iâ€™ve planned out running  away so many times i canâ€™t count but i know i would never survive and i donâ€™t want my parents to know that iâ€™m somewhere out there not coming home. at least if i kill myself they know thereâ€™s no way iâ€™m coming back. the only thing that keeps me going sometimes is my dog or my little brother both of which wouldnâ€™t understand if i just disappeared. i donâ€™t want to let everyone down but at the same time i know that no one cares now why should they afterwards. i donâ€™t know how iâ€™m going to do it as i live in the uk so no guns or ceiling fans for me to hang myself off of but i know i donâ€™t want to be here tomorrow. if youâ€™re reading this i hope youâ€™re stronger than me .
