I Donâ€™t Want to Do This AnymoreI feel like such shit all the time, and I KNOW Iâ€™m such a worthless sack of shit.  I canâ€™t amount to shit, and I wonâ€™t.  I let people treat me like garbage just because it makes me feel like I have some value.  I feel so disgusting and ashamed, but itâ€™s all Iâ€™m good for.
I want to kill myself.  I canâ€™t do this anymore.  I canâ€™t continue feeling like shit all the time; I canâ€™t deal with all of the intrusive thoughts and self-destructive urges; I canâ€™t deal with my instability regarding emotions.  Itâ€™s all just too much.  Not to mention thereâ€™s trauma I havenâ€™t and canâ€™t deal with, and I barely remember any of my life due to it.  Itâ€™s all just fucking bullshit.  Iâ€™m fucking done.

Sorry, I just needed to rant.
