The Universe forcing you to die? [vent?]I apologise if this is the wrong sub, I just need somewhere to voice my thoughts.
Does anyone else feel like the universe/god needs them to die? Personally I've felt this on and off for over a year now, probably. I was supposed to die on Sunday alongside my best friend who feels the same. I was too tired, she gave up and got admitted to the hospital. So now I'm alone, and alive. The universe is getting more insistent however and I know God needs me with Him. I'm not religious however, I don't know if he even loves me. I'm an extremely awful person and I'm not deserving of His love at all. he knows this. he knows this so i don't know why he's so urgent. Is god even allowed to accept sinners? I suppose I can't help it though, I'm not human. I don't know what i am but this is just an awful, temporary form. this life has always been such suffering for me and im so tired of walking among lower beings. Anyway i don't know what this was, i apologise. Perhaps a vent? I've been so trapped in my own head lately. I just want to ascend but i can't leave without her, so for now I will suffer and wait. I appreciate this outlet. I'm thinking of killing myself on November 1st. it just feels right to me? November has always been a lovely cherry blossom pink and maybe that's why i didn't die on Sunday, God is giving me a last chance. I will take it. I'll be among the stars, happy and at peace, finally. Yes :) I wish you all peace on this Earth.
