Iâ€™m having a hard time telling my family I need serious help because of my anxiety.I have been battling depression and anxiety the majority of my life. I was born with a disability and grew up in a very ignorant town. I have gone to a psychologist/psychiatrist sense I was 11. I sometimes feel like because I have held myself together my entire life what they think what me falling apart looks like isnâ€™t. I lost someone who was like a brother to me. It will be 1 year in February. He was 19. I have been on medications sense he passed. I have tried telling my family that I canâ€™t hold my self together anymore but they keep brushing it off. I have spent my entire life dissociating painful memories and emotions. Sometimes I forget the most precious memories I had with my loved one. The closer I get to the one year mark that harder it is and the more I remember. Itâ€™s like getting that phone call that heâ€™s gone alll over again.Iâ€™m so tired of acting like Iâ€™m ok. Iâ€™m scared if I donâ€™t get more help I could end it. How do I tell them?
