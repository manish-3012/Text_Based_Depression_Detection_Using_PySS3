my life ended 3 years agoI've been dead for a long time. I just didn't believe it. Now i do. The stress, the anxiety, the pain. It's all caught up to me. I can't keep running and obviously therapy and medicine are useless. I'm giving myself 12 hours to live and then I'm going to head over to that little clearing in the woods where we used to meet up in the middle of the night and I then I can be in the one place where everything was perfect one last time
