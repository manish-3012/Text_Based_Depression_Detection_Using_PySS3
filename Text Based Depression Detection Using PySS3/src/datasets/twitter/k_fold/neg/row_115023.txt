I messed up again as usual.Last night my BF and I were going to order pizza from a local place. I tried 4 times to order it because it kept telling me there was a card error. I figured I must have entered something incorrectly and kept trying before just giving up and ordering from somewhere else. The local place never called or delivered so I figure it didn't go through. 

Now this afternoon I got a text from my BF saying it went through...all four times. I give up. I can't do anything right. Maybe I should just end it and stop wasting people's money. 

TL;DR I accidentally charged $39 four times to my BF's debit card.
