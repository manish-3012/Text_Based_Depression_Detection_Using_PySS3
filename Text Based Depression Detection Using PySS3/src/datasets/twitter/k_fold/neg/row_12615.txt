Iâ€™m overworked in an Ivy with no good friends, no love, no money, no family, and depression.
I hate my life.  

I work so hard, spend so much time working on school, yet I keep getting abandoned with people Iâ€™m trying to make friends with.  

I just got bullied last night by two girls on zoom  , and Iâ€™m basically being ghosted by two more. (All of Whom Iâ€™m not attracted to)

I canâ€™t pursue my hobbies because I donâ€™t have money.  I do have a lot of money right now, but I have to spend it on upcoming medical procedures so Iâ€™m going to be broke.

Every-time I try to make friends, I just keep getting abandoned.  Iâ€™m not ugly or fat or anything, and i think Iâ€™m pretty interesting as a person.  I can name numerous fun facts about myself, which often surprise and make ppl laugh.  

I have no free time to even pursue my hobbies.  So much time spent in school that I havenâ€™t played video games in over a month, then longest streak in my life.

All I want is love from a girl, yet I keep getting abandoned ;-;.  Iâ€™m not toxic or abusive.  But I may be a little clingy, but Iâ€™ve learned how to avoid that now.  I miss my ex who broke up with me 8 months ago too, because I felt like she was the only person Iâ€™ve ever connected to in my life.

Due to growing up in a difficult household, Iâ€™m not connected to my family, so Iâ€™m basically all alone by myself.

I guess suicide is the only option because if I canâ€™t be myself and make friends, and if I have to painfully overwork my self in my classes, whatâ€™s the point?&amp;
