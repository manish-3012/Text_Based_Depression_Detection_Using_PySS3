Just me ventingSince I escaped from my abusing living situation of five years things seem great to far but my god it's tolling down so hard on me that my family wants nothing to do with me at all. I'm living with my girlfriend and her family since the incident of which is in my other posts if you wish to know more, I'm just losing hope now they told me I'm going to be a terrible father and I can see now how they're affecting me even after I left, I have zero self confidence I'm actively afraid to sleep and have to drink to actually fall asleep now. It's taking a toll on me I just want to be free to be myself and live my own life.
