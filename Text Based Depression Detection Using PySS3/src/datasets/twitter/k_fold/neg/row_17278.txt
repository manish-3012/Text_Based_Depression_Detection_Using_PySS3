My chest just feels so heavy all the timeIt feels like actual weight and while I donâ€™t think I have the actual courage to pull the trigger on myself, I know I want to all the time and itâ€™s almost always my only constant thought in my head no matter what Iâ€™m doing or where I am. Itâ€™s always there to haunt me. But sometimes I do get impulsive and just do things like a couple days ago, I was biking and biked in front of cars on the road twice and was so close to getting hit (wouldnâ€™t have been bad if they succeeded). It feels nice to say that somewhere where others can relate unfortunately :( I also donâ€™t see a life for myself past 20 as I saw someone mention in an earlier post. Iâ€™ve never ever thought of marriage or kids or buying a house or even graduating college. It doesnâ€™t seem to fit in my head and I donâ€™t see myself doing those things ever. I guess I will just loath every waking moment of my life.
