I give upI give up. Iâ€™m so stressed of everything, and my mom doesnâ€™t help me. She just stresses me more, and I canâ€™t take it anymore. She doesnâ€™t even care about my mental health, only my grades. I just wanna die, just wanna disappear. The only person I love is my dad. Now Iâ€™m regretting everything. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m so confused. I donâ€™t know what to do. I wish I wasnâ€™t born. I wish I could just be my cat. I wish I could just disappear.
