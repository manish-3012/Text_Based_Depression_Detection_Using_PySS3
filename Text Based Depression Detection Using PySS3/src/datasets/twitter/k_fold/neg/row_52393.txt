How do you manage to continue?I feel like I live chained. I don't have intimacy. I broke up with a girl and I feel bad. I can't speak about anything with anybody. Everything I do is wrong. There are a lot of people who expect that I will be taking care of them so I can't die but I can't continue living. Am I supposed to work for others during all my life until I die?
