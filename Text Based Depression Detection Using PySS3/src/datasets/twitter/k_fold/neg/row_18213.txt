Zippity f*cking doo dah***TRIGGER WARNING***
You know what? It's all crap! Everything is sh1t! I need helped and every S.O.B around me is a selfish tw@ in every way imaginable! I was institutionalised in early June and released later that month because I was constantly suicidal, self harming and smoking weed to try and escape and distract the emotional/mental pain. I just couldn't take it anymore! Guess what? I still can't! I've been met with nasty attitude change and/or arrogance/ignorance from those that are meant to care most! No one has patience and/or time for me and do you know what? I'm done with it! I want to physically hurt so bad right now! This is beyond me! I don't give two flying sh1ts about anyone that has something to say in a way that can be deemed as hurtful because I'm far from being a snowflake! I don't want to hurt or die because of people. I want to because I can't contain the thoughts! I was met with nothing other than a key worker and psychiatrist when I came out. I have been practically left a sitting duck in the aftercare side since release and I'm not getting any better! Between the lovely visuals I get and the constant paranoia. I don't know how much longer I can go on! To f*ck with it all! Advice would be fantastic but anything other than that will be pointless. I don't succumb to menial uplifts or pathetic put downs. But do as you all please with this post!
