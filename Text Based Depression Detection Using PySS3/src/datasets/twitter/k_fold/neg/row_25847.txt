A dilemmaI am a relatively young guy. Iâ€™m always bouncing between extreme sadness and extreme happiness, though itâ€™s not really a happiness; itâ€™s more of like a fearless nature where I think Iâ€™m invincible and can do anything. I read online thatâ€™s kind of like bipolar but my parents donâ€™t think I need a therapist so they wonâ€™t take me to one. So basically, I think Iâ€™m mentally ill but I donâ€™t actually know if I am.

I just kind of feel like Iâ€™m ready to die. Iâ€™ve experienced all of the life there is. Iâ€™ve made friends, had/have a romantic relationship, Iâ€™ve drank until I couldnâ€™t move anymore lol. I canâ€™t open up to anyone about this except my parents, but they donâ€™t even think Iâ€™m serious. My girlfriend, who Iâ€™ve been dating for over 6 months, has no idea. I told my very closest friends yesterday that I feel like Iâ€™m bipolar but it took a lot of alcohol to tell them, and I think they got weirded out. It just seems that everyone likes me until they get to see the worst part of me.
