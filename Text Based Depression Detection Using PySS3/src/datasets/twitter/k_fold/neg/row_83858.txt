I just thought about what Iâ€™ll talk about in therapy and feel like suicide is the only optionOh my god. Everything is so fucked I want nothing more than to die. 

I am going to my first session today at 1pm. I was thinking about what to talk about and it just all broke me. Iâ€™ve been this way for 18 years of my life, I have never changed. I have no other option but suicide. These intense impulses for it are something I really canâ€™t control.
