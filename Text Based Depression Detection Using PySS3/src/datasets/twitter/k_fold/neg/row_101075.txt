I want another shot...I want another shot at my hanging attempt. I want another shot at my overdose attempt. I want another shot at my jumping attempt.

I want another shot. I just want to try again. Do it right this time.

I'm a fuck up and can't seem to do anything right, all I'm asking for is another chance. Another try. Do it right.

So tonight I'm going to try again. Get right back up on that horse. Gotta find a good tree or a good spot inside to hang from. Got the note all ready to go. 

I just want another shot.
