out here thinking about killing myself while cleaning toilets at 10:50pmI've been thinking about doing it for the last couple years, i don't think I can go on anymore. kinda sad to not even be old enough to get a job and getting to this point but it's a long time coming. there's no point in going on anymore and it's just too much. 

if I'm honest with myself 30% is probably chemical, 20% masking and bottling emotions and 50% is probably some of my family. if i have to deal with my mother continuing to call people who die by suicide selfish, denying help i need to cope with autism because 'you're not /that/ autistic' or saying that autistic people only come out as lgbt to give themselves somewhere to fit in (hello, closeted lesbian autistic person here) one more time I might finally down a bottle of sleep medication, get a knife and be over with it.

as it is, im only cleaning bathrooms because she insists it be done now. ive cleaned this one twice because the first time wasn't good enough and I have another one to go. what i /want/ to do is go sit in my back garden, bask in the cold and strike a couple of matches because it calms me. I think everyone can live with the fucking bathroom not being cleaned until tomorrow but apparently not.

I mean either way, i don't see myself alive in 5 years but oh well. i can try and express how I feel all i like because it's not like she'll listen anyway.
