Fuck this life, it's nothing but a prisonMy biggest fear is trying to kill myself and not succeeding and shame by my family or worse getting dirty looks from them. I know what i could do to end myself but the fucking fear it's annoying. My parents are supportive but don't know the real me, and i got no friends and severe anxiety. Should go with it and kill myself?
