I am done with thisA couple years ago, suicidal thoughts started creeping into my brain, and it has been growing exponentially. It is now at an all-time high where I do nothing in my day except contemplating different methods of killing myself and trying to choose one of them. I am done with this, I have tried many times to "get better" and "seek help". IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK. I have been getting only worse and worse over the years. I guess I only have a few weeks left before I completely succumb to my thoughts
