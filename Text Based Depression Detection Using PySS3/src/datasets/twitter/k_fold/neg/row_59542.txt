Questions about apathyI tried to kill myself when I was 13. I swallowed a bunch of pills and immediately panicked and tried to force myself to vomit after. 
After nothing came out, the greatest sense of relief/comfort/acceptance I have ever felt in my entire life washed over me.
I genuinely thought I was going to die but I just ended up vomiting a bunch. Convinced parents it was stomach flu.

Ever since then, I have become dangerously apathetic about everything in life. I might not graduate high school simply because I don't go to classes anymore and haven't turned in any work in almost 2 months. I blame my apathy on this wave of relief I felt. Ever since that day, I changed. Now, no matter what trials I face and no matter how hard things get, I can always tell myself "Well don't worry about it. You always have an **exit** no matter what situation you get yourself into."

How do I get over this apathy towards everything? It's seriously going to fuck me over hardcore if I don't work on it. 

How do I convince myself to stop considering suicide as an option for every problem? I mean literally everything is given that same choice. "Oh you didn't pass high school? Who cares. See what happens after, if things go bad, kill yourself." "You spend most of your time in your room, on your computer? Who cares. If things get too bad, just kill yourself." "You end up losing all your friends? Meh, just kill yourself."

I find it even more strange how nonchalant all those thoughts are. People associate suicide with some horrible, dark act but to me it's just another option. Like if I had to decide what to do after high school (If I graduate): "Hmm, there's community college or I could go work for my father or I could even try my hand at applying straight for a University and hope to get lucky. Oh yeah, I almost forgot I can kill myself to." It just seems weird how  easily I can accept that as being a viable choice.

TL;DR Tried to kill myself about 5 years ago. For some reason, my failed attempt made me accept suicide as a viable choice for life problems and has made me extremely apathetic about **everything**. Other people make a big show of it saying "I'm done that's it, my life is shit, I quit, going to shoot myself in the face." while I'd be more like "Oh, well, I guess things didn't work out like I hoped. I'll just go over here and quietly off myself." How do I start caring about stuff again? How do I stop accepting suicide as an answer to my problems?
