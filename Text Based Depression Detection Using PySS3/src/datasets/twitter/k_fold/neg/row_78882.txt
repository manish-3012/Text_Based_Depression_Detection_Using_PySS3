I already have a planI'll wait until my parents and sister leave for vacation in the summer. 
Then I'll probably give some extra food and water to my pets, because I love them and dont want them to to be hungry until my parents come home. 

After that idk what I'll do, either overdosing on medication or something else, not sure. At least something where I'm still awake for a bit. I'll play some YouTube video or podcast to calm down, so that I wont be too scared. Maybe say some goodbye to my friends over text or call them. And yeah. Idk when, but I hate myself to such a degree that I just cant do it anymore.
