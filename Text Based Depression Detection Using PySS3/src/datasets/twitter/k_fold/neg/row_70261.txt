In the end, it's just a statistic.Im standing on the edge. Below is a dark, familiar pit. Im not welcome anymore, and deservedly so. I can feel myself falling into the abyss. I dont think ill be coming out of it this time. The help i need is inaccessible. 

A handful of people will care. I've prepared them the best i can. Some will be angry, and reasonably so. It's not the first time i've let someone down. I think it's time to start tiding up. It would be inconsiderate to leave things a mess.
