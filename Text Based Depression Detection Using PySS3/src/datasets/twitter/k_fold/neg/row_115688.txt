It's my birthday and all I can think is that I have absolutely no reason to live.I am unhappily married, unemployed and have no idea how to get myself out of this situation, that I feel stuck in. I am a worthless loser with nothing to contribute to the world. I hate my life and I can't seem to get myself to do anything about it. I wish that I could just stop breathing. Why should I live when there are so many more useful people in this world. Don't we have to many useless people?
