God will save youThis is a joke that I heard from someone but if you think hard about it the joke has value, the joke goes like this. One day a man was stranded in the middle of the ocean and a boat come by and the guy on the boat says â€œhey there you need any help ?â€ The guy in the ocean says â€œno thank you god will save meâ€ and the boat leaves a few hours pass and another boat comes by and the guy on the boat says â€œ you need any help sir?â€ And the man in the ocean says â€œ no thank you god will save meâ€ half a day goes by and the man ends up drowning once he gets to heaven the man asks god â€œgod why didnâ€™t you save me ?â€ God replyâ€™s â€œyou dummy I sent two boats to save you but you took them for granted.â€ So the morale of the story is to not take things fro granted and always be grateful because youâ€™ll never know when itâ€™s a act of god trying to help you.
