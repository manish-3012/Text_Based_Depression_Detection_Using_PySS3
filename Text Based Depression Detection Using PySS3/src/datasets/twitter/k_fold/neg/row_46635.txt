"I wanna die" "Lol mood" no reallyPeople think it's fake, it's been so normalized to joke about suicide. I'm like, no. I'm serious. I have a noose tied in my room. This isn't a joke.



And even if you think I'm joking don't you think I joke about it a *little* too much? Like y'know, constantly? 24/7? And talk about death or suicide in general all the time? Is this not obvious?



I've given off so many textbook signs. Constantly joking or talking about suicide or death, complete obvious lack of hygiene, sleeping way too much, excessive drug and alcohol use, self harm, making drastic changes in my physical appearance, losing interest in everything and everyone, giving shit away, acting recklessly..




I sound like something out of a middle school health class textbook. I'm showing *every* sign anyone ever tells you to look out for and even the people who say they care don't realize anything's wrong. People don't even realize I'm depressed
