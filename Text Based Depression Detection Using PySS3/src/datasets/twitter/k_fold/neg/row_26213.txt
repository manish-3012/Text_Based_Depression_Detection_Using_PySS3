My own parents hate meEvery day my mom looks desperately for something to scold me about. Every day, she manages to find something to insult about me. Every day, she calls me retarded because I haven't finished my homework yet, even though it has only been fifteen minutes since I got home (I walk home most of the time). Every month, my mom tries to physically hurt me enough for me to regret living. I don't know what to do. I have already spoken with counselors at school and online and I have gotten no helpful result out of it. Either someone helps me with getting my parents to stop hating me or I die.
