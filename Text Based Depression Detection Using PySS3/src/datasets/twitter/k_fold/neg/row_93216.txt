10 hours to goThis is it, I've made up my mind, after many failed attempts in the past I'll finally succeed tonight, I'm sick of this I should of stayed in the military. Going to keep everything clean. Organize my belongings in a clean manner, pack a simple bag with my firearm that I use for home defense and set out towards the bleak desert. Find myself a nice rock or something that overlooks the city and blow my brains out. It should take a while for them to even find me by then i hope decay and scavengers do most of the cleaning.I dont want them cleaning up the remains, much rather have them find bones or something much easier and less smell. 1 hollow point round, to ensure the job is done. So that way I can actually succeed in something for once. If this is ever found by my family, my father gets all of my money not a single dime to that bitch that's married to him. The rest of my firearms for hunting goes to my sisters, my battalion coin along with whatever gear I have to my buddy in PA, computer/ rest of electronics goes to my littlest sister. How can I ever say I'm sorry for being made the fool of despite everything I have done and tried in vain, fuck em. Whether I sleep forever or if there is an afterlife I request to be left alone.
