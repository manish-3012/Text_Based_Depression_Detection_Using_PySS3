Why not, it's my birthday, I can do whatever I wantIt's my birthday, i'm now on level 20, I survived for 20 fucking years. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember and I can't recall happy memories. Never had a gf, never had many real friends.

It has been 3 years since I last saw my old friends, they moved on, they have their own lives, moved to other cities to study.

My old high school crush wished me happy birthday and told me to go out with my friends... I don't have friends irl... I have now 2 online friends that I never met irl.

Social anxiety doesn't let me make new friends (or at least that's my excuse).

I'm in high school again and I don't see myself working 40 hours a week again, so I don't have much hope for my future.

If I die now, I don't leave much behind, my parents and my brother will be upset and probably will never forget my suicide but I can't live just to satisfy them.

I don't know if it will be today but it would be nice. For my birthday I wish someone would kill me without pain... maybe I can give myself that gift.
