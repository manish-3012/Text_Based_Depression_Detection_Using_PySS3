suicidal all the timei have distractions of sorts, but basically suicide is always on my mind .. well, really ... it's on my heart, and then my mind

new here, just wanted to say it out loud to people that dont get all 'worried' and need to 'fix' me

it comes from a deep rooted pain and sadness ... seems like i die a little each day .. and suicide would at least let me end the excruciating existence of what some people call living

i realized while i was setting up my account that this years birthday will make it 50 years since i had my first suicidal thought, sigh

i was planning, again, today .. well, tweaking really, because i have been 'planning' it all out forever .. anyway, planning how to simplify everyone's life that knows me (although i dont think that anyone gives a crap about me) around how they could collect the money i leave them .. ya know, preferably without having to leave the comfort of their own house.  I came up with the best plan yet, i think! nice work suicidal me!
