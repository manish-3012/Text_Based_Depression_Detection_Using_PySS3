I feel so stuckI have never thought Iâ€™d be one to consider ending my life... I have PMDD but I honestly think itâ€™s bipolar or BPD.. I will have good days then suddenly just want to kill myself and feel so empty...
I am 21 and not living w/ my parents and canâ€™t talk to them b/c they will LITERALLY just tell me I feel like this because I donâ€™t go to mass anymore.. I am so frustrated w/ them and feeling rejected by them because Iâ€™m not catholic. I love my boyfriend but I feel like I havenâ€™t ended stuff because Iâ€™m dating him.. I need to vent.. I donâ€™t know why I get suicidal thoughts randomly.. my day has been fine
