Iâ€™m DeadI feel like Iâ€™m dead and stuck inside this living body.

I donâ€™t recognise who I am I donâ€™t know what I want I donâ€™t know what to do I donâ€™t know anything anymore . This is not me . 

All of my interests , feelings , personality and anything else is gone all I feel is pain and suffering ,from the very first  minute of the day when I wake up to the very last when I drift off to sleep . Not even weed and alcohol can ease this pain . 

I feel like my duty now is to get rid off this living body Iâ€™m stuck inside .
