I feel like going through with things would be easier.Iâ€™ve lost my job that I loved.

My girlfriendâ€”who said she wanted to marry me and I was the one for herâ€”broke up with me. 

I am a disappointment to my parents. 

Guys, itâ€™s so hard to think of even wanting to make it anymore. 

Iâ€™m 26 but I feel like I simply cannot do this anymore. I donâ€™t want to live, because there is this deep darkness that has taken me. 

Please god help me. Please give me something to live for. 

I donâ€™t want to die, but I feel like I have to.
