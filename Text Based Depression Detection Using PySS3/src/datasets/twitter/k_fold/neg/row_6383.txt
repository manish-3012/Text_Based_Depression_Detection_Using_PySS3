I wonder how many we've lost hereI just noticed that there's 191k people on these boards and only 611 online. It made me think about all of the accounts who are no longer with us.

Generally, people are looking for help and attention when they post about these things, but I've seen some real shit on these boards that I've never seen anywhere else, and no doubt a few make that choice after posting here.

I bought a gun recently cause of all the craziness. It's different when you're actually holding that power in your hands. It's scary. I don't know how you guys attempt without a guaranteed chance of success. I could never do that. 

That's some true desperation, and I hope you get the help you need
