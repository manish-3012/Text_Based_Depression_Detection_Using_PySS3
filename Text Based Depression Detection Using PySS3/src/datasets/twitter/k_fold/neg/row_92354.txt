My family is no moreShe never loved me as much as I loved her. 4 years of loving her and sacrificing everything, destroying my body to make it work and build a family, FOR NOTHING. Now my son will experience the same pain I did when my parents split. Fuck my fucking liver. I'm sorry Jr, daddy will get it together and will always be there for you. It's just right now he's not good and he loves you so much. He loves mommy too but sometimes mommies and daddies separate. He will always have her in a special place in his heart. This pain is too great. I want it to end. I want to stop loving you, caring about you. I am empty. I am done.
