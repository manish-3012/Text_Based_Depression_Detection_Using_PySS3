How to I rebuild?I asked my friend to describe the night he randomly came over to my place and found me trying to over dose. I remembered very little from the night and wanted to try and piece together the parts nearly a year later so I can try and rebuild my self. Here is what he sent me, and I've got to be honest it's just reminded me of how willing I was to pass, and now I'm just angry and upset that it didn't work:

"It was all to do with (Ex girlfriend who cheated me and left me in stupid amounts of debt) I walked in and you was listening to Lil Peep but the version youâ€™d done. Proper deep lyrics. You was zoned out. Completely vacant. Non responsive but awake. Covered in vomit. Off your head. Flat trashed, throwing up blood. Youâ€™d given up. You didnâ€™t want help. I rang you an ambulance. You refused to go with them. You said you was scared of me because I was being passive aggressive cause I was demanding to know where your stash was. And I was shouting. You thought I was gonna kill you you was that far gone. You lied to me about not having any and youâ€™d taken them all. Until I went to roll a cig and found a bag of 5 Xans in a pot. And I snatched them and you begged me to give them back you got angry at me for refusing. I couldnâ€™t help you. I had to ring an ambulance. At that point I genuinely thought youâ€™d have done anything to get those xans back and you had a blade next to you. So I snatched your flat keys as well and took the bag and locked you inside whilst I rang an ambulance. It was heavy shit bro. You had completely given up"

Since that night I've moved got clean, become a manager of a campsite at the the side of the biggest lake in Italy and started earning more money than I ever thought possible for myself. Yet I still can't look people in the eye or develop a genuine connection with another human being. It makes me so sad because I know I have fight in me to achieve good things, but at the same time every single thing I do just feels so pointless, even when I'm having complete fun. Am I a lost cause, or is there steps I can take on top of medication and therapy?
