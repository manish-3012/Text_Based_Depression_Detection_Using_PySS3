Blood from a stoneI dropped out of college on the GI Bill and attempted suicide.  I recovered for a while, now I'm on the hunt for a job.  Homeless, jobless, crashing on couches.  And now I have wonderful collections agencies coming after my debt, so any scraping of income I'll make in the future still won't be enough to survive.  What the fuck am I supposed to do about any of this?  Now I'm just convinced that everything would have been better had I succeeded,  and all I can think about is trying again.
