I've been sick for a very long time and I really want to get out of this hole I've been living in.15, female. I was born with Neurofibromatosis type 1 and when I was 7 my mom was diagnosed with Hashimoto's encephalopathy. She was no longer the kind mom that would surprise me with a trip to the movies and tuck me in at night with hugs and kisses. My childhood was put to a halt and I was forced to grow up. We were doing good financially until it plummeted and we were in the negatives, and we're still on a strictly tight budget.

The only friend and person I could find comfort in moved away, and changed into a person I hardly recognize.

Not only that, but in late September of this year, I began to get violent migraines. I would pass out at school, get tunnel vision and I was lucky to get 5 minutes of sleep each night. I  had to miss a lot of school so I could just lay in a dark room with the covers over my head, waiting for it to go away. It did not go until I had to go to the emergency room to get an IV stuck in my arm.

Rumors were going around among the teachers and students that I was a stupid loser. My friends rejected me and said that I was faking it to get attention.

Then I got back on track, but only for 3 days. I had to have surgery to remove a fibroma from my back. It took another 2 weeks to heal and I faced even more hate emanating from my friends and mentors.

The migraines came back and I'm more behind than ever in my studies. I can hardly keep any food down and I've lots tons of weight, no matter how hard I try I can't seem to gain any.

I've never resorted to alcohol or drug use, or self-harm. I'm always in so much physical and emotional pain and it's never gone away, I don't think it ever will. 

...I know it sounds so angsty and stupid for a 15 year old girl to come here and say this, but I really need your help.
