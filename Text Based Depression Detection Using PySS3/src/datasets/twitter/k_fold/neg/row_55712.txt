So I want to die......I've had enough of life.

Suicidal ideation is not new to me. But recently it's become much more real. Bit by bit, I'm destroying everything good in my life. Recently I admitted myself to hospital due to a large overdose of painkillers. It was a stupid thing to do. Overdosing on those things isn't likely to kill me.

I'm in a rational, clear-thinking frame of mind right now. I know there are other ways, and that things can get better. But really I don't care. It's not that suicide is my only option...it's the option I *want* to take.

I don't even know why I'm posting here.

Meh, I'm going to try sleep, see how I feel in the morning.
