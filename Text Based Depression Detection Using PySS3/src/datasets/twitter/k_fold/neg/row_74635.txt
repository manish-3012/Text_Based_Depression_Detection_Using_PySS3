I might kill myself tomorrow. I'm not sure I have the guts though or can come up with a plan that will workTomorrow is my last day of break before I return to college. I'm going more days this semester and I'm not looking forward to it. I have no friends at college. I have no friends in person at all actually. I only have one friend, my best friend, but she lives in another country. My anxiety is horrible right now. I'm having about 70 anxiety attacks daily I estimate. My anxiety has been making it difficult for me to fall asleep at night also. Thats when my intrusive thoughts are the worst. That will make school even more miserable if I can't get enough sleep. My medication doesn't work. I haven't been on a medication that has worked. Therapy doesn't do that much. It never really has. Calling a hotline or talking to someone about this won't help because talking doesn't give me friends or completely get rid of my anxiety. I could absolutely enter the career field I want without a degree because these classes are irrelevant but I won't get an opportunity without a degree. No one can convince me not to kill myself so don't even try.
