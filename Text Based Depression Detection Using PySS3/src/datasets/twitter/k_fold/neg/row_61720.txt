I wish i didnt exist.I wish i never existed in the first place to begin with. No one would have been attached to me. I am too weak to face the real world. Im 16 and nothing traumatizing has happened to me and i already feel weak.
I have no passion whatsoever. I have nothing to do that i truly enjoy doing. I have 0 worth as a person.
I sometimes imagine myself having fallen of my balcony and sprawled on the ground with blood around me. It horrifies me.
I dont want to commit suicide anytime sooner because of the effect itll leave on everyone even though theyll move on.
I just wish i never existed. Im completely worthless.
