It's my birthday.When I was 6, I told my nani that I wouldn't live to be an adult. I wouldn't live to be 20. I'm 20 today. And the main feeling I have is wrongness. I shouldn't be here. 

 5 suicide attempts since april. Why am I still alive? Yesterday, my mother-in-law who has taken me under her wing told me she was so happy. That she was going to lay-by my birthday present a month ago but didn't know whether I would be here for it.

I don't want to be here. I have good days, good moments. But it's still so hard. Before, all I wanted was to overdose. Now I'm looking out my window and seeing what damage I could cause (mostly broken leg, or neck if i fall backwards). 

I fantasise between getting my next tattoo at the store near the beach ( a sea creature) and it fades into me jumping off the pier. 

I shouldn't be alive. It's wrong. The world put up with me for 20 years, it doesn't deserve any more. 

Sorry for the ramble. I don't know what to say.
