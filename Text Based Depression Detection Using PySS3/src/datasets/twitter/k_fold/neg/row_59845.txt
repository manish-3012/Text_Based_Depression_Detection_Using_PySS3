Friend is struggling, I don't know what to do. Hey guys,

I've got a close friend struggling with pretty severe depression. She's told me that she attempted suicide and thinks about it all the time. She's seeing a therapist and is on medication but that doesn't seem to be helping (it has only been a few weeks) I don't know what to say, she tells me that she's so close and feels like a burden (which isn't true, which I constantly reinforce) 
I just don't know what to say, I'm not equipped to deal with this accordingly and I feel like I'm letting her down. I've told her to call a hotline, my mother, her sister (who has also suffered with depression) I'm just stuck, please help reddit.
