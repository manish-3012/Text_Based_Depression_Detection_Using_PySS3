Wish I went through with itMore than a year ago, I lived with my mom and step dad. I came out as a trans girl. After months of bickering about gender identity and my mom playing the victim card I was kicked out. In a 10 minute span, I went from arguing with my parents to living and crying in my car at the local park at about 10pm.

I was 18 and still in school. I had to work too, 35 hours a week. I stopped showing up to work and school all together because I was completely catatonic.

There was a stream behind the park and i would fantasise about just drowning myself. I never did.

I still feel like a waste, a burden. I've only been talked to like a child, but also expected to act like an adult. Never have I had a moment to myself, or a moment I didn't have to panic or be anxious over. There was always police needing to be called, a sibling to look after or to parent my parents.

It's been about two weeks since I've harmed myself. Slammed my forehead into my cupped hands for several minutes hoping I'd go into a coma and die. Now I just have a probable concussion or brain damage or some shit, a throbbing headache that won't go away no matter what.

I wish I had killed myself that day. In a perfect fucking timeline that's how my life would've ended. I hope I find the strength and will to end it.
