VentingI feel like killing myself. I wont actually do it, I'm a coward. For the past years I've been mentally hurt more and more each day. It's the people, sometimes you feel like it's okay, but most of the time you feel like shit because of someone... 
Honestly I've been kinda clueless lately about socialising and understanding other people. I had to "chill out" and not care because my head felt like exploding sometimes. 
But of course you can not care only so much until you're full of it. 
I think about killing myself more and more each day.
I feel like my life has no point. It's either death or life full of misery, hard work, annoying people and taxes. Is it really worth it?
I feel lost and I'm so depressed that I actually like it.

Please, just don't say anything like don't kill yourself or life is this or that.. I actually feel like killing myself just because.

I don't really care abput anything at all, school, friends, family, food..
I just want to sleep all day.

I guess I'm just a psycho... honestly who cares. I've been put into different life possition and all my options are shit and going to hurt me or my family.
Quite ironic, bcs family are part of the problem.

Yeah I'm a mess.
