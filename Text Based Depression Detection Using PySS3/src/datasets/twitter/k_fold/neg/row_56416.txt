This is probably like any other post hereSo I've experienced the worst feelings and situations ever.  Been thinking about escaping through suicide many times for 9 years.

Only now I realize I never really wanted to. Things suddenly got worse, I will do it.  There is one thing holding me back and I should get rid of it
