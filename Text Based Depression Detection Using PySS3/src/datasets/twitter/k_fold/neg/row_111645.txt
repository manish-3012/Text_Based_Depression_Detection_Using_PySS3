Afraid of dying? But still want to dieokay i feel like there's always two voices in my head. one is always telling me that it's worth it to end my life because people will get over me and replace me. i know that people literally wont care. like my older sister straight up told me she wouldn't even care if i were to die. but then another part of me is truly terrified of death. like i don't want to be gone forever, y'know? but like i *do* at the same time. like i'm going to die someday, right? might as well get it over with now and stop the pain before i end up pushing people away. 

idk sometimes i feel like im running out of time (even tho im 19) and some weird voice in my head always tells me that i need to beat the clock before it gets to me. that probably makes no sense to anyone but me but yeah.
