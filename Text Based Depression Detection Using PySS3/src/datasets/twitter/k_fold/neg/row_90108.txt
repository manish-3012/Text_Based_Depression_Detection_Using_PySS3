my viewi just wanted to get other opinions on this. i obviously dont feel comfortable talking about this with people i know.

i've had depression for a while and that probably influenced my view on suicide alot. i used to think that suicide was a terrible thing and ooo i'm gonna go to hell if i die blah blah blah but i'm mature enough now to realize that life has no meaning whatsoever. like we as humans have a natural survival instinct, but if we can manage to realize that there is no real purpose to life, then is there a point to keep living? i mean not even to end suffering or because of depression. if there is no real purpose to life then why go on with it? 

i'm sure you guys get this alot but what are your views?
