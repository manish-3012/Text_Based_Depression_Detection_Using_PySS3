24 year old autistic with no futureI am a 24 year old autistic with low giftedness, but they diagnosed me with normal giftedness although I doubt I am normal, with problems with academics and pretty much everything. I am suicidal because I have had pressure from my father, who is a ph d in physics, and my brother, who is studying engineering, to succeed in a STEM major.  I was also bullied in school for my autism and it was the shittiest time of my life. Also lost all my friends because expressed thoughts of wanting to kill others, and/or myself.

I believe my lack of talent is due to genes from my mothers side. She is a religious muslim with what I believe low IQ and I have tried to have her tested for it to prove to my dad that she is stupid, but she will not have her tested. 

Why live when the only job you can have is a janitor?
