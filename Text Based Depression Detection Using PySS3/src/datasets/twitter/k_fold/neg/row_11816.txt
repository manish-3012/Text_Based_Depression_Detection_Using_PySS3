what can I do to help my friend?my friend has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for 10+ years and has tried to kill himself at least twice that he's told me of.

he has a lot of financial stress, his family took him to an inpatient care thing once and the hospital kept him there for 3 days and charged him him a huge bill that he can't pay and his family won't help him 

besides this he has just had a really really terrible hard life and struggles with mental illness as well. I feel so bad for him but whenever he vents to me I don't know what to say. I want to make sure I am being as supportive as possible, I know there's probably nothing I can do to help but I don't want to do anything wrong or not good enough

i'm just really scared for him. His mom has to get an abortion recently and today he told me he feels jealous of it because he wasn't aborted. Things he says to me are terrifying

He is such a wonderful caring talented person with so much ambition and he has so much good to offer the world.

mostly i just let him vent at me when he's upset but all I can ever think of to say is 'yes, that is really horrible I'm so so sorry you feel that way and i hope things get better. I wish I could help you' I feel like this is such a stupid and generic thing to say but I don't know what else to do. I am not good at speaking and i don't have a lot of life experience so it's hard for me to talk to him and relate to him sometimes but i just want to make sure I am not doing anything wrong. 

I try to reassure him sometimes that when he gets insurance from his work soon and can see a therapist things will get better but I really don't know   

he has the means to kill himself whenever he wants. he takes medication that requires needles so he has those around. it's scary
