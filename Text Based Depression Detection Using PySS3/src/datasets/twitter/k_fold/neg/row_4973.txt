Bloodletting gave me mild anemia and I am glad about it.There is a reason  you should only donation 1 unit of blood in 90 days,  
I let a bit more than 2 units in 2 months.   


Chest pain, unusual stress when heart pumping, breathlessness....   
This is how my body finally catching up with my mental stage.   
This is what I deserve.

More like a slow suicide, than an act of  self harm. It feel good to have control over one thing in my own life.
