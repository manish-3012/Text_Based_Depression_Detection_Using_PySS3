He left me. I don't want to go on.I thought we were in love. I thought we were going to get married and start a family. I thought we had a life together.

But I was wrong. He left me. He never loved me. He was using me to support himself and when he didn't need it anymore he left. He was lying all along.

I don't think I want to live with this. It's too much. I don't know what to do with this pain.
