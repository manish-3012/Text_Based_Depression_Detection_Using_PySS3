Hey23. Mookie is what my girlfriend calls me and noodle is what I call her.

Charged with three felonies of varying severity and a misdemeanor. Drug offenses, nonviolent. Compliant, really. Facing time. My dog'll be dead before I get out if they have their way. Even before proceedings I owe a lot of money for bail and the lawyer. I've thrown most all of it away, smart, handsome, modest too if you believe it, thrown it away to a cycle of self loathing and closeted drug addiction.

I love them all so much. I know they love me too. But wouldn't it be easier? It would certainly be easier for me.

I'm steeped in drink. May my heart stop so as to remove from me the daunting task.
