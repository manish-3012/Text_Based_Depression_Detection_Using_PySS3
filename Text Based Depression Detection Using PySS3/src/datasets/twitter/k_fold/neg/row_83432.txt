Just need a little help....I've recently realized I'm not gonna do myself in.... I've fantasized a lot about suicide, but never actually done it (obviously), even though I've had the means. I've sat in my bath tub with a razor, too afraid to cut my wrists, climbed a building once only to find that I was too afraid to jump off. Last weekend I even dragged my grill into my room but was too afraid to dump the coals in and light it. I guess what I'm getting at is that I know I'm not actually gonna kill myself... but what now? Is there any help for the fact that I despise life and wish I could just stop living? I've been all emo tonight, and I'm sitting at home drinking, surfing the internet. I've been trying to listen to songs that kind of fit the mood, but have a positive enough meaning for me to keep going. My suicidal tendencies go back several years... I kind of feel like if this is how it's going to be, I might as well do my best to muster up the courage and off myself... Not really, but what do you do when you've overcome the urge? What makes it worth it to keep going? I'm looking for anything; advice, anecdotes, even a youtube video or song that can make me feel a little better for a little bit.

Thanks guys.
