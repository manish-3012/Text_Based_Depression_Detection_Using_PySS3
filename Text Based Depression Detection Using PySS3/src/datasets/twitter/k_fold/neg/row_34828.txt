50/50 chance to kill myself on Sunday.There is a possibility of me losing my house tomorrow. I have no friends or family to go with whatsoever. There are no jobs here offering housing, and I already stayed at the shelter here.

After you leave you can't come back for a year. I ended up going to inpatient care a month ago so that way the end of my stay. Already asked them). I have -200 in my bank and now a 25.000 hospital bill. Im living in a foreign country and obviously can't go anywhere in this situation.

If I lose my house, I am going to kill myself before Monday. The only reason I haven't done so is because I haven't seen my friend who lives back home. I can't just leave her like this, I love her. But without anywhere to go I'll freeze to death here it's-10 degrees right now. And I've checked everything there is 100% no place to go. I can't do this anymore.
