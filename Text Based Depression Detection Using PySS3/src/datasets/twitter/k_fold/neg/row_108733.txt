My Friend is Suicidal with No Reason to LiveHello,

My friend has been in a marriage with narcissist for 6.5 years and not long ago they divorced.

Also her father passed around that time or so and it was just too much for her to handle.

There was a lot of damage done by a narcissist and she no longer wants to live. She attempted once but was saved by a roommate. She says why live this life when you can end it and all of the problems will be solved.

I heard that narcissistic abuse victims can recover but she just does not want when it is easier to end it. Before all the bad things happened she would also think about reasons to live for. I don't know what to tell her really.
