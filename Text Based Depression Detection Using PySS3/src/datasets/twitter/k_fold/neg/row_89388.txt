Late 40s, recently tried, wondering what I can say without landing in some kind of mandatory supervision?I'm in my late 40s and feel like I'm losing everything that matters to me, everything I've ever worked toward. And most of that without much warning. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow. How much can I tell her about my recent suicide attempt before she has to get some kind of authority involved?

The attempt was real. It was remarkably easy and painless so I am not sharing details. I am not willing to make it easier for all of you to follow my poor example. I lost consciousness and, according to everything I've read, I had to have been within a couple minutes of the start of brain death when it came apart in a very unlikely way. Brain damage terrifies me so I won't be doing this again without better preparation. Hopefully I won't be doing this again, period.

Like most people, I don't want to die but I do want the pain to end. I don't want the people I love to grieve but my own pain has become unbearable. 

I want to get help so I don't feel this need to escape. Like I said, I have an appointment tomorrow. What little I feel like I might be able to salvage of my plans won't be possible if I am in custody, though. Aside from that, maybe it would be the best thing for me? But the cost would be great enough I don't want to risk it.

How much can I disclose to my therapist without putting her in a position where she has to choose between following my wishes versus following her conscience or any legal guidelines? Oregon if that matters.
