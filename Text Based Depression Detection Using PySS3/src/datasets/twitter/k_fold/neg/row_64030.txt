Iâ€™m lostSoo... a few months ago, my dad died from sorosis of the liver. It was kind of sudden, a pretty damn rough ordeal..

At the time, I (23 m) was with this guy (19 ftm) who was living with me. We celebrated our one year about a month or so later. 

After he died, I got incredibly depressed. I started drinking and smoking pot regularly, I was having emotionally charged out bursts and lashing out at everyone and everything. 

He ended up leaving me. I donâ€™t blame him for it, I was a ROUGH person to be around, I realize that. 

But when he left, he said if I sought help, weâ€™d talk about still getting back together. Sooo I admitted myself to a hospital under Suicide watch. There, I was put on new antidepressants that are helping. I made a dedication to see through my recovery.. while I thought heâ€™d be a part of it.

I was there over the weekend. The day I got out, Monday, I learned he packed up his stuff while I was inside and told me the SECOND I got home that I should move on. I know Iâ€™m supposed to go into my recovery for me, for my health, but the thing is.. I donâ€™t really care about myself. Iâ€™ve been passively suicidal for years. I mean, I get why he left, it was for his own health... it just fucking sucks that I had to be kicked while I was down for him to look out for himself. 

Itâ€™s been a few weeks since then. Iâ€™m fighting the urge to just get drunk constantly again. For work Iâ€™ve been delivering for Uber eats and post mates, which has been awesome cause if Iâ€™m feeling too bad to go into work I donâ€™t really have to. But, My mom is really pushing me to get another job, which is one of my MAJOR stress factors. I just donâ€™t feel like I have the mental health right now to maintain a job. Iâ€™ve had breakdowns at work with better mental health before. I mean the thought working at this place is literally making me want to off myself instead. 

Iâ€™m stressed. I so feel abandoned. My house felt so alive 6 months ago, and now itâ€™s never felt so dead. I feel so cornered and trapped. I can feel myself starting to slip again. 

Help?
