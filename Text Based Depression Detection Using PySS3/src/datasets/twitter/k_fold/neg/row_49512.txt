Thinking more and more about suicidefirst of all, i'm trans*. I just started therapy with Amitriptylin (25mg/day) against my ongoing depressions. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm thinking of just ending it all. I'm pre-surgery and feel like a piece of shit. a worthless piece of shit. I just want to end that ongoing pain. Everytime I fall in love with a girl, she is straight, or not interested in pieces of shit like I am. but how could she love me, if i hate myself ... every day is just another day full of pain and feeling like shit, knowing that i somehow have to get through the day, to wait until i can fall asleep and feel nothing again. I don't want that live anymore. I just want it to end. I want to fall asleep and never wake up again. Don't have to struggle through the day anymore. don't have to struggle feeling alone anymore. don't have to be such a worthless piece of shit anymore. I recently did, what i always wanted to do and started a training to become a nurse, but my mind is stopping me. i regularly get panic attacks including passing out sometimes, i regularly just start crying and don't know what to do anymore and want to end it. help me ... please...
