I hate how my life depends on money. I want to run away from the responsibility.Here am I in this subreddit again. I was gonna off myself before the end of 2019 but I failed because I was a coward. When 2020 began, I readied myself to start life anew, to be a better student and work towards the future. But the world did not take my promise to better myself seriously. So much has not gone my way for months now. The world is in chaos, my country is in chaos, my finances are even worse than before... I can't keep up and manage these problems anymore.

I can't even talk to anyone I know about this. My parents will think I am emotionally sabotaging them and that my emotions will add more weight to their growing problems. My sisters are too young and do not deserve to ever know what I am going through. My friends are depressed too, and I don't want to trouble them with my suicidal thoughts. I've depended on my friends too much already because I could never be emotionally open with my parents. I think it's better if I just hide my feelings.

Anyway, because the world is in a crisis, and my finances are in ruin, it won't take long before I don't just go hungry, but also be unable to pay the bills. I hope my parents don't give me a funeral because that's expensive too. 

I'm tired. But being able to write this down has eased my heart a little bit. I don't really want to go. There are so many beautiful things in life. But I am too weak to be able to obtain those things. Every year, I have become a worse version of myself compared to the previous year. I hate myself. I'm ashamed that I've allowed myself to live this long.
