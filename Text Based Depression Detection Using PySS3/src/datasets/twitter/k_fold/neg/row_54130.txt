Failure to wife, familyI survived cancer and a bone marrow transplant years back. Haven't worked in forever. My wife has grown tired of all my issues and how I don't have my shit together. As have I. This is all I have. Without it, I don't know what to do. Yet with it, I'm not doing anything.  Could just stop taking my post transplant meds and it would be a gradual death. But why wait?
