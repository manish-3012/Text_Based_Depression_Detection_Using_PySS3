Has anyone here talked to a professional before? How was that expierence?I am really close to ending it, I always told myself I would wait till my parents pass away but the longer I live the more people care about me.
A few months ago I told my closest friend how I really feel. It was the first time I opened up to someone but I feel like that was my biggest mistake. All he is gonna think about once I am gone is 'How could I have prevented this' and that wasn't my intention I didn't want to make him care more about my well being. I just wanted to vent, I was selfish.
So now he talked me into seeing a professional. I lied and told him I would go, but I just can't see how they could help me my life is fucked no matter if I get pills that dull the numb feeling.

If anyone has gone through therapy or something similar I would really like to know if it actually helped you
