Because I'm a loser virgin in his mid 30's, I will do the world a favor and dieEven through people here may say otherwise, I will do people a favor by killing myself very soon. 

I am an absolute loser. I work a low paid job, failed school because I'm a retard, and I've not had a single friend in my entire life. I'm also in my 30's.

I tried dating but was made fun of and women especially made my life shit growing up. They will be glad to hear I've finally removed myself from the world. I don't blame them to be honest.

I've been in different types of therapy for years now and nothing has made even one second more bearable. I must  die to ensure nobody has to acknowledge my disgusting existence anymore. The only kind thing for me to do is to die, and make sure that I cause myself pain while doing so for my disgusting existence. Trust me, people who knew me as a child had a right to treat me like shit, for I was a loser pathetic piece of shit myself. Why treat a worthless turd anything better than what he is? I'm glad everybody I knew treated me like garbage because I am garbage so it's how I should be treated. 

People have even told me before to kill myself. I agree. I just wish I could cause myself the pain they wanted before I die.

Why shouldn't I end my life?
