I Cant Handle This AnymoreI am a 15 year old girl and I just feel like I can't do it anymore. I've been fighting depression for two years and have lost almost all of my friends. I just can't handle life and what it throughs at me and I just want it all to be over. I know I could be happy and I don't want to die I just can't do all of this anymore. It hurts so much I can't see a way out anymore. I don't want to die I just don't see another option.
