Fighting for survival is such a boring battlegirlfriend is leaving for new york (where shes from) in 3 weeks. i dont know what to do.. everyone i know is moving or too distant or i think doesnt wanna hang out with me. this is a bad time in my life. im gonna move to ny and be with her, i guess? but im also gonna cheat on her while were apart, i think. i need another warm body but at the same time am supposedly in love with her, even though she has kinda gotten fat and im not really attracted to her right now :/. i want someone else to feel good about. ultimately though, my problem is not knowing what the fuck im doing in life. im okay right now with my job but not fulfilled with where i would be going in the career trek. my best friend is blowing me off for new friends and some new bestie who he is "totally in love" with. i dunno guys, im just wondering where the fuck im going from here
