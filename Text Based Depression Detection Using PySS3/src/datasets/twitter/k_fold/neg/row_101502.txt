Iâ€™ve made my decisionI have been bullied from 1st grade till 7-8 grade by a guy who recently left my school (ending the bullying) Yet some of his friends who helped with it will be staying in my school. I have lived since then in fear that it will start again. Itâ€™s gotten so bad that I have trouble sleeping.

Iâ€™ve been holding my thoughts off for as long as I could but Iâ€™m beginning to struggle more everyday. 

Some time ago (In May) I met a nice German guy online. We became friends and I view him as a close friend (maybe even one of my closest friends) we made an agreement that in summer break next year we would meet up.

In June 2021 I will meet him, and after he leaves I will be attempting to kill myself. In that way, I will have fulfilled every promise I have made and go off with no regrets. 

The only thing Iâ€™m scared of is the reaction of my parents, I donâ€™t want to hurt them but I also donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
