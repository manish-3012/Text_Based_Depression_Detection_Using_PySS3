I'm so doneEverything is flooding back to me. All i can thing about it was happened to me. All I hear is the ringing of my exes voice saying how she had it worsen that i was being overdramatic. All I can smell is blood, all i can see is hallucinations, all i can see is the past. Why am I here? Nobody cares about me, nobody loves me. I'm a waste of my family's time, energy, and money. I'm a waste of potential to my friends. I'm worthless. Im everyones punching bag, the only reason people still want me is for my looks and their own wants. They want me, but they don't want me for who I am, I've went through enough experiences to know that. Why am I still suffering? Why can't my misery end?
