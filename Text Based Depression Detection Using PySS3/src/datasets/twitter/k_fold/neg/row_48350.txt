Can't stop thinking about leaving this world behind.I've had suicidal thoughts for nearly 2 decades off and on. But now, they've been every day. Morning and night. Every night I think maybe tonight's the night, and then I just fall asleep. When I wake up, I'm disappointed to have to face another day, and consider doing it before going to work.  All day I think about whether or not to do it when I get home. I'm thinking about a combination of sleeping pills and plastic bag, and/or nitrous in the bag. 

What's got me down the most right now is my car died, and I don't have the money to fix or replace it. It's $35 one way to get a lyft to and from work. My best friend is letting me use her credit card for that right now. Next week I'm on my own. 

But its so much more than that going on in my life, on top of a pandemic and impending civil war. I'm a transguy, my family has disowned me, parents won't let me see or talk to my 2 kids. They tricked me into signing over custody.  I'm being sued for a car accident that was definitely my fault. I'm autistic and lucky to have a job in the first place (I'm a janitor). Now I might be getting my wages garnished. 

My life is just shit, the world is shit. My body hurts, my soul hurts.  I'm so tired. Idk what I'm asking for. I just wanted to put this out there. Maybe someone has some encouraging words for me.
