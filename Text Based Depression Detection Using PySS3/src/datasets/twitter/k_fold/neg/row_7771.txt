It's a daily fightThere haven't been very many days that the thought of ending it hasn't crossed my mind. Sometimes it's just a fleeting thought. Sometimes, like today, it's an elephant on my chest. I got in a tiny disagreement with my significant other today, and it turned into me in tears, fighting myself to not swallow every pill I could find in the house and checking out. I've been diagnosed major depressive, but medication made my suicidal tendencies worse, so I've been unmedicated for years now. I am looking for a job, and I know when I have a steady job it will help me feel less worthless, but the waiting is killing me. Maybe literally. I feel like I can't talk to him about it, because he'll just think I'm overreacting (and maybe that's true.) I still can't help the way I feel, though, and I don't want to die, but I don't want to hurt anymore like this. I don't know if this really makes sense, but I just needed somewhere to say it.
