all i do is hurt and annoy other peoplei try to be better, but i dont even know what ive done wrong usually. people will just get upset in response to something i say, or otherwise be clearly done with my shit. the only one left who enjoys my presence is my dog, and i leave him every fall for college anyway. beyond my irritating personality, i dont have much going on there either. im not smart, but ive already racked up so much debt going to college. im not attractive. i have no skills, nor the self discipline to gain them. im just a failure of a human being, i think, and the kindest thing for me and others would to be to end this failed experiment and cut losses.
