How do I go onIt feels really pointless to do anything when you know full well nothings gonna change and youâ€™ll still be sad the next day and the one after too.
I used to make fun of suicide and think it was selfish but now i know what it feels like to want to end it and would never ever wish it on anyone. Maybe this is karma. Feel like a failiure, like iâ€™m useless and like no one in the whole world gives a shit about me anymore. Havenâ€™t slept in like 2 days.
