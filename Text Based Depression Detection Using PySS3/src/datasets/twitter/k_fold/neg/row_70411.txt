HurtMy boyfriend refuses to unfollow the hot girls he's following on Instagram. He knows it hurts my feelings as well. I know this is something I have to get used to, because he's a guy and also because they all have better bodies than me; and who wouldn't choose to look at those girls with flat stomachs and bigger boobs over me? I know it's stupid, but it hurts so much and makes me not even want to be intimate even more. And what hurts me even more is that when I've told him about me possibly not wanting to be intimate anymore he said it was totally fine with him... Oh my god I hate myself so much
I also added hot guys on my Instagram out of resentment of what he has on his. I don't even like having that shit on my feed or get off to it; I just want him to understand how it feels. But I guess that doesn't make a difference. I just don't know what to do anymore
