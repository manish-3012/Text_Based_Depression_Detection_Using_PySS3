Yep, I'm getting closer and closerUsually at this time of the year I'm not that depressed because I like christmas and spending time with my family. This time around it was ok, but I could feel that something was wrong. Now that everyone's  gone and I'm alone again I feel so bad.

There's also this girl. I started liking hier and impressed myself a lot by doing things that are basically superhuman for me, like approaching her. I thought that maybe it was time for me to be happy after all I have endured, especially as I was also having great success in school after getting back this year.

But she basically killed all these dreams I had in one Facebook conversation today. And I'm definitely not stable enough right now to take that well. I'm supposed to study this week for my finals next week, but I'm not because there's no point. I already said it here but school (and basically everything) doesn't give me any satisfaction. 

I'm pretty sure she was my last chance at happiness. The thought of suicide is creeping up in my head so much it's insane. Few years ago I felt like I could never do something like that, even being depressed and all. And nowadays I'm thinking about logistics while crying in bed.
