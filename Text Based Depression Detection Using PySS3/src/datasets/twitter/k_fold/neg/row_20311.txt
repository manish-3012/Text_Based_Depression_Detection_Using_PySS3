I just don't know what the fuck to do anymoreI figured I would create an account for this because I didn't want to keep this on my main, but in the past 15 minutes or so I've come pretty damn close to doing something I'd probably regret. I'm going to try posting here, because anytime I actually try and ask for help from people I know you only get the "I'm here to help" which just doesn't really work for me.

I guess I just don't know what the fuck I am doing with my life anymore and why I deserve to be alive. Sometimes I feel like I'm not living for my own sake but so that I don't let everyone down around me. But then I think about how if I did go through with it and kill myself well, maybe then people would actually care and try.

The issue is, even if someone really cared, or really tried, I think I would push them away. I have had a therapist twice - both times I despised it. I don't think the concept is terrible, but both treated me like I was a child and talked so condescendingly too me, hell half the time it seemed like they didn't even know what to say. At the end of the day too everytime I picked up the check from the mail I knew that it wasn't worth it and that money could be much better spent on something else.

My last therapist did try prescribing me medication, some days it feels like it completely changes who I am and makes me the person I always wanted to be, and other days, especially right after I do something I know was a horrible decision, I just feel like shit and really want to die for the rest of the day.

It just seems so godamn simple to choose to die rather than keep dealing with feeling like shit. I never feel like I'm good enough, no matter how much I do. I can work myself to the point of wanting to die of stress, or I can stagnate and want to die because I should be working on and improving myself instead of playing games or hanging out with friends.

There's so many different things about myself I could bring up and talk about what's specifically going wrong but I wanted to keep this post short. Thanks for coming to my ted talk, even just listening and being able to know that people are out there who genuinely and actively care is all I ask.
