I don't want to kill myself because life is horrible, I want to die because I hate myselfLong story short, the whole "it gets better" phrase always makes me angry, because I feel that people associate suicide with having a crappy life. Well, my life isn't awful. I was never abused, I have money, I have a roof over my head, but it doesn't matter, because I hate everything about myself. I don't think I'm worthy to live at all, and it shows because I have absolutely no friends or social life and I've never had a girlfriend. In fact, on my 22nd birthday this year, I got 1 post on facebook, no phone calls and my family forgot. 

I just realize that somebody like me is nothing more than a leech on society. I'm a worthless coward with not redeemable qualities, and every time I look in the mirror I feel like throwing up, because all I see is a genetic failure standing before me. I'm incapable of doing anything properly, and the only talent I have is fucking things up. I realize now that, it won't get better. I can change my life, but it won't matter, because I'll still be the same piece of shit my whole life. I just wish I had been aborted, because it would have saved everyone a lot of trouble.

I just want to die because it will free up some space in the world, and I won't have to be a burden on others. That seems like a fairly noble goal. When I was a teen, people always said hang on, you have your whole life ahead of you. Well, now that I don't have it all in front of me anymore, and I know I won't grow out of my own stupidity, I think I would do everyone a favor by blowing my brains out.
