.I think this is it. I think I'm finally ready to kill myself. I don't think I can cope with anything anymore. 

I'm not going anywhere in life. 

I'm failing school. 

My friends hate me. 

My ex-boyfriend doesn't care about me. And all I care about is him. 



I just can't cope any longer. In my head, I know it's all trivial, but..

I think I'm ready to be done with pain. 

EDIT: Thanks to those that took the time to read this (and leave helpful comments). I'm sorry if anyone got worried or anything. Tomorrow I plan to get help (and hopefully checked into a hospital) because I'm aware my life is in danger, and I do need help. Sitting around at home waiting for 4 more months to see someone to help me is not going to help. 

Again, thank you guys. Sorry if your time was wasted.
