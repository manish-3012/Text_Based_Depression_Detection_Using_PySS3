I've had increasing suicidal thoughts for over a week. I'm uninsured and want to get help.I believe I am suffering from severe depression, and likely an anxiety disorder. I am not currently insured, and unfortunately can't enroll in a paid or free plan until open enrollment in November. I don't know that I can afford to see a therapist right away, but I believe I need to at least see a doctor who can prescribe something to help with my depression. I have no idea where to start with finding a doctor or any part of this process.

My work environment, unfortunately, is also feeding into my feelings of despair. I work in proximity with individuals who are also having suicidal thoughts, which is really rough.

I'm recognizing that my current feelings and symptoms are severe enough that I need to receive some sort of immediate assistance, but I'm not sure how much I can get while paying out of pocket. I've been feeling suicidal for over a week- a combination of life circumstances and whatever is wrong with my brain- and it's been getting increasingly hard to overcome these thoughts. I'm afraid I'm going to call my bluff.
