Planning a festive-coloured Christmas suicideI wanted this year to end on a positive note, so after another failed overdose and deciding overdoses are fucking stupid and unreliable now, I'm going to cut myself to death and freeze outside. On Christmas Eve, i'll run around the neighbourhood and watch the snow turn red with myself. I fucking hate Christmas. I want to mock the fake and commercialized day where everyone pretends having a loving family is a given, normal and mandatory thing.

Everyone treats me like a disposable thing, so i will dispose of myself. When i'm gone, you won't have any more children to beat, since the other one ran away. Too bad. Checkmate. I win.
