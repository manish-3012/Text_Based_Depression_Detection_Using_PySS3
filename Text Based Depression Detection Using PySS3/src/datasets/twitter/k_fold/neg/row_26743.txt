She's planning to die.Someone who I met over the internet that I know only over the internet, that I've been talking to for multiple months, has just told me today that she plans to kill herself in a couple weeks, or perhaps even a shorter time frame.

I'm scared and I've no clue what to do. She lives in a totally different state than me. She's jobless and out of school. She called herself a NEET. Not Employed, in Education, or in Training. She says she'll have enough money to last 2 weeks. Then she can move in with her SO, however she stated right after she said that, that she would kill herself instead of doing that.

She see's herself as worthless and alone. Rejected by everyone else, even her own parents.

I care about her so fucking much I can't even put it into words. I'm afraid I'll say something wrong. I'm hoping that she'll still be here tomorrow, but I don't have much time left.

Please... I need some help. I don't have any information about her other than a First name, Last initial, and State. I don't even know if she lied to me about any of those. She might have, just to stop me from tracking her.

The only contact I have with her is online through Steam, which is a gaming service. No phone number, email, or anything of the sort.

EDIT: I've talked to a Suicide live chat online, same organization as the guys who answer the hotline, and have things I'm planning to do. Getting her phone number is a #1, and perhaps other ways of contacting her. Though I'm still extremely afraid that I'm walking on a sheet of ice that's no wider than my printer paper.
