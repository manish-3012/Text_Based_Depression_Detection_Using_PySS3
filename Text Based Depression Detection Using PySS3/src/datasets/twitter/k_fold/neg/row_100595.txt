Death And The Fear Of DeathI donâ€™t want to be here anymore not because Iâ€™m worried about leaving anyone devastated because even if anyone cared they would get over it 
I canâ€™t leave because I canâ€™t fathom death or what that would be like 
The fear of death is the only thing keeping me here 
But itâ€™s starting to look like whatever death is, itâ€™s a lot better than this.
