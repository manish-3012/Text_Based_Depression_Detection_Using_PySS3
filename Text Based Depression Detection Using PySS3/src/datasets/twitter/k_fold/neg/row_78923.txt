I have those thoughts. Suicidal thoughts. I have them. Why? 
My childhood was good at times. But also horrible. My mother died when I was only 8, she died right beside me... Still have those images of her dead body. But before she died, my dad, my mom and I were a family. A happy one. But then I don't know what exactly happened. My dad and my mom fought. Not just vocally but physically as well. It was not a pleasant site to see. After that, my mom and my dad separated.Then life became downhill. She died, I moved in with dad. Dad and me argue. Step-Mother and me argue. Feel like they want me gone. 
Another thing is that I have a girlfriend. But sometimes i feel like she deserves better. I just don't know how to explain this. 
TL;DR: Childhood was crappy. Feels like everybody is better off without me.
