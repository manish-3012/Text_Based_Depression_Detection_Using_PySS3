14 years old, looking forward to death.Mother dropped me out of school at the start of my first highschool year, ive tried to go back but i cant deal with the emotional stress and  trauma of the past 2 years. Shes psychopathic and manipulated me to disturb my father who had recently divorced her. The family house was hectic as constantly throughout the day and night she would antagonize me to hurt my father, though me and him left in no time, 

I dont wanna go to into it honestly, typing this shit out is annoying. My mother is psychopathic narcissist who will be the reason i die at 14. Alots happened and my father is dealing with alot of false court cases submitted by her and im going back to her house to stay for a while in 2 days, been thinking about suicide for over 2 years now as i dont see a way out of my situation and i think i might commit soon.

TL;DR, my mothers insane and wants me dead
