lonely and desperateidk what to do anymore i don't trust anyone in my life anymore and i think they are either trying to sabotage me or don't want me in their company. it's really draining to not be able to even trust your own mom when shes the only person i really have left. if anyone wants to talk to me i'd be happy to have a conversation even if it is just momentary i would really appreciate it. idk i think even my family has begun to lose hope in me because i'm just getting worse everyday and isolating myself more. i'm just so paranoid everyone hates me i can barely move sometimes and it really limits my whole life and what i am able to do. i miss being blissfully ignorant but now i am too aware and i can't even distract myself from how lonely i am. nothing makes me happy and even when i am happy i beat myself up until i'm sad again. i'm just really devastated about being so alone but i hope it will change eventually. i'm trying to stay alive but i'm so miserable but my mom will kill herself if i do and my brothers are too young to be without her. i don't know what to do anymore i feel like there is no escape sometimes. it's like i'm just stuck in a corner watching the same shitty movie on loop. nothing feels real and i desperately need someone in my life right now.
