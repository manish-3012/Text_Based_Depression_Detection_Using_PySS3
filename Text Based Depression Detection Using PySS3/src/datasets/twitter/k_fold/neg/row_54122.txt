The only way is to have never existed.Another entry while I'm in this deepening pit.

I feel bitter towards everything, and the specific people who could have helped but just sat back and watched and laughed, cringed, avoided, assumed I was autistic or something (I'm not apparently). But even when I think back to when there could have been an intervention - by a school, "loved one", doctor etc. - it feels like it \*still\* would have been too late. I want a hug so badly (ideally from a mother-figure who isn't a cunt,) but I know it wouldn't help. I want someone to tell me I have something to live for and that I deserve to live like I love myself, but again I can't see that changing anything at this point. Services that provide counsellors/therapists to "help" just sound like cogs in the machine now. 

I clearly am not fit for that phenomenon where people overcome their issues and have fulfilling lives where they can help others by being the adult they needed growing up. I truly cannot see myself as a content person, because then it's like I would be going against the grain of who I really am. I can only imagine myself dying asap or spending my life spiralling in god knows how many directions, and wasting resources that more functional people can use. I'm too tired, too bitter, too sad to give a shit about anything. 

Pity doesn't work either, which may seem weird since I'm posting here. I just wanted my thoughts 'out there'. Funny that the best moments of the great "uni experience" so far has been me drowning in wine and vodka by myself. I can't wait to leave these naive idiots thinking that there are good people out there who don't abuse children.
