A song triggered me but i keep listening to itMy friend shot himself in the head in 2018. This sparked a huge curiosity into guns, bullets, and suicide by gun for me. I can read about it and not be bothered. But the song â€œPumped Up Kicksâ€ triggers the memory of my friend. It also triggers the picture of the columbine shooters dead in the library. i keep thinking of the photo and its fucking me up. i heard the song at around 4pm today, and while in the shower (around 10pm) i had a maladaptive daydream which was i think half an hour long. I just got out of another one, and this time is was around an hour long. 

My dad had to watch me like a hawk because i was talking and walking around. Iâ€™m prone to walking into things, and even though he was watching me i ran into my bookshelf and took a chunk out of my nose. 

These thoughts of cutting and shooting myself and just giving up keep flooding my mind and i cant take it.
