I think I might have a temp solution to this torture.I was really close to killing myself until my parents left the house and I decided to go to Teamspeak and talk to people. I HAD SO MUCH FUN BUT IT ENDED WHEN THEY CAME BACK. So, can you guys tell me what to do about this? I cant talk on my mic with those bitches at home because they are paranoid and out of touch and nosey. How do I get an alone place to talk with all my stuff intact like computers and the games and the mic. Should I move to an apartment or what? I didnt know where to put this post in what subreddit, so i put it here. If someone does remove this, please tell me where to post this then.
