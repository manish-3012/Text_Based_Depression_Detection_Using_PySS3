I feel I've become defunct as a humanThere's not many people i can open up to right now and just vent all my concerns. Every day, it seems like my mind slowly tiptoes into dark thoughts without my consent. At this point I've been depraved of someone I can just talk to about feelings without having the risk of being patronized or treated differently.

I don't know, I really do want to become a functioning member of society and raise a family, but I can't maintain that drive on a day to day basis. Some days go well and some days don't, but it seems like those ends get more extreme as time drags on.

Not many will read this, and I've resigned to my fate. I just wanted to get this out there, and hope all of you guys are doing fine.
