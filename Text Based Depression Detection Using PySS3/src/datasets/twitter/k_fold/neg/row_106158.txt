Lost the love of my life and can't live with the guilt anymore.I don't see things ever getting better, and if they do, so what? My life has always been shit but recent events have just confirmed I really must do this, to end my pain, anxiety, sadness, guilt and regret. Not today, but eventually. That's the only comforting thought I have. I have a found a reliable, quick, and painless method. I just need to get my affairs in order first. I'm willing to listen to reasons to live, but only because I have no one to talk to about this and a miracle isn't going to happen anytime soon.
