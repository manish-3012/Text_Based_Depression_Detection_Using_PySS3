At a bad placeGuys I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this. I'm just not sure if I'm strong enough to share this with anyone else at this point. I'm pretty emotional right now and not thinking clearly but I hope I can still get my feelings across.

I'm currently in medical school. I'm at a real bad place right now. I made some poor decisions early on and I just...I don't know how to deal with it right now. I fucked up really badly. Just fucked fuck fucked fucked fucked fucked fucked fucked FUCKED myself.

I'm not really sure how to put this. Fuck. I made so many mistakes so early on I just can't believe how dumb I was. I made it into medical school. I was happy. I spent half of my fourth year at probably one of the happiest points in my entire life. I knew that I had gotten into medical school early, that I had achieved my goal. I cut back my courseload considerably, hung out with my friends as much as I could, and met an amazing girl (who is also now in medical school). Literally less than 2 years later and I'm a complete fraud and I don't even know how I can continue. 

I started medical school. Shit was a mess right away. I was in the right mindset and completely relaxed, yet I'm not sure. I guess the laid back attitude got to me? Right after orientation the hard stuff came on fast. Everyone else could deal but I couldn't. The night before the first exam, I realized I was completely fucked. So I cheated. I cheated, then cheated, then cheated, then cheated. I fucked up so bad I can't even believe things are so fucked. I had never cheated in my life until that moment and I just fucking can't believe things ran away so fucking quickly. WHERE IS MY LIFE!!?!?!kjsalfjsajflsajflsajf;lsalfsal;f;lksajflksajflksajflkjsaf;jsajf
