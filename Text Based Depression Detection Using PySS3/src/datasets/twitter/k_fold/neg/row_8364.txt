Don't know how to get betterI'm at my wit's end. My medication runs out this week. I've moved back home to care for my mother and there are no psychiatrists in my area who will see me due to lack of insurance or due to refusal to accept self referrals. I tried 211 but they couldn't find anything. I can't afford to go to the hospital. I'm scared I won't make it past New Years.
