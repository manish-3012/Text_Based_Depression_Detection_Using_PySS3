i made an emergency appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow but iâ€™m scared to admit out loud how dark iâ€™m feelingiâ€™ve been really really struggling and this weekend i decided i was going to kill myself, and i posted on here about wanting to tell someone in my life before i do but not knowing who to tell. i had a bunch of people reach out and honestly it touched me. it makes me sad that i got more support in one day from strangers on reddit than i feel in my entire life, but it stopped me enough that i went into my psychiatricâ€™s office this morning and made a â€œsafety appointmentâ€- basically meaning iâ€™m at risk of seriously harming myself and i need urgent help. 

iâ€™m going to meet with him tomorrow and i am absolutely terrified to say out loud how dark of a place iâ€™m in right now. i almost had a panic attack at the office this morning just checking the box on the intake form to confirm that i was at risk of harming myself and it was urgent. how do i find the words to tell him how dark i feel? iâ€™ve become so good at pretending to be happy and okay that i donâ€™t know how to talk about it. iâ€™m so scared and i feel so anxious, shouldnâ€™t this appointment be helping me?
