can't deal with life anymorewarning: past suicide attempt mention and generally fucking annoying


the combination of school, living in this house, and living with PTSD and ADD is making me want to kill myself. i've wanted to kill myself since i was 8, the earliest i can remember clearly imagining how to. I've already failed suicide twice but since my family hides all the "resources" now, there's no real out for me. I'm still looking into it. I don't have my permit or license yet since I failed the learners test the first time. I've been in a constant panic state since 3PM yesterday, it's almost 6AM now and I should have been studying for at least some of that time. 


I can't focus in class because of my fucked up PTSD brain, yet realistically I know I wouldn't do much better in the real world with a job. did fine my first semester but now I'm only taking two classes, one in person and the other online, and the one in-pperson class keeps sending me into these anxiety attacks. It's too late to drop, there's only 3 more weeks, but I can't bring myself to go to classes more than necessary. I've already pushed missing class so much. I'm cheating on all of the assignments to get by. I feel so pathetic. 

Also my family has no money so I doubt I'll be able to afford books or even attend next semester. So I have to get a job. I don't know how I'll get a job when I have no skills, no positive traits, nothing. I'm nothing and I feel so pathetic. If I went to a hospital AGAIN it wouldn't help and would only end up costing my family wasted money they don't have and time. I wish we had the right to choose to die. I want to die. I can't cope with life. I have tried and failed over and over again. Nothing is going to get better. I'm almost 19 and literally no part of it has been enjoyable besides the things that bring me out of my life. Like sleep, or reading. The only time I felt true, light-headed relief was moments after my second, nearly successful attempt. I remembered absolutely nothing of the unsettling things that happened in the hours after. I want to feel like that again and i know i'll never feel that way without taking action. you don't come across that level of happiness/relief in reality and even if there is a way, i don't fucking care to find it unless it's the end to my story. i don't want to go from that happiness to going back to the regular depression and pain. everything in my life since then has been so miserable in comparison. i wish we had the right to choose to die, because we're going to keep fucking doing it in these painful and horrific ways all alone. suicidal people don't get support, only the illusion of support through years to decades of making them endure therapy and medications that don't work.
