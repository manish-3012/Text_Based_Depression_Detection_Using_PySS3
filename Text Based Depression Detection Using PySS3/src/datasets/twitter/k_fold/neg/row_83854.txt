I can't believe I'm hereIT feels weird to be on a suicide watch page. I have always thought I was a super successful person. I have a great job, a master's degree, an intelligent brain, a fair amount of looks and some faith. Yet I am in a problem today that seems insurmountable. I have been trying my hardest to seek resolution for 4 years. It has been a painful 4 years. I am so close to giving up. The only thing that has kept me alive is that where I live it's not easy to kill yourself. I have no access to drugs I can OD on or pills. I looked up more violent options but will never have the courage to go through with it. Am I silly to kill myself because I can;t solve a problem? Do you need to have bigger issues to be eligible for suicide?_x000D_

My problem is that I have to choose between my faith and my husband. I love him very much and he loves me back - however my faith does not permit us to live together. _x000D_

TL;DR: I want to end my sad life but don't know how.
