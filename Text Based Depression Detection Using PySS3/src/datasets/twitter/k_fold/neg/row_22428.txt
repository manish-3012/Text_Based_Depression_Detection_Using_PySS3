A little help neededThrowaway since my girlfriend knows my Reddit.

And sorry for a possibly disorganized post, my thoughts are a jumble atm.

For the past year, Iâ€™ve been feeling increasingly irritable and have wild wild mood swings. Iâ€™m not sure if I have anger issues, but I think I do since Iâ€™m always reacting aggressively to everything that annoys me. Iâ€™m always angry or upset at something, and I really canâ€™t help it since most of the time itâ€™s an in-the-moment thing. It isnâ€™t until everything has simmered down that I reflect on what Iâ€™ve done and feel absolutely horrible about it. 

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m exactly suicidal, but every time I get really mad I either think in my head over and over â€œI wanna dieâ€ or â€œI want to kill xâ€ to try and not lash out. There arenâ€™t many instances at all where Iâ€™ve lashed out, but Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™m approaching the limit. Recently when I get angry, my arms tense up like I want to grab the person and swing them to the ground, but I just leave the situation in a fury. Previously I would just feel angry and leave, but now I feel like Iâ€™m going to explode any moment. I scared that when I do, Iâ€™m going to harm myself or harm someone else. I donâ€™t want to die, but when Iâ€™m in that rage itâ€™s all I can even think about. I just end up crying every night in guilt because I feel so miserable that I even thought about it. 

Sorry if this doesnâ€™t count as suicidal, I donâ€™t know where else to post since Iâ€™m fairly new to reddit. Iâ€™ll repost elsewhere as needed.
