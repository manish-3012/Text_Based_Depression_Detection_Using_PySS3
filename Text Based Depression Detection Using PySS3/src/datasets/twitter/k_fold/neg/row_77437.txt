I've been thinking about taking pills a lotReddit, 

I need help. I'm back in therapy, but already I wish I hadn't bothered and had just ended it all a while. 
I'm scared I'm going to do something awful to myself. I keep thinking about how many people love me and how selfish it would be. I have student loans of exhorbitant rates to pay off. I have a roommate who I think still cares about me (long story), and I do have family. But is that even enough anymore for me? 
I sometimes feel like it would just be easier for me to take something and just end it all now. 
I'm a Christian, I don't believe that my immortal soul would be in danger if I did it. Yes, I think God will be disappointed in me, but what's the point of living here anymore? 

I need help. I don't really want to die because I'm scared. Please help me.
