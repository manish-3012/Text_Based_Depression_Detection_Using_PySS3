How do I go about getting myself committed?So the last few days I've held a kitchen knife to my wrists, pressed it in, moved it a little, but no actual cut. I figure that is probably not good so I'm thinking about going to a mental health facility and asking them to lock me up for a bit, if that's even how it works. Does anybody have any information on this they can share with me? Do I go to the nearest hospital ER and tell them I'm suicidal? Is there a specific thing to search for on the internet?

Let me add something else, it needs to be free. I think I literally have $130 in my bank account and that's all the money I have in the world. It can't be free now and they bill me later. I'm 31 years old and I live with my parents. Your typical basement dweller except without the basement. I also don't want my parents to have anything to do with it; I'd like to go to the hospital on my own. I'd like to tell my parents that I'm going to commit suicide and give them time to prepare but that is stupid. My plan has always been to wait until they die and then off myself so they won't have to go through that pain and I'd like to stick to that but I really think I'll go through with it if I don't get help soon.

Please help, I need all the info you can give. And also, please explain it to me like I'm five years old. I'm smart with some things but I'm a moron at actually accomplishing things in the real world. Thank you in advance.
