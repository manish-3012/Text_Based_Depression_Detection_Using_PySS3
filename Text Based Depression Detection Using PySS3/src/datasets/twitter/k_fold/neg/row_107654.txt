Closer than ever beforeI want to do it. I have everything planned. I have no one to go to. I'm scared. I wish I had a reason not to. I hate writing in these fucking things but there is literally no one esle to talk to and I don't even have a house ohone to call you on anymore since you did what I stupidly fucking asked and blocked my number but you DONT WANT to hear my voice any way

i can't do it anymore
