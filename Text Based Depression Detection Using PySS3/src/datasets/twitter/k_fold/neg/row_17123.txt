I just want to die but i'm too scaredI want to die. I wish i could. I just want the guts to do it, just fucking do it!! but i can't. I'm just such a pussy for pain. I just want the endless torturous cycle to end, i want to feel what true happiness feels like, not this. not this fake ass 'i'm okay' version of happiness. i want to just be able to wake up and not want to die, to be able to go a day without that sinking feeling in my chest. It feels like that feeling in your chest after you cry alot, that heavy gray sinking feeling all the time every second of every day. I want to just lift the weight off my chest and let someone else carry it. I'm sick of my small flashes of happiness being torn away from me. I hate it. I hate this. You know, sometimes when I feel depressed, a thing that always helps me is going to a website where you can anonymously listen or vent to people. I go as a listener. I always listen to their problems, and give heartfelt advice. In all my years of living, nobody has done the same to me. Nobody will ever just sit down and listen to me, and give me ACTUALLY HELPFUL ADVICE OTHER THAN "thIngs gEt bEtTer" BECAUSE ITS BEEN HELL FROM THE START! I just cant go on! When will I stop being in ruins? when will I sleep happily? When will I be able to walk past someone and look them in their eyes? when will I be happy? I hate this and I just want to throw up. I'm so sick of all this shit. I just have to sit here on this earth and suffer deep inside and hate everyone.
