Can't stop cryingI'm so tired of everything. My dog passed recently, my hours at work were cut, my daughter says she'd rather live with her dad cuz or house has no food. I'm disappointing her so much. Im just overwhelmed and having your own child say you suck because shes hungry is a horrible feeling. I just want to curl up and die. Im so dehydrated I'm running out of tears.
