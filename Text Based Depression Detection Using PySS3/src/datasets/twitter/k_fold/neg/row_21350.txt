Today has been one of the roughest days in a while!I only got three hours of sleep today, I havent been able to get good sleep in such a long time and it's killing me. I dont know how much longer I can go on like this, I just want to feel like someone appreciates all the hard work I put into school and life, no one seems to care, I dont get the point anymore. I dont know how much longer I'll be able to live like this ):
