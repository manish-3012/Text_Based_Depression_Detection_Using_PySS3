It's getting worseI posted a little while ago, but shit is getting really bad fast. I tried reaching out to a friend in real life but their advice was "get drunk" and now they're ignoring me. I began giving myself cold burns with a can of deodorant and now all my mind can think about is tying a plastic bag over my head and filling it with deodorant. I'm sure it's a side effect of zoloft. I just thought I'd post this in case I go through with it and don't make it.
