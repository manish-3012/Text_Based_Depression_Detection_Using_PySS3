Suicide is more humane than a miserable life.I donâ€™t want to be sad forever. 

Iâ€™ve tried many different medications to try to fix my bipolar 1, but none of them seem to affect me. Iâ€™ve had a couple really great therapists who always listened and made me feel comfortable, but nothing they tried worked. Iâ€™ve put in so much effort into my mental health just to sink lower. 

Iâ€™ve watched my mom, whoâ€™s in her 50s, struggle with depression and anxiety for as long as Iâ€™ve been alive. I can see her toxic behavior showing up in my life now and I donâ€™t know how to stop it. Itâ€™s automatic. 

Iâ€™m in my 20s and I refuse to drag myself through life for 30+ years. I feel like suicide is much humane than that. My plans are made and itâ€™s time to go.
