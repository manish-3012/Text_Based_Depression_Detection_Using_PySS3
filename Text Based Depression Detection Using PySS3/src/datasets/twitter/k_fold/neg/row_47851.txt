Online friend threatening suicide.I have been talking with someone online anonymously for some time now. They have expressed their depression and desire to commit suicide. I am posting here as I don't know what I can do in this situation. I am concerned for this person and greatly appreciate any advice. 

I know about the resources listed here, but due to my communication with this person being text only I'm not sure how to proceed.
