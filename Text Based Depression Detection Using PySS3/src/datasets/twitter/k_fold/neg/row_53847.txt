Exhausted from the painI have been depressed for a good portion of my life, yet I'm still just a kid. Grew up in a family where mental health was awful, all of them had a medical diagnosis. I'm scared because I have no idea of who I am and if I talked with a therapist I'd either be put in a psych ward for the rest of my life or they wouldn't believe me. I have no memories from anything past 14... I don't know why and everything that I have in my mind is fabricated from what I've heard other's talk about how I was when I was younger... I kinda assimilated their stories and now I tell them as if they were my own.

There are too many wrong things with me and the fact that I manipulated my way out of therapy and they said I was "good to go" is one of the reasons that made me not believe in therapy. How the hell can you be a therapist and not being able to catch a kid who is a HORRIBLE liar?

I have a feeling that either I'm too confused, broken or that I have some other kind of personality disorder. It's like I switch back and forth with this two personalities, one is really peaceful, has forgiven everyone who has done me wrong, wants peace, wants to change the world, wants to help people, enjoys the little moments, is calm. The other is full of hatred, angry, doesn't forgive anyone and holds grudges for an eternity, wants to destroy, is always angry at the world and has anger issues. 

The only thing that both of them in common is being suicidal. I'm tired of being suicidal because I know I'm a coward and possibly will never go forward with it and that actually hurts me MUCH more because I'm tired of being trapped inside my head, I'm tired of explaining problems that I have that are not "relatable" or that others can understand. I'm too complicated and my feelings are too confusing for anybody besides me to understand.
