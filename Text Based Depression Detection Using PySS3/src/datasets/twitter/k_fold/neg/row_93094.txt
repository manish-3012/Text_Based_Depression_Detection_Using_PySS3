1/25After vaguely contemplating suicide for a while since freshman year, today was the day that it all became very real. I felt the motivation for living completely drain away from me, this whole day was an eternal battle to either end it all tonight or stay alive.

I'm here, so I haven't killed myself (Win for me?). I don't know what to do, life doesn't seem worth it anymore. Seems like everyday I lose more motivation and the person I don't even want to look in the mirror anymore because I don't even know who I am.

I'm between a hard place and a rock emotionally and mentally, but I'm still here. So I guess that's a win.
