There is just no point anymore. I'm a fuck up and I always will be.I got charged with possession of marijuana. All my hard work was for nothing. No med school for me now. What is left? Working at a gas station or being a striper I guess. I should just end it now, no one would really care much after a while. My parents have 5 other kids to worry about and my friends will forget about me easily.
