God keeps hurting meIve been suicidal for over a year now. I tried to fight it. I travelled. Ive let friends and partners in but I just keep on hurting. Sometimes I feel like my old self. Today, it's back. 

I rejoiced with the fact that all this is just time. Time to feel the pain. Time to be happy. Time for this life to end. Im happy that I wont live forever. I can get hit by a car. I can have cancer. I can end all this.
