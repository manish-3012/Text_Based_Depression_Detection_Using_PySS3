I the worlds worst motherEdit: title is I am, jesus I cant even do that right

How could I even contemplate destroying my family's lives like this. Why can't I stop myself from wanting to leave. I feel like the worst mother in the world. I feel like an awful human. I have these wonderful children whom I love more than life. One is not even a year old yet and she's the reason I get up everyday because my older kids are pretty independent. She makes me get out of bed and make food and clean and play with her. The small bursts of joy I feel are usually of her doing. So why am I so sad? I should be so grateful. So many people would love to be in my shoes. I feel so selfish. 

Today, as I was pouring hot water for my tea. I watched the steam with lust. I wanted to singe my skin. I wanted to feel. I wanted the pain. I have a history of self mutilation and I haven't since I had my kids but I have to fight the urge everyday. I have to will myself not to carve my skin or bite my hands or burn my body. 

I have a bf, I live with. He would be responsible for all three of our daughters and I feel so guilty. I feel guilty he would have so much on his shoulders but I doubt he'd miss me. He's really here for the kids and I'm incredibly alone. What now?
