I'm doneI'm here to have random people tell me I am worth something. To have at least one last hurrah before I go. I know what I want to do, I want to fucking die. The pain is just too much to bear. I hate everything about myself. I'm lazy, I have a big ego, I have no real friends, I'm a fucking weaboo who finds imaginary friends in anime like Anohana and Sakurasou, I cry myself to sleep, I'm all around socially awkward, and I just want to die.

And there's nothing you can do about it because I'm doing it in 3 days.

* UPDATE

I have been thinking a lot these past few days about suicide, and I think it'll help me feel better if I tell people my story.

I remember when I was 13 my dad just fucking had it with my antics. I was a naughty kid, I still am, I don't know why. So anyway what he did was he didn't talk to me for a year.

It hurt. And that's when thoughts of suicide seemed to be the solution. For a year, I lived without a father. He wouldn't talk to me, or look at me. If I fucked up in some small way he would look at me as if I were a fucking disease. Living without the comfort of someone who loves you is hard. Especially when that someone is around you 24/7. So you end up feeling like a little worthless piece of shit that no one loves. Every time I mess up I hear shit like "Are you fucking retarded?" or "I fucking hate you." or I wish you were never born."

The last one really stings. I'm 15 now, and my dad and I are meh now but my mom started getting really abusive when my dad lost his job. Since then all my dad does is take care of my baby brother and stay at home.

So when mom is home, you know that all the stress of work will come to you. Also, I'm pretty sure my mom hates my dad. And it's really hard knowing that you don't have a family anymore. But most of all, it's hard knowing that no one will ever love you ever again the way your parents did.
