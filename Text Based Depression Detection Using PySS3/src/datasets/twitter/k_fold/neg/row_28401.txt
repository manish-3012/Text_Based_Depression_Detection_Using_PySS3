The Realization That You're The Outsider.In the end, I think the universe is made up of energies. They may take on various forms of existence, but they always exist in some way. I think those energies have a place that is home to them, but sometimes they can wander somewhere else that can be foriegn to their nature. I think that may be the reason why I (and a lot of others) feel so out of place in this world. While we took the form of a human being, we may not know exactly how to BE one. Human nature may not be our nature. It may be better, it may be worse than ours... but its different. Maybe that's why I've never felt at home here. Maybe that's why no one likes me. I'm just not a natural vibration or energy for the energies of this world. I don't know. That's why I'm releasing myself soon.
