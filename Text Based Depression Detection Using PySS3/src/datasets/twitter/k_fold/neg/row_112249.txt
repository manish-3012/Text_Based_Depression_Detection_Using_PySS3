I feel the human race had one chance and blew it.I don't need to explain this in too much detail, it's pretty obvious so i'll give three examples.

Climate change, countless people say it's happening yet oil companies still convice people it's fake along with politicians questioning it. China has been increasing coal usage making it much worse.

Coronavirus, most of it could've been prevented but nobody believed it until it happened because their "favorite influencer" said it was overexagerated. And now people have rioted in the streets killing and causing a higher infection rate. 

Presidental election is going to start more riots I promise you.

It seems like killing myself is mercy for whats next to come.
