Tried OD (15 months ago so not current)It was in Aug 2019. I took a bunch of Prozac (which had no good effects for me)  and Paxil and Tylenol and booze and maybe some Benadryl too, I donâ€™t remember, and maybe a couple other things in the medicine cabinet, and hoped I would make increasingly bad decisions with all the Prozac and booze, maybe go drown myself or jump in front of a car or pick a fight in the hood I would be sure to lose. Unfortunately, I just cried a bunch, posted on this forum, and went to sleep. Thinking abt upping my dedication and trying again but last year was such a stellar failure. I donâ€™t even know how to buy more dangerous drugs. Iâ€™m so good at sucking at life. But Iâ€™m also too incompetent to pull the plug.
