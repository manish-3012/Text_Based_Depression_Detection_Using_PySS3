How quickly can someone become suicidalI want to know because I may underestimate how quickly someone can change. I'm right now quite worried on my friend , who hadn't been anywhere suicidal, become so as he puts very high expectations on his physics's results. He will obtain his results today and I don't know how he would react if it's extraordinary bad.
