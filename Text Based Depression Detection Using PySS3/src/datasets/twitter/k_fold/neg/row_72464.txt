Why do people say they care about you?I'm close. Very close. Spoke about it to someone I've barely spoken to and it's ruined what was left of my life. She said she did it because she cared about me and wanted me to live, but I could count the times I've spoken to her in person on one hand and I can hardly see any effect I've had on her life or the lives of others. Since this is a support community full of anons, I was hoping to gain some insight on why people who I hardly know - or not at all - would care about me at all. Why do people care so much? If my attempt fails, I'll be ridiculed at school for 'wanting attention' and the like, but if it succeeds I can guarantee there'd be a lot of bullshit from people who would say they cared about me. Is it even possible to seperate these people from the people who could... genuinely care, as nonexistant as they are?
