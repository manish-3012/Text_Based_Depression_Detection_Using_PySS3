I got yelled at by my dad and my first thought was suicide. I'm an adult. I shouldn't be this way.My dad is my boss.

I haven't been 100% lately. Between getting sick frequently, breaking off a 6 year long relationship and coming out to my family... I feel really lost.

Something I can always count on though... is whenever I mess up and my dad tells me that I need to do better, my immediate thought is "oh no, you've fucked up, you need to kill yourself".

I can't understand it anymore.

Why am I allowing myself to think this way?
