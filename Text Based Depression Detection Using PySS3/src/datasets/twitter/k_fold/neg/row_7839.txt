would people miss me if i die?i should start this post saying that i am NOT planning to kill myself at this  current time  and i am sorry if this post is not meant to go here but i don't know were else. 

i am a 16 male who is currently in his 1st year of college. i have a met a few people who i now consider friends and am still connected with a good bunch of my old ones.

i have healthy relationship with my parents and teachers but there has been an idea that has plagued me for awhile.
     
would people miss me if i die?

in the sense that if i kill my self...would any one miss me? i understand that they would be sad but i am sure they would get over me.
i talk regularly with my friends at college and when playing games but i still have that thought  at the back of my mind that says "no one would miss me and would forget about me  soon afterwords"

i guess one of my main points of thinking about this because i have shit all self worth and i have zero social life out side college in the real world. i am also self conscious about my weight which i am trying to fix.

i should say once more that i do NOT think i will be killing myself any time soon.
 
thanks for the responses!
