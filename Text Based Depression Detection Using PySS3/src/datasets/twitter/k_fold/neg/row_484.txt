To whoever is thinking about suicide and sees this.Even if it feels you are alone, that no one understands you, that you are so worthless to the point that the world is better off without you. Just stop. And think clearly about what you are doing. There are many people that would be sad to see you go like that. Even if you don't know that. One of your family or friends, pets, some complet stranger that you accidentally smiled to and helped them relive their stress, or even one of your fellow redditors that are kind enough to care about you. I know i do. Even though i never knew you. Knowing that a human died when i could have stopped that with a few words of encouragement would surely bring me over my breaking point. Well, just make sure to think about everyone that would love to help you before you do anything you might not live to regret. Please.
