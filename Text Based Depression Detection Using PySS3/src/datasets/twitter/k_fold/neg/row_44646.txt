Will I infect my children?My eldest child is 6, he has seen me at low points, he sometimes sneaks downstairs and peaks in the living room while I'm crying alone in the dark. I try to make out like it's nothing to worry about but I feel he's understanding I'm in pain now. 
Will my sadness make him sad too? I don't want them to emulate me in their future so time is short, I want to be a distant memory. I realise now that I can't make them hate me, they feel love too much and forgive.  
My plan is to end it in a way that doesn't look like suicide, like an accident, so there's no guilt passed on to my loved ones. But I'm worried he may have seen too much and will know deep down that it was intentional. My partner knows I am depressed / suicidal so she may work it out, but at least she can say it wasn't suicide. 
My youngest child is young enough to be left without any memories of my existence and will hopefully bond well to  whatever step-father/mother that takes my place.
