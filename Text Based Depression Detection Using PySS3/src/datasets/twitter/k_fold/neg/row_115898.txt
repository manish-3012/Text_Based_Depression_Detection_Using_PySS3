I might OD on my asthma prescription pills(Sorry if this is posted in the wrong sub I just need a place to talk) 

Iâ€™m 14 and have a pretty crappy home life which is normal to me, but today I came home to find that my younger siblings had torn apart every inch of my room. My sketchbook was ripped, all my painting are lost, and I really tried to do my homework but even that was ripped up and now Iâ€™m getting an F tomorrow in class. All the things I truly cared about were ripped up and my paints/charcoals were gone I feel so destroyed and canâ€™t stop crying. My mom didnâ€™t even do anything but shrug it off. My dad gave told them â€œDonâ€™t do that,â€ in a normal voice which is the opposite of what he does to me if I mess something up. Heâ€™d get very physical and verbal with threats and hurtful comments, but to them, because theyâ€™re boys, apparently theyâ€™re â€˜betterâ€™ in his eyes, I guess. 

And I replied to him in a â€˜toneâ€™ which set him and my mother off into a yelling frenzy. I donâ€™t even get it, this is the first time in a LONG time Iâ€™ve said anything in an attitude way. I never use attitude, and when I just say something my mom makes me shut up because apparently Iâ€™m too attitudey. Sorry for watching your kids 24/7. Sorry for cleaning the whole house up and down. Sorry for waking up at 2 A.M. to help around. Sorry for living on a budget at 14 because you always talk about money in front of me and make it my fault if I spend a dime on something. Sorry for almost cutting myself. Sorry for not having a social life because you donâ€™t let me go anywhere and say why am I always on my phone. 

Sorry for being born. I canâ€™t take it anymore. Whatâ€™s the point of living?
