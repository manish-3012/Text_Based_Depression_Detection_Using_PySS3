The fear of the future has gotten unbearableMy life has become nothing more than an endless cycle of anxiety and depression, and current news have ridden me of what little motivation I had to begin with.

This world is terrifying and someone as weak and constantly anxious as I am just isn't fit to live in it. Not only am I a consistently socially anxious wreck, but I am convinced that live in this planet will become absolute hell in the coming decades, which is something I certainly don't want to be around to witness.

It's not as though I have the means to obtain any of the miniscule amount of life goals I have before I die anyway. Far too stupid to receive the education I'd need to ever get a decent job, far too ugly and awkward for relationships, and far too depressed to do any of what hobbies I formerly had. And what's the point? The world is going to be uninhabitable soon enough anyway. It's already happening, and it's just going to get worse.

We're all going to die. Why should I delay my death? It's unlikely I'd see past my 40s anyway. Will I kill myself any time soon? Perhaps not, but I do believe it inevitable. No one has given me reason to live- I've talking with therapists, counselors, multiple (utterly useless) online chatlines, and they've all said the same thing, *"We don't know how to help you."* And at this point, I definitely don't know how to help myself, and I don't think I ever will.
