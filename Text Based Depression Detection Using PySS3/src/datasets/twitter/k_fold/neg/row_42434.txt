Why don't I get to be happy?I can't remember the last moment in my life where I was content. 
Instead of taking the train to school tommorow morning, I'm taking it to my death, I'm finally ok with dying now, so I may as well do it before I change my mind. School will be shit tommorow anyway, My arms are a blooded mess now so things will be awkward, since it's 30 degrees I can't wear a jacket, this is something I've been planning for a long time. I hate myself and I need to die, I have just been waiting to become okay with death, and that is now.
