i am for sure going to kill myself this week.hey guys. this is kinda long so iâ€™m sorry, but iâ€™m just done. the past few years iâ€™ve been really struggling and couldnâ€™t go a day without crying and fucking shit up. iâ€™m always so miserable and feel like iâ€™m in a cycle everyday. really canâ€™t wait until iâ€™m dead. iâ€™m always thinking about suicide and have tried twice but failed, i am always sad and others can feel it. iâ€™m a burden. but today i just feel like iâ€™ve had enough, itâ€™s not her fault. but there is a girl iâ€™m in love with, my best friend, she liked me but i only started to develop feelings after she told (i was still trying to figure it out, we liked each other at the same time) and when i actually told her then she had gotten over me. she told me she doesnâ€™t want a relationship and that she is over me. i respect that as long as we can still be friends. but then after i asked if she wanted to go to homcoming (as friends) she says no and asks another girl. (she tells me she did by mistake, sort of said without thinking but still) if i had only said something earlier something might have came out of it. i hate myself. i love her so much. like i wouldnâ€™t just kill myself over this but it just built up with everything else and iâ€™m done. all of my other friends barely talk to me even though i try to engage, my siblings and other friends also donâ€™t care and often make jokes about how one day iâ€™ll end it, and my mom thinks iâ€™ve been faking depression for years. my best friend still says she loves me (as a friend) but has been weird with me today and trying to avoid contact it feels like. so iâ€™m going to do it. i have everything i need. i just need a time where iâ€™ll be home alone so i donâ€™t ever wake up. i donâ€™t care if i sound like a pussy. i just want this over with. the reason this is so long is because there is no one to talk to. anything to prepare for my final days?
