When is suicide the answer?I Google that. And usually get it's when you have some kind of terminal disease and there's no chance of recovery. When you're in great pain physically. But what about mentally?

When can I shoot myself in the head and have people accept that I was in pain. I have depression, and anxiety, and Tinnitus. which has ruined my life. I find joy in nothing. I'm in despair everyday, for every hour of the day until I can manage to sleep. it's taken away my ability to relax and my only passion in life. music.

Every monumental occasion is stained by Tinnitus. Every single one. I got this 4 years ago. So habituation isn't an option. Neither is accepting it. 

I start my job tomorrow. And I'll be able to afford a shotgun. I'll be able to finally find peace from this hell. 

I think suicide is my answer. I know it is. I feel some people were meant to be happier than others. I just got unlucky. because instead of a shitty life, I got a cruel joke of a life. 

I hope I can also get the virus while at work. I'm tired of this shit. I'm tired of hurting and throwing myself into anxiety attacks. of wanting to abuse NyQuil to sleep. of drinking too much alcohol to forget my problems....I'm fucking tired......
