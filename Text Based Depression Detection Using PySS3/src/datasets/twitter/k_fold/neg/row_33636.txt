nothing makes me happy anymorei have wanted to kill myself for so long, even as a kid. My life hasnâ€™t always been great so it made sense kinda. But Im a straight A student at a good college, I met a girl who makes me so happy. But no matter how perfect my life has gotten, every night I still look at my ceiling and just want to die more than anything else. I think about grabbing a razor and slitting my wrists in my bathtub and floating towards my death, or just overdosing. When is it supposed to get better if itâ€™s already perfect? When is this feeling going to go away?
