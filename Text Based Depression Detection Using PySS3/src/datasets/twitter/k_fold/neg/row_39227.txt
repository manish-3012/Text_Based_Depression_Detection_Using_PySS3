Daughter wants to end it all in few weeksI don't know what to do. My daughter is 22 and she is talking about ending it all in a few weeks if she can't find a reason to live. I told her I could have her committed but that is the last resort. She is currently in college, set to graduate in May and she doesn't want to talk to a psychiatrist or psychologist due to losing her ability to get her  license for a job. 

Her life has been up and down. She makes friends, then they come and go. Which I told her that is normal, people will always go and go in your life. She just recently found out her boyfriend of a year has been cheating on her with a girl he had been dating for 3 yrs. Apparently this boy and my daughter had been making plans for the future and wham she finds out it's all been a lie.

The virus has impacted her life tremendously due to fact she isn't socializing like she was (conventions, hanging out with friends etc) so it's messing with her mental state. She doesn't see a future cause at the moment nothing makes her happy and she aches all over. She musters through the day but once it's over she breaks down and says what is the point of living. I tell her you make life for what it is, good bad, high low, you make your own happiness but that is what a parent would say . She is only 22 and can have a full life ahead of her but she doesn't want it. 

I do not know what to do and where to turn. I feel if I have her committed for self harm she will hate me  forever. I love her deeply since she is my only child but I don't want to lose my kid!  Any advice to what to say to her is deeply appreciated!
