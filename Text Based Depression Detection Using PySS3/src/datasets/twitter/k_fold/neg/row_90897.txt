intimate stuff in we share is written stored on reddit servers permanently forever - does it worry anyone or me overthinking - opinions valuedPersonal intimate stuff in our lives is written stored on reddit servers permanently forever. That's risk of other people reading...from 1. Admins 2. Court order - Parent or relative of someone sectioned. 3. Hacking 

So is it me overthinking here or is this fair and relevant point to consider? I value opnions. 

No right or wrong answer at all. No criticism of Reddit at all it is what it is.
