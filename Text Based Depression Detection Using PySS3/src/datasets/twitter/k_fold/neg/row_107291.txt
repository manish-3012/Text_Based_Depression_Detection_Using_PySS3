I don't have the energy anymore.Please know that I don't have any plans to hurt myself. This is just where my head is at the moment.

I'm going to try to keep this short. Mostly because it's taking all the energy and motivation I have at the moment to write this.

The feeling of being constantly overwhelmed has given way to apathy. I just don't care. I don't want to try. I don't have the energy to try anymore. It's too much work. There's too much in my life to fix and I don't even want to start. The thoughts of killing myself came about so rationally... like "Well, yeah, that makes sense. I could do that, I guess". In the past, as a child, I had thoughts of suicide but they always came in moments of complete desperation. But now, I'm not even crying. I'm just exhausted. 

I can't imagine myself doing it at the moment, mainly because I know it would destroy my sister who already suffers from anxiety and OCD. When I'm having these thoughts, the selfishness of it is what pulls me out. I couldn't hurt her that way. 

It's strange that I can be with friends and be ok... and as soon as I'm on my own again the thoughts return. I know they'd all be shocked if they knew. I'm the happiest, most cheerful person on the outside. Keeping up that facade is exhausting.

Again, I'm *not* sitting here with a bottle of pills. I'm just tired and can't see the point anymore. These thoughts have become more and more frequent over the past few weeks. I'm just too tired to fight them. Part of me just wants to let them take over and give in to it.
