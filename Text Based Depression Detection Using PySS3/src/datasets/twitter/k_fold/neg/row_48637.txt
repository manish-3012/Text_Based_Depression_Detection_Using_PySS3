Isolated in every way possibleThe Pandemic just highlighted the fact that I'm 21 and I have no idea where my life is going.

I think I peaked in high school but I didn't really deserve that since I was a heavily bullied kid that never lashed out once, especially once I got on the top of my game. Got good grades, had many friends, confident about my appearance...

Before the pandemic I made large changes to my life by changing my major and being victimized by something that isn't my fault. 

I've lost confidence in myself and I don't see significant progress. I try to throw myself into drawing and painting because it's one thing I'm good at. But I feel bitter that I receive no support for any of my work. I'm jealous of my friends...and I sincerely don't want to be.

I don't think change is easy for me. The only thing keeping me afloat is my amazing and well-adjusted, loving boyfriend. I don't even want to be around him anymore because I can't take him loving someone so useless, ugly, and stupid.

I have nothing good going in my life anymore. Even if I try.

I don't know what to do. I can't get help because my parents have experienced traumas of their own and feel bitter that I'd get effective therapy. They sabotage all of my chances to get help.
