Keep me safe for what?Hi reddit,

I'm reaching out because... I actually don't know why. Do I think that things will get better? No, but do I wish that I was that one in the billion to strike jackpot, yes, but is it likely, no.

I haven't had a good time in a long time, whether it's not fitting in, bullying, not feeling like I matter, the most recent issue is romantic relationships.  I never asked for this existence and yet here I am, not particularly enjoying this existence, I wish my mum did abort me when she wanted to, her moment of weakness doomed me to this life.  I'm alive because I have to, not because I want to, for me suicide seem to be the great liberation more than any acts of living ever did/will.

All I can say is thank fuck for gun control, or maybe it's a curse that I live in a country with strict gun control. Maybe this will be one of the last trace of evidence of my existence, idk.

Godspeed
