50 xanax, 6 joints 1 bottle of vodkatonight is the night boys, ive had this planned for a few weeks. once my parents fall asleep im walking down to the river and am going to try to find peace. My head thinks it understands the universe, the feeling that every moment of human existence is a joke. i do understand how people can be comfortable but how can i get myself to function if i simply cannot cope with life for what it is?
