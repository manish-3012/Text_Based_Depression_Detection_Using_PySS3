Severely depressed I think? Feeling alone and suicidal almost took some pills no clue anymoreSo I am 16 and have been through a rough patch constantly bullied and pushed around. Keep thinking of suicide but then I would be missed and I would never see my crush again? What should I do almost jumped in front of a car nearly consumed a handful of pills and keep thinking my air soft gun is real as it looks 99% realistic and then I realise. I feel alone yet I have friends it seems that no one cares and I donâ€™t know what to do as I havenâ€™t told anyone and no one asks if they did I would probably shrug it off and keep feeling blue what should I do?
