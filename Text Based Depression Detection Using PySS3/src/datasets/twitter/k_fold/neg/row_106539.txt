Hey youIâ€™m not sure you will ever read this but after several hours of crying and drinking. I still want to die but I no longer blame you. I actually wrote my letter tonight and Iâ€™m putting it in the mail tomorrow morning. I explained how much I loved you and also how much you have hurt me. I also wrote all of the good memories I had but also the bad ones.  Iâ€™m wrote my fears and my hopes. 
Finally I wrote why I decided to end things. Itâ€™s a combination of my debt, Not having any family who cares, and just an self harm problem that I canâ€™t seem to fix.  I feel hopeless and useless. And just all around not fit to be allowed to live. 
But Iâ€™m glad you seem happy again. So please do not blame yourself for this. 
This is a decision Iâ€™m making on my own 
Iâ€™m just tired of not being happy or not being good enough for anyone I guess.  Not even myself.  
Maybe my actions will cause some hurt in this world but the resulting good it will cause will be even greater.  
So goodbye one last time.  
I sincerely wish he is what you want in life. 
Goodbye amber. 
Yours truly.  Michael Lee
