I'm always pressured and misunderstoodNobody takes me seriously just because I'm a minor. As the top student, I'm always pressured to be THE BEST. When I don't become the thing people want me to be, stuff happens at home. This started since I was 6. Honestly, I don't know how to act anymore. Back then, I was purely happy, and knew what I want and who I was. But nowadays, I just go by "fake it til you make it". Many people are jealous of me and say that I live a perfect life, and bully me. The words my parents tell hurt. A lot. They favor my younger sister more than me, and they basically think of her as the better version of me. Unlike her, I'm a mistake. I really don't want to take my own life, but if a car was about to hit me, I wouldn't move out the way. I'd love to welcome death. It goes on more than this, but I don't really have the strength to talk about the other things. Sorry for venting
