Iâ€™m in a rough patchI have persistent depression and anxiety. Persistent depression is continuous but not severe. Sometimes it flairs up though and I get into major depressive episodes. Im very afraid that I am starting another one of those. I once had an episode last almost a year and all that got me out of it was beginning to take medication. Im so afraid of that happening again. I cant live with that kind of pain. The past few days have been really rough. Ive been depending on weed and still taking my medicine regularly, maybe not as much as I should (supposed to be taking twice a day but only take it religiously in the morning). I didnt wake up crying this morning at least. Thatâ€™s the worst kind of day. Today im just dull. I cant go anywhere or really do much. Ive wanted to hurt myself again. At this point I do not want to live.
