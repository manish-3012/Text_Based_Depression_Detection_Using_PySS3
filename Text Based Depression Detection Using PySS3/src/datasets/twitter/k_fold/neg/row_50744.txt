ExhaustionNothing has gotten better despite what people may say and encourage. It's not as though I expected things to magically be better - that'd be a bitter lie to myself to believe. Though, I always had a general idea a long time ago that when I saw myself in the future, things would be alright - however, they're not. Whereas I've spent so long trying to find things to keep myself going, nothing's worked. I don't know what to do anymore. I was caught up in heavy self-harm but was able to stay clean for a month or two until last night, when I relapsed. It was so spur of the moment that I couldn't stop myself, although I've been beating myself up over it ever since. This aside, I've been so sick of waking up early to go to classes and getting home late due to work. It's a daily routine I should be used to, but I swear I'm about to push myself over my limit due to stress from it all and the pressure being put on me to excel at everything I do. I've had nobody to turn to, as I'd always kept isolating myself and still do. I'm so tired of everything and I want it to end. It's a cycle that goes on everyday and I'm not sure how long I can keep it up, as it seems neverending at this point. I just don't want this anymore.
