normal to fantasizing and thinking about killing self?hey there , im just a (normal??) teen and don't really know where else to ask. is it normal to think a lot about wishing to not exist or wanting to kill myself? i've never made solid plans but I've bought things i would need to do it but i feel selfish when i am on the brink of doing it. from the google searches ive done it seems like its normal. what do you all think?
