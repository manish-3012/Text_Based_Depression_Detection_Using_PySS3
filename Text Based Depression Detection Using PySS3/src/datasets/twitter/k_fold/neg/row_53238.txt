STOP running that commercial saying "Nobody would miss you" if you killed yourself.I'm a mid 50's person with a failed marriage, working from home alone at my own online business, living far from where I grew up.  

At this age, virtually NOBODY wants to make friends. About 80% are consumed with their grandkids/older kids/careers, about 10% are too ill or have addictions preventing social activity, and the rest have created very specific rigid life routines that prohibit other activities or friendships.  If you're not very wealthy (wealthy enough to throw big house parties or buy a large yacht to invite people), you're DONE.  After years of trying, I have given up, and now it's just a countdown to the end.

But this post isn't about me, it's about the commercial that keeps running where various people look around and say, "I wonder if anyone would miss me".  I know for a fact that nobody would, and I'm sure there are a lot of people in my situation.  

That makes this commercial little more than a dare or a challenge to kill myself, because I can sat emphatically NO, no one would miss me.  

I used to be fairly active on facebook, with hundreds of past coworkers, clients, school mates, and such, so when that commercial began I suddenly stopped posting on facebook to see if anyone noticed.   No one did.  I seriously considered escalating my suicide timeline as a direct result. 

I'm sure that the commercial concept sounded good on paper, and perhaps good for those who have everything going for them in their lives, with a perfect family and great social life.  But to the rest of us?  The message seems to be "fuck you, loser, go kill yourself".
