How do I decide...Whether or not to kill myself? Suicide is definitely not always wrong, but how can I make a rational choice? Is it reason enough that I'm a heavy burden on friends and family, don't contribute anything now and have little hope of doing so later? I'm young, but I still doubt that I'll be successful, even happy, in my future. I'd rather kill myself sooner and waste fewer resources (therapy, medication, air) seeing if I do have a future.
