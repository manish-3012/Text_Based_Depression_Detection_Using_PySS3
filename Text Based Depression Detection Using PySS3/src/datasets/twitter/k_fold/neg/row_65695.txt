Music is my escapeHi guys, i dont know if im allowed to post this but if i am i thought id share some songs with you. These songs have helped me and my friends through a lot. Music for me is an escape, it can bring me into others lives or take me away from everyones. it can cheer me up or be the sad song i need on the sad day. I wanna share two songs with you guys, theyre both from a band called twenty one pilots. there music may seem weird but their lyrics are what got me, ill give a lil example of the lyrics from each song.

this song is called holding on to you and its lyrics show hope in sadness. heres some lines from it:

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going,
'Cause the next moment, before you know it,
Time is slowing and it's frozen still,
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night,
Right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it,
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me,
This ain't a noose, this is a leash,
And I have news for you, you must obey me."
the next song is kinda sad but it made me break down the first time i heard it. its a slow piano song so if you didnt like the rap of the last song you still might enjoy this

heres a lil of the lyrics: 
Now the night is coming to an end,
The sun will rise and we will try again.

Stay alive, stay alive for me.
You will die, but now your life is free,
Take pride in what is sure to die

so i hoped someone found this nice and tell me what songs help you. id love to hear. cya later guys
