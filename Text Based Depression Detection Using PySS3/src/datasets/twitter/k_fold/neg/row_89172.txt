Does anyone ever feel scared of themselves?I woke up and felt restless and scared when I thought about was I was thinking earlier with my suicidal thoughts. It felt like I could feel the rope around my neck getting tighter and pressing on my trachea. My body then started to ache and Joy Division's "New Dawn Fades" played in my mind. My point is, does anyone ever feel scared of what they were thinking earlier?
