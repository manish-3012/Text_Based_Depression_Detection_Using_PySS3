My life is completely worthlessI'm just a piece of trash that makes everyone around me miserable. I dropped out of college, I don't have any friends/romantic interests, and my family tolerates me at best. As for my own life, it seems all I can do is mess things up. I work a shitty customer service job, I have no skills or talents, and every day I spend living is spent in absolute misery. I'm planning on killing myself tomorrow morning, but I guess I'm just curious if there's even a tiny reason I shouldn't just go off myself right now. Sorry if you had to read this.
