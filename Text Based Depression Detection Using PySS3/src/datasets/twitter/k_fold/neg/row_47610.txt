Extremely depressed, feel like people only want me for sexThis isn't when my bipolar disorder and eating disorder started, but it's when it got really bad again.
I'd been with girls before but I had sex with a boy for the first time last summer. I liked him a lot. He didn't care about me, and he had a girlfriend anyway. His brother walked in and threatened to tell his girlfriend, unless I had sex with him too. I said no, but they made me do it anyway.
It took me months to tell anyone what happened and while my 2 best friends were supportive, my parents both accused me of lying about being raped.
After that, i've had a lot of sex. Guys, girls, threesomes, I'm down for whatever. I think people just see me as a sex object. But no one ever stays.  I had sex with a guy I really liked yesterday. I thought he liked me too. He told me I'm gorgeous and we used to snapchat all day. Later he texted me saying it didn't feel right. I'm hurt but I can't say I'm surprised.
My life really has no purpose anymore. I had a job but i got fired months ago. I started doing a lot of pills and stealing until I got fired and given a $500 fine. I stopped stealing and I hardly do pills anymore but I still feel guilty about stealing so much.
I really have no future. I still haven't applied anywhere and even if I do, i feel like if I go to college, I'll just have to be hospitalized for my eating disorder/ bipolar depression again and have to leave, especially because my eating disorder is getting bad again.
I really feel like there's no chance at me having a good, stable life. I have some amazing, supportive friends but I'm constantly afraid I'll end up ruining it somehow because I seem to do that a lot.
I just feel really lonely and I just don't feel like there's any purpose to my life anymore and I have no desire to continue it.
