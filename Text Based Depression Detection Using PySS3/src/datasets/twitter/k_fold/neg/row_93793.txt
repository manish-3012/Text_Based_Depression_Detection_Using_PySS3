It sucks that life is so painful for some of usKnowing one day the pain will stop provides me with a sense of peace. No matter how much I suffer, one day it will all come to an end.  
And there will be nothing again, just like there was nothing before my birth. I hope.  


Are you afraid of death?  
I am afraid of what comes after it. I'm afraid of the possibility of another life, of another existence. I'm not afraid of nothingness.
