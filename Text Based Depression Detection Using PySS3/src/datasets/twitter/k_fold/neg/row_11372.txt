I think my best friend may have done it, and it's tearing me apart.She's been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now, went to the hospital on Monday, got released that evening.  We text almost constantly, yesterday morning she just stopped.  Nothing.  She can and does access her messages on her computer, so her phone being broken isn't an explanation.  She lives a few hours away and I can't drive.  I have no way to get to her, and I don't know her address.

I'm terrified that she has killed herself.  I don't know what to do and I feel like my whole life is unraveling.
