I can't stand this, I'm filled with anger 24/7I frequentlyly fight with my family (Father, Mother, Brother), I became so violent, I always feel pain and anger flow in my blood, I can't stop thinking about my parents' mistake bringing me into this damned life in the first place.

I never get a job even though I had applied so many times, friendless, lonely, depressed, damn suicidal
