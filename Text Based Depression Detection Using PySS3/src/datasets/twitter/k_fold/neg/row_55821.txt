I don't have anything to live for...I don't mean that in a dramatic way, I was thinking and why am I even trying? I used to have friends but it's more or less dwindled down to one (I didn't do anything, people just stopped tolerating me), my grades are shit and I know I could get all A's if  i actually tried but I'm too fucking depressed all the time to care, I get bullied more and more everyday, and I don't actually enjoy doing anything more. I've never been in a relationship - never even kissed someone - im just tired of it. I'm so sick of the crippling loneliness, why bother living if this is all there is?
