Suicidal over SchoolI'm trying to finish college, but I feel completely overwhelmed and unable to do the work to pass. I have less than a week to do a bunch of work, and I don't feel mentally together enough to do it. If I don't finish these classes, I'll have to take them again, but I can't pay for them, so I'll never finish.
