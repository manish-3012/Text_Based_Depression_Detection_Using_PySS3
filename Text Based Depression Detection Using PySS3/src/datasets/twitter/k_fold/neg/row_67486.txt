I can't take this anymoreI've gotten to a point where I think about suicide all day every day... the combination of issues I have just feels like too much 

I'm tapering off benzodiazepines which has ruined my health to a point I can barely move

I'm gay and suffer from gender dysphoria, I feel like I'll never be happy with myself or have a family

I've lost most of my friends I used to have

I have damaged my brain with years of drug abuse, to the point where I no longer feel pleasure from anything. I no longer enjoy food or watching TV or social interactions. I am numb.

I have hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, I see visuals 24/7 and have loud ringing tinnitus that drives me crazy

I just can't see the point of living anymore, I don't feel like happiness is possible for me. My health is ruined, I have nothing to look forward to in life. My brain just isn't here anymore. What's the point of trying when benzos do permanent damage and take 2 years+ to recover from withdrawal. It's too much.
