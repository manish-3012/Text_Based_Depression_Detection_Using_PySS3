Suddenly having thoughts of suicide, and its beginning to worry meI haven't felt like this in a couple years, and it seems to have come on so suddenly, and for no apparent reason. I struggled with awful manic depression/PTSD/eating disorders in the past, but I've been healthy for about a year now. I've learned to become very aware of my moods, and that's why I'm beginning to worry about myself.

It began about two to three weeks ago and it's lingering. I keep wishing I were dead, thinking that everybody will be better off without me to bother them. My self-esteem, which is usually healthy, is crumbling. I hate how I look, I hate my art, I hate myself altogether. I'm a fucking embarrassment, to be honest. I have a group of wonderful friends, and a very healthy relationship with my boyfriend of 6 months. I don't know why this is happening, and I'm afraid that bringing it up to them is just whiny and pathetic, because my life isn't even bad right now. I don't want to be seen as crazy or starving for attention. I've gone through a few traumatic events (CSA, abusive relationships, family issues), but they're in the past and they don't ever cross my mind anymore. I just feel so fucking sad and I fear that everybody is lying about their feelings toward me, which is just so irrational. The cherry on the cake is that my period is about a week late, now. I've taken a few pregnancy tests, which all came out negative. I plan on doing this daily until my period comes. It could be the stress, but if I'm pregnant, I'd probably actually kill myself. I can hardly afford another abortion, but the pain that it put me through is something I never want to go through ever again. I'm also afraid that it would ruin my near-perfect relationship.

Today has been the worst of them all, and suicide seems rational. That's why I came here. I feel like I need to let it out or at least let somebody know that I'm feeling like this.
