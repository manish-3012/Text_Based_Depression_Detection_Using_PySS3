i want my guilt to change mei feel stupid writing this, but i just want someone to know. i grew up very religious, and i was taught from a young age to wait until marriage. waiting till marriage is something very important to me. it shows my love, and obedience to God. i told all of my friends, and i showed my pride for being a virgin. but... i met this person. this person was quiet, and calm. i was definitely attracted to them, and i got to know them more over quarantine. one thing that stood out to me was that they were also a virgin, and they never had a relationship. i ended up telling them about my feelings, and they returned those feelings back. we started to hang out. i noticed on the third day of hanging out, they became touchy. i told them that i didnâ€™t like it but they seemed like they didnâ€™t care. theyâ€™re kindness masked the red flags of being touchy. about a month in, i lost my virginity. this person didnâ€™t force it, instead i asked. now, my guilt is starting to come in. i noticed that i havenâ€™t been spending time with my mom, and that i miss her. i have been gone from the house more, and havenâ€™t been doing my chores. i really want my guilt to get worse, so bad that it will make me stop asking for sex. no one knows about what i have done, only my sister, and God. i really want to tell someone. someone that knows what iâ€™m going through. so far my guilt has lead me to think about suicide, something i have thought of before. i really just donâ€™t want to deal with what i have started.
