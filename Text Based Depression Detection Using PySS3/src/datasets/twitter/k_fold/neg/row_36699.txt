Overdosing on Zoloft???Is that a thing? Like can taking half a bottle of Zoloft do anything cause thatâ€™s all I have right about now. 

Itâ€™s weird. Iâ€™m not even super depressed at the moment, hell im not sad at all right now, I just canâ€™t get the thought out of my head. 

Maybe I should get the bottle out of my room. Iâ€™m afraid of what might happen if I donâ€™t
