I'm not asking for helpThe majority of posts on here seem like a cry for help, if Iâ€™m being honest with myself Iâ€™m just here to vent.

I donâ€™t plan on committing suicide tonight, but one day I will.  Iâ€™ve been depressed for 8 years which is a third of my life and all of my adult life.

Iâ€™ll never understand why some people are challenged in life more than others, why some people can live long happy lives while others suffer every waking moment.

Iâ€™ll willingly admit there are people out there who have it far worse than I do, but I am at a constant struggle to find a good reason to continue on.  Saying I can't be depressed because someone out there has it worse than me is like saying I can't be happy because someone out there has it better than me.

Never in a million years would I have expected my life to turn out this way, to feel so terrible for such a long time.

I just want to say to everyone out there struggling with depression, Iâ€™m sorry.  I know your pain and I wish everyone could be happy.

I canâ€™t wait for this to be over..


(I wrote this about a year ago on another suicide forum. These words resonate louder and louder everyday, despite the many changes I've made with my life I am more miserable then ever.  I think i'm at a point now psychologically where even if I miraculously became happy, I would not be able to enjoy it, I just don't feel at all anymore. Tai Lopez once described people who are depressed as people having "scared up brains" I think that represents me pretty well.  I'm not ashamed I don't want to live anymore and haven't for a while, I'm not ashamed that I am too weak to keep fighting.  I've lost.)
