I've grown tired of my repeated failures but I don't want to kill myself (though the thought of it is corrupting my mind)I have all these goals but I have no compass for them which leads me to failures and setbacks. I am only taking two college courses and tutoring a third but I feel like with all the freetime I have it just creates more anxiety than I have felt in a long time. I just feel so aimless and lost, the one thing that I have done in regards to my goals is losing three pounds in January (trying to lose a total of forty). I want to do more reading but haven't because of my ignorance complex; when I am learning something new I get anxious because of how much it reveals my ignorance. I ultimately do not know what to do to get out of this depressive mode and I am so frustrated with myself for going in circles. I just want this daily pain to end.
