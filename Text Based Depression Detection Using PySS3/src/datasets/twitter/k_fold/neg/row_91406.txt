I don't get why I'm expected to live on. Why shouldn't I be allowed to just die.If you're someone like me with no chances for anything more in life, why shouldn't I be allowed to just end it all. I have no chances to ever be loved or in love, I have no chances to achieve something more than a shitty retail job working for people I despise, no chance to ever have anything to call my own. So then why am I expected to just slap on a happy face and pretend its all okay forever or pretend it'll get better when I have absolutely not a shred of a hint that it will be okay. "Temporary problem," that's fucking bullshit.
