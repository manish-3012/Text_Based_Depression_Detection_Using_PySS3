I can't stop my thoughtsI have to do it. There is no other way out. I have to do it. I'm meaningless and weak. I can't do this anymore. it's so hard to build up the courage. I'm not scared of dying I'm scared of pain. I'm tired of pain. I don't have any energy. I don't have any friends. I can't wait any longer. all I do is disappoint everyone. I know they are tired of me. I WILL be gone sooner or later. I have to.
