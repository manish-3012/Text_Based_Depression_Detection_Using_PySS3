Unmotivated...So day 3, nothing major happened to me. No suicidal thoughts today but i feel that its just in the air. I had philosophy today which i enjoyed. Thats the only class that kind of brings me joy because i get to talk to new people. 

I used to draw all the time in that class and i post them on instagram but i havent done so for the past week. One thing i noticed is that i always like drawing portraits but i cant seem to draw me... anyways, i had a hard time sleeping last night. I was helping alot of people tho and started typing in a slurryâ€” i was just so tired from the hangout.

I woke up just in time for class tho. Then i slept right after, woke up halfway thru my nap then fell right back in and now im here. I also skipped 2 days of working out, i think this is gonna be a bad suicide if i do go back to it.

I also received 250+ upvotes on my HUMAN TO HUMAN post. Im glad thats something positive ive imposed on this group.
