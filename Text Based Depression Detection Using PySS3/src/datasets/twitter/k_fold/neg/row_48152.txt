Don't care about throwaways anymore...i just want someone to talk to.I'm on 10mg of Lexpro (I know, still low dosage), and its been about 4 or 5 months. But its not seeming to help much. My current gf seems to get upset/annoyed when she sees me fall into the deep dark holes. And i just want someone to talk to.
