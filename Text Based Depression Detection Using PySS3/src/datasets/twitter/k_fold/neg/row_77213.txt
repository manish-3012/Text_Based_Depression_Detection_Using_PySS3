God wants me to die...I've had a miserable childhood, I've been used as a tool majority of my life, I'm trying in vein to get a job, I look for positives in bad situations but most of the time its not there. And when I try to destress and take my mind of bad things going on my life, even that fails, because I play games and lose almost every game most of the time and my favorite team gets beat most of the time. Very rarely I'm happy, and it's an issue. Its as if God is deliberately brought me to this world to suffer. It seems that God wants to see me die because nothing in my life has been noteworthy to celebrate too heavily about.
