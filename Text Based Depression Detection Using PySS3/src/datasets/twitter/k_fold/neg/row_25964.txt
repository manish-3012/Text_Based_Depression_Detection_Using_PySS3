I'm seriously done. Ending my life asapI just can't take it anymore. It fucking sucks and i can't handle it. I've been refusing to attempt again but damn it's the best option I've got. I know I'll hurt people really freakin bad but I'm done being guilty and suffering for everyone. It hurts. It hurts so badly

I'm not failing this time. I have a gun in the house. Going to blow my brains out and Damn i hope it works. 

I hope i end up anywhere than here and please don't give me the "you're too young to die" " things get better" " you have a purpose" bull shit because I've heard it all before and my answers are. Yeah so what, I'm 15 but I've wanted to die for so damn long and i literally don't care anymore. They don't get better for me, my life has been going downhill since i was 6 and i can see where I'm headed. I don't want a purpose, i don't want a life. 

AHH I just don't want to hurt people but i can't live anymore... I've said "one more day" for too long. I'm done.
