TiredI donâ€™t really have much to say, I wouldnâ€™t know how anyways. I hate every single minute that I breath and itâ€™s just that thereâ€™s this unexplainable torture that feeds off of me and Iâ€™m so tired of trying to live. 
I keep telling myself again and again that itâ€™s okay but it absolutely isnâ€™t and know it isnâ€™t going to be, so iâ€™m tired of fooling myself at this point and being stuck in a loophole of shame. Though, at this point I donâ€™t really seem to care anymore and I guess thatâ€™s sort of a way of accepting it. I also donâ€™t know if anyone will read this nor do I care if nobody does but putting it out there seems to make it somewhat better and I know Iâ€™m not alone
