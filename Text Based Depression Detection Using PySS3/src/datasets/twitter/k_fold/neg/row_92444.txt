Just hate being myselfCurrently at home. Drunk. Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself since I was around maybe 15 years old. Iâ€™m 21 now. The thoughts seem to come in waves.
I have tried exercising, eating healthy, seeing a doctor and being more social. 
None of it works and I keep coming back to wanting to die. 
The worst part is that I feel like all this could be fixed by getting into a relationship. I know this will only
Make things worse but Iâ€™m so lonely I crave any attention I can get. 
I wish I could be exceedingly happy like other people I see but it is almost exhausting for me.

2020 will be the year I die.
