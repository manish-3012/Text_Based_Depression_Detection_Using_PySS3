Itâ€™s been a bitFor the first time in 4 years my suicidal thoughts are becoming plans again. Rather than passive. Theyâ€™re becoming staring at the pills in the bathroom and thinking of the highest building in my city. Iâ€™m thinking of writing a note. Iâ€™m thinking every single day I am very very close. And i donâ€™t know how much longer is left. But I really desperately donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
