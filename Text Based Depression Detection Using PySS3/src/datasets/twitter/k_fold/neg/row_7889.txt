Why shouldn't I end it all?Basically the title. Husband had an affair cos I became too far. I've lost half the weight now in an effort to get him to love me again, but it isn't working. Can't have children because if a tumor in my ovaries. Dead end job, unmedicated adhd. There is literally nothing and no one that I have to live for. So is there any reason I shouldn't just end this useless life?
