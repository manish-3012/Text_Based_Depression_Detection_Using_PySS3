I'm a fuck up.I don't know what to do. I feel like the biggest failure. In fact, out of everybody I know, I AM the biggest failure. I'm 23 and failing out of university. Everyone else that I know is either successful in their field or still in school and doing well; on track for graduation in their 4th year. I have friends and a family that cares about me, but I feel like I'm a burden on them.

I just got back from a pub crawl, so, I've been drinking a fair bit. Tonight is the first night I've ever truly thought about ending my life and I'm scared more than I've ever been. I'm going to bed, but it would really mean a lot to me if I could talk to someone tomorrow. I don't think 'sober me' would ever   ask for help like this.
