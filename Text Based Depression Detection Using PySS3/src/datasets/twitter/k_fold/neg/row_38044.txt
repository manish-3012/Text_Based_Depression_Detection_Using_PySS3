PillsI've just counted out all my pills. I have 4.8 grams of fluoxetine, and 19.4 grams of topimirate. Plus a small smattering of paracetamol and diazepam. I can't afford rent or bills, I'm self employed and no work is coming in. I'm such a fucking failure. It really would be so much easier if I were dead. But I have no idea if the above would achieve that, or just cause more pain and hassle. I don't even know if I want to die. I'm half absolutely desperate to not exist anymore, and I'm half scared, not knowing what's on the other side etc. 

I don't know what to do with myself.
