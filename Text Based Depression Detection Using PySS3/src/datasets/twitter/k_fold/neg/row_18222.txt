A diatribe against myselfI sit here yet again, eyes glued to the computer monitor, it's haunting glow is the only waking comfort I seem to have these days. Reddit, the beacon of light where I visit to escape my own mind, where at least I can look at other people having rich fulfilling lives and believe that in time I could also be like them.

You know what stings the most though? When the solution to your problem is in actuality a catch-22. All you want is the love and support of another person, but nobody wants to be in a relationship with a depressed individual. Depression finds a way to seep through the cracks of your mind, and others are quick to pick up on it, reasoning to themselves, "Woa he is unstable/crazy, he needs help, but not from me." Shattering whats left of the sliver of hope you desperately cling to.

Another day, another chance, did the dice roll in your favor? You know almost immediately, all you can really hope for is the strength to be able to get out of bed, maybe then things will pick up? Maybe life will let you climb out of the well today.

A few hours pass, and like ice-water down your back, a sudden cold realization occurs, the rest of the day isn't getting any better, it's getting worse. It's as if you're a robot that knows that it will be scrapped for parts at the end of the day.

The glow of the monitor begins to strain my eyes, that's probably enough for tonight, maybe I'll get a better roll tomorrow.
