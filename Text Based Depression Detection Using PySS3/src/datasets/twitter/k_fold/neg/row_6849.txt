It seems overly dramatic but this is what I feel. I hate my entire being. And no, these feelings are not a result of me being on my period. This just happened and I don't know if I should be concerned or attempt to have a moment like this again.*I wrote this in a Word document as I was failing to make any progress on an assignment; in it I recount something which happened to me this Monday. Posted on* r/SuicideWatch *because I want with my entire being to be removed from this life; and I might just get the strength to do it myself. But I fear if I try I will fail as I do with everything else.*

I lay on my bed in pain, sitting in my own mess, when I would typically change my pad and take some ibuprofen, drink some tea. But I did not. I laid idle, making no attempt to soothe the pain which plagued me. I told myself, â€œthis is all I deserve.â€ I accepted defeat. Said all the things which I hate about myself. Scolded myself for trying, for thinking I have or even deserve a chance at happiness. And when I finally got those thoughts through to myself, when I finally accepted my agony rather than fight against it, I fell asleep. It was perhaps the most comforted I have ever felt. The most complete, knowing there is nothing else to be done, that I may as well die laying there. And I thought of it. Dying of suffocation in my sleep didnâ€™t sound too bad.

But as all good things are in my life, the relief was temporary.

Because here I am again, trying. Just barely, but trying. And it hurts. Because Iâ€™m lost and I know thereâ€™s no point, but I still try.

I wish to accept defeat again. To lie in the pain I deserve. And to fall asleep comforted by the peace of being done. Permanently.
