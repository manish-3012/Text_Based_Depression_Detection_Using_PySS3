I don't know what to do anymore, my life is over.Hi, I was directed here through a thread I read yesterday.

I wrote a detailed description of why my life is awful but apparently 15000 characters is too much. I tried posting it in segments and got told that I had to wait ten minutes for each post.

I deleted it and tried to make another thread. I got prompted with about ten captchas in a row and then was told that I'd have to wait to make another post despite getting the captcha correct each time.

It is impossible to illustrate everything even in a condensed fashion 15000 characters was condensed.

My life has gone nowhere I'm 31, I associate with nobody. I am a full blown recluse. I go weeks without seeing the sun on my face. My view from my window is a brick wall. I live in one of the very worst buildings in my city and am surrounded by people living out the most dismal existence north america has to offer. Two people on my floor have died since I've lived here. It is actually listed as one of the worst places to live in canada, and we won the honor of canadas worst landlord I think. Bravo.

I was heavily mentally abused as a child. Told I was worthless. Given nothing. fed garbage food. Given garbage clothes. living in roach infested terrible places. I never had a father. Never learned any life skills. Never taught how to shave or be a man. how to handle money or responsibilty. How to talk to women and be confident. Albeit I'm not entirely bad looking and am in reasonable shape. I've had some relationships in my life but never anything long term. There is something mentally wrong with me. I will be alone forever.

I've been homeless most of my life, since I was about 16. Couch hopping staying up for days at a time. Living like a zombie, dozing off. Taking the train from one end of the line to the other and back just so I can be somewhere. In this time I have lost every friend I've ever had. I've disassociated with my family. I haven't spoken to them in a long time. They don't care and never have.

I developed social anxiety during my time being homeless. I'm afraid to go anywhere. I was put on medication a few years ago and it has negatively affected my brain for the rest of my life.

I was unaware that the meds I was on (Effexor-venlafaxine) Actually increases the suicide rate in users. I think it is criminal that this information is not provided to the patient. They give you a pamphlet with the side effects listed and suicide is not one of them. If I had better access to the internet at the time I could have researched this.

Go ahead, google "effexor has ruined my life" into your google search bar and you'll find a treasure trove of people's stories regarding their loved ones committing suicide or how the drug ruined their lives in general.

Just check out the search queries that come up with just those words. I'm definitely not alone in this.

There are people still being prescribed this death sentence as I write this. and it is horrible. Psychologists are making a mint off of killing people and ruining their lives.

I could go on for a long time about what this crap did to me. My mind will never be the same. 

As it stands I only go out for groceries. My life consists of sitting in a small bachelor apartment about the size of someone's small garage. one room, white bare walls with peeling paint. My building made a deal with the local center for addiction and mental health and they have an outpatient program setting up schizophrenics and other insane people to live in this building. So basically it's like a mental ward.

I'm terrified of my own neighbors. People used to shit in the elevator before they put cameras. And even then you still smell piss in there sometimes. It's so awful. I get to watch people in the dregs of their life waste away evry day. And I can only feel that this is my fate as well.

I never smile.. I never laugh. I'm incredibly shy and quiet. I can't make eye contact with people. I've had this problem since I was a child. It will never go away.
I've lost countless jobs because of these things. I've given up. There's no point in trying to work because this happens every single time.

I got accepted to disability about three years ago and got this apartment, the first place that I can call home in years. I wish I knew how awful it was in advance, because honestly... how is someone supposed to survive on a thousand dollars a month if they absolutely need their own apartment? There's so many people here on disability it isn't even funny. It feels like a mental ward though. 

And I'm in a tiny tiny cell slowly going insane.

I have no future. I will never succeed. I will never have money. I gave up on all my aspirations because nothing will ever come true.

The only way to make anyone happy is money money money money.
I'm sick of being poor. As it stands with the money I get from disability I am forced to live 40% below the poverty line. I cna only afford to live in the worst. I will never be able to afford to move. I will never have a good job, I will never get married. I will never have a kid. I will never drive a car. I will never be anywhere, outside of this garbage city. I love reading about the world, and amazing places. But what is the point of reading if I will never see them. I can't stand being here. I can't even afford a passport. Spending money on anything other than food and necessities is out of the question. I usually spend half the month hungry, because after rent and bills my budget is insanely tight. So I just sit here and be hungry.

I've been to the crisis center twice last year. Never again. I'd rather die that be in one of those places. Horrible.

But again, I have no future. i'll never have a safe home. Never be able to afford bills. (I got my first cell phone at age 29) roughly twenty years since the cellular phone was made commonplace. I missed out on all my youth. I have no precious memories. Ever special moment was squandered. Every relationship gone. Every friend and family member gone. My phone goes days without ringing. I pretty well only speak to debt collectors and my social worker. I'm terrified of doctors now.

I don't know what to do.

Knowing full well in advance that my life will be incredibly horrible. That I will never afford to make myself healthy. Or have friends or do anything that I want to do ever.

I've never once in my life bought a person a drink at a bar. That is how poor I am. I've never been able to take a girl out for a meal. That is how poor I have always been. I can't take it anymore.
