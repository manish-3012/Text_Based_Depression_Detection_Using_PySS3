Need help with friendI need to get back to her so I'll write this quickly with not too much detail. She says that if she loses her horse she will kill herself for sure. It seems as if the horse is the only thing she has to look forward to in life right now. The horse is likely to move with her owner far away from my friend. (Friend is not the owner). She loves the horse more than anything else in life. She constantly says that the horse is the only thing that keeps her alive most of the time. 

Anyways. I want to maybe get her mind off the horse and onto something else to get her to realize that there's more in life than a horse, as important as it may be to her. She's had previous attempts so I'm not at all doubting her. She WILL do it. I'm just not sure how to tell her it's going to be ok. 

Sorry if I'm not making sense or am repetitive. I'm in a hurry.

Edit: Thanks for the replies. I know I shouldn't tell a suicidal person that they are straight up wrong. I just want to get her to get her mind off of the horse and onto something else in the most subtle way possible. This is the least violent way to handle things imo. Not sure if it is possible, however.
