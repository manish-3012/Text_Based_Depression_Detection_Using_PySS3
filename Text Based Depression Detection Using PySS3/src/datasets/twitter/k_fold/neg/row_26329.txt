I want to die over little things.Hello, i dont really know how or when this started, but i feel like dying at stupid things, making someone in real life mad, or when i get a little anxious.  


Im sorry, this is very vague, but i dont really know how to express it. I dont think ive been depressed for long or anything. But this has started to worry me a bit. Because it started some time ago and i didnt pay much attention to it. Now it happens more often, and to be honest. I dont really want to kill myself, but this feeling is really annoying to me and i dont *want* to feel like dying over little stuff  


I dont know if anyone feels the same.
