Telling my students bald-faced lies...Iâ€™m a teacher. Iâ€™ve trained in mental-health first aid. Iâ€™ve even had a student die by suicide. But Iâ€™ve struggled with these thoughts going on almost 16 years. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized twice. Iâ€™ve been on SSRIs since the first hospitalization. I see a counselor. 

But I still want to die, Iâ€™d say, 80% of the time. Iâ€™m in a shitty relationship, but I cannot afford to live alone. I live near none of my very few friends. And I feel the constant pressure to live because of my career. I donâ€™t think anyone should live like i do but I lie and tell my students to â€œget helpâ€, â€œit gets betterâ€, etc etc. 

But it doesnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve just gone from one shitty place in life to another. And now I have even more reason than before. Student loan debt, car loan, growing old alone. All of these are current realities. And if I donâ€™t actually accomplish killing myself? Crushing medical debt! 

Iâ€™m 31, own nothing, only child, and have no contact with my family from either side. Iâ€™m so tired of pretending. But the ripples that I could cause being a teacher scare me worse than anything. I canâ€™t even manage myself and Iâ€™m telling these 14 year olds to stick it through? What bullshit.
