I'm sorryI'm sorry. 
I tried to find something that would make me happy. Well happy in small bursts. And all it has done has been piss people off. I guess I'm not allowed to be happy. But to just lay here in my bed and cry myself to sleep every night. 

I have next to nothing motivation. I don't know why I do some of the shit that I do. 

I'm scared to open up to people. Then when I try, it never goes anywhere and I close myself off again. 


I'm tired of it all.. 
I just can't go on...
