How do you convince yourself to not end it?Ive been living with depression for about 8 years now. Since I was 14. I've been suicidal off and on but these last few weeks have just been really hard, and I've just been thinking about how many people live to be grandparents while being depressed the whole time.

So my question to you is, what mindset do you have to put yourself in to make the bad thoughts go away, or what's your reason for staying?
