Acutely suicidal, Schizoid, Autism Spectrum, affective, avoidant PD, ADHD, chronic pain, just want to be aloneI have chronic pain and health issues + I just want to be alone.
I donâ€™t believe in my future, not being fully able to work, donâ€™t want that other people have to support me (financially).
People stress me out, especially If they need me. 
Life feels overwhelming.

If I could choose Iâ€™d prefer to live all by myself in the forest, maybe 1 or 2 dogs, not freezing in winter, no extreme heat in summer, NO PHYSICAL PAINS, no depression, no regrets, no people that have to suffer because of me or my disappearance + some books, maybe even WIFI, LOL.

But even that scenario is not enough to really make me WANT to live. It would just be more bearable. 

So I figured the best solution would be being dead. 


I donâ€™t even know what to live for. (I had a few moments in my life where I thought life may be worth living. It was some days in Summer when I was on my road bike, listening to music. But that was only of short duration. And I wonâ€™t ever be able to ride my bike that way because of my healt issues.)

Actually I think about killing myself every day since Iâ€™m 11 years old. Iâ€™m severely depressed since the age of 5.

Though never having been diagnosed, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™ve got inattentive type ADHD, ASD/Aspergers, affective disorders and Schizoid + Avoidant Personality Disorder.

Any advice or camaraderie heavily appreciated.

23, female, if thatâ€™s of importance
