Thinking about cutting myself for the first timeWell, Iâ€™m laying in my bed, scrolling through this subreddit and commenting on post where I try to help people who are struggling like me, like I do every night. And now, my wrists just feels very â€œitchyâ€ and kinda â€œnumbâ€ I guess? I donâ€™t really know how to explain it... I have never cut myself or self harmed in my life (unless you count the fact that I had a noose around my neck at one point and almost killed myself). Anyway, I keep thinking about trying to cut my wrist and just experience/try it. I canâ€™t stop this feeling and itâ€™s kinda bothering me... really contemplating about wether or not I should do it... but my whole family is home... sooooo yeah
