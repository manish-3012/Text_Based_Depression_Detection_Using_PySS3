Falling apartSo Iâ€™m 17 years old. I have work in 3 hours and I havenâ€™t slept at all tonight. I have been either sobbing or just blankly looking at something. I literally donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m feeling this way. I cut two days ago and broke my clean streak of a year and a half. Kinda contemplating doing it right now. Idk Iâ€™m just falling apart quickly and I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to anymore.. I only have my best friend but she has her own problems and doesnâ€™t make time for me a lot.. I just need someone.. something.. some motivation.. please.....
