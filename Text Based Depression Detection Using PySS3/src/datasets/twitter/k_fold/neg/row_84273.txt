There is no help.I've done everything right. I've spent so much time and money on therapy that it's baffling. I have a drawer full of medications, and they do exactly jack. I can't even name how many I'm currently on, much less how many I've tried.

I've spent a week in a psych ward. I've logged more hours on the suicide chatline than most people do on a given video game. I've been in relationships. I've tried to open up to people. I have a good job. 

I'm just fucking miserable and don't want to do this anymore.
