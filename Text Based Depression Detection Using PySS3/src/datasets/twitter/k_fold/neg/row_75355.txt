My life is going to shit.Recently I've been going through a lot
My auntie got diagnosed with cancer they're going to start chemo soon but I can't stop worrying that she might die. I don't know what I'll do if she dies. if she dies I won't have anyone who truly cares about me. I'm mostly worried for her son  he also is going through a lot. I don't know what he'll do he might keep using alcohol to escape his problems but my worst fear is him committing suicide

I hate myself for all the times I've been an asshole to her. I hate myself for all the times I've made a mistake that annoyed her. 


When I heard that she had cancer it broke me it made me so alone because there's no one in the world who I will have extremely strong bond like I did with my auntie. 

Also my gender dysphoria has been kicking my ass. Each time I look in the mirror all I see is a girl staring back at me. In public I'm very self conscious because I'm worried about someone misgendering me or if I see someone I know I'm worried about them deadnaming me. It's like I'm constantly on edge.
