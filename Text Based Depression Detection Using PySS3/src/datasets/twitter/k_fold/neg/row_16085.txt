Don't know what to title this post...I haven't thought about suicide in maybe 2 years. The thoughts have recently started bothering me again. I don't know what to do. I feel as though nobody gives a shit about me. In fact I know they don't. I don't know how much longer I can handle my own thoughts. I'm getting closer to my breaking point. I'm lost and confused, and all alone...
