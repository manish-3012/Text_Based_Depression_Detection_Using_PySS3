Not wanting to be the boy who cried wolfThat's what they all say when I tell them I'm having suicidal thoughts again: "oh, you've been saying you're depressed for five years now! Do you ever lighten up? You're not actually going to do it, you haven't done it yet.

And they're right. I feel like a coward and a liar for being here when I said wouldn't be dozens of times. For telling them I was feeling suicidal but not actually following through with my promises.

People should follow through on things, you know? They should be dependable? How would you feel if your friend said he was going to skydive a hundred times and never actually did it? 

I feel guilty because I'm unable to do what I say I'm going to do.
