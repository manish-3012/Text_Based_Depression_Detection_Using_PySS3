Suicide is one of the only things I can think about at this pointI really wish I did it years ago, came close when I was 13 and got hospitalized, and it's only gotten worse since. I tell my family I want to go to college once covid is over but I don't have it in me. Even if from this point on everything went perfect I don't think I could be happy. The idea of going to college and getting a degree doesn't make me happy, accomplished, or anything. It just makes me dread every aspect of the process. Going into class every fucking day exhausted as hell and wishing I could die already, what's the point? I feel like my whole life will just amount to another suicide statistic and I'm more than okay with that. As long as it'll be over soon.
