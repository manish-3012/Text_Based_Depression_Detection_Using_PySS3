Donâ€™t know how to copeHi, Iâ€™m not really sure how to start but Iâ€™ve been contemplating the idea of suicide for a while, about 3 years now. Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do it but recently the urge has been getting stronger and stronger. I lack close friends who I can open up to so Iâ€™ve never actually told anyone and would feel bad if did. Every day I wish I wouldnâ€™t wake up and I cry most nights due to being a reject in school, and at home, since my parents refuse to give me attention of pleasure in life. Itâ€™s currently Ramadan and Iâ€™m struggling living due to fasting, Iâ€™m 6â€™1â€ but weigh 50kg but my parents donâ€™t care and say itâ€™s good for me. I refuse to eat and take my anger out on food so recently Iâ€™ve just been eating less and less and itâ€™s making me hate my body more and more. Iâ€™ve also recently gotten a government issued student loan which my mum wants because Iâ€™m not to be trusted (Iâ€™m 19) and itâ€™s the one thing Iâ€™ve been looking forward to for a month now since I can do a bit of shopping for myself. Today sheâ€™s said if she doesnâ€™t get it by the end of the week, Iâ€™ll have to start paying rent and start paying for the food I get. Iâ€™m also a Muslim cursed with sexuality problems and I donâ€™t know what I did to have caused such a thing but Iâ€™ve been living my entire life a lie and I canâ€™t tell anyone since the friends I do have have publicly made it known that they donâ€™t accept LGBT people and wouldnâ€™t be friends with them so idk how to change my feelings towards genders. The main thing thatâ€™s been holding me from ending myself is not being able to see how happy my family would be, I donâ€™t think they like me, and life right now is just hard to deal with now that Iâ€™m being starved. Sorry for posting this if itâ€™s unserious enough, I just wanted to let a few people know a bit about me before soon maybe I do die
