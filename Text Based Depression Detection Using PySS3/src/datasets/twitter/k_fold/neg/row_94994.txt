Please help me :(I was on Gabapentin for over a year for anxiety at 600 mg per day. It helped and I slowly tapered off. Iâ€™ve been off for about 4 months and I have way worse anxiety than before, even just getting panic attacks while sitting at home. I have moments of depression and suicidal thoughts, naseua and lack of appetite sometimes. I want to give up. When will this end?? Gabapentin was supposed to be safe and harmless!! I canâ€™t do this anymore
