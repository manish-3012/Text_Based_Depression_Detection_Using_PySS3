I have frequent thoughts of suicide and have started to cut myself. The cutting doesn't even hurt anymore, doesn't even sting. All I can think about is cutting deeper...or worse, so I can feel something, anything.
I'm 20 years old and I feel like a failure, like I am just a waste of space in this world. I can't find a job, relationships don't last, my parents are having to pay my bills which makes me feel worthless. I can see that I am nothing but a worthless disappointment. I have horrible insomnia, I go days without sleep, food is losing it's taste. When I can rest all I dream about is dying. I fear I am very close to doing it..
