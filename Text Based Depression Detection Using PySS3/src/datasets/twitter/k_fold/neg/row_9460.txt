Why shouldn't I commit suicide?Im talking about this from a Philosophical perspective. Without heaven life is meaningless. So why shouldn't I commit suicide? If all there is after death is non existence why shouldn't I commit suicide right now if the outcome is the same as if I live a long and happy life for 70 years.
