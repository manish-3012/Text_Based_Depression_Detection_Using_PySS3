Don't mind meI honestly don't believe any of you can help me, because I'm not even sure I want to die. It's the most pÄºeasant thought: to not be. At the same time I'm pretty sure I'm too chicken to take my own life. "Maybe there's a way", "Try a little bit more", "Maybe, this time it won't hurt".
Those are all lies. I'm posting this here because, for the past 9 years I've been having suicidal thoughts, I shrugged them off as "This isn't depression, I'm just being a crybaby". Well, after 9 years, I'm sorry, I can not be a good enough person, but there MUST be SOMETHING off about me.
For the past 9 years I've had thoughts; everyone has thoughts; but today I actually, honestly, and like I've never done before, thought about the rope. This is how I found this subreddit (I was pretty sure there might be one).

For those of you who managed to get through it, what do you suggest? When it gets to the point you don't even want to be yourself (but at the same time you don't want to STOP being yourself), how the fuck do you handle it? I'm pretty sure I've searched the internet the past years and have not found the solution to the 'to be or not to be issue'.

There are many things I'd love to say here but I don't feel confortable enough. (hence the throwaway account)

Please sorry for any lexical errors, english is not my first language
