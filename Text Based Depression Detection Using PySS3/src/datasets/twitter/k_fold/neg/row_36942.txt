Blank SlateI drive myself to the hospital to ask for help but I back down and make up some bullshit so I don't look like an idiot.
I have had so many strong friendships and relationships and yet at the end of the day the only thing I can remember is how truly alone I am.
I have had opportunity for excellent careers, beautiful girls everything one could ever want but i squander it all.
My 21st birthday ticks past and I dont care anymore. Where I saw the good in all things all I see is the negative. I cant handle my hometown anymore, I cant be around my friends of family my skin just begins to crawl. Ive lost faith in God, destiny all that other bullshit they try to sell you so you wont top yourself. Im leaving and I dont even know where to. Any advice on how to cope with this will not fall on deaf ears. Thanks for reading
