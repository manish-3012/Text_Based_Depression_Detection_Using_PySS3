Run out of borrowed timeMom's been dead for years now. Been having more frequent nightmares where she's alive but acting in the worst ways that she did toward the end of her life when her illness was affecting her mind, especially the way she'd sometimes have something bad happen to her and she'd wonder why I did it to her (like falling, when I wasn't able to stop her in time). I don't think I even remember what the actual woman was like anymore, just this warped parody of her.

Inherited the house I grew up in, mortgage and all. Despite the life insurance she left my brother and I with, the damn thing has sucked me dry. I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. My brother has contributed almost nothing to the mortgage, and he's held up every attempt I've tried to get going to sell the fucking thing.

The whole family is so much more emotional than me. I think I have emotions, maybe. I've had to be emotionally supportive literally as far back as I remember. That's the only thing I'm good at anymore; I can't finish school, and I've gotten shittier and shittier at the hobbies most important to me. Yet everyone in the family needs me to be competent for them, and they get hurt when they can't understand that I'm not a wizard.

Friends tell me how happy I make them, how much they love to be around me. I wish I could do that forever, but I'm in too deep. It's fucking terrifying to me whenever someone is attached to me, anyway.

I'm just so tired. I wish sleep would actually kill me. I wish my damned gun wasn't broken from when I misassembled it after cleaning it. Any attempt I could make to get help is just further being a leech, including this one.

Fuck, just let natural selection take its course.
