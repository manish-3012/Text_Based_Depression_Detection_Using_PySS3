I dont want this anymoreMost days I get home from School ( I'm 17), eat something with my older sisters and my mum, and then hide in my bed. 
I hate this life, I don't have any goal in it. No motivation. This is my last year in school. I just need to finish but I'm dying inside.
I want to tell my mum, but I'm afraid she will think I'm like my father. I'm probably like my father. (He had major depression what caused the family to split)

Parts of the reasons my life is going down:

1. Nobody fucking likes me for who I am, they are just friendly to me because I'm good in Informatics and they want help in school tests.
2. I feel lonely, very lonely. I'm a tall skinny nerd nobody likes. It's killing me, I just want somebody to like me for who I am.
3. I don't have any motivation. I sometimes need hours to get out of my bed. I don't know why I even stand up in the morning, for who?

This is going for a few months now, and the longer it goes the more I consider suicide. 
I don't even want to die, I just want this aimless crawling trough my life to stop.

TLDR: I can't find anything worth living for.
