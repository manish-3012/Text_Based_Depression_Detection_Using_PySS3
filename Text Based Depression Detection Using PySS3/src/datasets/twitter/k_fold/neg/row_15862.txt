I fuck things upI've been raised in a toxic family, I had a bad childhood, I got beaten up for no big reason, my parents and grandparents didn't talk to me, they keep telling me that no one loves me and that I'm a waste of time and a mistake, now I am in a relationship and because of my past I don't feel like I deserve my girlfriend, I want to die but she is the only reason that keeps me alive. I sometimes tell her that if something happens to me she should try to forget about me but she starts getting sad and that makes me want to die more. I hate my life so much, I barely have friends, my family keeps telling me how big of a failure I am even if I try my best, and I make my other half feel sad... I wish I could end it all but I don't know how, I don't want to suffer too much.
