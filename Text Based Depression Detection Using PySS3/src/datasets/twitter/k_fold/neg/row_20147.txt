You can get over a death.I feel like the people around me will get over me dying, living with me the way I am will fuck them up for the rest of their life. I'm not only putting myself through the pain but them too. Isn't it selfish to make them put up with me for the rest of their lives when I can give them a chance to work through the loss and get on with the rest of their own lives?
