I just purchased the gun I'm going to kill myself with3 day waiting period starts at time of purchase. Don't intend to do it as soon as I get it but it's looking very likely that it'll be within the next couple weeks.

I would think that having such a short time to live would make me want to get out there and really try to experience some new things or really make these last days count, but I find that all I want to do is sit and cry.
