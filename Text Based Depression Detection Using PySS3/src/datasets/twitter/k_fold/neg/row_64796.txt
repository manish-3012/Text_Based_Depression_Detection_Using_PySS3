Its my birthday this weekTurning 18 soon. Dont remember a year when i was happy. I only held on so long to see if it gets better, really has only got so much worse. Failed at school, never tried because i always thought "whats the point im killing myself soon".I'm killing myself on my birthday. Ive finally cracked, ive wanted this for so long. Im ready. I hope there isnt an afterlife.
