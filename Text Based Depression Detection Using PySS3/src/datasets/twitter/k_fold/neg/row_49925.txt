I feel like I'm going back to the way I was before. I don't want to live like this.I'll try to keep it short since I've written this out many times in the past._x000D_

I've had depression since the age of 7. I'm currently 17. Back in October, I was about to kill myself, but my school counselor ended up talking me out of it. For about a year before that, my depression was really bad and I was dealing with terrible anxiety too (panic attacks, shaking uncontrollably, hard time breathing, crying at the thought of being around other people, passing out, etc). _x000D_

Since then, I've been apathetic about my life. I just gave up on myself and decided to keep going because it made my parents happy. I wasn't really sad anymore, but I wasn't happy either. I was just really content._x000D_

I recently talked to my psychologist about it and she told me that it sounds like it was just a defense mechanism. She said it sounded like I was just going through so much that I subconsciously just "pushed it all aside and said I didn't care." _x000D_

I had thought that my depression was actually starting to go away, but since hearing that, its all coming back now. I wasted my entire childhood being depressed. I just can't keep living if I have to deal with this again. I can already tell that my thoughts are less clear then they were in those few months. I'm having a hard time staying in class without crying. Its starting to bother me again that I don't fit in anywhere._x000D_

I don't know what to do anymore. I just hate how my life has turned out.
