Anything can mean everythingOver the course of a year now, and less than 30 minutes left, i have had a really hard time. There have been so many painful things that happened. But the channel on YouTube Unus Annus that will be deleted very soon now is going to be deleted. It helped me at least have something to enjoy. It hurts so much that it is going to be gone. I am gonna have trouble finding something to fill that hole and keep me alive for just a while longer with sanity.
