Been contemplating for a long time, fantasized a lot and the urge is getting stronger.I've been contemplating my suicide in a detailed manor.  I know what song will be playing while I kill myself, what the note will say, which wont be much and how I will do it.

The only thing that makes me feel better now, is listening to that song and picturing myself bleeding out.
