So I won't turn 27 like thiseeI tried and tried to get better turned to numerous therapist, went into the hospital and had several medications. When I am feeling better shit happens, I have lost my splen, have Morbus Meniere, depression, anxiety, PTSD and ADHD. I get been rejected by all the girls I ever liked. I got beaten and mentally abused  as a child on a daily basis. So what's left for my then to accept the pain won't fade. I gave me self another year last year, worked my ass off. I failed. Now I'll hurt my friends. But enough is enough.
