Christmas presentSo my therapist keeps telling me to think about things, that bring me happiness...

The thing is that nothing does, literally nothing.

I just feel like everyone hates me, and i should leave.

So i chose the only thing, that'll make things better for everyone 

If i fail classes, i ctb at 01.01.2020. no excuses
