Don't know what to doI feel helpless, and often have suicidal thoughts. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone I know

I feel especially bad about myself because nothing particularly bad has happened to me. I grew up with a good mother and father, enjoyable lifestyle, yet now I feel sad all the time but it seems like its for no particular reason

I have felt this way before, but this time it seems worse and is the first time i've had suicidal thoughts. sometimes i think the world may be better if i just ceased to exist, thought i'm too scared to kill myself and i dont want to cause that pain to my family

i really dont know what do to
