Ugh I'm so fucking tired of my mom insulting me. I really wish I could just manage to kill myself, it seems like only then would she ever take me seriously.I wish I was never born. Why have a child if you're just gonna be an asshole? I wasn't even planned, I literally could have been aborted. I should have been aborted. I'm tired of dealing with her and I'm tired to dealing with life in general. I swear to God I'm going to either kill myself or runaway. I almost got the courage in the middle of her insulting me and just fucking walked out the door. Almost. 50 fucking degrees Fahrenheit with strong, icy, winds in nothing but shorts and a t-shirt sounds much better than ever dealing with her.

Fuck this. She keeps pushing me further and further off the fucking edge.
