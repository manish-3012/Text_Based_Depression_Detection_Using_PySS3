It was better before the highsI'm not sure how to explain it. When I was 19 I went through some terrible things. I tried to end it a couple weeks later but only succeeded in being rushed to the emergency room. I dropped out of uni and moved back in with my mom for a couple years. During that time I closed myself off from my feelings. I also didn't let anyone get too close to me. I found it very hard to trust anyone. But killing myself didn't cross my mind. I was like a sad clown. Fun to be around in small doses, but I never let anyone in so that they couldn't hurt me again. It seemed like it worked. I felt... OK. 

That is, until I started working full-time and making new friends and actually letting people in. The highs of my new hold on life caused me to go through severe downs. It is as if I'm terrified of losing this small foothold I had gotten. Anyway a bunch of bad shit happened with this new job, right after I started dating this amazing guy. And it was like deja vu. Or a premonition or something. I ran, and ran and ran and layed down on the playground of my old elementary school with no shoes and no jumper in the middle of winter. I was freezing. It felt good. The motorway is right next to the school and I wanted so badly to jump off the bridge. But he wouldn't stop calling me. And I couldn't do it. But I still want to.

I'm turning 23 soon.
