Not sure what to do with myself anymoreJust tried getting even a small part of whats bothering me off my chest and I think itâ€™s very funny how the only thing that seemed to be my escape has now turned into a completely useless try to make myself feel better. Truly pathetic. This subreddit plus ranting to friends has been my only way to try to fix myself for the past five months. Iâ€™ve now figured out just how pointless it is when thereâ€™s nothing someone could say to make me feel okay with who I am and the life Iâ€™m living because they canâ€™t prove me wrong. Thereâ€™s too much thatâ€™s wrong with me. Not sure why Iâ€™m writing this, if you read it then thank you for doing that and have a nice day. Hope that if youâ€™re struggling too you find a way to get out of it since I canâ€™t.
