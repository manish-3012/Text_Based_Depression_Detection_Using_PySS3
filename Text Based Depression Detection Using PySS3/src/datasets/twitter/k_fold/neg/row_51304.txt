please help me. i dont want to kill myself. but i may eventually be capable of doing so.im scared of saying this and i say this reluctantly. this is long. if i were in your position i wouldnt read all of it. i woudl think that im pathetic and useless and skip it. maybe write a fake comment and pretend i read everything yea thats what i would do.

&amp;#x200B;

but i want help. no i dont want it. i know i need it. i want to be cured. i doubt i can but i still reluctantly hope it. 

&amp;#x200B;

this is a mess. you're reading a mess. this wont make sense but something in my head tells me i have to write this. i typed everything that came up in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm twenty.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no reason to kill myself. On paper I should be happy. I have everything but a significant other. Money. Good School. And now I have better friends than I ever did. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it all hurts. I am overwhelmed with thoughts in my head. I overthink, I assume, I'm paranoid  and my own consciousness directly talks to me and it's driving me insane. I sometimes hear sounds and voices I know that aren't there.

&amp;#x200B;

I shouldn't be mentally ill. I don't cut myself and I know i cant kill myself too many people care (or do they actually?). Maybe i might if this continued. these thoughts in my head my own mind talking to me. echoing what i do sometimes telling me its all a joke, that its all stupid. that everything i find meaningful is meaningless. 

&amp;#x200B;

i wish i could kill myself. i wish i had that will. but i cant even do that. can you believe that? i cant even kill myself. all this shit. and i cant even kill myself. thats crazy no? i want to but i cant. i know people care and there are things i want to do. but yet i want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

 But something lingers. I don't see a future even though I know I'll have one if I don't fuck up. But it lingers.

&amp;#x200B;

It all sounds like an excuse. Even writing this. i don't know why I'm writing this. i should be studying. I could eventually graduate get a good job make my parents proud find a nice girl and live.

&amp;#x200B;

maybe its because I compare myself to others. maybe because I think I wasn't as born as good looking, as strong, as strong willed, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

what do i do. I cant even write straight. I know this shit im writing is a mess. im lost. why cant i just be normal. why cant i just tell my friends when i have problems. i should be normal i know i can be normal. cant i fake it till i make it?

&amp;#x200B;

maybe its the drugs. the adderall perhaps? but i had these feelings even before i took adderall. i maybe take a pill once or twice per month.

&amp;#x200B;

is it the drinking? i barely drink anymore. probably not. if its that it shouldve been worse when i was drinking almost daily a year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

its the worse its ever been and it shouldnt. i have the most ive ever had in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

what do i do?

&amp;#x200B;

did i mention i lie too much? im a compulsive liar. is it that? i want to stop. but sometimes i lie instinctively. if i told them its a lie they would think im a no good liar. there are lies i want to fix but its too late now to tell the truth. what would that make me look like? im buried in lies that i can only cover with more lies.

&amp;#x200B;

wait actually. maybe this is all about love? ive hooked up. made out. but ive never had a true girlfriend and im still a virgin. 

&amp;#x200B;

and now to to the funniest part. i could go see a counselor but i dont want to be caught somehow by someone i know because ill look weak and problematic and thats just unattractive. i could go tomorrow morning but i know i should study. because thats what a normal kid would do. not go to a hospital for mental issues but study live life spend time with friends. and also a part of me thinks this is all normal. i wish it wasnt so i could get it cured but it could all be normal.

&amp;#x200B;

maybe this is all normal. i dont think like this all the time. or do i? i dont know.

&amp;#x200B;

what do i do.

&amp;#x200B;

am i even writing this for someone to read? fuck this almost even sounds like a copypasta or a fucking troll. maybe im just doing this for myself. i dont know.

&amp;#x200B;

why am i not happy? why is my mind clouded with these thoughts? why cant will myself to make the most of what i have?

&amp;#x200B;

i love my friends.

i love my family.

i have money.

I have an education.

i know i can find someone who loves me.

i have a decent personality.

im not too ugly. probably normal. yea im normal.

&amp;#x200B;

So what are these thoughts? what am I doing?

I came to the study lounge to study yet Im writing this. 2700 words in 30 minutes. couldve finished my essay in that time.

&amp;#x200B;

im awful. i wish i was normal. wish i didnt think of all this. even now a thought popped up in my head: im sure everyone feelings like this at some point. But for some reason it doesn't feel normal. I feel like im alone in this. its probably my head trying to justify all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

who would even read all this. why am i here? and if someone read all this? why? why believe or even bother reading this nonsense that barely makes sense? im not your friend. you don't know me. i doubt you're so selfless you read all this to take care of a random stranger that could just be a troll.

&amp;#x200B;

maybe no one will read this. maybe no one will comment. maybe a troll might just message me telling me to die.

&amp;#x200B;

it might make me think about suicide if someone did that. but i know i won't. too many people care about me and there are things that i want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

yet i consider suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

actually. if there was a button that ended my life i could press it.

would I tho? i would never know.

&amp;#x200B;

but everything you read (if someoen did read it) are the thoughts that constantly wreck with my head. sometimes i forget where i am. sometmes my life feels like dejavu. soemtimes i feel alone surrounded by people. sometimes i cant even say hi to someone im friends for reasons i know not why.

&amp;#x200B;

is that waht im afriad of? people viewing me as insane? retarded? im sure someone people view me as that already. but that doesn't matter. i know it doesnt matter what everyone thinks of me. i should just say hi. or approach someone out of nowhere and try to make a friend out of them. 

&amp;#x200B;

this post has no focus. but i guess its something. now looking at it. it feels like im flushing my thoughts down the toilet. wow it made me feel  a little better. but i know the thoughts will comeback. it always does.

&amp;#x200B;

perhaps i need to be medicated. it cant be normal i sometimes hear things. that sometimes i have weird urges. that sometimes everything feels numb and pointless. that sometimes even my best friends dont care.

&amp;#x200B;

maybe they don't. I have good reasons to believe they don't. well. they may care. but not as much as i care about them.

&amp;#x200B;

or maybe it's just an illusion maybe i don't care about them either.

&amp;#x200B;

MAYBE. its because i dont stand up for myself. im a pushover. but at the same time. im selfish. i won't let anyone win over me. if a house was burning down. id pretend to care but try to save myself first.

&amp;#x200B;

No. wait. actually. it's paranoia. that people don't care about me. the only person i know who cares of sure is my parents. wait thats two people. oh also my aunt. but that feels not enough. for some reason im mean to family. theyve never done me wrong they send me way too much money. i only hurt them. could that be why? fuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

could it be a childhood trauma? i had no real female contact in my middle school years. all i talked about were video games and all i did was play video games in middle school. for fuck sakes i paid someone to sit next to me in class.  but thats the past. im not popular now but everyone in my community knows who i am. some people go out of their way to be my friend. maybe i am popular? no. im definitely not. 

&amp;#x200B;

a reliable source told me people want to get close to me. but its my shyness. perhaps its that. im an only child. took me longer to learn social skills. it could be that. that awkwardness could be haunting me still. making me have these thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

or it could be my judgemental nature. i avoid ugly people or people i find dislikable based on the first time i meet. but later i realize i need more friends. i need to burn time. so i try to befriend them but ive already ruined it by being low key mean to them. its a cycle of regret.

&amp;#x200B;

speaking of regret. i have problems of regret. i cant let go of regret. i get way too angry and stressed thinking of mistakes from many years ago that still mess with my head.  

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like i wasted so many years. i have so many years in my life left yet i feel like i wasted it. i couldve done it better. i wish i could go back in time

&amp;#x200B;

i just fucking wish i coud change things. why couldnt i just have come out perfect?

&amp;#x200B;

why am i prone to sinning? doing things that are wrong. coercing drunk girls to make out with me. gambling.

drugs execessive drinking. FUCK WHY CANT I JUST KEEP THIS ORGANIZED. i apologize this is hard to read. is someone even gonna read this? i doubt it. but i write this hoping even though i dont want to hope it. i dont know what this even means. im just saying it.
