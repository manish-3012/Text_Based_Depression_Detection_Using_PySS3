Things are against meNot just big things. Small things. Stub my toe, accidentally dropping things, forgetting the remote when i sit down, opening the wrong drawer, forgetting why i was getting up. I have no idea why, but these things bug me subconsciously. How can i keep making the same mistakes? After these things build up, i freak the fuck out at someone, usually for something simple, like asking a stupid question. It doesnt help that i approach everything irl sarcastically, so i make them feel stupid, if they dont flip out on me. Am i a bad person for this?
