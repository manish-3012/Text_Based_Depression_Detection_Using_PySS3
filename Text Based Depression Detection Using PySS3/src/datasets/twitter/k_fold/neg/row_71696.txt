I am convinced I canâ€™t do anything in life.I feel so pressured to attend college and itâ€™s making my symptoms worse. I only feel like killing myself in the morning and past 2-3 Iâ€™m a little better. So why is my calc at 8am and I live an hour  away from my school and have to take the bus there so waking up before 6 is seeming impossible.
