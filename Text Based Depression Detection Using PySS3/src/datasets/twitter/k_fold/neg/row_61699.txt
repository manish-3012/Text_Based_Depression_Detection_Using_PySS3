I feel like I need helpI am an FTM transgender guy and I am feeling incredibly hopeless.  Every time I look at myself I see a disgusting freak, not because of anyone in my life telling me so, simply because I feel that way.  I am unhappy every day knowing that I will never have a penis.  I know this is stupid, that some guys lose their dicks in accidents or can't have children or whatever, but it makes me literally want to die. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up, I am trying to get on hormones but it is nigh on impossible even in the liberal area in which I live.  Even after the hormones, I will still literally never have my greatest wish, which is the genitalia I feel like my brain signed up for a birth.  Please help me Reddit. I don't want to tell anyone I actually know because they will be worried and treat me like I am fragile and stupid, when really I just know I can never get what I want no matter how hard I try.
