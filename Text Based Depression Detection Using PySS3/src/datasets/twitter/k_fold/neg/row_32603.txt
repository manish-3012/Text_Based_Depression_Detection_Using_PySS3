My kid is my only reasonAnd sometimes I wish she was dead, because then I could be too. I love her more than anything ever and she's all that I have. At the same time, somewhere deep down, I'm thinking...if I wasn't a mother, I'd have a permission to commit suicide. 

Me killing myself would harm her for the rest of her life. I will never do such thing. But right now I'm just so tired and lonely. Tired of this battle.
