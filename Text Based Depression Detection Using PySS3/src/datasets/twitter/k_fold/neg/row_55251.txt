How long can one seriously be expected to say alive for their parent?My moms the only reason I'm around still. Pretty common story around here. I just can't fucking do it much longer. She gets so frustrated with my lack of progress and success yet I know that I will never wake up one day and transcend this. She feels she's done literally everything she can for me, and honestly, she really has. Some fucked up shit happened to me when I was young and it's just irrecoverable for me. I'm trying to get the courage to end myself because, honestly, there are literally way worse outcomes for my life than that. Isn't that fucked up? That your life is so screwed up and you feel so out of control that suicide is BETTER than other things that could happen?
