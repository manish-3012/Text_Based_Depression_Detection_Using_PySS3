I donâ€™t know what to doItâ€™s been years. I just had a particularly horrible breakdown concerning the vision in my eye. Just recently I received lightflashes and grayspots (?) in my eyes and my vision has been blurry, mostly in my left, for a while now. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been  feeling very depressed for a while now (hence the itâ€™s been years part) but I will genuinely kill myself if I end up with permanent impairment in my eyes, even blindness, Iâ€™m only 16. Of fucking course this happened during the only time I canâ€™t easily revive medical treatment. I finally mustered the motivation to do one of my google classroom assignments and this happens. I feel like I can just never win or get ahead. (Sorry for any spelling errors, itâ€™s just kinda hard to type when you know, your eyesight isnâ€™t par at the moment)
