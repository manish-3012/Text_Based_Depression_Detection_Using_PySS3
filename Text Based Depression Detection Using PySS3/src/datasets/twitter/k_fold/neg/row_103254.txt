Please help me- my boyfriend is suicidal.This post is asking for help with my suicidal 20yo boyfriend (we live in Australia). 

I've been with my boyfriend for two and a half years,  and we live together.  We've had two 'big'  fights; one two months ago and one last night.  Two months ago,  I woke up the morning after the fight and he'd accidentally left open private tabs of 'what to do if suicidal' searches.  When that happened I just spent more time with him and made sure he knew he was loved.  However, this morning (morning after the most recent fight) I woke to him asleep in front of the computer with a private search tab where he had searched 'how high do you have to jump from to die 100%', and he was browsing a forum discussing the perfect height to kill yourself from. 
I'm extremely worried, I love him and I will do anything to help him. I want him to get professional help,  but neither of us have any money for it. If anybody has been through a similar situation please help me, or if anybody knows anywhere I can get him help in Australia without going bankrupt please post.  
Thankyou for your help,  I really appreciate it.
