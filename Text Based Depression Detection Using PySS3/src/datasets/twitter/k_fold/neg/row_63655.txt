Hanging myselfI've been trying for weeks to hang myself from the metal bar in my wardrobe but the bar is shorter than me and its hard to get the noose tight as i have to get lower than a crouch position.  

I needed to hang the rope from something higher. I found something (not telling you). I stood on a chair put the rope around my neck then slowly stepped off the chair to tighten the noose. The noose wasn't tight enough in a standing position so I crouched a little to tighten it further. 

I was in the middle of a dream when I woke up on the floor. The noose was still around my neck but the rope ripped.  

All I need is a stronger rope and I know exactly how to kill myself. It's almost reassuring to know I have a perfect method  after trying for weeks and failing. 

It's nice knowing I have a safety net that I can use when life gets worse.
