Assisted death.I find it incredibly unjust that assisted suicide isn't legal in the state's. And the spots where it is legal it's only for those terminally ill. I've struggled ever since I was young with mental illness. (Add some trauma through out the years, along with multiple suicide attempts) My brain is wired so fucking bad, I find myself in these painful lows where I can't forgot what's happened to me and what I've done. And when I finally feel like I have things somewhat in control it falls apart all around me again. I feel like the character in movies who struggles with drug addiction and stumbles in and out of their families lives causing grief. Except I don't have an excuse, I don't have a good personality or anything to come back to when sober. I'm just this shitty manic person who's sometimes easier to deal with. 

I just wish I could find peace legally. Without having to find some inhumane way to kill myself. Without having to go days before someone finds my body and without traumatizing someone else. 

I'm just waiting till I have my own place. I'm so close to having my own place. When I do. I'm going to kill myself and finally be free. Finally find peace. 

Listen to Beyond the Valley of the Three White Horses if you'd like. It's the song I unsuccessfully attempted to last year. It brought me so much peace while I waited. This next time I'll follow through. 

Sorry if this is a mess. Wish you all the best.
