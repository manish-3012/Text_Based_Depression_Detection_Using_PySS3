VentingI don't know where else to put this, so here goes. 

The thought of our gun cabinet has been close at hand for weeks now. I can't stop it. I can't seem to stop being so depressed. 

Five years ago I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and depression. The hallucinations I can live with, but lately the depression has been too much. 

The worst part is I have no reason to be depressed. I have the happiest, most beautiful baby you could ever see. My husband loves me more than life itself, and I love him twice as much. I have a job that I am at simply because I love it, and if we wanted we could both quit our jobs and retire on our savings.

So why do I feel this way? It isn't ennui - we had to work, and I worked HARD, to get here. I just don't know how much more I can push on. 

I'm just so tired.
