Iï¸ donâ€™t know if Iï¸ can do this.Iï¸ canâ€™t breathe. My body doesnâ€™t feel like mine. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a while but today was the first time in a long time that Iï¸ consider actually taking my life... Iï¸ donâ€™t know what to do. My boyfriend broke up with me yesterday and I donâ€™t want to live in a world where we arenâ€™t together. Iï¸ want to die. Iâ€™ve never felt pain like this... Iâ€™ve had depression and anxiety my whole life, it definitely played its role in this relationship and him leaving me has pushed it to a place Iâ€™ve never experienced before. Iï¸ donâ€™t know how to move passed this. Iï¸ miss him already, Iï¸ donâ€™t want to be alive, Iï¸ canâ€™t breathe.
