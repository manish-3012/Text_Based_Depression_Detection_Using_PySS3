Iâ€™ve lived long past my timeIâ€™ve been contemplating suicide as long as I can remember 

Iâ€™ve done everything to get better, I got my diagnosis, and have been taking them for more than three months only to find out the best version of myself still sucks a lot. 

Last time I tried I was stopped because I left a note. This time I made no such mistake. Iâ€™ll be gone before my family comes home. I told a few of my friends some final words and my phone has been blowing up so I just turned it off. I scrubbed all of my presence on social media. Itâ€™s all done. I can finally go in peace. My first attempt was when I was 18, Iâ€™m finally succeeding. Honestly my lifeâ€™s been going down hill from then anyway so itâ€™s about time. I just needed to get my last word out without alarming any more people. Itâ€™s finally over. Iâ€™m glad I got to choose how I go. Goodbye
