It's my birthday and I wish I had the courage to ensure I'd never have another one.My life has been getting worse and worse for the past eight months, and it wasn't starting from a very high base. I am one failure away from being kicked out of university and I'm just about to receive it. I am extraordinarily ugly, lazy and apathetic. My friends have drifted away out of boredom or revulsion. I have no money and no job, my clothes are falling apart and I can't even afford a haircut. I should have finished university by now, but in *four fucking years* I haven't even completed one semester's worth of study. My parents pay for me to see a psychologist and he told me last week that my problems seemed beyond his aid. 

I'd like to think it's concern for my parents that keeps me alive. But I doubt it. I think it's just cowardice, the same cowardice that has utterly ruined my life. 

For that reason, feel free to ignore this post. If I was serious about killing myself, I would have done it years ago.
