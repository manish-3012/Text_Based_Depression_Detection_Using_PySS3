My mind is trying to find reasons for suicideTitle says it.  These days I've been much better as opposed to a few weeks ago, but whenever I'm doing nothing, I find myself occasionally finding reasons to kill myself.  Is it common, this sort of withdrawal effect?  Suicide just comes up now as a very casual thought, and it seems so convenient that it becomes tempting to just do it.
