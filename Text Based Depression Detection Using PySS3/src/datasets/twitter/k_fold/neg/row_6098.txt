Being a genuine burden to othersI've been depressed for so long, had therapy since childhood and antidepressants since 14, dealing with an endless host of issues that's not worth getting into. Now at 22 I only exist as a burden to others.

 I'm lucky that my parents are extremely kind, patient, forgiving people. I'm too sad to really function, so they do everything for me. I can't hold down a job, so they support me financially.  I flunk out of university and they tell me it's okay. I fail at everything I undertake but receive nothing but kindness in return. I've said the same complaints over and over again for years and they always listen and give advice, or pay for my therapists if they can't.

And nothing helps, so I keep existing while continuously burdening them with my existence. Of course I can tell that I have burdened them. Severe depression is a burden to loved ones as well as the person suffering it, just like other, physical illnesses burden loved ones. Suicide would not only solve my issues but it would probably result in more happiness for my family too. They would feel a great deal of sadness at first but eventually recover, instead of having to watch their child decline each passing year no matter what they do.
