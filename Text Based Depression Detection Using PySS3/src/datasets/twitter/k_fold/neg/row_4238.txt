When my parents take away my only incentive to live another day.I think I'm going to end it soon. Maybe not today, but I know I will soon. 

I dropped out of high school so I could distract myself from reality with video games, and this is all I did for the next 6 months up until today, my only joy in life was gaming (Pathetic, I know.) 

My parents know I have a problem and they think solving the problem is taking my computer away and putting me through counseling. But honestly I don't even know if they can force me to speak to one I have no motivation or desire to, and I already planned on killing myself if I turned 18 and was still jobless. 

My only fear is hurting my mother, as for my step dad he can fuck off, maybe my suicide will prove a point to him. 

I don't even know if this post is making sense, I cant keep a stream of thoughts going without getting distracted.

I also dont even know why im posting this
