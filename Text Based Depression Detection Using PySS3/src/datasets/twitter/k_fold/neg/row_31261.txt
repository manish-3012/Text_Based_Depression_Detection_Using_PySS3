i just need something to live fori just havenâ€™t been myself lately, i just started high school. nothings going good, i hate the way i look. the blackheads on my face, my ugly hair that used to look good. i rarely have happy times. iâ€™m starting to think about this girl again, i always get fucking depressed every time i do, itâ€™s been a year now since i have. i trashed my whole closet today. i thought about, hanging, suffocating, and shooting myself. i donâ€™t know what to do with my life anymore. i just donâ€™t know happiness.
