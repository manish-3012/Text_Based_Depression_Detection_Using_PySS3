I'm ruining myselfI've been slowly convincing myself to kill myself more and more and I'm scared. It probably sounds weird but I can't do anything about it.

I have these blackout moments when walking due to ptsd, I don't go unconscious in a way, it's like I skipped time and I end up somewhere else.

It's like when you go bed, blink and it's morning, except it happens when I'm walking and I'm terrified because of my mind convincing itself that it's best to die, I feel like if I go anywhere I'll just unconsciously kill myself
