I just want to go away.Iâ€™m at a point where I would welcome a quick end to all of the pain. I donâ€™t want to be a burden to anyone anymore, I donâ€™t fit in anywhere. My friends seldom talk to me anymore because of life, I feel like Iâ€™ve been left behind and the only place Iâ€™m comfortable is laying down in the dark drifting from conscious to unconscious. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and this always comes back, worse than the last time.
