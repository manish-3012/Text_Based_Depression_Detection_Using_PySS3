Good friend online threatening suicide. Need advice.I've been friends with this person for a few months and we've gotten extremely close, we know almost everything about each other.  Recently, they've started opening up even more, and told me about their past self harm and suicide attempts. 

Over the past couple weeks they've been getting verbally abused by a lot of their close friends, and has been self harming and thinking about suicide again.  I'm the only person that knows, but they don't actually talk to me at all when they're feeling depressed, they just come to me after the fact.

I don't know what I can do to help, if anything.
