I could do it any day now and I don't even have anyone to tell about itAnytime I see anyone I just act normal and like I'm doing just fine, meanwhile I keep a tied noose in my car with the right length and thickness for a drop and an exact spot I could go to do it at any moment. It's even by my work and I drive past it almost every day where I'd want to do it. When they run you through those suicide risk questionnaires they ask if you have details worked out and that's a big yes for me. Every painstaking detail planned to a T. 



I'm literally so scared at this point because at any point I could just be at the spot in &lt;5 minutes and do it.


Like I said the worst part is I don't have anyone to tell about it. No friends, family, no therapist or doctor etc. Everyone around me goes about their lives and doesn't even think about how I might be doing and soon they'll probably be saying it was so unexpected after I do it like it hadn't been in the works for 5+ years
