Life is just about objectivesThis not a farewell note, just some thoughts.

I've witnessed many things after years of living and studying how others go on their own,

It's all about fixing and accomplishing objectives, since you have something to do, your life has a meaning while you're trying to get to your goal.

But once you finally reach it, the void. And you wonder why you are supposed to do here, in this very world.

And since everyone is following theirs own goals, they rapidly forget about you, that's kinda scary.

Once I tried to experiment this myself, I stopped giving signs of life, stopped talking to people I normally talk to, and waited to see who's gonna notice first... The result was frightening...

The more you grow up, the less you are able to talk and see distant friends because they're going their own way, and you can't blame them for this, but the truth is you're getting lonelier and so on...

Things are just goings on, and i'm not changing at all, just witnessing time going by.

No one but me knows how depressed I am, I'm struggling since so much time.

But who cares ?
