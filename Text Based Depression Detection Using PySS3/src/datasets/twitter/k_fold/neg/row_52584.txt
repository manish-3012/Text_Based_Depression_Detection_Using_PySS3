P.a.i.nI just want to touch on how depression is very painful. My face was ruined, and I am having hard time accepting the fact the I have a face that no longer belongs to me. I canâ€™t overcome how painful it is, and I canâ€™t describe how depression can make you a different person. I canâ€™t control any of it, itâ€™s just part of who I am I feel like. Itâ€™s consuming every single piece of soul I have left. I fight everyday to survive rather than live. My survival is just based on the fact that I can get this mess fixed one day. Depression is physically painful. The nausea, dizziness, racing heart, zero appetite, etc. itâ€™s disgusting, and I canâ€™t believe that such pain can exist in this world. People want cars, money, vacations.. I just want to be okay. I want to feel safe in my own skin. I want to feel okay looking at my own reflection. I want to be okay. Thatâ€™s all I want.
