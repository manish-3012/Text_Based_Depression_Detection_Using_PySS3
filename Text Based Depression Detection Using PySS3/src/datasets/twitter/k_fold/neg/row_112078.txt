Why am I like this?I go to therapy. I talk to a couple of supportive friends. I moved away from my horrible parents. Despite failing a semester in University, things were  getting better. 

Now I'm watching myself waste days away instead of finding a job so I can pay rent. I'm sad all the time and I don't use any of the tools my therapist gave me to stop self harming. I don't listen to my friends. I don't fight the thoughts anymore. I've started thinking about suicide more and more. One of my friends said if I don't start getting better soon, then I'm just doing this for attention. I don't know why I'm doing this to myself. I don't want to die but I feel like I'm forcing myself into a situation where that's the only thing left to do.
