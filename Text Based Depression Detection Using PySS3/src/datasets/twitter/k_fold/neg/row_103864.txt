I'm only 25, yet it is like my life has been a swirling toilet that just won't flush.Even with a sister I was isolated with a lot of time to myself growing up, one of the running jokes in my family is that my sister asked 'put it back I want a sister' when I was born.   

The only people I have or rather had was my cousin, however with life we have more responsibilities now and don't hang out too often anymore and 1 friend who lives 4 hours away by car and I haven't seen them in person in about six years + we barely talk due to adult shit. 

Everyone local is just too up their own ass to put it blunt, I went through that shit during education. It never seems to change.

Rewrote this multiple times trying to sound less whiny, but fuck it. 
 Don't think I am going to be around after today anyways, so whatever. I'm only 25, yet it is like my life has been a swirling toilet that just won't flush tbh as petty pre-teen edgelord as that makes me sound.
