The only thing keeping me here is the thought of what my death would do to my parents. Other than that, I have no reason to be here.I'm 23, live alone, working full time.  The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I know what that would to do my parents.  I've already seen what my actions have done to them before, when I quit my job and tried to move to Florida (I'm in Atlanta) to be with the girl I loved more than life itself.  They couldn't stand the thought of me being so far away, and with her, and it tore them apart.  Relationship ended and everything returned back to normal for them.  They don't know how I've lived my life since then, with the drunken nights, drug use, strip clubs, near suicide attempt....my life itself has gotten better but I'm just so tired of everything.  I want to throw up my hands and give up and have all these goddamn burdens off my back.  But I can't, because I know what it would do to my parents.  I want to die but I can't.  So I'm stuck here, acting like a give a shit about this world.
