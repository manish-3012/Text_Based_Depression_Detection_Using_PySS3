SucksI don't know where to get help. I have a phobia of phones, and really bad social anxiety, but the anxiety can be somewhat worked with though. But then there's the thing that if I booked an appoitment for a therapist, I couldn't afford to take a bus. Walking or going with a bike is not an option, my apartment's literally in the middle of nowhere and I can barely walk around the block.

I come from an abusive home, my parents have abused me emotionally since I was little. They've never hit me or anything, although they have threatened to for sure (they've even threatened to bury my dog alive etc. and told on several occasions that I'm taking poor care of him and that it'd be better for the dog and I'm scared that I am actually as shitty as they tell me I am. I don't want to hurt anyone). The abuse happened pretty much 24/7, and I ended up becoming so scared in the end before moving out that I never even came out of my own room. I have my own apartment now, and I've seen myself getting a lil bit better but it's so hard with no support. I have no one. No friends, maybe a few people I can say hi to on WhatsApp but that's about it. I've lost so many friends in the last couple of years. The last time I saw a friend was at least half a year ago, there's literally nobody in my life.

I'm not in school, don't have job, ironically I'm still supported financially by my parents which scares me. And I can't get into school, because I'm stupid as hell and have already failed and dropped out once.

I guess I just want a hug. I hate having to do everything by myself. Sorry for the weird rants, I'm not even going to spellcheck so blame dyslexia for the bad grammar.
