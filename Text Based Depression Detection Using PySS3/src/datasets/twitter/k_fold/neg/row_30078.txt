What more can be saideveryone has the same story as me here. i'm not special. i can rationalize that my life is easier than most people on the planets', that i'm more privileged than most people and have more opportunities than most people....and it just increases the self-hatred. what kind of fucking nerve must i have to want to kill myself when i've had running water and electricity my whole life? when i have parents that aren't abusive and the opportunity for an education...but i dont want to try. i dont want to get better. i'm embarassed by my existence and i know everyone hates me, even though i know no one actually hates me. i fucking hate this existence and the plan of a nitrogen can and a plastic bag on my head is seeming more and more appropriate. i keep telling myself i'll wait until my parents die to spare them the pain, but i'm starting to think thats too long of a wait...
