thinking of giving up because i'm really uselesstbh, i dont have the saddest story, and that just makes me feel even worse. im actually really blessed, but im hopeless and useless all the same, so. the story is:

My parents, especially my mother, were really abusive to me. my mom would constantly tell me how ugly and fat i was until i developed anorexia at 12, and shed manipulate me into thinking i was a garbage daughter for not loving her enough and all that. my dad was kinda absent but he worked a lot, i dont resent him much but i dont feel close to him at all either. 

my parents were really hard to deal with, but they didnt suck on purpose, they are just very flawed. i left their place in 2016 to go to college, and i have been living w a pretty manageable deal of functional depression since i left my parents place and we have an ok kind of relationship. 

however i gave up on that degree for a few personal reasons, and they have since been extremely disappointed. my parents always had sort of an habit to lie to me or hide stuff from me then manipulate me into doing what they wanted or sabotaging me when i was doing what i wanted but they didnt, so when i quit college i didnt tell them. but i lost my job september last year and had to ask for financial support, so now im under their full control again. they let me stay here in my own place until the beginning of this year, hoping id get back on my feet. i didnt. so ill be moving back in with them in a few weeks.

i sinked in deep in my depression since losing my job. i sleep all day and am tired all the time. i drink and smoke and never leave the house, thats my basic routine. the ONLY thing that makes me keep living and not neglect the world are my pets. i have two lovely angels in the form of beautiful, tiny, cats and a darling baby dog. they saved me more times than i can count. i clean the house to give them a dignified space to live in - if they werent here, id be living in filth. i let the sun in exclusively because i know they like sunbathing. i only get out of bed to feed, play with and walk them, if they werent here i wouldnt leave the bed at all. anyways, the straight up only reason im alive and functioning are my pets.

i had been feeling like garbage a lot since losing my job and contemplated suicide greatly. i decided not to do it because i love my pets and life was worth living with them around me.

recently tho something really great has happened to me, and a university in europe got in contact with me to study there. i wanted to go so bad, itd be a dream come true. but my parents wont help me unless i give up my pets - they wont help me financially take them with me, and wont take them in if i go. i cant do this. i cant just get rid of the beings that are the literal reason im living now, the things i love the most in life.

i decided i cant go. i know its only a matter of time before depression hits and im alone and finally kill myself, and i cant stand the idea of getting my parents hopes up about me finally not being a failure and a waste of money only to die abroad. i also would never give up my pets under no circumstance. i see no way out but to move back in with my parents, take my pets to their house and then killing myself.

i cant stand the perspective of disappointing my parents again by refusing an amazing education opportunity, and by refusing im sentencing myself to be a burden my entire life - im already jobless and know i dont have a future. id never be able to get on by myself. 

the plan is to make my parents already adopt my pets and leave a note asking them to not get rid of my angels once im dead and just give up instead of dealing with being a continuous disappointment and failure.

idk what else i could do
