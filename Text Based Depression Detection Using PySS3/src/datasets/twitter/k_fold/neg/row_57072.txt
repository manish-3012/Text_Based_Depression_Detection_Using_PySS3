Looking for hopeIâ€™m desperately trying to cling to some hope. Has anyone been able to pull themselves out of this space successfully? Itâ€™s been a perfect storm of things happening and most recently, my financial life came crashing down to the point where I havenâ€™t been able to afford groceries or a haircut in over a month. A coworker literally dropped a bag of groceries at my door and left. Iâ€™ve never imagined myself in this place and Iâ€™m repulsed to be completely honest because of the fact that I let it get so bad. I hate that Iâ€™m here and that I canâ€™t get myself out.
