Never enoughAll around me life is beautifully created, people reach their dreams and settle in a state of grace, i regard them in peace. They deserve all the beauty of this world, for them is the future, the resources, the love and kindness. I feel good watching them, i live because of other people happiness and i'm lucky to be in such a perfect place.  The only flaw is me, being an unworthy individual, toxic for them, i don't really get why fate put me here, i'm like the dust that covers the forniture, i just ruin anything while all is just good by their own, my only task is just not being too visible for my nasty being. All i ask is to be annihilated by the beauty to disappear and be forgotten. Only that way i wuld be satisfied.
