I know when to die and I donâ€™t know how to feel about itIâ€™ve already decided on a day. The preparations are done. However, I cannot shake this feeling of unease out of my skin, itâ€™s growing day after day and Iâ€™m scared I will fail. 

I canâ€™t imagine failing to die... because the other option will be coming back home, pretend Iâ€™m fine and tell an imaginary recounting of the day Iâ€™ve spent, knowing that I was going to throw myself out hoping for the water to take me. 

Iâ€™m scared that after all these years fantasising about death, it will not be The End. Then what else will be left of me ? Iâ€™ve spent years and years imagining my death, fantasising about it, because it was all I had. All I could possibly do, was kill myself. 

But Iâ€™m afraid. Iâ€™m anxious and nervous and Iâ€™m procrastinating... Iâ€™m second guessing it, and I hate, hate, hate that I canâ€™t be at peace with it. That Iâ€™m still so fucking human about it. 

What did you felt after deciding you will die ?
