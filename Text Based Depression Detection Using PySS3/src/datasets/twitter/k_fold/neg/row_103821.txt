[Poem] I want to kill myselfI want to kill myself.

I want to kill myself.

I want to kill myself.

I want to kill myself.

I want to kill myself.

I want to kill myself.

I want to kill myself.

I want to kill myself.

A new start I've made

I've made my own plan.

I'm here to get what I deserve.

I just want to survive and keep trying.

I want to survive so bad I don't even want to see them anymore.

This I know, this is my life's mission.

I want to die, to be killed.

I didn't know this life, I just knew what it felt like.

I didn't know what I should be doing.

I didn't know what to do, my whole life had been about trying to find out, searching on my own.

And I didn't know when to stop and what to do.

So I made my own plan and now I'm here.

I'm here to die

This, I make my own deal

I'm out here to die.

I'm here to die

This is who I am
