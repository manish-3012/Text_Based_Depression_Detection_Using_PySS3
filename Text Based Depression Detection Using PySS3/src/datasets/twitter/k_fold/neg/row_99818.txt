Why should I be forced to live if i don't want to, and if my death will generally benefit others?In my current (and for the foreseeable future) situation I am a dependent. I have no job, no partner, no real friends or people who care about me, I'm just a parasite, living off the hard work of others. I'm useless, and I'm fucked to a point where I'm unable to change it because of how fucked my health is. If I'm unable to enjoy living, and others would rather I was dead, why should I live?
