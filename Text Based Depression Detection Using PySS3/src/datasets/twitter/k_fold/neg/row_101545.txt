17 y/o girl &amp; suicidal, need to ventI'm not really sure why I'm posting on here. I just don't know what to do. I'm a 17 year old girl, I don't have friends, I'm ugly, have a shit family, and I'm probably not getting into uni. I've tried talking to a teacher at school about feeling down but they didn't care - I don't think anyone does.

Everything that makes me feel crap is so trivial and I feel stupid for feeling suicidal because I've not gone through cancer, homelessness, loss etc. and I'm just a teenager. But I don't see this getting better.

I've researched suicide a lot and although the possibility of failing scares me, I don't think I have much choice. I don't want to carry on living like this.
