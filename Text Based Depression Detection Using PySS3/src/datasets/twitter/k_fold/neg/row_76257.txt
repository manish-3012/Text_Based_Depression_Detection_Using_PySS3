My weird situationIâ€™ve got a disabled brother.

He has a fairly rare disability, and I suppose affects him in a similar way to Down syndrome. Lower mental age, over friendly, some struggles with speech etc.

Heâ€™s a teen and entirely reliant on my parents. Canâ€™t leave the house on his own, canâ€™t be left home alone, canâ€™t cook. He isnâ€™t even allowed to run his own bath. He has to be told to do almost everything.

I hate my life. My situation isnâ€™t awful, but I just fucking hate it. I donâ€™t really have any friends. I have a couple people from school, but theyâ€™ve moved on to different colleges and got their own friends, whereas I have no one. I feel really lonely. Thereâ€™s nothing I want to do. Iâ€™m so tired and my body feels fucking weak. Iâ€™ve wanted to die for a long time. I tried to hang myself maybe a year ago but my plan didnâ€™t work out and no one knows. I had therapy for a few months but just ended up lying to my therapist because I was frightened of what happens to people with suicidal thoughts.

I want to die.

But that leaves my brother.

It makes me cry almost every night.

If I died now heâ€™d be upset and confused, but would eventually learn to forget.

But then when my parents die heâ€™ll have no one.

Iâ€™m his only brother. We have no siblings. Iâ€™m supposed to take care of him when my parents die. 

I donâ€™t want him in an institution.

But I fucking hate this life. I want to be able to die. But how can I fucking do that to him?
