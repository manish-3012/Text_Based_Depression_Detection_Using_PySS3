I'm tiredI'm so tired, I just genuinely don't see anyway out of this. I've got medical expenses that I have to work out so I'm not exactly financially independent at the moment, and I have no other option than to live with my parents. I want to work but legal reasons are making that a bit complicated.
So I'm stuck at my parents home dealing with my mom. She is a temperamental woman, she doesn't have any sort of control over her emotions, and she constantly makes me the subject of her anger. I can barely live in this house without being blamed or attacked by her over incredibly small things. I can't take being made to feel like a failure anymore.
The real cherry on this situation is that not only does she have depression herself, but so does my sister. You think that'd make her more sympathetic to her other depressed child, but no. So when she has to call out of work cause her mental illness makes it hard for her to leave the house, the entire world has to stop to take care of her. When my mental illness makes it hard for me to get out of bed, I'm a lazy bastard that she feels like never accepted adulthood.
I just want this to be over. I just want her to leave me alone for once. And I don't see any other way for this to happen.
