I need help and everyone close to me has abandoned me.I almost did it last night. I drank probably 12 shots of whiskey and was about to take 9 sleeping pills. Somebody came and stopped me. But now everyone is telling me they don't have time for it anymore. Everyone close to me has left me alone. I've even asked for someone to just come and be close to me so I can go to sleep and make sure I wake up in the morning to try to get help. There's nobody here. I'm so scared. Help me.
