I don't want my life anymoreI am so incredibly sick of being me. I took the rest of my sleeping pills two weeks ago but obviously I'm still here. I hate every ounce of myself and I just want my life to be over. I don't totally want to die, I just don't want my own life. Even if I get better in the future, I'll still be me and have my life. I hate my life so much, I always kind of have.

I'm on medications, going to therapy, going to acupuncture, been in the hospital, been in a treatment program and about to start a new one, I've done everything I can. I have pretty good friends to support me, and I am just starting to open up to my family more. But none of this has really helped me. I keep doing all of this waiting for my fucked up mind to change, but I just continue to hate myself and my life.

When I took the pills the other night, I kind of knew they probably wouldn't kill me. But they would give me a little while to not be the same me. I was in the hospital for 1 1/2 days but it didn't change anything, just like all the other hospital visits. I told them I wasn't feeling very suicidal anymore, but how the fuck do they think that suicidal thoughts just go away like that? I still am so unhappy and want to kill myself a lot. But I think I'm too weak to completely commit suicide. Because there are amazing things that make me smile in this world. But those things aren't enough to really make me want my life.

Please help me, I just want to kill myself already.
