I feel alone I guessIâ€™ve only ever come close to suicide on few occasions, but itâ€™s on my mind a lot throughout the day. Knowing I could just slit my wrists and nothing will matter. Just nothing. No needs or desires needing to be satisfied. And I really donâ€™t know how the fuck imma cope with the rest of my life. Iâ€™m too lazy to do anything in life an for most of the shit that just happens to happen to me it feels like Iâ€™m fucking cursed. Like thatâ€™s pushing it maybe but I only ever seem to notice when things go wrong but Iâ€™m never able to appreciate what things are. Iâ€™ve been trying to lose weight for months and Iâ€™m growing overweight. Itâ€™s been worrying to think itâ€™ll get worse and Iâ€™ve not got much going for me already. Iâ€™m lucky enough to have been born into a moderately wealthy family. But everything just seems so fragile for the future. These have been some of the hardest months of my life recently. Iâ€™ve lost family, friends, the only meaningful relationship Iâ€™ve had in years and thereâ€™s no guarantee that anything will get better. And if it doesnâ€™t what the fuck am I gonna do about it? Thereâ€™s nobody to pick me up and when there is I donâ€™t think they understand. Itâ€™s frustrating feeling like nobody understands. Even I struggle to put it into words but everything from environment of the community Iâ€™ve been introduced to growing up to my own lazy shit head, everything just seems too much. And from the way things work at the moment, Iâ€™m not sure I wanna be a part of the society I live in.
