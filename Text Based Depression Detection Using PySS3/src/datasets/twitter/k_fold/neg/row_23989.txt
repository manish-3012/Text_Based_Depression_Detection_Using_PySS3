The day my father traumatized me 

My  mother had finished preparing the food in accordance with my father  arriving home from work. It was around 4:00pm with our public scool day  behind us, I was still in elementary level. On this occasion, we were  gathered around the dinner table.

My sister and I bickered and belitted eachother. It was learned behavior from our parents and others.

My fathers temper was usually hidden. We were never safe as to knowing what would provoke his rage.

I've seen scarier parenting from uncles but father was my own demon.

The verbal abuse between my sister and I escalated and I called her a "bitch".

Suddenly my dad jerked his seat away from the table, making a screeching sound against the floor.

I masked my fear by pretending to have an angry expression. As he maneuvered toward me I stared at my food.

This  specific moment terror wonder in my current age because I knew that my  father was going to hit me yet I have no concrete memory of a previous  assault.

My dad picks me up by the  arm, smacks me, and forces me into the restroom where he says "don't  come out until you're ready to be with us".

I collapsed onto the cold tile floor, crying, as he exited the room and shut the door.
