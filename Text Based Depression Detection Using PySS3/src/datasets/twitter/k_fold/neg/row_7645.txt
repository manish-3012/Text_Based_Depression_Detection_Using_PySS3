I feel so alone.I'm sitting in bed next to my pregnant wife, but I feel like I'm alone. I'm just sitting here in the dark crying silently. No one can know how much pain I'm in mentally. I don't think anyone thinks about me. I don't have a social life. I ghost my friends, ignore their texts, then I feel horrible about not having anyone. Suicidal thoughts are constant for me, I don't want them, I'm scared of dying, but I just feel so horrible. I just stopped smoking weed after being a daily smoker for a couple years. I think I made a mistake. My self loathing is coming back big time. Yesterday was the year anniversary of when one of my best friends took his life. I made a mistake and went looked up his old Facebook page and viewed pictures of us. I feel like he was the only one who truly understood how I felt and currently feel, he understood all too well. I really fear I'm on the same path. I keep getting invasive thoughts of just walking into the woods with my Glock and not coming back out. I really don't know how to get help, no one understands, I don't want to ruin the life I've built by telling people. So I guess I'll just anonymously post here. Thanks for reading I guess.
