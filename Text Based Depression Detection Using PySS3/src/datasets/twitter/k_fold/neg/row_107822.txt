Why does it seem that people react more when a woman commits suicide than when a man does?Is it because it happens less often? Is it because women have more reproductive â€œvalueâ€? I know two people who killed themselves in the span of 3 months, one 23 year old male and the other a 28 year old female and the female got way more sympathy and I got the sense that people perceived her suicide as more tragic than his.
