SucidalI cannot clean my appartment or do the dishes anymore. Feel tired all the time. 

I just need to vent, I am a virgin at 24. It does hurt a little I do no obsess about it but deep down it hurts. Feeling unloved hurts more, and I know it is myself that is the problem. Think I am autistic or some shit like that. I stress out about the smallest shit and I beleive that I am about to crash soon. 

I barely have friends but I cannot cope beinge lonely anymore. Its like a physical feeling

Suicide is only in my head some planning but I could not go through with, every attempt is basiclly crying a bunch and writing a final note but everytime I feel like I cannot explain why I am killing myself. 

I just needed to write this. I feel like a weak human being and I feel like I fucked up on my own. I did not get dealt a bad hand I am tall and not entirelt ugly, I dont feel ugly atleast. But my selfconfidence is non existant.

I procrastrinate a lot too which makes life harder. I also have concentration issues. And it feels like college lacks mening and I wont get a job anyway. 

What should I do? I need some practical tips. 

Thanks in advance, it means alot if you read this far, it really does.
