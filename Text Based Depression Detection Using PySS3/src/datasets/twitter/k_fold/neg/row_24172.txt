FebruaryI tried killing myself this past February, I told a lot of people and they either didnâ€™t really know how to react or didnâ€™t really care. Not much has changed since then. Iâ€™ve felt very few times where im happy to be alive and more often than not I experience things and just think â€œman this is what i stayed alive for, is it even worth itâ€. I keep trying to fix whats wrong and i keep failing. Ive failed for so many years idk how much longer i can keep going
