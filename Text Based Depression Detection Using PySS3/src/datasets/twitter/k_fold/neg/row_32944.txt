Hi Dr. ZYouâ€™ve been dead for 7 months now and I miss you. I miss being able to talk to you at our weekly appointments. My familyâ€™s ripping into me worst then ever and I donâ€™t know how to deal with them. My anxietyâ€™s perked up about things that are &gt;5 years old and I canâ€™t make the screaming in my head stop. Iâ€™m losing my anchors one by one and I donâ€™t know how to make any of it better. My depression flares up at least once a day now. My mind goes to dark places and I wonder why I canâ€™t just make the jump... I wish I was stronger but Iâ€™m not. I still canâ€™t find a replacement for you and Iâ€™m not sure I ever can. The system seems to be so much different then you were. I really donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore and I donâ€™t know who to ask for help
