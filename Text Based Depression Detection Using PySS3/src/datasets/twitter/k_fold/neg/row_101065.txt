Everything feels heavy yet numb at the same timeI was never really able to express emotions well, and probably get a little off track so my apologies if this is a little confusing

Lately everything feels heavy. I feel alone, even if i'm surrounded by others; I find no joy in things that used to bring me happiness. I force myself out of bed when I don't sleep late knowing I have nothing else to do except for sleep, stare at my computer, work. I don't feel I really have any friends, I have one person in my life who checks up on me and I feel like a burden the past few days for being at a low.

I've been able to deal with my emotions until now, I know its just a repeat of whats happened in the past but still feels almost unbearable to deal with. Whats the point in living if you just feel like this constantly? I know I can't kill myself, but I wish I could.

Writing it out here still doesn't feel like enough. Theres so much to be said but I can't even think of anything to type at the same time. 

I'm numb
