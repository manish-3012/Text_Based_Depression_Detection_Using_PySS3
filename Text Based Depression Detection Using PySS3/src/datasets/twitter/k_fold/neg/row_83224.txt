I just don't care anymore.I don't feel like making a throwaway.

I just don't care anymore. I used to be happy. I'd hang out with my friends and I'd play sports and I could laugh and dance and fall in love with straight guys who would never return it.

But now I just can't do it anymore.

My friends always ask me what's wrong, and I always tell them the same thing - I'm ugly, I'm untalented, I'm disgusting, I'm a faggot, I'm stupid and I'm a miserable, miserable failure. I'm 16 and I want to die.

I know I'll fail out of college, I don't plan on living past 25 or so. As soon as I'm of legal age I'm just going to drink until everything goes away and it's just me and the bottle.

What's the point of living in a world where you know you'll just be miserable for the rest of your life?
