Somebody that I used to be.I remember how people described me as when I was younger... I'm only 20, but when I listen to how people remember me when I was 10, a brave boy who wasn't afraid to sepak his mind, cheery and quippy... I've become such a carcass of my past seft.

I'm a fat depressed fuck that isn't good at anything. Not even the games that I've spent literal thousands or hours on, I'm an absolute disgrace, and I don't know how this happened.
Why? Why do I have to be this way? Why can't I look at anything I do and be like "hey, that's pretty good". Instead, every time I remember something, even something good, I wince because "oh god what it if I did something EXTREMELY STUPID?!", and it feels like I've been stabbed in the brain. It physically hurts to remember things...
I will not go anywhere in life, despite being privileged enough to have a roof, good food, and a family that loves me, even though they definitely don't understand whats going on.
Which to be honest makes me hate myself even more. I'm so much worse, than people that have it much tougher in life. Fucking godspeed to them, I'll just be over here, making the paperwork so I finally can own a pistol to shoot myself with.
