Just feeling scared about everything.I know I need to get better but at this point trying so many different things, I legitimately do not know how. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s even really worth it. I donâ€™t know if I want to. Iâ€™m ready to give up. I feel like my new medication has impacted my mood to the point Iâ€™m just on edge at any time and Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t wanna keep doing this.
