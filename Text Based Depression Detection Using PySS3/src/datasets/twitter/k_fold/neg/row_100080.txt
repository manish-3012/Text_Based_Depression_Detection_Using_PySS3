Why do people want to live in the first place?I just can not understand this. When we die our concissnes probably just switches of and we stop "knowing" that we exist. Right? So even if my live would magically become perfect death is still strictly better. You do not "miss out" on anything cause you Do not know it. 
Does what i am saying make any sense to you?
