Mm














Im like a lost boy 
Behind me are cold hands waiting to creep into my brain, im like a disastrophe, an aesthetic empty canvas under a blanket 
And my words won't fit what I'm feeling
My eyes could tell you stories 
But my heart can shut you out 
Because I lost everything 
And I have nothing 
And I wish I could rise like the day 
But I know tommorow will be in vain. And I sometimes hear noises, noises that turns into dark whispers, a far away voice. And I would never know what they we're saying but I understand them though.
And i would get through this night like the night before, alone. And it's always night, there weren't sunny days even on seven am's, on pancakes and on eggs because mom is away and dad had gone mad and sister has her own life and older brother is a child again. And my bestfriend is smiling like a doll, we get along sometimes because she wants me to slit my wrist yet I'm still scared so most of the time she would also get mad at me. And I don't know where to go, because mom is worried and sleepless, dad is uncontented and lonely, sis is far when she's in the other side of the door, brother is asleep until this lifetime ends, and I'm sorry for not wanting to belong in any of this. I'm sorry if im emotionless sometimes, if I look like a tower of pride it's one of those times when I just don't know what emotion to select and expression to choose. I would unconciously shut down and say stupid things and maybe nothing at all, Because I'm just an idea, a made up alternative imagination, molded by the people around me, unaware of what she should feel. And until now, i still don't know what to feel.
