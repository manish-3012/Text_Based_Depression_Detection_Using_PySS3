drugs donâ€™t help.i have a plan but i canâ€™t act it out. i live in buttfuck nowhere out in the country and donâ€™t have a car to get into the city to actually get my shit. i have stoner friends that have given me weed and offered tabs and shit but i canâ€™t OD and croak on that. i get a high of course but it doesnâ€™t last long. my parents who i still live with will kick my ass if the figure this out. 
iâ€™m planning something with gravol or Benadryl or both honestly whatever I can get- given this iâ€™m emetephobic and the idea of throwing what iâ€™m taking back up is enough to get me cornered. hence my extensive research of side effects and case studies and actually using an antiemetic drug. 
but honestly iâ€™m tired of the world repeat key telling me iâ€™m too much of a pussy to do anything to end it so nobodyâ€™s that concerned. my ex told me that when we were together so; hell if someone who loved or said he loved me can think that god knows what else the world thinks.
