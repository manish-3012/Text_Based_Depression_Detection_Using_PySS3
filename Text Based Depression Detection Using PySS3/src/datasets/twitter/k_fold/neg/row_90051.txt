I just can'tI don't know why I am bothering to write all this.  Do I think it will help?  No not really.  I guess it makes me feel like I made a final effort.

I have been depressed for years.  I have been on every drug at every dosage.  I have been to therapists.  I have tried Yoga.  I have depression, lupus, and thyroiditis (or something like that - they have not completed diagnosing).  I have worked hard to get through school and get a "real" job.  But I am so freaking depressed that I can't get out of bed to come to work.  I have been 'counseled' at work and am in danger of losing my job.  No one seems to understand the absolute struggle it is to get out of bed.  Someone actually told me I "use this as a crutch" to be lazy.  There is nothing left to try - I am tired of feeling like this all the time and having people act like I am just making shit up.  My favorite is "You have so much going for you - why would you be depressed?"  
I just moved 8 hours away from all my family.  I have no support.  I just can't do this.  

EDIT:  I look forward to actually doing it so everyone can say "Oh gosh, I guess she really was sick!"
