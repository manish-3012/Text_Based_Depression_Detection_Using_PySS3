So done with everything but cant go through with itI've been struggling a lot with extreme generalized anxiety for the last few months (playing medication roulette with my psychiatrist and therapist currently), I'm not sleeping more than a handful of hours per night if that, and have been sh-ing on the daily. I have a lot of suicidal ideation but recently came to the realization after researching that all of the suicide methods I have access to have a low chance of success and a high risk of brain damage. And I feel like if it were to fail I need my brain to be functioning to keep my job and stay in school, which is pretty much the only thing stopping me from attempting to end it. I've never felt this trapped before in my life, and I'm really losing hope that it's possible for things to get better :/
