Woke up at 2am and ready to die soonI constantly try to find reasons to stay alive. To keep going. But all life has shown me is to just end it because life just sucks. Woke up randomly and Iâ€™m just unbelievably sad. The will to die is overcoming my will to live. I never wrote a suicide note but I just started to. I realize I only have one friend who actual cares about me and not that superficial shit. My mom thinks Iâ€™m joking that I want to die and it may be my fault for being so good at hiding shit. Iâ€™ve been off my antidepressants which numbed my pain all because of how fucked health insurance is. I have a bottle of xanax my mom gave me because she knows I struggle with anxiety and every day I think constantly just to take it all with alcohol. Hoping that shit kills me. Iâ€™m trying to keep going but I cannot see any reason why I should.
