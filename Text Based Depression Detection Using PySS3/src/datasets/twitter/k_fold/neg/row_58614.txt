It feels so good to hyperventilate,It feels great to hyperventilate, like im buzzing in euphoria. My teeth start to get that buzzy feeling, than my hands tingle, than everything feels awesome. I started out with my therapist taking me off of zoloft(sertraline) because it was "making me more suicidal" when in reality its only the little fact that my life is coming to an end and there is nothing i can do about it. But anyway, its been 4 days since ive taken any medication. It started out with today being great, than it spiraling down to now, at 4 AM CDT, about to take my own life, slitting the shit outta my arm, and than proceeding to just sit, listen to music, and slowly start to feel a slight euphoric feeling, and i noticed i got quite suicidal, but than i just got this crazy mental collapse and i just started hyperventilating and crying more, but i honestly feel great right now. Its been a month since i cried last because of the sertraline, but now im actually crying and feeling good. So what if im suicidal and closer to ending it than ive ever been, it feels fucking amazing.
