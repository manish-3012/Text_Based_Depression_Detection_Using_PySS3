this sub is surrealI was scrolling through and this sub is fucked up. A bunch of posts talking about shit that has happened or how people are crying with no hope. and these posts are mere minutes apart without any comments on them. It's like we are all sitting in the same room dealing with horrible fucked up shit and no one is talking to eachother. It's really surreal.
