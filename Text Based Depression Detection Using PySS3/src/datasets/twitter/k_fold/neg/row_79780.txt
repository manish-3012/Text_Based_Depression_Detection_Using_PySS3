I made a huge mistakeI fucked up. I should have killed my self back then. Instead I stayed alive because I was in love with someone who doesn't love me or even like me back, but I knew dying would hurt them. Hurting my parents and my family isn't a consideration to me, but hurting him is. 

I don't know what to do now, 6 months on. He is dating someone else, I want to die everyday, I've been hospitalised 4 times in the past 4 months. Twice within the last fortnight. 
I can't cope. I can't exist anymore. 
He knows that I stayed alive for him and it's not fair because if I die he will blame himself, but if I stay alive now, it's only so he doesn't blame his self. It's equally fucked up. 

I just want to be dead. The pain is too much all the time and and i can't do it. I'm alone and have no friends and I just can't see a reason to be alive, even if my brain was normal.

I'm sorry.
