I feel like Iâ€™m dyingI feel horrible. Iâ€™m back on Prozac, surviving off 800cals a day, behind in school and I meant to have an interview with a media outlet tomorrow (thatâ€™s meant to make me happy!).

I feel like my insides are rotting. I feel like shit I just wanna die and never come back. I want this feeling to end, its the worst Iâ€™ve ever felt. I want help but I canâ€™t ask.

Sorry for the ramble but I am suffering itâ€™s horrible.
