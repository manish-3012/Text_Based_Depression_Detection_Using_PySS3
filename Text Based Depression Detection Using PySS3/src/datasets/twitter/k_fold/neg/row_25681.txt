2.5 weeks in the hospital, not getting betterI was going to shoot myself because of long standing shame and self hatred, inability to form relationships and not wanting to work and exist and live life. I love my family and told them. Guns gone, in a hospital. I am on an antidepressant, Effexor 150mg, it just made me horribly sick and now does nothing. It wont change how bad I am or how much I hate myself. I lost my job, no friends, I am too ashamed to want to see family or talk to anyone again. 

Can I give up now? I am such a piece of shit and want to hurt myself. How can this ever get better, ive tried everything. Either im honest and locked up forever. Or pretend to be better and get out. And honestly, i dont believe in a "chemical imbalance", i believe these drugs will make me far worse
