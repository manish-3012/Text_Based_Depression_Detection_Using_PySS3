I am totally helpless and resigned.I want to keep this short. I have a lot of things going for me in life, but I am not the most mentally healthy guy around and need medication to rise up and take responsibility for myself. I recently got my bachelor's in computer science, which should be the start of a promising career and high salary, but there's a catch: I had to move back in with my folks while I'm figuring things out, and they are both against my pills. I have no job, no money, and no way to get back on my medication and get my head straight enough to get any job, let alone one as mentally taxing as a developer position. I have been off my drugs for about 3 months, and i just keep feeling worse and worse. My narcissist parents do not listen to me, and treat me like an addict who is trying to manipulate them whenever I try to open up. I have begun isolating myself intensely, as they both browbeat me whenever I am around them, call me a loser, tell me to get a job, etc. They're both smart people... I don't understand how they don't see how negatively this is affecting my life. I've tried reasoning with them enough. All of this after I already attempted suicide last year. My father would rather talk to me about homeless shelters than consider my side of the argument. They just won't see that they're wrong until I'm dead, and at this rate, I'll get the balls to follow through soon.

No fuck ups this time.
