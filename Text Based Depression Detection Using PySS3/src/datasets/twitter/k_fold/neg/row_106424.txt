What will you REALLY need to die from an overdose?I know it's unlikely, and the most common outcome is writhing in pain and vomiting...but, I have several roommates. A lot of which are on pain meds or medications for various mental illnesses. Let's say I mixed EVERYTHING they had, would it be enough to die? Two bottles of adderall, two bottles of antidepressants, a few bottles of various painkillers and mood stabilizers.  Would taking those all and wandering out in the moods for a few hours kill me?
