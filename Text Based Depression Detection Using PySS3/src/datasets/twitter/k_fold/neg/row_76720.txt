The only thing keeping me aliveFor now. Letters. So many letters. I canâ€™t die knowing I didnâ€™t give an explanation. One to each of my (5) friends, one to each of my parents, one to my sister, one to the teachers that made school as bearable as it could be until it wasnâ€™t, one to each of the people I wanted to get to know better but never took the chance. The only thing keeping me alive. Once I finish I can die in peace.
