I lost my job because of my own stupidityI started working in a hotel. It was an easy enough job. One of the guests seduced me. I'm just that depraved of female attention that I swallowed the hook right up. Needless to say she broke my heart. I don't know what I was expecting. I told my family I am having a great time with her. But I am alone sitting in the train crying. I can't face going back into the hotel. I can't the humiliation. I set myself up for failure because of my own naivete. I think this is what is going to drive me to kill myself. I will see you in the next life. If I live I'll reply within 24h
