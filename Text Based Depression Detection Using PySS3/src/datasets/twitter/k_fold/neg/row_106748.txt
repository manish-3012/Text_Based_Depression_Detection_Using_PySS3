Guess I'm tiredHi.

32, male, straight, single.

I suppose, I have no reasons to wish to be dead - I am healthy,  I have a reasonably well paid job which doesnâ€™t require too much effort, no problems with alcohol or drugs, nobody molested me as a child, etc.

Itâ€™s just that it doesnâ€™t make any sense. My job? I do some shit and some fat cats on top get even fatter. Also, I am not especially good at that. My family? I donâ€™t have it, and frankly donâ€™t have much desire to make one. Last time I had a girlfriend was in 2005, if I am not mistaken. Friends? Nope. Had two, one is dead, the other is 3000 km away. Hobbys? Donâ€™t have them either. I used to like to read, but now I donâ€™t read anymore. Except when taking a shit. If I had a serious problem, I could have tried to live to solve it - just to see what life  would be like without it, but I have no serious problems.  Iâ€™m kinda bland person, I guess, and my life is also bland, boring and mildly irritating.

Bought 12g of propranolol a couple of weeks ago. Think that will suffice.
