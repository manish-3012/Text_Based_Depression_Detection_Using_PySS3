Should I break up with my fiancÃ©e before killing myself?The thought of his grief used to be enough to where I would never follow through. I cannot handle my own grief anymore. Should I break it off first so that he doesn't have to find me or lose his fiancÃ©e? I'm already no longer the person he loved. Only filled with anger and resentment and causing him immense stress. I'm ruining his life and happiness already.
