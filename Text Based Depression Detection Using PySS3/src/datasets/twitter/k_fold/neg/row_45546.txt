help.I feel really weak for doing this but I need someone's help. I've been very depressed for 5-6 years or so. I've never seen a doctor, I saw what happened to my older sister when she went to the hospital and fuck that.
But tonight it's really bad, I'm alone in my house (parents are in europe), and it's too late for anyone to be awake. I just want to end it. I don't care about anything anymore. It's not even a loneliness thing, 2 out of the past three nights, I've gotten laid. I just don't enjoy anything anymore. I'm really ready to do it. I don't know why I'm asking for help, if anyone will be able to say anything *not* cliche to help. But that's my story, I've got a rope tied up in the basement.
