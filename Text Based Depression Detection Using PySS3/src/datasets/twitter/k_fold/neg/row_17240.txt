My anxiety peaked and I've just shutdown.It's been a rollercoaster at work, with family, my fight with depression etc, then today happened. I got a call that my grandma had fallen, yesterday around dinner time, she was found at noon today still on the floor awake but unaware. While I'm on this phone call, kid A(14) says kid B(16) spilt gas in the garage and it was making the whole house stink. B denied it, fight ensued. Call wife, wife says I can't go stay with grandma until aunt get here because she has an appointment on Friday and needs the car. What appointment I ask? To get her haircut. Your. Hair. Is. More. Important. Than. Grandma. Got It! 

Then snap. Off went the emotions. I just don't feel anything now.

I didn't even tell her what the boys had done. Which was destroy the roof of a $20,000 pool enclosure with the gas spill. I don't think it will matter, no one will bother to build it without me here.
