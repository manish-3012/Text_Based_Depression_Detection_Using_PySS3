The death of a failure.I'm an absolute fucking failure, and I haven't even left secondary school. Well, sixth form specifically. But I just want to fucking die. Everyone loves to laugh at me, for every tiny thing I've ever said, every time I stutter and stumble over my words. They laugh, because my ex came out as a lesbian, mere days after she left me, mere days after my Nana was cremated. My best friends, who've stood by me for 5 years have just gotten up, and left me behind whilst they have the time of their lives at tresham. I'm forever being compared to everyone, the same everyone that confuses me with my perverted cuntsack of a brother. The same brother who goes from trying to kill me, to supposedly loving me in seconds. My parents have just given up on the failure I am. Hell, even the school fucking counselors have given up on me. I just want it to end and there's nothing else I want more than to just tie my school tie, the same one that everyone signed on the last day of year 11, so tight that it strangles me. Wouldn't that make things so much fucking better? No one would have to bother laughing at the biggest fucking failure this shit stain of a town has ever seen, or tolerating me stuttering and stumbling. Hell, even the school itself hates me: all the teachers know that everyone hates me, yet it took one guy nearly breaking open my cast whilst he beat the shit out of me, under a security camera, for them to even contemplate doing anything about it.
