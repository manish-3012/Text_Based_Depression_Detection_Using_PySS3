HeyHey. Im not really sure what to do or say here. I messaged someone on my skype to call me later and i wanna talk to someone else on there but theyve just had surgery and i dont want to be a burden. Maybe my situation isnt as bad as others. i dont self harm or anything. Quite frankly im terrified of taking my life cause i fear i will be horribly punished in whatever comes next. im also terrified of hurting the people that love me. Im just having constant bad thoughts like this everyday know for a while. i dont know who to talk to i dont really know what to do. i dont really want to kill myself i mean i do  and i dont i just dont really have anyone to talk to. i dont really want to talk to strangers and i feel guilt bout nagging my friend with my shit. its all just a bit overbearing atm.
