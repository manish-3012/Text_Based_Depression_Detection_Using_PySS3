Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake I have madeAll my friends are fake, everyone I've ever cared about has always become tired of me. I care too much but on the outside it seems like I don't care at all because I put up a defensive front. I was bullied my entire childhood and the thought of having to finish college then go to work for the rest of my life just doesn't appeal to me. I sleep on the tile floor in my room because I don't think I deserve a bed, I've actually done that my entire life. I wish I could just disappear and have no one miss me or ever think about me, I wish I was never born because I am just a stressor for everyone around me. All the girls I have ever been with have made me feel special for a few weeks but then they just become more and more distant, I don't know how to save relationships and I don't know if I ever will. I try to be the nicest person I can and I try to help with everything but I think girls are put-off by my vulnerability. I'm overweight and I've recently been throwing up my food because I feel ashamed to have ate it. I just want to cry but I can't, the only time I can cry is when I'm tripping on acid. It's weird because I love crying it completes me, it envelopes me into exactly how I feel and exactly how I will always feel. Because even when people say they care about me I know deep in my heart that they don't really give two shits about me. They just feel sorry for me so they feign interest in the things I do.
