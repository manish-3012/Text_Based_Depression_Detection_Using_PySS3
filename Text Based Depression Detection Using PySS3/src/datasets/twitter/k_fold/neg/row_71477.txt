Is there no end to this?I've been battling depression and then suicide for over 3 years now. it all started by losing my first crush in a way that got an entire small town afraid of me. I used to play Maplestory but that only made things worse over time. I quit that now but all the shit about SOPA, PIPA, and now ACTA have gotten me so worried and paranoid about having everything i love be gone cuz of these satanic wastes of paper bills that i wanna kill myself to not have to go through that much loss.

Why I'm still alive today I'm not sure.
