Im considering suicideLate at night there is a train that comes by my apartment every now and then. My plan (that im not sure if im going to go through with yet) is too put my head on the tracks and get decapitated. My death would be quick but brutal. I'm willing to go through with it, if things persist like this. I dont care anymore. next post might be a goodbye post
