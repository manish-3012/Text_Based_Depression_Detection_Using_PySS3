All i needed was to have ONE, fucking ONE skill.So i could focus on it and have a normal life, have a job/career and not be this fucking waste of oxygen on planet Earth. Seriously, i simply can't fucking see my existence as something else than a fucking cruel and bad joke of the universe. You have all these people in the world and every single day i see on Reddit people with skills, like, woodworking, painting, dancing, being good with numbers, being good with people, drawing, sports. All i wanted and i needed actually, was to have ONE FUCKING SKILL IN THIS FUCKING LIFE, and i have NOTHING. I'm not even saying talent (which i think is a higher form of skill), just ONE, one fucking skill at something so i could function in this fucking life. And before you say something, i tried things to "find" what i could be good at or discover a skill in me, but i've found NONE, nothing that i could do or invest. 

This is pretty much the source of my depression, anxiety, my negative view of life, the lack of a skill and consequently the lack of purpose in life. I know it's wrong to judge others but it really annoys me when i see 14-15yo saying they want to die because they got rejected by someone or they think life is hard because of school, like, i'm 29 (almost 30) and i'm a fucking failure in all aspects, i have ZERO chances of changing my life because the lack of skills, the lack of good education and the bazilion mental and physical issues i have.
