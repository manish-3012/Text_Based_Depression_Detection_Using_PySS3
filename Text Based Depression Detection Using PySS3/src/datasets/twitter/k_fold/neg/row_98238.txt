I think Iâ€™m readyOut of every points in my life, I think this is the time when Iâ€™m ready to end my life.

I considered Helium suicide, bought a tank since a month ago, and prepared the items (tubing and bag) already. 

But I didnâ€™t even open the packaging until just now. Things havent been okay. Everythingâ€™s wrong. Iâ€™m in a void of sadness.

I think Iâ€™m ready to go.
