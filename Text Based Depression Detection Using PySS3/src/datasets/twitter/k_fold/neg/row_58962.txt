I feel so useless (migraine)I just feel so useless. I'm usually in a better mood, but I've had so many migraines that I just can't keep up. 

I've been jobless for a year, I'm more or less blacklisted from jobs although I'm heck of a worker noone wants a person who's sickness can take 1-3days, weekly. My boyfriend pays for everything (I'm on the dole, so I do pay for my part of the rent and small things) He says he doesn't mind, that he can sympathize and such, but I just feel like such a fucking burden. I'm going over logics over suicide, I don't believe I'd do it, but the thought scares me, my thoughts scare me. Why can't I just be normal?
