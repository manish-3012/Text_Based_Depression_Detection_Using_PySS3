Life is too painful  

 I want to kill myself. Life has become too painful to bear.

I am a failure. I am 33 years old with nothing of any value. I have no boyfriend. I have no job. I have no savings. I live with my parents. I have no close friends.

There was a time where I was more optimistic. I was heading for a bright career as a university lecturer, I had a long term partner and I had ambition.

However, two years ago I became depressed â€“ I ended my 12 year relationship with my partner and I quit my job, as my mental health was impacting upon my ability to teach. Since then, I have been unable to hold down a job without regressing back to depression. My parents are at their wits end with my lack of motivation and they have no understanding of how depression works. 

I just exist by eating, sleeping, job hunting (jobs that I am not qualified or experienced enough for) and watching Youtube. I do not have the money for a total career change â€“ I cannot get funding for a 2nd degree, so I feel helpless and lost, as every possible way out has an obstacle.

I want to die but I am not brave enough to attempt suicide again, as I failed last time and surviving only made my life worse. Does anybody else feel like this?
