I lost my big brother to suicideI lost my brother in December. He was 25 and I am 24. We had finally had a good relationship as adults as we were torn apart as kids. He is and will always be my best friend. I feel bad because I was the only one who knew he was struggling but we always talked about both of our suicidal thoughts in such a calm and joking way. He would do anything for anyone. He was there for me no matter what. I always seemed to have something going on and I didn't get the chance to be there for him as he was for me. I know that no matter what I couldn't have saved him. I am still going through all the emotions but lately I have felt lost. How do you cope with a situation like this? What are you supposed to do with such a big hole in your life? I don't feel him in spirit or have any signs that tell me there is something after you leave this world. I wish I had been a better sister and that we had more time to be closer. Life just seems so pointless now. It is so painful and I wish I could be wherever he is but I know I have to wait. I hope things become clearer and I can find a reason for being here. I miss him.
