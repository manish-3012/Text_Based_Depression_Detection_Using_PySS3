Please help me to keep going..I try to do everything right and do the right things, but because of every choice I make, something goes wrong and the choice that I choose after that, something else goes wrong, maybe the people around me are better off without me, sorry to the people around me who care about you if you ever have to read this, but that means that at that moment I am very close to the moment that I want to put an end to all this as I am the moment I am doing this write, or it means that it is already too late and that someone looks in my phone at what I have written. And the last option is that I have printed this text and with the money I have disappeared to try to restart my life. I think I make the right choice by making someone do something good and then that choice goes the wrong way and everything goes too far, sorry to the people I hurt and hurt. I don't see it all that way anymore and that is simply because of everything that happens in my fking life and that I have taken care of myself. I thought it was getting better and better but at the moment I think of fuck, no it is not at all, at this moment I am thinking to jump for a train or to take 10 pills of drugs on it to end that way. I care about so many people around me, one more than the other and I often just feel that it is only from my side, I just want to do the right things and try to enjoy my life but sometimes I just can't really do that, I always try to do my best for the people around me but it seems that it always refers to me and that it is always negative .. I hope in the deepest part of my heart that nobody this letter ever comes to read, and if anyone comes to read that it is only because I want to make clear to them how I feel but what I am not trying to radiate. So if you are reading this, I hope I have given you my phone so that you can read it and not in one of the above ways. Well, I'm sorry but goodbye.

TL:DR: Really mentally messed up at the moment

I wanted to post it here cuz I feel like i cant talk to anyone about this at the moment, im seeing a therapist for half a year now, and i really started to heal, but tonight I feel like I want to give it all up for the first time in 2 months.. sorry for my english and formatting but I translated all of that with google translate since i wrote it in my own language. I will see my therapist again on thursday
