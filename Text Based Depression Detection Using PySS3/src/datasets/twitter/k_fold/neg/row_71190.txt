Hopeless.i am completely hopeless. i donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. i canâ€™t even use my best coping mechanism because my parents locked everything away. iâ€™ve got the tablets. iâ€™ve got the note. so why donâ€™t i fuckin do it. because iâ€™m scared? no. iâ€™m not scared. not anymore. iâ€™m gonna take them. iâ€™m going to leave this place for good.
