My life has been worthlessmy life has just been series of unhappy moments, 20 years of emptiness, a little happiness here and there, but it was only a little relief, im sure my parents love me, but they are like strangers to me, I have a few friends but they mean nothing to me, I'm not sure if I'm a depressed weakling or a ungrateful, anti social bastard, anyhow I feel alone and I dont think I'll ever be happy, suicide seems inevitable, the future seems scary, why keep on dragging myself everywhere forever, I'm shit at life, I wanna end it now
