I've decided that my death date will be September 6. Any 'bucket list' advice?Hey all,
Im not gonna bore you with all my past. Just know Ive wanted to do this for years now, even when km happy. Yes ive been to therapy, took meds. Some people are just terminal, and thats ok! I am one of those people unfortunately. My depression is terminal. I've decided instead of almost killing myself and failing all the time, im simply going to set my death date as September 6th. I have the method known, place time etc. Im not here for anyone to dissuade me, ive had a good life. Does anyone have bucket list ideas? So far the list is:
1. Own a Panasonic Q Gamecube (something ive always wanted, ik im a nerd lol)
2. Get laid by both sexes (ive had gfs in the past, but never gotten that far)
3. Attend a Bill Burr Show
4. See one of my favorite artists live - Tyler The Creator, Kanye, J Cole, and Kendrick are at the top of the list
5. Lose all this damn weight! I want abs for the final few months of my life. Im only 15ish ibs overweight so it wouldnt be too hard to get em by my death date.
6. Visit my hometown one last time
7. Attend a few parties with my friends
8. Try DMT
9. Achieve a prostate orgasm
