I took alot of sleeping pills, I just want to die.The night before yesterday I couldn't get any sleep listening to my abusive parents argue all night. Honestly, I just wanted it to fucking stop for once, I knew what was next, I knew that I was next. I decided to take 5 sleeping pills just so I could sleep, to numb the pain, I woke up a total of 2 times yesterday and whenever I did my ears rang like hell and I couldn't see shit. I honestly felt the most dizzy I have ever felt in my life and my head was doing that blackout thing when your low on iron. Anyways, I got to sleep, sleep is all that matters, sleep is an escape. I just now took another 5 and I plan to do this until they run out. Currently my parents think I'm sick, but who the fuck cares. I just want to die, I know how hard it is to overdose on sleep meds but I swear to you, when I get my next prescription I'm downing the whole thing.
