I'm going to spend one last night with my wonderful mom and then I'm done.I can't take the fear and sadness anymore. I'm going to write a letter to my mom that will hopefully help her cope. Let her know that there was nothing she could do and this was not her fault in any way. I love her very much. 

I've tried the medicine, I've tried talking. Nothing eases this never ending fear.

I feel calm now. I crave freedom from all of this.
