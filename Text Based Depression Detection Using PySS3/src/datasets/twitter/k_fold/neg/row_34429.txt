Should I tell someoneIâ€™ve been dealing with some mental illnesses or at least symptoms that I saw on internet 
 (self diagnosed) 
And Iâ€™m definitely sure that Iâ€™m depressed and suicidal itâ€™s now 4 years that Iâ€™m living like that and no one knows 
Idk if I should tell it to someone cause I clearly have no friend and Iâ€™m afraid of the judgement of my parents if I come to confess theyâ€™ll say that Iâ€™m to young to feel bad and all 
Btw if someone has any non-prescribed medicine against depression or anxiety please tell me
