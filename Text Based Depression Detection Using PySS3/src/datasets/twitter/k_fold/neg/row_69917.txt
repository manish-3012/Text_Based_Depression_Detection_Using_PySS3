Goodbye to the community, and not those in my life.I wish everyone here the best of luck in the journeys they are going through. Although mine is not done yet, I can feel that my battle with depression may finally be coming to an end. 

Over the past few months Iâ€™ve been taking different kinds of medications, the first few having not worked, but now Iâ€™m on one that seems to be genuinely working. 

Iâ€™ve also been accepting a lot about myself, recently coming out as bisexual and getting a lot of positive feedback from my family and friends. 

For the first time in a long time, I feel happy. Like maybe thing will eventually work out. So I just wanted to say goodbye to this community, and all those who reply kindly to the posts of people going through hard times. 

I may have to come back again, life had a way of messing with you. But until then, Iâ€™m going to enjoy this happiness that Iâ€™m finally feeling. Goodbye and thanks for all the support.
