Why be alive for nothingI'm tired of having to live for everyone else because they would be crushed if I killed my self. Why do I have to suffer when no one else pays any mind to me unless I was to kill my self? It's insane youre expected to think of life as some gift when it's the exact opposite. Life isn't a gift it's misery.

I want no part in the struggle to make a decent life. I don't want to hold onto hope that it might get better one day because what if it doesn't? Then it was all for nothing. It hasn't gotten better now and it probably won't ever. No matter the effort I put into it. 

I want to die so bad I just don't want to hurt those around me. My family and my best friend, I don't know how they'd get along if I did do it. I still just feel so alone and incomplete. I have no motivation anymore. Not right now.
