I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s so bad about suicideI think about killing myself every single day. I never tell anybody, in fact I actively hide it, But there is one thing I donâ€™t get. why is there such stigma for suicide? This is how I see it: suicide is an end to anything bad permanently. Nothing bad, or good, will ever happen afterwards to you. Anything you previously cared about will be impossible to think about because you are gone. I donâ€™t see very much of a downside to this, the only thing stopping me from committing is not having a painless way to go out. What am I missing here? I donâ€™t understand why itâ€™s such s bad thing.
