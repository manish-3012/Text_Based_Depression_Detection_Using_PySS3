Fuck it Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m tired of reaching out, Iâ€™m tired of calling crisis lines 5 times a day just to talk to someone and hear the same shit every time. 
Iâ€™m tired of disappointing people and myself. 
Iâ€™m tired of my anxiety. 
Iâ€™m tired of my depression. 
Iâ€™m tired of seeing my ex sleep around with a bunch of new guys in the house that we moved in together while Iâ€™m stuck at home with my parents. Iâ€™m tired of of my nicotine addiction. 
Iâ€™m tired of smoking weed with my friends just to get more anxiety. 
Iâ€™m tired of girls laughing at me. 
Iâ€™m tired of everyone laughing at me. 
Iâ€™m tired of working 2 pathetic jobs. 
Iâ€™m tired of wearing a stupid fucking mask everywhere I go 
Iâ€™m tired of people telling me everything is going to be fine. 

Itâ€™s not, nothing is fine and nothing will ever be fine. I need a way out, I want someone to just come in my house while Iâ€™m sleeping to shoot me in the face. I want to run my car off of a cliff. I want everything to be over with. Iâ€™m done
