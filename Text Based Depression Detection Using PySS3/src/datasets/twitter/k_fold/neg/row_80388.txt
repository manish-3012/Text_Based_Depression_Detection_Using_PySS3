Will ~950mg of Zoloft kill me?I'm fourteen, a trans girl, I weight around 130lbs and I'm 5'3" (I think. I haven't checked in a while). I've overdosed before, I've been in the hospital and in psychiatric care, I've been to therapy, counselling, shrinks, etc. and none of them have helped me all that much. My family is abusive and while I've told multiple people (my teachers, school councilors, therapist, etc) none of then have helped me with it at all. I'm schizophrenic and I've told people about my delusions and hallucinations and again, they haven't helped. I can't contact suicide hotlines because my parents monitor my phone bills and I'll get into serious trouble if they find out.

I'm just wondering if this dose will kill me. If I take any more than 950mg, my aunt will notice the pills missing and I'll get in trouble, so if it won't, I won't be able to take more anyways.

Forgive me if this post violates any rules, I did read them but English is my third language and my reading comprehension is worse than that of a blind deep sea invertebrate's, so my apologies if it does.
