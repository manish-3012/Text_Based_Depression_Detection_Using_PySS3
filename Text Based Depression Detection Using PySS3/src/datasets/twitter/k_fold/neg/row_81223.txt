Been a while since I posted here.everything had felt like I could cope since my last post.

then my gran died yesterday, and I was told I was an idiot for feeling the way I did about unrelated things, and then I thought my dad had finally done something nice for me and dug a vinyl out of his basement that I've been talking about for the past two years. turns out it was for my sister that had suddenly shown an interest.

today is not feeling great for me. I feel fucking stupid for feeling this again, exactly as I did in my last post. like it's not justified that I feel this way. i thought i could cope by now, and I thought I'd have worked through it by now. I'm tired of feeling stupid, and second best. I don't feel like I matter to anyone. there would be no difference if I was dead
