4 hoursItâ€™s been four hours since I thought that all this shit would finally be over, I just couldnâ€™t bring myself to it, even though I want it so bad. I saw a post on here a bit ago saying something like â€œone moreâ€ or â€œmy lastâ€ and I was thinking the same thing, like the last person I talked to, just some shitty friend I was having a joke with, like is that my last conversation? Do I want that to be my last conversation? Now Iâ€™m just confused on what to do, sitting here watching Snapchat memories from the good times I donâ€™t remember because my memory has been shit since my last suicide attempt a month ago. And I know that Iâ€™ll never have any more of them good times again because these mental illnesses have ruined everything good I had, and I donâ€™t see the point in trying and putting in effort to fix my life when the easy way is just killing myself, and then itâ€™ll be all over, no more pain, that all I want, just peace.
