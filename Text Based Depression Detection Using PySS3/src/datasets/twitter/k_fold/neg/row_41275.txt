up and down is worse than steadyI was chronically suicidal well into my adult years. Then I got some amazing therapy and spent the next several years chronically happy -- like, well-adjusted, growing, satisfied. All that. Then a year ago my life exploded all over the place, and it was more than my coping skills were able to handle. I limped along, broken and oozing devastation; tried to get help again, but the person I found wasn't a good match. I liked her, but we just didn't work well together. So instead of getting better, I got worse and worse and worse, and I spent all of fall being actively, acutely suicidal (four hospitalizations in two months).

After that I was better, but I went back to the counselor I had had, and it wasn't long at all before I started despairing again. So I left her. I do feel better, but I also feel so fragile, and now I'm trying to do this all by myself. Which means sometimes I'm up and feel like everything's gonna be okay; and sometimes, like now, I feel so lost and alone and incapable and overwhelmed. It's hard to fight that. I'm so tired.

I'm not actively suicidal right now. But the notion seems charming.
