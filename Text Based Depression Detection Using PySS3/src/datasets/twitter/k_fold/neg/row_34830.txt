I think I may be done...I am 47, I hate my job, I lost all my savings in a failed business venture, I live in my parent's guest bedroom and spend weekends alone. I have no money, almost no friends really. I'm single with no dating prospects and find it very hard to put myself out there with all of this baggage I carry.

The past few years have been hell.  It's not gotten any better.  I see a psychiatrist and a therapist but nothing helps.  I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder.  I cry in bed a lot.

I think if I were gone forever--my family and few friends &amp; acquaintances would stop for a moment of silence then go about their lives as if I were never there to begin with.

I don't think I'd be missed.  In fact maybe those around me would be pleased as they wouldn't feel the need to worry about me anymore.

It's simply not getting any better.  No hope. Nothing to look forward too.

Somebody help
