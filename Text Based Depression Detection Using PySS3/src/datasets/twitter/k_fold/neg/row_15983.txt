Iâ€™m going to try to fall asleep and I hope to not feel this suicidal in the morning.I really want to go out into a field and kill myself. Walk until I canâ€™t walk anymore. So no one finds me for a while. Iâ€™d hate for my family to find me. Iâ€™m going to try to stay alive. But right now. Itâ€™s eating at my mind. Iâ€™m so triggered at the moment. Feel so hopeless. So worthless.
