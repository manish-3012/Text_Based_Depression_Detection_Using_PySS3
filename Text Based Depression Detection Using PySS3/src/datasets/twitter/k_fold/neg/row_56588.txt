How can you get over the past?Intrusive thoughts of poor social interactions; faces emblazoned with micro-expressions of disapproval; plausible notions of - the reality that - you didn't live up to your potential in endeavors and relationships.

More painfully: that you never really had any relationships or endeavors at all. As a kid it was video games, then it was internet for 10 hours a day. The lack of Facebook photos - the lack of an active Facebook, the lack of a profile picture - conveys this: if you go to attend the most overpriced dating service in history, you better have at least a few filtered polaroids filters to show you went to a frat house, an apartment; even an upscale restaurant with the opposite sex. 

Most salient: feeling like a fated victim of childhood trauma, as if you were deterministically bound to not achieve success; or that you were stripped of yourself since before you could speak.

The learned (self-)helplessness. "Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man." 

Watching others' progress when you know you should be right with them but instead you're just in the front row, eating popcorn, cuz it extends the neurovegetative depression metaphor. 

I used to be on the giving end of this now I've been on the receiving end perpetually. You don't know how many times I've typed iterations of this to myself on a pseudonymous blog. I aint even satisfied with this one, and why's satisfaction what I want to feel from this? Freedom of expression
