Bought a pack of notepads and a pack of pensIts happening . Just came back from buying a pack of notepads and pens . Now to write out all of what I owe like credit card debts,  phone bill commitments,  and car finance details . I'm sure my credit card bills will be most likely wiped out because one of them is over 5k . The rest is just owing a small amount and my work superannuation for the past 20 years can pay off the rest . My car will likely be reposesed but joke is on them as I will be dying in it . Getting all this prepared to kill myself in a few weeks time.
