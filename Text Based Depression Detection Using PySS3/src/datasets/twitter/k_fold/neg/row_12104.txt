I need to prove I'm not an attention seeker. My first suicide attempt just failed. I promise I'll die as soon as possible!Some people call me an "attention seeker" after my failed suicide attempt. Life after first suicide attempt is not that easy. It's not like something you can see in the movies when a man tried to kill himself, then someone found him and sent him to the hospital. And what's more? He would wake up in the hospital and be surrounded by supportive people. Noo!! This doesn't usually happen in real life. In real life, people feel happy when you wake up because they don't feel guilty. They'll say things like "Why did you do that?", "Be happy", "Thereâ€™s always someone worse off than you are", and etc.. which makes you feel worse. I heard someone saying that I didn't really want to die.  I just need attention. So it makes me feel like I want to do it again. I want to prove that I really want to do it. Is it just me or anyone else?
