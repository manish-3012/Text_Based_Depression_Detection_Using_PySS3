Is this really the place where we encourage suicide?So I've been seeing a few "Goodbye" posts from suicidal people, and most of the comments are encouraging them to not do it, and asking them if they would like to talk instead, etc. But among those are comments saying "Go in peace," "I hope you die peacefully," things like that, and they're not downvoted to oblivion. Is that acceptable here? Is that seriously allowed? I joined this because I have been suicidal in the past and wanted a place to go if and when those feelings returned, and I really do not want to be in such a situation and have people telling me, essentially, to follow through with it and that I should do it, how ever "polite" they may be in their approach. I read the rules and the pinned notes, and it doesn't seem that these kinds of comments are acceptable, but they're still there and not downvoted.
