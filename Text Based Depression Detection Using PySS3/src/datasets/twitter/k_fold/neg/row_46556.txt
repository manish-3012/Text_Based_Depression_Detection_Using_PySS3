If God feels my pain, will I go to hell when I take my life? Either die soon or live many years in this prison called life.I am speaking of personal experience; I am NOT encouraging anyone to commit suicide.

Why would anyone want to feel like this for the rest of their lives? Every day, I feel disgusted with life and my only comfort at night is knowing that I will die soon (hopefully this weekend or maybe tomorrow). I have endured so much in life but I am completely defeated. Since I no longer have family and friends by choice, my death will not matter...so will God please forgive me after I do it? Will I get to be with my departed loved ones, whose deaths changed me forever? I have been a pretty decent person all my life, and the few that knew me well acted like I was practically a saint. Not that I am, but I am too sensitive for this world. I despise a world of loose morals, where innocent people and children die and suffer for no reason, and where lack of morals/soul is rewarded. Not to mention my own issues (please skim my other post(s) if interested) that are impossible to live with. We are going to die anyway, so why not sooner rather than a lifetime of excruciating painful thoughts and memories that, counselling, medication and hobbies cannot fix?

Please let me know if God will forgive my first sin. I do not deserve his blessings, and I need to get this over with once and for all. Please forgive me...
