Dunno what to do anymoreReally just at a point where Iâ€™ve given up. No matter what I do I canâ€™t make myself happy. I hate how I am and Iâ€™m ruining my relationship cause, just to not get into details, cause of my trust issues and anxiety and attachment issues. Sheâ€™s the only thing that makes me happy and hopeful but idk when Iâ€™m not with her then reality hits and I realize Iâ€™m still my shit self. Just like the other day I had to call my coworker and closest thing to a friend out here cause I was sitting in the parking lot ready to kill myself and I wanted him to come sit with me so I didnâ€™t. Lately Iâ€™ve just been getting high to deal with my problems and but then Iâ€™m just really high and really sad. Having to actually call my friend and acknowledge to someone I donâ€™t usually confide in that I need him there so I donâ€™t fucking kms was really a wake up call that idk Iâ€™m a lot closer to that point than I thought i was. I havenâ€™t lived the hardest life. All of this shit is internal which makes it worse because I canâ€™t bring myself to stomach myself any longer. I canâ€™t change how I am. Iâ€™ve been trying for years. Iâ€™m kinda just at the point idc anymore. Itâ€™s gonna be the way I go at some point anyways Iâ€™m sure of it. All it takes is one time Iâ€™m sad and have access to something thatâ€™ll get the job done quick and more or less painless. Sorry for this vent but Iâ€™ve exhausted all of my two friends with this shit enough. Canâ€™t say this to my gf cause well A most if itâ€™s about her and B sheâ€™s just as suicidal as I am and weâ€™d just end up thinking of ways to kill ourselves which wouldnâ€™t help anything. Idk sorry kinda just thinkin out loud and was hoping writing it down would make me feel better.
