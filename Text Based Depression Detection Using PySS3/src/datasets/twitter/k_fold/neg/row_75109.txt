I hate it when people pity meHi, I'm new here. I'll skip my extremely long and confusing back story and just say this: I drives me crazy when people pity me. Have you ever seen a turtle get stuck on it's back and try to get up but it can't? That's how I feel. People just stand around and watch it, puffing out their bottom lip and say "aww that poor thing" but no one goes to help it. When they finally do decide to help it, they send it somewhere they think it'll be safe and get help. But the thing I've come to realize is they don't really care. They just wanna do the "right thing" so they can go home and boast to their families about how they saved some poor, innocent, little girl from killing herself but in reality, all she wanted was to finally be free
