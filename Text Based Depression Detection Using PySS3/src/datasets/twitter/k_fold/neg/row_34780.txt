I wrote a suicide note todayI'm waiting for next Friday which is when I will be able to get the rope for my possible suicide. I wrote a bunch of individual suicide notes for different people but I'm just trying to decide if I should hang myself or jump off a bridge/building because both would be very easy for me. I don't know why I'm writing this but i think that this is somewhat therapeutic for me.
