I feel it winding up again. [Gore description warning]I have a history of mental health issues going back to childhood. I had extensive suicidal ideation for over a decade before attempting. I have had episodes of â€˜winding upâ€™ where I feel inner tensions ratcheting up over weeks/months that usually end in some form of self-harm. There have been episodes with heavy dissociation and thoughts/perceptions crossing into the territory of psychosis. I experience paranoia and anger. I become restless and impulsive. I have obsessive/compulsive/intrusive thoughts and, to a lesser degree, behaviors as well. I withdraw at some point from what few social and interpersonal connections I have. One severe episode ended with me not sleeping for two days because of intrusive thoughts/images of cutting half of my face off with a knife to look under it and then stapling it back on. It ended when I had a cutting episode in which I bloodied up the sink and splashed/cleaned the blood from myself and the sink with steaming hot water so that the smell would take up into the air and I could breathe it in; then I tried to put my dead friendâ€™s knife through my face but it wasnâ€™t particularly sharp and it got stuck part way through for enough of a moment to notice myself in the mirror with a knife in my face, wounds pointlessly numb, and think that I just looked stupid and the whole endeavor was useless. I went from near frenzy to crippling depression. I went to bed and slept, finally. 
It was several years later when I attempted suicide in the manner I had started obsessing with when I was about 12 years old. I stabbed myself five times in the abdomen with a kitchen knife. It was disappointing. I clenched down hard on the first stab - hard enough that instead of â€˜cuttingâ€™ through me I could hear the knife audibly ripping through me. It was something like the sound of cutting through cardboard. Blood flowed out of me. It didnâ€™t spurt or gush. It flowed smoothly and evenly. It hurt a lot. It was the type of pain that so far exceeds the threshold of reacting instinctively to deflect or avoid it that you maintain full deliberate control of your actions. I acted to stab again, and again, and again, and again. I was disappointed, again. I didnâ€™t experience the pain the way I had always hoped. I was to supposed to stab myself six times but I was a nervous pervis not knowing how the pain or blood loss would effect me, not knowing whether my will might fail or how quickly some form of shock might set in. I moved too quickly, I didnâ€™t force the blade to the hilt, I miscounted. I was sloppy. 
Whether a full episode was â€˜onâ€™ or not, I had more or less obsessived on what that experience would be like. I was disappointed and then I survived. I felt as though I had built up a â€˜false religionâ€™ of it over many years and intense episodes, and that it had all collapsed. I thought I might be free from all but the memory and, for a while, I was. Then in the same way I found myself with the thought of disembowelment seeded in my mind. Now I am progressively feeling wound up more and more again. I am not presently feeling an episode as when I stabbed my face, but I wasnâ€™t in that kind of episode when I attempted to kill myself either. I was triggered to act primarily by very immediate and acute distress due to external events then. I do feel an episode now though, and I feel that the trigger threshold is otherwise much lower now because I know how easy it is and have the added confidence of circumspection regarding its execution.
I thought the compulsion was gone, but itâ€™s not, and I am definitely not afraid anymore. I wonâ€™t be nervous next time. I feel something in my psyche winding tighter and tighter and, whether or not I have an immersive and prolonged episode, I feel the threshold to trigger the action is much, much lower now. I donâ€™t know what to do. I havenâ€™t harmed myself yet, but I donâ€™t feel entirely in control now. I think that will only continue to decline. I donâ€™t know if I would survive again this time.
