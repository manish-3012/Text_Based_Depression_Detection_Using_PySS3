Do These Thoughts Ever Go Away?My life has (fundamentally speaking) changed for the better, can't say  the same mentally unfortunately.  I now have a job and someone that I love dearly and yet I don't "feel" better.  Some of you may say that it  will take time, and if that is the case, then how much time?
