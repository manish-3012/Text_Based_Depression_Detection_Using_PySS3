Thereâ€™s no hope for meAll people can do is tell me â€œit gets betterâ€, â€œhang onâ€,
â€œGive it timeâ€, â€œgo for a walkâ€, â€œyouâ€™re still youngâ€, â€œyou can be happyâ€, etc. and itâ€™s all so fucking insulting, Iâ€™d rather have someone completely ignore me than to say useless shit like that. Words donâ€™t help shitty traumatic situations, especially not when itâ€™s a lifetime of that. Iâ€™m tired of therapists who just want to shove pills down my throat while I continue to live with my abusive father whoâ€™s abused me in all ways possible, because yeah, I need pills that arenâ€™t gonna actually solve the issue and just numb me out and not even make me feel better. Iâ€™m tired of therapists thinking I overreact when I talk about how I feel and I tell them I donâ€™t ever feel safe. Iâ€™m tired of being unseen and not being important enough. Iâ€™m tired of having no help. This world is honestly so shit. If you have to be born into good circumstances in order to enjoy this life then    LIFE IS NOT A GIFT. Thereâ€™s no help for people who need it and who are victims. Everything just caters to the ones who are â€œacceptableâ€. If everyone canâ€™t be happy and safe then this world is fundamentally fucked up. I hate it here.
