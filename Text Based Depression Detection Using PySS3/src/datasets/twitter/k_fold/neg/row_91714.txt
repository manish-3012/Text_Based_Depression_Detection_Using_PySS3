I'm not sure what to do anymore...I've been feeling pretty suicidal for the past year. I know suicide isn't the answer, and I want to get help, but I don't want to put my parents through that. It would be so expensive, and we already don't have much money. If I tell them I've been feeling this way, I know they'll spend as much money as needed, and I really don't want that. I attempted suicide this past year. It was a pretty piss poor attempt though. I only downed about 9 pills before I chickened out. But now, I really am thinking about doing it again. For real this time. I don't want to, but at the same time, I do. Every thing is just so confusing and I don't know what to do anymore...
