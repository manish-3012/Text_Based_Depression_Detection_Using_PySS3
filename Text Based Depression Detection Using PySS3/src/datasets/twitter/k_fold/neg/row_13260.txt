Thinking of doing suicide by cop this weekI was doing okay but yesterday I saw a really pretty girl at trader joe's and just all these suicidal emotions came in thinking about how women are, how the world is, how nobody cares about men and Idk how I made it through last night. Had a couple beers this morning and I'm still pretty shaken up, just not sure how to progress.

I will be 31 this year and I'm just so tired. Women simply don't like me. I'm a decent looking guy its just that my personality is just meek and weird even if I try to act confident and they just don't like me and everything I do feels like a cope. I am considering suicide by police this week, but I am scared that I'll survive and end up paralyzed in jail for the rest of my life or something. Otherwise thinking of running my car in the garage, but the same thing I am worried I will wake up paralyzed.

I don't know what I should do right now. I just came back from culvers and had a nice burger and fries. Thinking of doing some of my body weight exercises to see if I can progress and build my confidence back a bit, maybe listen to some music and play skyrim after.

its so tough i have zero support and the only friend i had online just turned into a complete a-hole saying im responsible for all my problems and i just dont want to live anymore and i 100% believe there is no god and even if there is im not scared to die anymore
