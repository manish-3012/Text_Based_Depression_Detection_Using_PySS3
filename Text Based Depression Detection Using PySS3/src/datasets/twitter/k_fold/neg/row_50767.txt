Looking for a friendI am not suicidal, I know I am not going to kill myself so maybe this is the wrong place to post. I am just very sad and lonely. I would like a friend, just someone I can talk to, not in person but online. I used to have a friend, she was my girlfriend but she left me some months ago. I feel so alone.
