It is hard sometimesIdk about everyone but I find it so hard to stay alive 90% of the time this world seems to lack color/excitement nothing seems new . I have felt like I dies on the operating table when I was 5 " had a tumor removed 3 times " and only time I feel alive is when I am having sex or doing something that gives me adrenaline rush it is still hard not to think that I would be better off gone then here still. I know I won't so it but it is so hard not to want to when all I want to is curl up on someone's arms and have them lie and say it will be alright and I am a 35 yr old male
