i wanna give upi wanna give up, so bad. i just wanna be dead somehow, in anyway. i wanna be gone from this planet and forgotten, i don't wanna feel anymore. i'm not helping anyone by being here, i'm just a burden for everyone i meet, i hate to be so gloomy but i'm just so tired. i'm ready to give up
