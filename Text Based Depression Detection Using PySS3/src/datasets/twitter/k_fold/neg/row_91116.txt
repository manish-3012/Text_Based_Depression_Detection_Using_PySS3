I put on a great faceOn surface, I have family and friends convinced that Iâ€™m a happy and bubbly mom and wife but lately Iâ€™ve been fantasizing about driving my minivan into a canyon. I love my kids and donâ€™t want to leave them but my husband has made my life miserable for the past 7 years. He has put me in such financial ruin that I have to file bankruptcy this month and Iâ€™m just not coping with this very well.
