gonna do it over the weekendNot really sure why I am writing this. I am a 24M who's been unemployed for 4 months and living with my parents. I went to uni and ended up with a terrible gpa and was basically rejected by my peers due to social anxiety and substance abuse issues. Have had one SO in the past 3 years and that didn't even last that long. I got Baker acted while I was at my last job and I'm pretty sure the few acquaintances I made there all think I'm crazy due to disappearing for a week without explanation. I try and go out and socialize with acquaintances but it just never seems to stick. My only real hope was going back to grad school for a fresh start but it's looking like that's not going to happen due to my poor grades in undergrad. So basically I'm stuck with no friends/ horrible romantic life, poor job prospects and severe depression. The only reason I'm still here is because I know what it would do to my parents. I'm starting to not even care about that... I feel completely helpless and I know the way to end this for good. No pills that'll just damage your organs or wrist slitting that'll just hurt and clot before it'll actually does anything. This isn't going to get any better... you have to have friends to get friends. It's not like I'm actually gonna get a decent job with a huge work gap and few marketable skills. What's the pint? I'd rather just end it now than having to repeat this cycle and be miserable for the next 50+ years.
