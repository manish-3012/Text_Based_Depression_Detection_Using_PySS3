Trying to make a plan to end itToday is the last day Iâ€™ll see my boyfriend. He is leaving me. He walked out on me 11 days ago and is coming back today because I asked him for help. He doesnâ€™t know Iâ€™m suicidal and he will just judge me if I tell him. I canâ€™t live like this anymore. Everyone I love leaves me. And I donâ€™t love the way normal people do. I donâ€™t just get over it. I was already depressed and this is my final limit here. I donâ€™t like anything. I donâ€™t like music or movies or hobbies. My job is fine but not enough to keep living for. I have a friend but she isnâ€™t enough to live for either. The only thing that stops me is hurting my dad. I donâ€™t think heâ€™d get over it. But maybe he could. Maybe I could beg him to just let me go. 

We had this huge life together, me and my boyfriend. He treated me like I was the most valuable thing in existence. The love was deeper than I thought possible. I used to think I was dreaming. This man came in my life after searching for me for years, he did everything possible to be with me and when he got me he couldnâ€™t shut up about how happy I made him and how nobody had it as good as he did. It was truly a different kind of love.  But nobody believes me when I say that. Iâ€™m in my 30â€™s. I know better by now. And nobody gets it because nobody has had it that good like I did. 

Things happened. Bad things. I lost a pregnancy. His mom died. We fell into a rut. We got into financial problems.  It got hard. He stopped cherishing me. I got complacent. He got mean. 

And then. One day. He told me he didnâ€™t love or want me. And I couldnâ€™t believe it and I fought so hard for him and he stayed. He left a month later, the day after thanksgiving dinner with my father. 

I got angry. He swore heâ€™d fix everything and he was just giving me space. He promised heâ€™d do things to fix the damage. But he didnâ€™t. And then when I asked him to come back, he said he was just lying about fixing it. And that if he came back heâ€™d be a prisoner to me and that heâ€™d just be faking it and would cheat on me. He screamed at me and said all of his promises in the beginning changed and that itâ€™s stupid to believe a promise. 

He says he puts everything before him and he canâ€™t do it anymore. That isnâ€™t true but he thinks it is and I guess perception is reality. 

I live in a very gun friendly state. I would like to get off this ride. Iâ€™m over being here. I donâ€™t belong here. My emotions arenâ€™t right for this world. I donâ€™t feel the way other people do. I am not a social outcast or depressed for no reason. I am attractive and sexual and funny and I know how to make friends and keep a decent job. That just makes it worse. Because I know going out and making friends and doing hobbies and sleeping around wonâ€™t help. My depression is because of things that happen that I canâ€™t change. Itâ€™s not just a general sadness I canâ€™t define and could therefore remedy or medicate. Thereâ€™s no cure for being hurt by someone you trusted. No way out. No way out. 

I just want to stop hurting. Now heâ€™s made it so even if he comes back, it can never be like it was. And Iâ€™m done being hurt. Iâ€™m just scared of killing myself. But if I donâ€™t, I will die anyway. I donâ€™t eat or drink. I canâ€™t pay the rent here alone. I would probably just get into hard drugs until I just overdose. I would rather not suffer that way before I die and have to think about how happy he is and how heâ€™s sleeping with other â€œpeople.â€  

I just canâ€™t. Is it okay to just go? Itâ€™s okay to die if you want, right?
