Deep down inside my soul I know I should pull the trigger on this 9mm pistol tonight...rocketing the 115gr copper coated lead hollowpoint through my fragile skull...I'm just venting the words that come into my mind as I stare at this loaded weapon tonight, lonely and empty. Forgotten by human society and left alone in solitary confinement.

I've been left behind and forgotten by this world.

 Maybe I'll find the COURAGE to pull the trigger, maybe I won't.

All I ask is that you don't try to stop me. Just read my words tonight.

It's my right. My choice.

That's American Freedom.

You want to send the government after my ass?

Well, they can throw my dead body in a cell.

Nothing more.

Nothing less.
