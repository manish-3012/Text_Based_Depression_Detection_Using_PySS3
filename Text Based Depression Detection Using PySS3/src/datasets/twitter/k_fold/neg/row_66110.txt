Why do most people view suicide as a bad thing when sometimes it isn't?Hi, I'm new here. I think suicide is sometimes the smartest and best option. Not for everyone, obviously. It depends on the individual's situation. But if someone has a chronic health issue, be it mental or physical, and decides that they'd rather not exist, then why is that not a valid choice? None of us chose to exist and none of us chose the conditions we exist under. Surely, the decision to opt-out should be a human right. Why do the majority of people feel that everyone's obliged to keep existing until something else inevitably takes them out (e.g. illness or an accident or murder or old age etc.)? Why can't we decide for ourselves if our particular life is worth living? This whole 'suicide is selfish', 'life is a gift' thing is very weird to me and doesn't seem to be based on real logic or real compassion. Everyone dies eventually, so why can't people take it into their own hands and not be seen as 'crazy' or somehow morally lacking?
