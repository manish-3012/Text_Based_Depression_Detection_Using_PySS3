What's the pointwhen I had spent your best years dealing with a medical condition that I have isolated everyone/everything else? Now, my peers are doing so well and yet my education is shitty due to this condition. Been trying to get a job but no one wants to hire me. What's the point of it all? 16 really just held better days.
