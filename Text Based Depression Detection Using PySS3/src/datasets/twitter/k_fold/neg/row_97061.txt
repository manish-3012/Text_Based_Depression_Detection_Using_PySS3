Every day gets harderI am so weak. I'm just sinking further and further. I try and get out and do things but I just don't care. It takes so much effort. If he leaves I don't know if I can go on, but the emotional toll now is just as straining. I wish there was a painless way to go, but it really doesn't look like there is. And I don't want to fail. The depression and anxiety I'm feeling though...I have headaches all the time, I cry all the time. I don't get enjoyment out of anything. I have people I can talk to, and do to an extent, but I can't tell them everything. I don't know where to turn, I don't know what to do. I'm tired of putting on a happy face.
