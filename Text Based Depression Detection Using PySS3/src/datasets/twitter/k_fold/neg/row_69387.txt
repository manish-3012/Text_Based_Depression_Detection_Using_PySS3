I don't want to do this anymoreA student without motivation right now an exam coming up for university and i have really just not been caring about it at all. i go to a tutor with other kids from my class for the exams and because of how i feel about living i fail to understand the lessons and the teacher scolds me in front of everyone which makes me just want to shoot myself in the head.  I don't want to go to university and get a job then continue living. I want to end the pain as soon as possible. But my parents keep telling me i have to for some reason and they force me to go. Every single day waking up to get scolded really hurts. These words the tutor says makes me even more suicidal. Constantly loaded up with bad energy and shamefulness i'm not even sure if i can survive until august. I might actually end it all soon. 

I dont want a better life. I dont want to desperately study for a career that i dont even want. I just really dont want to continue. I want everyone to forget me not feel sad about me. The only reason why i still havent done it is because of my mother really and my grandparents. Im living for the sake of other people's feelings. Just thinking how much it would scar them. I wish i could kill myself right now and everybody would just forget it. I can't take the pain anymore
