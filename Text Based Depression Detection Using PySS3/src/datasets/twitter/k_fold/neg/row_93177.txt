I need helpAl I think about now is pulling a trigger on myself. 

All Iâ€™ve ever wanted to do is just make people happy, make them laugh, and care. But no one does the same for me, no cares about me. People backstab me, use me, and overall are just fake to me. People pretend to be my friends because my parents are rich. They never invite me to anything, itâ€™s always when can we come over, when can we use the boat. My life should be great, right? No, all I want is a meaningful attachment. But people are heartless, they done care what their actions do to me. How do I not care about it, how do I escape? All I think about everyday is killing myself.
