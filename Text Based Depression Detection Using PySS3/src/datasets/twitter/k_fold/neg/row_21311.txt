Would someone just talk to me?I'm feeling so fucked and alone. I just don't know what I'm doing with myself and really don't like my life right now. I just want to talk to people and I'm having a rough time making friends and feeling close to anyone. I just need to talk to someone right now who can be open minded about things. I just don't feel safe with myself right now and I don't have anybody.
