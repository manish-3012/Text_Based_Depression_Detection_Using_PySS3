My friend might commit suicideHeâ€™s always making comments about killing himself. Heâ€™s gotten into therapy and was recently diagnosed with depression and is now on antidepressants. He still makes comments about him wanting to die and how life is pointless and tries to assure me he wont kill himself but Iâ€™m still worried for him. Im scared that one day I might find out he killed himself. What can I do?
