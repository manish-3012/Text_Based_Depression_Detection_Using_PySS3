I don't have any futureI'm 19 years old and I don't see any happy future for me. My life is only going to get worse and worse at this rate. I'm currently attending college and I'm doing terribly. I'm failing half my classes. Not because I'm dumb, I just can't motivate myself to do any of the work anymore. All I want to do is sit at home all day. I barely even go to classes anymore. My parents don't know yet since I lie to them and tell them I'm doing fine. I don't have the courage to tell them I'm failing. I don't even want to be there, I have no interest in any subject. I've hated school my entire life and I was never good at it. I'm always scared and anxious about what will happen to me once my parents know I failed. They'll probably kick me out. And then I have nothing after that. I'm not good at socializing. I haven't had friends in 9 years, I'm not good at socializing and I don't like doing that. The only people I talk to are my parents and people at my job, and even then I'm poor at socializing. I have no hobbys besides browsing the Internet and video games. I don't like doing anything else. My life is not terrible yet, but I am fully aware that I only have another month or so before everything comes crashing down. I don't know what to do.
