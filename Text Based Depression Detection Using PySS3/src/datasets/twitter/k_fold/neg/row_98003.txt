Planning a Public Suicide Attempt.I've been going backwards and forwards in my mind .. about whether I should proceed with this plan, as awkward as it is. I might change my mind the next morning ... and then spend the whole night fantasizing about it again. Should I live in a tent? Live in a van? Kill myself? Fake a suicide attempt? I honestly don't know .. but it really seems like my life is over, and I've arrived at a stalemate.

&amp;nbsp;

Seems like a lot of my life decisions are indeed controlled by my moods. . **but again, the main triggering factor is the fact that I'm unemployed**. My financial assistance is also running out, as I've probably mentioned in other topics.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't want to make this all about myself, I'll be sure to listen to everyone in here and make the best of my efforts to reply and provide emotional support .. but unfortunately, I personally cannot be saved. This is something even my parents have told me - *people will get sick of helping you eventually*..

&amp;nbsp;

It seems like the only way the poor will ever be taken seriously in this country is if they commit suicide or self-harm.

&amp;nbsp;

If you look at the DailyMail, for example.. you'll see how people's attitudes toward welfare change:

&amp;nbsp;

1. When there's articles about the TV show 'Benefit Street', in which they will leave comments about how the poor are nothing but lazy, drug-addicted scroungers.. 

2. When there's articles about people taking their own lives as a result of benefit cuts.. after which people will leave comments about how the Tories have blood on their hands, and how evil Capitalism has become, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

I just want to go a bus stop and overdose on prescription pills, then slice my arms and my stomach with a knife. Get carried away by an ambulance .. ... hopefully then, the poor will have a voice in this country, once again. This will be my sacrifice for the working class.
