Who deserves lifeAnswer: people who are not me. I am older and in poor health. Pain all the time, chronic illness that gets worse every year. So I tried but I passed out and came to to a bunch of EMT's. I asked them not to save me but they did. So now I have one more sin on my soul. I wasted precious resources in a pandemic. My parents would be so ashamed of me. I am so ashamed of me. I won't do it that way again, I won't overdose. There are better ways. I can't be using up resources that way, not in times like this. Mea culpa. I'm sorry, Zach, please forgive me, I couldn't do it one more day.
