i dont want to hurt myself anymore i just want to diethings have gotten to the point for me that where i usually would desperately want to grab a sharp object and stab myself or cut myself or even use a knife as a method of suicide i just sit there and feel this crushing weight and everything gets dark and i close my eyes and just will myself to die i just want to be dead 

every little thing that goes wrong pushes me here and im out of fucking options and i want to just end it all

being alive is annoying
dealing with people is annoying
arguing with my boyfriend is annoying
even fucking doing things that make me happy is annoying

everything is annoying and its not getting any fucking better and i can delude myself into believing that i am on the right track and that things will "get better" but its a fucking lie ive seen through it so many fucking times and im fucking done

im going to kill myself soon its gonna fucking happen
im fucking done
