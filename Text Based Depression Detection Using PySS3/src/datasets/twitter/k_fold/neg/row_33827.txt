I can not fail this timeI dont have the will power to keep sticking around, feels like i have nothing to live for. All anybody sees when they look at me is what they can get from me, or all my failures. Ive tried to commit suicide twice before, by overdosing on heroin. And failed. But now my tolerance is low, and i think id have a better shot. I have no money, ive considered robbing my mom or sleeping with men for it, both ideas disgust me, but so does the idea of continuing to live. I cant ever seem to bring myself to cut my wrist deep enough, not because i dont want to die, i just cant cut deep enough. I have reached out to anyone i can think of, but i am alone. Completely. I am not worth the effort to anyone. I want today to be my final day
