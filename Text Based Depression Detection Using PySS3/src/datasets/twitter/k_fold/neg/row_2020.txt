i hate it i hate it i hate it how is here so badiâ€™m catholic and my mom always says that iâ€™ll go to hell if i take my life, she seriously doesnâ€™t even care. and can hell really be worse than this i just want to be gone. and i donâ€™t want to go to heaven or hell, i donâ€™t want to have to constantly be with myself i just want a black out. i want void. i want absolutely nothing to happen. i just want to be over. and i almost crashed my car last night and i cut last night bc iâ€™m going insane i canâ€™t take any of this iâ€™m so sick of trying i try so hard and itâ€™s so unfair that i(and yâ€™all) have to live with this pain. why is it that we have to live with pain and then people have babies for what?? so that way they can go through this pain and want to die when they are 17. i just want to leave this life and i donâ€™t want a new one i just want everything to disappear
