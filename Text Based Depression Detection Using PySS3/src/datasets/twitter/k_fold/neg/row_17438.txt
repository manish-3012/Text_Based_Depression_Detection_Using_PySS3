What to do? I need help.Hey reddit. 
I hope I can write this here, if not delete this post. 

I need help, I am suicidal and I don't know what to do anymore. Except the fact that I want to take my own life. 
My whole life has been a downhill and this half year has just been awful. I been in and out of psychiatric ward and now I finally got a psychologist. But still, I am so lost and with this quarantine now a days, I just don't have the energy to live anymore. It's literally killing me.

Where I live, the mental health care system suck and I don't know if anyone can help me anymore. I just so so tired.

The only thing that is stopping me from taking my own life is my best friend. If it wasn't for him, I would have been dead a long time ago. 
He is literally the best thing that has happened to me my whole life and it kills me to see him begging me to stay alive. 

This is where I need help.
He is desperate for something to do that will help me, but I am at loss, I don't know what anyone can do now. All I've been doing for last week is sleep and cry, and that's not a life I want to live. I too tired to live it as well. 

He has been through this many times before, and that just makes this so much worse, because the last thing I want is to make him go through this again.

I havent decided if I am going to take my own life, but I am pretty damn close to ending it. But what do I do? Am a that selfish to end it and not care about my best friend? Or do I stay alive because of him - when he is willing to put his life on hold for me? Though I feel like I shouldn't stay alive because of anyone, I feel like I should stay alive because that's what I want...  I don't know anymore. If I do stay alive though, what can he do to help me and what can I do to help myself? Because I can't live like this anymore.

Thanks for reading and thanks for any comments.
