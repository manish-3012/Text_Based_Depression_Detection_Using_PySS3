Please, I just need to make it all stop.I want to die and I would do it in a heartbeat if I could calm my anxiety over dying.       I don't know how I let it get this far.   But here I am.    Today was just a culmination of how horrible  my life has been for the past few years and how it's never going to get better.    
I'm heartbroken over deaths in my family that I can't seem to heal from.     I have sick animals who I can't afford to take to the vet, hell I can't even afford to eat.     I have no one close to me who I can turn to for anything, the one person I have is tired of my crap and honestly if I tell them they will say I want attention.   
I just wish I could go to sleep and not wake up.    I know it's not the answer to anything and it will harm my family, but they'll get over it.    Nothing brings me happiness.    Everything I once like doing is just nothing to me anymore.       


I probably should go to the hospital, but I'm even afraid to do that.   They wouldn't believe me.    I don't care if I have to go inpatient for awhile, but they probably would kick me out.    It's not like I could even follow up, I don't have a car and there isn't a bus line near me that I could even walk too.         


If I could do it now, I would,  but then I couldn't, I can't work up the courage.      I feel lost.    I just want all the pain to go away and it just never will.    Just my luck my knives would be too dull.      This probably shouldn't even be here, I shouldn't even be here.
