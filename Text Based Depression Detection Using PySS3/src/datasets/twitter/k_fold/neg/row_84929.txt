Are antidepressants free on the U.S???I'm from MÃ©xico and antidepressants are really cheap here plus they can be bought without a recipe... Anyways I've been going with a psychiatrist and he prescribed me that and some medicine for my anxiety, they've been miraculous, I've never felt that good in my life, of course I'm also going with a psychotherapist, but I've been wondering if it's that expensive in the U.S cause here in MÃ©xico it's so cheap that I don't know why I've been suffering so long if the cure was right in front of me at a pretty solid price
