I have found a browser based chatroom that I use to vent or just talk about suicidal thoughts.asbusstop.net is the website.
 I recently went back to this chat. It's dead sometimes but when it's active it's really fun.
asbusstop gets its name from a usenet group that existed in the early days of the internet called alt.suicide.holiday the group is long gone and is somewhat obscure now. 
 [From Wikipedia.com:]
"alt.suicide.holiday


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Jump to: navigation, search 



alt.suicide.holiday (a.s.h, ASH or ash) is a Usenet newsgroup. Its original purpose was to discuss the relationship between suicide rates and holiday seasons. However, it has since evolved into a broad discussion forum where suicidal people can openly share their thoughts. Some participants are not suicidal, but post to provide psychological support and other input to suicidal or depressed posters. " 
However this chat is not tied in with the usenet group, the general attitude is still the same. 
[From Wikipedia.com:]
"The community has developed its own unique terminology. "Catch the bus" refers to the act of suicide, and the group is described as:
A bus stop where several people have decided to stop and chat before deciding on whether or not to get on the bus.
Newcomers are traditionally greeted with:
Welcome to a.s.h, sorry you're here."
 That's where the chat gets its name from.
Hope this chat can help some no matter if you intend on doing it or not. There are no methods listed on the site and posting or discussing methods is explicitly prohibited.
