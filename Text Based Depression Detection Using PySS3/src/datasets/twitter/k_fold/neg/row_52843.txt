kind of tried to kill myself todayso yesterday or so my family took my pc and my phone away and now all I have is a school Chromebook which barely works. We also fought a lot and the problem is the fact that my main coping method IS technology so my depression just got like 100x worse. They think they're helping me and no matter how many times I tell them that this just makes it all worse, they never listen. I tried slitting my wrists today yet all I did was fuck up my arm. My mom saw my cuts and said "WOW WHAT WILL THIS DO? YOU'LL DIE AND WHAT ELSE? THIS WILL HELP NOBODY" and shit like that and they just don't understand. They even say that I'm addicted but I know for sure that they couldn't go a day without their phone. One of my tenants who's basically family is literally just a school teacher so she definitely doesn't need it. And she doesn't know that I'm depressed/suicidal at all
