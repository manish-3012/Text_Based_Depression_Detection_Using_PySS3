finallyi have been in a horribly abusive relationship. she has destoyed my life. i feel behind on all my bill to the point where i can never recover. if i get an appartment i won't be able to get electricity. she took it really hard but now everything is looking up for her and my life is in a hole that i will never be able to dig out of.
i feel an amazing sense of piece noing what has to be done. im having a rough day at work which just fuels the fire. can't wait to get out of hear and just let all this pain go away.
i am no longer strong enough for this fight.
