Don't know what to do anymorei just realized how many things that go on, which i donâ€™t tell you, or anybody, about.

mostly because part of me shuts it all out

but then there are days were i want to do things. like tell you those hidden secrets &amp; problems, or apologize to hiro and tell him how much he means to me, or call all of my past friends and tell them im sorry for being such an asshole

instead i choose to bottle them back up, where theyâ€™ll later try to come out again.

a lot of the time, i donâ€™t tell you whatâ€™s going on because i donâ€™t want you to worry. your problems mean more to me than my own.

however, sometimes i wonder if they really should; or if it anyoneâ€™s feelings and emotions should matter to me at all. well, itâ€™s always been that way, so why change now? oh yeah, because â€œlove does extraordinary things.â€ like bleed you dry of everything that truly matters, take your pride and replace it with insecurity, and downsize the world so that it is miniscule compared to the size of the love if it were materialized.

and it hurts.

it hurts when youâ€™re asked if youâ€™re okay, or happy, and you reply with a question:

â€œis anyone ever *truly* happy?â€

i donâ€™t know what this is meant to be, though i do know what it isnâ€™t.

* a suicide letter
* a love letter
* a sorry note
* a cry for help

well, maybe one of those was a lie.
