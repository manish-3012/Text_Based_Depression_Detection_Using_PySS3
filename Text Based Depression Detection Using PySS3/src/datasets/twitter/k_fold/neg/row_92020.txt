I know I should try harderBut I really just want to end it all. My anxiety, depression, and derealization have all combined to skullfuck the hell out of my brain. I can't cope with day-to-day life anymore. Nothing my therapist and psychiatrist are doing is helping me. I can't summon the energy to de-stress myself.  

To give a background, the last year I've been suffering from derealization and depersonalization brought on by my anxiety. The last few months I've developed into this suicidal, sluggish, lazy, physically sick shell of the happy girl I used to be. My psychiatrist recently had me committed to a mental hospital when I told him about my plans to kill myself. They let me out after a week and I thought I was better. I *felt* better.

I came back home only to contract some suckass virus and went back to high school only to be confronted with a shitload of homework and tests to make up (a pile which continues to grow!) and it's all way too much for me. All the stress of everything has put my anxiety into overdrive. All I can do is put myself in a fetal position and sob on my mother's shoulder. I can't do this. I want to die. Please talk to me.
