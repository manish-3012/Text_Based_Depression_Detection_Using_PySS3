It's amazing how much my life has deteriorated over the course of 10 monthsIn February last year my life was great, I had a amazing girlfriend, plenty of friends and plenty of things to do. Now I have no girlfriend, my parents don't like me as much, I have only one good friend and so many people that hate me. To top it off, I was good friends with my ex for a good bit and she was great to talk to about my issues. However now she hates me and probably wants me to die because of how much of a asshole I am. I also lost almost all of my friends and have some people who group up and pick on me online every day. Everyday it only gets worse and worse no matter what I do and I'm honestly convinced that my life will never be good again. I always reminisce about how I had it before. I just want to end it all before it can get any worse. Everything only gets worse. If I've already peaked what the point of living anymore? I don't think anyone outside of my parents, brother and one friend would miss me at all. I've tried everything to get more friends but I always fuck up or people see how bad I am when they get to know me better. I'm a fuck up at everything and probably never deserved to live in the first place.
