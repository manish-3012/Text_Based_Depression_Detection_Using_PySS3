People close to me will over react, so I'm posting here.I'll try to keep this semi short. Before anyone recommends a crisis helpline, sorry, but please, fuck off. A quick rundown, I'm 17, lost my mother at 7 and my father at 14, mother to morphine overdose and my father to hanging. Shrinks haven't given me an official diagnosis but my last one put "question marks" beside Ptsd, depression, anxiety and disassociative disorders. I've tried to kill myself upwards of 6 times this year alone through feeble attempts at hanging. My last attempt being in April. In July, I bought my first car (1996 model so more CO)  and ever since, every night, the idea of CO poisoning has been slowly consuming me. That, and the idea of going 180km/h into a solid structure. My "last chance" I gave life in April consisted of seeing a psychologist. Yeah, that was just an hour a week of condescending belittling. To top it off, he wrote a "letter of closing" to my legal guardians (sister and brother in law) stating everything I told him. (Suicide/drugs/thoughts on home life, etc.) Sorry, started to side track, anyway, I'm in a much more dire position and this post is truly my last cry out for help and as a hopeful resurrection of my faith in humanity that has long been diminished. Thank you in advanced and know, if you fail, it's in NO way your fault.
