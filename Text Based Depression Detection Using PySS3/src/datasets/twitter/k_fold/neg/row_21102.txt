Somebody please help.Okay, so i'm almost 16, and i suffer severely from hyperhidrosis(sweaty hands and armpits). I wouldn't wish this on my worse enemy, everything in my life is good except this, perfect girlfriend, friends, etc; but i can't live another day dealing with this. 10 minutes after I put a shirt on, it's drenched in sweat and just a couple minutes after washing my hands, they're dripping wet. I'm getting sweat all over my keyboard typing this, sitting here shirtless continuously wiping my hands and armpits with a towel. Whenever people are here, I have to keep going to the bathroom unless I want to get sweat everywhere. I want to live, but I know that this is only going to get worse, and the only reason I'm alive is to not hurt the ones I love. I don't know what to do.
