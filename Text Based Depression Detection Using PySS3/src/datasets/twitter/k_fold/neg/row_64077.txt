Obsessed with beauty and success standardsNot posting on a throwaway because I just donâ€™t care anymore. 

Iâ€™ve been having these thoughts for about 5 years. I was doing well for the last two years but recently I have been really stressed and overworked at work.

I am ugly, fat, unsuccessful, poor and pretty much worthless. I am east Asian, and I am so far away from their standard of beauty and success that I just want to give up. You have to be slender, pretty, smart, and have lots of designer bags and clothing, and have to have money in order for anyone to be interested in you or respect you at all. There are so many things that I want from life that are simply unattainable for me and beyond my control. I have an auto immune disease that has no cure and has really affected my self esteem. I want to give up on this pointless journey. I want to end it all.

I just tried to hit my head repeatedly but I didnâ€™t hit hard enough because Iâ€™m still here and all I did was cry about my feelings while hitting myself. It doesnâ€™t even hurt anymore, I think I need to do it again.
