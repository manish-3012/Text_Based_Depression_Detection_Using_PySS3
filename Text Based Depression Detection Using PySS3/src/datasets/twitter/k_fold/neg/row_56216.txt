Thinking of giving up. All my attempts fail to find one person. Why even try. I just want a chance.Hey. Lost all my closest people. Including my relationship. Can I just have one person to talk to constantly? Dont care about age just need a constant texter. Here is a bit about me.

Been needing constant texting for a while. I have people that come and go but looking for someone I can count on who can count on me!

I love music, I almost always have something playing! Id love to have a shared playlist with you! 

Video and voice calls are important! I love talking :) If we could game that would be even better! I have the ps4 Switch and 3ds!

I have imessage discord and whatsapp!
