I told my therapist I wouldn't kill myself but the thoughts persistI told my therapist today that I wouldn't kill myself.  I also told them about the extensive plans I made yesterday on how I would do it.  I don't know if I'm a danger to myself or not.  I'm very sick of living this way, with constant ideation about killing myself and how to do it. I'm just wondering if I should go to the hospital.
