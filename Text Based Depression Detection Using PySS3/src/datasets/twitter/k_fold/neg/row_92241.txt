Feeling trappedI've struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 13. But as long as I had people telling me what to do I could go through the motions and get by. But now I'm 24 and I don't think I have what it takes to keep going. I fail at everything that requires work. As soon as I have noone looking over my shoulder, I give up. This lack of focus makes me feel directionless and trapped. I have tried many different therapists and I do not find them to be helpful. I don't know what else to do, dying seems like the only real way out.
