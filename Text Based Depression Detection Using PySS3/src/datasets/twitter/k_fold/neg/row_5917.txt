Which day to die?Iâ€™ve been deciding which day to kill myself. Sunday evening seems perfect because I wonâ€™t be at work on Monday so a wellness check can be performed. I need to be found within 24 hours so I do not stink up my house and my family will be able to sell it more easily.  This also gives me time to eat at my favorite restaurants in piece. 

Anyone know a better day to die? Or does Sunday evening sound like a good night?
