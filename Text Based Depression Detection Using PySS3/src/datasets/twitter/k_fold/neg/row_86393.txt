Just told my mom I'm sucicidal.I had a therapy session today. She likes to check in at the beginning of the session and ask how am I. 

She asked "On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being the least depressed and 10 being the most depressed how have you been this week." 

"An 8.5" I answered. 

I told my therapist I was having suicidal thoughts. She wanted me to go to an hospital. 

I said no. 

We came to an agreement that I would tell my mom. I wrote an letter. I gave it to her when she came in after work . At first she seemed indifferent. Then I heard her crying. She seemed mad but told me she wasnt mad. She told me not to do it. I did not want to make her sad. I feel like this is all my fault. 

She's gonna make me tell my dad. I do not want to tell him. 

Why do I feel as if this has made things worst?
