I need a friend right now.I haven't gotten more than four hours of sleep a night in three years. I struggle to raise a child by myself on $200 a week. My sons father doesn't give me child support. I have gone through the courts, I have even reported him as delinquent on payment to the attorney general.  I had food stamps but cannot renew them because my dad helps me pay my rent. I recently had an allergic reaction to antibiotics causing all the good bacteria in my body to be killed. After contracting virus after virus for months, I now have stomatitis. I haven't eaten anything but water and some sips of broth in 5 days. I still have a full time job and a son by myself on four hours of sleep per night through all of this. The medical bills are piling up. The cost of diapers and milk is going up. I was thinking to myself, I just can't do this anymore. I want to just swallow a bottle of pain meds and be done with it. There of course is the guilt of a child. To leave him alone in this world, though I'm sure there's an infertile wealthy family out there happy to take him. When rationality took over I decided I should reach out to a friend. I open my phone just to realise, from my lack of free time for anything, I don't even have somebody to express myself to. So here's to you reddit, maybe you can ease my pain.
