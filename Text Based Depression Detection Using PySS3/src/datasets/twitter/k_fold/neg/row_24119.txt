Have you ever considered the fact that God is real and hates you?I'm not suicidal. Not in the "oh my life is so sad, woe is me, death, blah blah blah" way at least. I just had a thought and thought this would be a good place to ask. What if there is a higher power that created you and your entire purpose is just for him to fuck with you? I mean the idea that just because someone created something means they love them is clearly wrong. I know plenty of parents who hate their kids. Have you ever tried cooking something and it just didnt turn out right? What do you do? You throw it the fuck away. You don't give a shit about, you just toss it. You've got more, it doesn't matter. But even more than that, what if this force was sadistic in nature? What if life itself is just a sick joke on humanity? What if the chemical reaction that creates consciousness is only there for the soul crushing purpose of leaving? These are, of course, just thoughts. Although they would explain suffering in the world, as well as death, and no other religion seems to be able to do that. I'm not religious myself though, so I don't really care. But the idea that God hates you is just as likely as God loves you. After all, there can't be pleasure without suffering, or suffering without pleasure. They both have to exist, so the fact is God could be on either side. But think about it, if you were going to create something just to later kill it, that's pretty much torture in itself. Its like leaving a prisoner alive just to torture him instead of killing him and relieving him of his pain. It's all just pontificating though. In all likeliness, God isn't real.
