i want to live and die at the same timei'm fifteen years old and in my freshman year of high school. a lot of people would say that i'm too young to die, but i feel like death is just moving on to something new. to me, your existence shifts to an entirely new place, even if that means being washed away into oblivion and not being able to feel anything (this is just my opinion and belief about the universe, this is not factual. i don't mean to force my beliefs onto you if you believe in something different). to us humans, death is the end, but i think that when you're born, your essence lingers in the universe for eternity. i don't want to live my life anymore. i don't do my work in school and i might have to repeat a grade. i have bipolar and possible social anxiety, so i always have mood swings and i'm scared of talking to people. one of my only friends is online, and i feel like our friendship is going nowhere. my life is making me feel depressed and hopeless, and my entire existence feels meaningless. i want to die and see what's after life on earth, but at the same time i feel like i'll miss my old life. lately i've been feeling more appreciative of small, enjoyable moments, despite my anguish. things like the sky in the late afternoon or walking to the baseball field at lunch to be alone. i think this is because i'm planning on committing suicide and these might be my last few days here. i'm conflicted. should i stay or should i move on? i don't want to call a hotline or tell my psychiatrist, because i know that won't help. plus, i might get admitted to a hospital and my online friend might think that i already killed myself, which would be terrible. what should i do? thanks for your time
