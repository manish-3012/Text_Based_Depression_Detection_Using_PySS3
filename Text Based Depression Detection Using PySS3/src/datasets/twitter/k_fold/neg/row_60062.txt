Starting outNew Reddit user, just found this sub. I'm in dire need of a support system and I hope this can be it. 

For decades, my mind has always gone right to suicide as its default response to any kind of crisis. But just within the last few years, I've gained so much hope about my future that occasionally I can stay aware of those hopes when the negative thoughts intrude. For the times when I can't, I got a semicolon tattoo. When I'm trapped in a spiral and can't even take my head out of it long enough to remember a single reason why I want to live, I stare at it. Sometimes I can't even remember why I got it, but I'm able to focus on it and I know it has something to do with that. Then it eases up. It may take 30 minutes to four hours. But it always retreats. I eat something, take a shower, or go to sleep, and when I wake up, all might not be well, but I'll feel in control again.

It's so terrifying to have your own mind try to kill you without warning, when you're already living in a maelstrom of dysfunction, trauma, and grief. You want to have something to hold on to; an anchor of sorts. My tattoo does that for me.

I hope this helped someone. I know it's not a one size fits all problem. And I'm writing this on a pretty good night, so it might sound like a load of shit to me the next time the bottom drops out. But I'm new, and I had to start somehow. Take care of yourselves.
