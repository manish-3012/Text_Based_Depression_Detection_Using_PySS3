I'm strongly considering overdosing again soonThe icing on top was when my mom called me a deadbeat today. I have pretty thin skin when it comes to that sort of stuff, and I've been feeling like a huge burden. I have had my hours cut because of the pandemic, and I'm not making a lot of money. I feel like a financial burden because I am. 

Plus I lost someone very special to me this year. She didn't die, but I don't think we will ever be in contact ever again. I loved her so much, but she doesn't want anything to do with me.

I have ghosted my friends because I felt like they were better off without me in their lives, which was really shitty to do to them. Since I have pushed everyone away, I have almost no one to talk to. I am working from home, and I don't really go out much. I feel very isolated. 

I have a lot of psychiatric medications that I have stopped taking, like Lamictal, Topamax, Abilify, Benztropine Mesylate, and Xanax. I was thinking about consuming all the medication I have stockpiled and maybe that would kill me. This would be my fourth overdose, so chances are I wouldn't die. However, I'm too scared to do any other method.
