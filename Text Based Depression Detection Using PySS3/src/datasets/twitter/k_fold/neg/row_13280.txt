Suicide feeling like a matter of factIâ€™ve dealt with suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember. It was more romanticized, and was used as an escape of thought. The visualization of all things letting go in its purest form. The past 6 months, itâ€™s become more of a simple matter of just not wanting to be alive. No flare, just I want to go blank. The pain has surpassed my passions, or even curiosity. Iâ€™m done, but I canâ€™t be because I donâ€™t want to hurt all the people that love me. I know how tormenting suicide is for the people that stay. As of now Iâ€™m a martyr through living, in a narcissistic way of speaking, and it works for now. Each day I wonder what will be the moment or inspiration for when that isnâ€™t enough. 

I know maybe life circumstances could change, but I donâ€™t really have that fight to get there. Currently, Iâ€™m working towards getting expenses down, so maybe I can hire a specialized psychologist. Iâ€™m kind of in a fight with time though. Iâ€™m starting to feel like suicide is an inevitability. Iâ€™m tired. There are so many wonderful things in this world, and Iâ€™ve already accepted the loss of experiencing them. Once Iâ€™m dead, so I wonâ€™t be able to reflect anyways.

Everyday itâ€™s a low rumble of thought. Not a dramatic feeling. I donâ€™t think anyone I know even suspects, or doesnâ€™t want to see it.
