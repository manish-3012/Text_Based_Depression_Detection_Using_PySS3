I'm so sick of feeling like this. I just want it to end.I can't stop crying. I feel like I'm in so much pain but it's all in my head. Because of me. 

I'm so sick of this. I just want to die. I just want this pain to stop. 

2 years in therapy and I feel worse now than when I started.
I'm on my 5th AD that isn't working.
I have no future.
Nothing to hope for.
I have no friends.
I haven't spoken to my family in 2 months because they don't understand or care.
And I think my psychologist and my psychiatrist have given up because I'm not improving. 
I have nothing left. 

I keep thinking about all the pills I have and wondering how which ones to overdose on to kill myself.
