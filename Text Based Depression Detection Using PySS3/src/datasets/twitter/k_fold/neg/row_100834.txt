Every time I get my period I want to kill myselfI'm already depressed all the time but the time right before my period is so much worse because I can't stop crying and everything just seems so much worse for literally no other reason. I'm legitimately afraid that I'm just gonna end up killing myself one of these months and it's gonna be because my dumb ass doctor didn't refill my prescription for 3 month birth control to stop my period in time
