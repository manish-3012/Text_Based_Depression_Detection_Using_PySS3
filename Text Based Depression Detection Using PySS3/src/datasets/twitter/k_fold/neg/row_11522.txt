isn't it just annoying how everyone wants you to die BUT NOT WHEN ITS ON YOUR OWN TERMSat what age do adults decide their precious babies are disgusting creatures who deserve to be abused? Everyone likes babies and kids but no one literally gives a shit about you after that until you're either committing suicide or live long enough until you need assistance with everything! Everyone makes you think your existence is a burden and you're like ok i agree, let me fix that?? And then they're like noooooo don't commit suicide are you stupid we need you alive? EVERYONE WANTS YOU TO DIE EXCEPT WHEN ITS ON YOUR OWN TERMS!!!! The saddest part is you can go through with it and have a funeral and yea, they'll all grieve (or pretend to), but they will move on, as if nothing ever happened. If i ever did, my only request is at my funeral there be a banner that says "this is your fault!" because anyone who shows up knew it was coming and let it happen. Assholes! I just want to give everyone on this sub a great big hug. I wish we could all get to know each other and support each other. Cry together. That would be worth sticking around for.
