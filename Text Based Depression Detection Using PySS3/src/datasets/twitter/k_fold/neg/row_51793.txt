Anyone who just hasn't put the thought into action due to the fear of immense physical pain while you were thinking of it long enough to make up your mind that its your only destiny.I hate this human survival instinct or I just a coward.I don't care what's behind the death which is just a last place we all go there. Is die by nature painful?if not,how many of people got blessed to die naturally.every nights I pray for die in the sleep.if dying is generally painful why I fear the pain .
