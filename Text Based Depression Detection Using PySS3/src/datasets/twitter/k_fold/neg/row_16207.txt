Why tf is everyone trying to save meI'm so fucking done. I've tried to kill myself 3 times in one month three years ago, haven't attempted it since, even stopped cutting myself for the sake of my s/o who is apparently sooo hurt by me self-harming. Guess what you know nothing about why I did it. You've never had to wake up every fucking day only to fight this urge to destroy yourself in any way possible. Every. Fucking. Day. Since I was 15. I'm 22 now. Have I once had a thought about how great it is that my attempts to kill myself failed? No. I'll tell you what: if i go a week without REGRETTING that I failed it's a fucking blessing. I've always felt like it HAD to be done. Because I never wanted to live only to see my family members dying, all my relationships failing and I always knew that I would never get better. And I lived to see it. And it fucking sucks. Thanks y'all, it's truly a miracle that you've managed to save me, very cool.

I know this sub is supposed to be a way to find help, I don't want it. I just needed to rant. Sorry
