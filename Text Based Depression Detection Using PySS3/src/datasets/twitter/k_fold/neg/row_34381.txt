Sometimes, bad things happen to bad people.Sometimes, people are mean and rude, incredibly hurtful to you (giving you depression and suicidal thoughts). But years later something bad might happen to them, for example their daughter/son might commit suicide due to bullying. That is when they will cry and ask for sympathy. That is when they will try to highlight how terrible the effects of bullying is, when in actual fact, their own actions perpetuate the death of their children. Because they were hurtful to someone else, they have to bear the hurt when the arrow is pointed back at them.
