I feel nothingI just feel numb. I always thought depression would feel sad but i don't really feel anything but still have the urge to cry and scream... I feel no reason to continue living. People tell me that i have things to look forward to in life but i don't think i'll get there...

I'm probably not going to kill myself becouse of my family and my two cats. But who knows, maybe the feelings od worthlessnes will overcome my will to live...
