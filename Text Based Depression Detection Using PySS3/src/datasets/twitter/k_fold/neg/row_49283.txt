not sure what to sayIâ€™m sure this sounds a little absent minded considering my immediate actions should be fairly obvious, but a mutual on my twitter who Iâ€™ve known for a few years now (we talk from time to time - weâ€™re not incredibly close ) has just tweeted heâ€™s â€˜planning on ending it tonight.â€™ 

Iâ€™m not sharing any @â€˜s or anything, but Iâ€™m really not sure what to say to him. Heâ€™s had a suicide attempt before and I just want to tread very lightly before talking to him.
