[21M] Losing HopeRecently graduated from college in June. Became a military officer. Two weeks after graduation, military sends me across the country far away from home. First assignment was a special assignment: not attached to a traditional base, so I mostly work alone. Three weeks into assignment, girlfriend from back home breaks up with me. Completely ghosts me as if I never existed. That was a month ago. Everyday since then has been a struggle. No nearby friends. No nearby family. Work is demanding and stressful. Waking up is hard. Have had suicidal thoughts lately. My few friends and family keep me going, but without them physically here it's rough. Adjusting from full time college student to full time working adult has been hard, and being dumped by the person I thought was my best friend just adds on to that difficulty.. I feel really depressed and down and I'm scared that I'll eventually these suicidal thoughts will get to me.. I'm losing hope.
