i hate/miss you so badlyim 25 years old and i live with my parents. not that thats a horrible thing in and of itself, but my relationship with them has been turbulent since before i can remember. theyve kicked me out as a form of tough love a couple times and brought me back in after being homeless for awhile. im drifting away against my will from my friends and family. i wonder if i ever loved anybody. i used to be best friends with my sister, now every conversation is awkward. im getting more and more awkward in general. its getting harder for me to make eye contact, its as if im staring into the sun. i feel like im playing the sims like my mind is the user and my body is the sim. i visit people just to fill my sims social meter so he doesnt get sad. i listen to music smoke pot and play videogames to keep my sim amused. anything that im passionate with is hard to share with others, like its unrelatable. and i cant share thoughts without feeling like im talking their ear off and theyre just listening out of politeness. i feel the most lonely when im with my friends and family. loneliness comes in waves. im getting colder as im aging, and i dont know how to act in accordance with that. i need love and i need to love. ive had my heart broken too many times and made a fool of myself too many times to try and meet new people. id be whoring out my sim.
