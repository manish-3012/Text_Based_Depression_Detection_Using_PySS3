More and more people commit suicide.I hear almost every day that someone can't handle life anymore. No matter whether it's a rich guy, poor guy, an adult, a high school student. Everyone just decides to not deal with the shit and pull the plug.

Doesn't that mean there's something wrong? There has to be a cause of all this. Suicide became an epidemic.

It can't be helped, cured. Everyone is so unhappy. Maybe it's a sign we really should just give up?
