I blew it. It was all fault and I got no one to blameI could've finished college right now and I blew it. I missed a lot of requirements, failed more than one subject and dropped out a dozen because of my stupid dumb decisions which led to my downfall. I fell in love with the wrong women in my life and when they all left me, I got totally depressed and suicidal. Which led me to drop and fail my subjects. I can't take take it back. I'm afraid I'm gonna be forced to stop or shift course, which is the last thing that I want to do since I've been studying for 4 goddamn years. And because of it, I've been suicidal and nihilistic at the same time, I lost all hope to the point that I'm tired to keep moving and fight back.
