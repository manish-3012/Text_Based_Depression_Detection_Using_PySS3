I just wish life was easy.Iâ€™m not gonna bullshit. I donâ€™t want to die. Iâ€™ve never wanted to die. I just donâ€™t want to be me, I donâ€™t want to be in this situation, living this life, being this miserable all the time. I mean really. Iâ€™m not that badass who conquers and makes his way through life. Iâ€™m a bitch, I just want everything to be easy. Because Iâ€™m not the type to keep persevering. Iâ€™ve fought through the hard times for years, but when does it end? Iâ€™m not gonna pretend thereâ€™s a 0% chance of things improving, but Iâ€™d say itâ€™s a slim chance. And Iâ€™ve never been one to beat the odds.
