13 year old daughter tried to overdoseHi

I am not sure if this is where I post this and if it's the wrong place please redirect me.

12 weeks ago my 13 year old daughter took an overdose, thankfully she told me and I was able to help her before it was too late.

Her reasons for taking this action was severe bullying at school.  

She is seeing a counsellor as often as she needs.  I enrolled her and have been taking her to a weekly program that helps rebuild confidence and self esteem which she graduates from this week.  

I have also taken her to a colour and Bio Rhythm Therapist for healing as I believe we need to heal her mind, spirit and body; we have another two sessions to go.  And I bought her some Angel Oracle cards for positive daily affirmations that she can carry on her whilst at school.

I have been dealing with the school to ensure that she feels safe, and I stay in contact with her by txt during her breaks telling bad jokes, sending funny pictures trying to keep her spirits up etc.

Every afternoon when she comes home we talk about her day, I'm trying to help her de-stress and analyse things that have happened.

I am worried that what I am doing won't be enough, that I won't be able to save her.  I believe we have a close relationship and I knew she was unhappy and that kids where not being very nice, I didn't know how much it was affecting her because at home she was still cheeky and fun loving but she didn't want to go anywhere unless she was with family.

We are also talking about her going to live with her Grandparents so she can attend a different high school, although I would hate that as I'd miss her like crazy.

At her current school the number of kids that are self harming is astronomical but I have learned that a number of the high schools in my country are experiencing this issue and as a Mother that is extremely frightening.

If you can think of anything else I can do for her I would be extremely grateful.
