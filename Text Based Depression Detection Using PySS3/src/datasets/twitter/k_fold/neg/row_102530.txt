dismissed from college. nothing else for meI could wait a year and attempt to re-enroll but that would mean living at home where i have no friends, no car, and an inability to catch the bus on time. no freedom and my mom yelling at me to do work all the time. there was a boy i had just met that i really liked. thats over too probably. if i stay out for a year i'll be too embarrassed to talk to any of my friends there. i won't be able to go to family things because i don't want to hear their opinions. i jumped in front of a car today but it stopped. 
i'm only living for other people at this point and it's excruciatingly awful
