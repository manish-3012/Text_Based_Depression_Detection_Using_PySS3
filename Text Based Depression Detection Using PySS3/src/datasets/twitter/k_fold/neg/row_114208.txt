Interesting info I found about statistics on suicide intentScrolled through a website to get more knowledge about my suicide method and found some interesting facts:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In a study done in Oxford UK7, 864 people that attempted suicide (and survived) were asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 30, how intent they were on killing themselves (where 30 was totally intent, and 1 was hardly at all). The results are below:   
&gt;  
&gt;Rating of suicidal intent, % of respondents  
&gt;  
&gt;Low (0-6), 36.9%  
&gt;  
&gt;Moderate (7-12), 33.9%  
&gt;  
&gt;High (13-20), 25.0%  
&gt;  
&gt;Very High (21+), 4.2%  
&gt;  
&gt; The message here is that **two thirds** of people that try to kill themselves are not *that intent* on succeeding. Maybe there's a part of them that wanted to end it, and a part didn't, and due to some event that tipped them over the edge, they tried to commit suicide.
