I want to kill myselfHow do I do it?

I feel so numb from all the """pain"""

Everyday is just a cycle of getting depressed and feeling """okay"""

Okay isn't even okay, it's just temporary relief

I really want to kill myself but I still don't have the courage hahaha

I really don't want to live anymore

I'm going to graduate college soon, yet I still suck at my degree. Yet I have high grades, and most likely be graduating with Latin honors.

We're not rich, my parents depend on me, and I'm afraid of disappointing them. I want to help them have a good life, but I feel like I can't give them that.

I have a boyfriend. He's the best. I love him so much, and he loves me too. I'm afraid that I also won't be able to provide a great future for our family. I really want them to be happy. Unlike what my family goes through now.

I don't think I have friends. I feel left out. I feel like they're ignoring me. I feel sad. I feel so alone.

I don't know. I don't know what to do. I don't even know why I posted this. I'm sorry. I'm scared. I feel lost.
