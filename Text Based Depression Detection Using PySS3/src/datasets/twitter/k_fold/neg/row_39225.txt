Only a matter of timeWhat a neglectful bitch i am. My kid is sick. My cat is sick. My dad is sick. And i dont care. I have not cared for them in months. I just keep wanting to kill myself. I have to do it soon because i am being found out. I am a fraud. No one has seen me since i got out of the psych ward for the second time. My hair is greasy. I dont eat or hrush my teeth and my clothes are falling off me. I look like a homeless person and i will be one soon. I have to take my life. I keep putting it off. Well its time. Either i sit here and do nothing like i have been for months or i die a slow and painful death loke i deserve. I cant take my son to a dr. I look like shit. I had a tooth fall out a couple of days ago. The cops were here yesterday for my schizo brother and i did nothing. I ignore everyone. Its only a matter of time.
