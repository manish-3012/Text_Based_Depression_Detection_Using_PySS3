Why be aliveIm 16 years old. Just turned 16 less then a month ago. I never thought i would feel sucidal but yet here i am , i feel sucidal. I just broke up with my gf of one year and 4 months because she was cheating. But thats not the main reason of why i feel like this. Its only adding on to it. The main reason is just i feel this sadness. I dont look at the world the same anymore. I used to look at the world so positively but now i just see sadness. I sometimes see dark figures at night and wonder if they are going to kill me and i get mad because if they are then just do it. Why was i born ? Why do exist ? Why does anyone exist actually? No one would care if i die. So i should just end it.
