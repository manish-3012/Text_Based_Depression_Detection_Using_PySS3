Back here again, y'all helped me before so...Once again, my depression has kicked back in full swing, and once again, I feel like ending it. I don't have any friends to talk to, my parents no longer listen to me, so y'all are the best I've got. I can't seem to force myself to go on. I can't even do the one thing I love anymore (lifting) because of a severe back injury. I just feel unmotivated to keep doing things I hate for the sake of my parents, and I can't do anything about it because my family will disown me and I will have no more support. I just don't know what to do anymore...
