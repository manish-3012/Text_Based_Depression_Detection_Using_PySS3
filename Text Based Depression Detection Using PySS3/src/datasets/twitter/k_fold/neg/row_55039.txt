Mind, of destructive taste.Into the flood again, same old trip it was back then. So I made a big mistake, try to see it once my way.

I feel so lost in the dark. I can't deal with the withdrawals. I just spent the last few hours  sweating,  in extreme nausea, every single bone in my body aching, my pupils dilated, constantly agitated and not being able to sleep. The painkillers wear off eventually, and I dread that moment. 
I'm drugged out of my mind every single day. It's the only thing I can do to help me get through work and school. 

I'm back to square one. Nothing makes me happy, sad, annoyed, angry, or anything anymore. Food is tasteless, love is foreign, nothing interests me anymore. I just want to feel something. Anything. Anything other than the constant  craving for another hit. 

I'll never know how far to go, to reach the place. Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home? Have I gone?
