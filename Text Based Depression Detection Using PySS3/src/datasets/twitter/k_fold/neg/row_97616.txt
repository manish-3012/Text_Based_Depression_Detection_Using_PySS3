Tomorrow is the dayI can't do this anymore. 22 years is enough. I'm a burden on everyone. I've been working for three years at a job I've come to despise. This past year has been awful there it's been a revolving door of coworkers and Im starting to realize why they keep leaving. The workload is too much for me. I don't have any degrees to get a decent job somewhere else. I don't have my driver's license cause cars terrify me so I bike everywhere. I haven't showed up to work since giving notice the other day so they probably don't want me back anyway.

I live with my parents. I don't help out enough. They were mad that I didn't go into work today. I was having a panic attack so I wasn't able to. I got halfway there then turned around and went back home. They've threatened to kick me out for not going into work. I barely have any money to my name on top of some bills due later this month. I have no where to go if I do get kicked out. 

I'm not able to live up to societies standards. Depression and anxiety are killing me. Life is what's killing me. I hate the fact that I'm alive. I picked up biking in hopes I get hit by a car or something. 

I bought a gun today and I'm picking up some ammo tomorrow morning. I'm gonna kill myself before my scheduled work time It's either that or I get kicked out within the next X days and do it anyway. I might as well get it over with.
