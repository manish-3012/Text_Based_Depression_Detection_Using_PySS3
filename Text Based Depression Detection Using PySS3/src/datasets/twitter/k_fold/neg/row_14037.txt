It's really hard to find the energy to liveIt hurts so bad. I don't have anyone I can trust, to go to for support. I don't have anything that interests me anymore. I don't have any dreams or ambitions. I don't know what I want. I wake up and have to drag myself out of my bed and too school, struggling to keep up because I have awful grades from not being able to focus. Then I go home and keep myself in my room, silently fighting my suicidal thoughts until I go to bed. I don't feel like it's worth it. I don't want to live anymore. I want it to be over.
