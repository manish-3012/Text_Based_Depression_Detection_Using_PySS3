Its getting too commonIt seems like every single day of my life I'm forced with looking for something to look forward to. Nothing seems fun anymore. What do i do for fun? I watch gamers on twitch because even though videogames arent fun for me anymore, it's nice to watch someone having fun. But here I am and the suicidal thoughts are becoming so common. Im afraid im going to have to deal with my anxiety for situations I cant handle and im at the point where I have extremely important tests coming up and i have no motivation to live or study and I just need help because it feels like its been going on for so long that my friends dont take it seriously anymore.
