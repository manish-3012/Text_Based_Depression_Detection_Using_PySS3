Iâ€™m 21. Stuck living with parents. Hate my home environment. My mom is emotionally abusive i donâ€™t know what to do. I just wanna do drugs and die.Iâ€™m so tired of living here. Iâ€™ll be having a good time with friends outside of my home environment. Then Iâ€™m forced to come back here and walk on eggshells all day long. I canâ€™t take this anymore. But I canâ€™t financially support myself either. I feel so hopeless. I might as well relapse. Talking about all of this will not change my circumstances. But I have no power to change the circumstances themselves either. I want to fucking die.
