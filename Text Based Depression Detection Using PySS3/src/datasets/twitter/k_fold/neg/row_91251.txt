I thought i was doing good, but sudden illness changed thingsI didn't think about suicide for quite some time now, becouse i knew i would have to do it myself in a drastic way. I was completly healthy, no hope for just a little push on my body being enough to cause serious harm. Until now...

Today i got diagnosed with a sickness which by itself causes some little damage to liver but combined with alcohol and high fat diet can be quite dangerous. I already fucked up without being aware of it- last few weeks i had a lot of reasons to drink (birthday, moving, festival,...)  so i did. According to my doctor, my liver seems already pretty bad and it brings me to dark thoughts.

Right now, i have the ultimate chance to commit suicide (kinda) by just drinking and ignoring the diet im supposed to be on. It wont be super fast and it certainly wont be pleasant... But the possibility is hard to resisnt once it's finally here. Especially since im moving to campus where people drink like all the time. I wont be the bad guy as long as nobody who knows about my diagnosis sees me drink, it will all seem like a bad luck. It feel like the universe is playing with me, observing if i take the chance it has given me and i honestly don't think i can refuse.
