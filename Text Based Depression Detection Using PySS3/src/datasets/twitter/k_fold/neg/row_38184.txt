Not sure where to lookIâ€™m only 16 but I have been through hell in terms of depression. Iâ€™m a junior now and i just donâ€™t care where I end up. I looked at some colleges today and I donâ€™t care because I donâ€™t think I will make it passed high school alive. Itâ€™s been a few months since my last attempt and I canâ€™t plan another one cause I have no good method. Iâ€™m lonely, I hate myself, I donâ€™t love anyone, no one loves me and I feel useless. I know when I wake up i will get no comments because all my life it seems no one cares about me so seems like Iâ€™m going out alone.
