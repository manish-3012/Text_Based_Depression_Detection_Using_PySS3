I set a suicide dateThe date is September 27th, 2020, my 21st birthday. Iâ€™m not sure why I picked a date thatâ€™s so far away, maybe itâ€™s because deep down Iâ€™m still holding on to that small glimmer of hope that things might change for the better. Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m going to be doing in the meantime, all I know is that if my situation is no different by then, Iâ€™m going to go through with it. Iâ€™m tearing up as I type this because I really donâ€™t want to die, but the pain is becoming too much. I really hope this doesnâ€™t come of as attention seeking, I just need to get this off my chest and this is the only place where I feel comfortable doing so.
