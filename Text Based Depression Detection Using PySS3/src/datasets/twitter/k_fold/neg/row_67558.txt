Today's the day, soon I can find peace.This is happening a bit earlier than I anticipated but I feel myself getting sicker. To those who are unaware, I was recently diagnosed with bone marrow cancer and opted against treatment by bailing appointments because I wanted to die a long time ago.

I worked as long as I could doing my day today because I love my job and I would honestly do it for free if I was able to. Now I feel awful and I know sooner or later I'm going to start slipping.

I hate this is happening now, I wish I had more time. But I do want to thank people who talked to me as a person. You guys were the only people who knew besides a few co-workers. Everyone's going to find out soon when I'm gone.

After this, I want to post once more to the other sub just to give an update to the few who cared. Then it should be about time to frive to my vacation where I'm going to enjoy my last day alive.
