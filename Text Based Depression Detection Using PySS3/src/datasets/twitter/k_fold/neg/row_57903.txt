I've just about had itI can't live anymore. I just can't. It hurts. My friends have avoided me for days. I've stopped talking to my family. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is my brother. How could I abandon him? How would my parents tell him that I'm no longer alive, that I killed myself? It just hurts to think about. 

I've locked myself in my room for the past few days. I lost my appetite. All I do is cry. I cry all day like a stupid, pathetic brat. I feel as if I am nothing. I could disappear and no one would bat an eye. There is no purpose in life. I'm just a disappointment. A failure.

I'm sorry I couldn't save you Rose. It was a pathetic attempt at trying to stop you. Maybe I will talk to you soon. I'm sorry, I really am.

Perhaps living is just one big nightmare, and death is how we finally wake up.
