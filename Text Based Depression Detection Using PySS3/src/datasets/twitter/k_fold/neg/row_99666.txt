Considering suicide again (after attempt)I survived a suicide attempt in January and even though I've been taken off the suicide watch list and I'm still in counselling, I still don't feel much better.

My life has gotten a little better but I still keep finding myself considering suicide again most days. I just feel that, now that I've survived one attempt and I'm still messed up, why shouldn't I finish the job?
