I can't find a reason to keep going.I don't really have much of a story, I'm a highschool dropout that lives with her parents, my 19th birthday is tomorrow, I've had problems with my mental health for way too long now, I'm schizoaffective and I've had a really hard time coming to terms with it. The meds don't really help the hallucinations, and not many of the people I'm close with know this about me. They all think I'm "just" depressed or going through a rough patch. Unless the rough patch is my entire life-span thus far, then no, it's not just one rough patch. I keep pushing my friends away and digging myself into a deeper hole with each passing day. I'm addicted to videogames, the mmorpg I play is basically my life at this point. My ex faked a suicide attempt and has been throwing me under the bus since, I just don't know when this is gonna end. I'm such a fucking manipulative piece of trash and I absolutely hate it. What is the point, honestly.
