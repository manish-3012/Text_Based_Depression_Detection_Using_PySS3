Why donâ€™t people sell all their things and move to foreign countries before killing themselves?Iâ€™m not a suicidal person, and I want to understand the mindset of those who are. 
With literally nothing to lose, why not take a gigantic risk. If it works out, woohoo. If it doesnâ€™t, youâ€™re just gonna be right back where you started, since all your material goods are meaningless post death.
