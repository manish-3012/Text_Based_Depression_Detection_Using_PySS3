I tried for 27 yearsI was never a bad person, but i always picked up on people not liking me. I have always thought it's okay it is not that bad. But now i have seen it's full impact on my career, my relationship and everything. When i was young i thought i will at least find one person but that will never happen... Unsuccessful career has lead my parents to resent me and it breaks my heart seeing it in their eyes even though they don't say anything. Everyone gets tired of me in few hours of meeting me and i can't live up to their expectations. Being insignificant hurts and nothing to look forward to except the same hurting getting worse through time made me decide to end it after all. I have thought about it for two years now and this seems like a good time. I have put my affairs in order, i will quit my job happily in a few hours and go out quick.
