No friends, no family, no gf, no life, suicidal thoughtsLiving just seems like such a chore most of the time. I wish I was never born. All I do is cause problems everywhere I go and ruin everything I touch. I have general/social anxiety, depression, DPDR, and OCD. I have severe trust issues and dependency issues and low self esteem. I have maybe one person that I would consider a true friend, but I hardly get to see her. A lot of my family are dead or I never see them. The family I do have are narcissists and I hate them besides my uncle and aunt. My mom is an abusive narcissist. Every relationship I get into, the person seems to be toxic. I also will get into relationships just because I crave attention and need to depend on others for my happiness. I hate myself, I am hideous. I have no life and mostly just sit on the Internet. I get suicidal thoughts all the time. The only reason I haven't done it is because I don't want to hurt family and I am terrified of death.
