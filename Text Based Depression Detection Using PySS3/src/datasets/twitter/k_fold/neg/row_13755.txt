16, transgender, ruining my lifeI have been out as a transgender man for two years and I am thoroughly convinced it isn't getting better. 

My parents have decided to laugh in my face at my requests to legally transition and medically transition. My extended family will not attend my graduation if they write my chosen name on my diploma. 

Everything I've had to do, I've done myself. I was attacked last week. Called a faggot, punched, and chucked to the ground. I just wanted to use the fucking bathroom.

I can't do this anymore. How stereotypical of me to say, right? But truly, it's gut wrenching. I want to believe God will take me. I still believe in him. But I do believe he has abandoned me. I'm losing control and I have no future left. Every time I think people are starting to come around I'm knocked down a peg.

The thing is, maybe, if I survived, people would take me seriously. It's a win\-win. My parents realize this isn't a game and I have a fun little anecdote for a TedTalk or some shit. But this world is brutal for people like me. I signed my death warrant the second I came out to my class. No matter what I do, it catches up to me. Everybody realizes I have a vagina at the end of the day. Back to square one. I'm ready to say goodbye.
