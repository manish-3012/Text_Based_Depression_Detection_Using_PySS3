Im a disasterIm sorry for the whining in advance, Im 17, i like in a small two bedroom run down trailer with two racist parents who hate me, im fat because when i get mad i cannot stop eating, i get punched, bullied in school, i get sent dick pics on every signle fucking social network being called gay, i got a job to pay for home school, our dsl internet lines break and haven't been fixed for 1.5 years, being 17 i got enough money to pay for sattelite internet, i rush to login and i have to restart school... my parents call me a dumbass, tell me everything i own or will on belongs to them and they are selling my stuff right now.



My parents hate me, im 17 and have to restart school so no college will ever take me, i own nothing and i get bullied everyday. I just don't know what else to do i will not go back to being beaten black and blue everyday, i won't let them win and with no career options ahead of me i have nothing to lose. I feel like im thinking clearly for the first time in my life.
