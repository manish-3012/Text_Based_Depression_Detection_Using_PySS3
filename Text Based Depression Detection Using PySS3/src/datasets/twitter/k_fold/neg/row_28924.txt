Could these situations happen? I can't stop worrying about it.This relates to my post a few days ago. A month and a half ago I pleasured myself to a girl on omegle (probably a gif I later realized) with my face in view the whole time, plus my furniture is fairly unique so itd be recognized.  I'm 15.

I keep worrying these situations might happen:

1. Someone takes the video or a screencap and either sends it to everyone, or tags a bunch of people in it on facebook.

2. The video is floating all around sketchy porn sites on the internet and 4chan. (probably more realistic)

Are these situations probable? How do I get it off my mind? I've tried but nothing's helped. Its constantly on my mind that this is going to happen.
