I am a mistakeI shouldnâ€™t have probably been born and being and Indian male is all about listening to your mom my entire life is dictated by them all they care is for themselves lately I started to feel like a robot with no emotions or feelings and what ended it more was when my mothers uttered I love that persons daughter more than you something inside just broke permanently I was never loved as a kid no friends no one and my mother just said that for no reason or whatsoever she says I donâ€™t even know why I have you I could probably adopt a kid and let you be. The reason I keep saying mom is because havenâ€™t had a father since 3rd grade.
