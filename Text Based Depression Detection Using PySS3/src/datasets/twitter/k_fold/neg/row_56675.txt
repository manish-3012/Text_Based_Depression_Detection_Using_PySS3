Two tours in combat and Iâ€™m so done100% rated disabled combat veteran here with two tours under my belt.(Bosnia &amp; Iraq). While in Bosnia I was exposed to shit ton of mass grave sites and in Iraq I was in a convoy that was blown to smithereens by an IED. I watched several people take their last breath on that one and had their blood on me. Iâ€™m constantly angry, depressed and chase people away from me including my girlfriend of five years who just left me because Iâ€™m a train wreck. Iâ€™ve tried all of the VA meds and therapy and it hasnâ€™t done shit for me. So itâ€™s been decided. Iâ€™m slowly killing myself by not taking care of myself. I smoke like a train, do cocaine, drink, eat shitty greasy food and I donâ€™t care anymore. I pray that I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow. My parents are both still around so I canâ€™t shoot myself in the mouth yet. Once theyâ€™re gone and if Iâ€™m not dead by heart attack, Iâ€™m taking myself to my old Army unit and blowing my brains out in front of the battalion headquarters. They used me up and spit me out for society to deal with, they can have me back and clean up my mess off of their precious fucking sign. Iâ€™m tired of carrying the pain of watching people die right in-front me and Iâ€™m sooo tired of the disabled veteran persona.
