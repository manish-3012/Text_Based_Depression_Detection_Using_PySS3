Just please, someone help me find a solution, I'm begging you.I've been in therapy for over 5 years, I've been twice in a psych ward, I'm taking 3 different kinds of pills, I've tried countless other pills, I've tried working out more than a few times in my life, including the past month and it only makes things worse. 
I've tried looking for new hobbies, I've been an actor for 2 years, I've painted, I've built kit models, I animated, I went out, I tried to meet new people. 

Nothing helps me, I don't want to do this to my parents, I don't want to go back to a psych ward, but I will kill myself if I have to.

I've had nothing but bad experiences in my life, any small sign of friendship was instantly shattered, I've never been in a relationship, and I'm pretty much traumatized from females yet I feel the need for one. 

Nothing made me happier than playing videogames, but it appears my joy of it is slowly fading along with my bank account while spending all my money trying to find a satisfying game.

I don't want to kill myself but it seems to be the only solution.
