I wrote a note.Tonight after many years of contemplating, I wrote a note. It grew to be six pages long before I tore it all up and started crying. I wrote a second note that was only a few sentences long and I did the same. I feel like my entire life is an enormous lost cause but Iâ€™m a coward.

My family is pretty fucked up and Iâ€™m positive none of them would miss me. My mother thought it would be a great life experience for me to be homeless when my father kicked me out.

I donâ€™t have any real friends. I lost the ones I did have back in high school because they thought I was a devil worshipper.

My career is pretty much in the shitter. My dreams never really mattered to begin with.

Thereâ€™s a lot more going on than Iâ€™m capable of putting into words right now, but I just donâ€™t see the point in carrying on anymore. I feel like nowâ€™s the time to finally end it.
