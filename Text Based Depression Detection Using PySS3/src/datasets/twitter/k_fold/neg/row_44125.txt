Need someone to talk to right nowjust a lot of thoughts are swarming my mind now , Iâ€™m trying to take my mind off of it but I canâ€™t . The person who I call â€œ mom â€œ keeps threatening me mentally saying that I cannot rest even though itâ€™s the holidays , keep away my items if I donâ€™t do what she says and keeps acting as if I didnâ€™t do well which I did . I just want to end all of this and I want to be alone but I canâ€™t . I have friends and family but none of them know about my suicidal thoughts and I have no one to vent to . It just hurts and I canâ€™t stop thinking about it . I need and want counselling but I fear that people around me will judge and stop me from getting the help I want . Iâ€™ve been bottling up my feelings since my thoughts started 4 years ago . I just want help .
