No Suicide plans, but just want it to endEven though I'm not planning to kill myself, that idea seems so desirable right now. 

The constant health problems, obsessions about contamination and illness, regrets about the past ten years, worrying about the future--I'm so exhausted by all of it.

I really feel like I've looked deep inside at myself and broadly at my life, and I've had a lot of good experiences, not just bad. But it's I feel like I've learned everything I can and tried everything and things just don't improve. I would feel totally fine and at peace to just end it.
