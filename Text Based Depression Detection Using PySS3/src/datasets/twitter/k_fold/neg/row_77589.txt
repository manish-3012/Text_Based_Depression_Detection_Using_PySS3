How I feelI write to the people of reddit hoping to figure somethings out. I honestly think about dying at least twice a day. Death to me seems so peaceful and the easiest way out of things. At the moment I feel like I haven't accomplished much with my life I'm 20 years old with no job and no future. I was kicked out of college because I was going through some emotional issues and was therefore unable to perform. I honestly can't begin to fathom how to get my life together at the moment. The sadness of my reality and my failures plague my thoughts every single and I just keep thinking to my self what a piece of shit I'am. I guess I got hit by the "real world" too fast, I just can't seem to find a way to get my life together.
