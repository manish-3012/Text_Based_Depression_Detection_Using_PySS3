I've told myself every year for the past 4, that I'm going to kill myself on my birthdayI never followed through because I still had a small amount of hope that I wouldn't always feel like this, and I never stopped trying to better myself. Unfortunately, my birthdays in less than a month and I'm drained of all hope, I've been defeated. I know the time and place it's happening at, I spent 18 days writing a letter to my family and I finished it this morning. I'd like to share my letter with you all before I go, I think I'll post it on my birthday.
