I think I nearly overdosed today, and it's the best feeling I've had in a long time.Such shallow breaths when I finally regained consciousness.  I'd love to go this way.  I used to worry about the chance of failing - charcoal and dead organs, but the comfort and liquidity seems a nice way to punctuate this life.  I wish I could take enough time off from my medication that I could be sure of death.
