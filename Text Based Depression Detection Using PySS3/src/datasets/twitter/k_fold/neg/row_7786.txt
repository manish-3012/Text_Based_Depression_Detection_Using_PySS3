[I'm not killing myself anytime soon but] I think 24 years in this world has been more than enough to have experienced all its beauty.I don't have anything to expect to make me feel like I need another 24. I see the patterns in things after a while and they get boring really fast. That said I do intend to outlive my parents. To do less than that would be irresponsible. But I'm really bored out of my skulls. Why do the same things have to happen again and again and again?
