I tried, I tried, and it's too late to be trying anymore.I have to give my A level exams in a few days. Over the previous months I've been going through mental trauma that my parents have failed to understand. My elder brother is an abusive alcoholic who got separated from his wife and child and is now spoiling our home. I haven't been able to study entirely because of his madness. Parents say I should lock myself in my room and focus but that doesn't help knowing he's fucking things up in the house. Parents can't kick him out because they owe him money for paying bills and expenses. He ruined his life and now he's set at ruining my life because he can't see me studying and becoming better than him. I hoped I could study and get the grades so I could move and study in Germany. But I guess. Its too late for anything. The damage is done. I can't find help or get help.
