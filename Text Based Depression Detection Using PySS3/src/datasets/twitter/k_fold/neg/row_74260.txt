I'm so fucking tired of humanityPeople fucking suck and I just don't want any part in this bullshit. The police fucked up an old friend of mine really badly (for doing NOTHING WRONG, they told him to walk away, he started slowly backing away and they STILL SHOT HIM) and it's going to take him months and thousands of dollars before he's ok again, I just want to send him all of my savings and off myself. I'm ashamed that I'm even the same species as those monsters and I don't know what to do. I'm not even scared, just angry. (This is 100% hypothetical and I have zero plans of actually doing it but) I just want to run into a crowd of police with a suicide vest and take out as many as I can along with myself. Fuck humanity, we're a lost cause and we'll never get over this bigoted bullshit just like we've been doing for thousands of years. I just don't see a reason to keep going, everything sucks and it just keeps getting worse.
