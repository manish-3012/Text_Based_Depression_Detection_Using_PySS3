wanna hear something?for those who reading, i tell you today probably one of my last days here.
i've been throughout so many lies, can't count it. the due date is coming. i can't stop it. help won't come i guess.
i think it's pretty much this, i live, eat, play, sleep and i don't know, contemplating? nah, i'm just depressed.
if someone thinks that i did this because i hate the world, people around me, and anything that i have, they are wrong, very wrong.
i was happy, for the time i lived up to this moment. i may complain about this and that, but truly, i thankful for this chance.
never in my life i despise my parents, brothers, my whole family. i love you guys. but i guess, love wasn't enough.
never thought i would cry while writing this note. i thought i'm strong, but i'm the weakest, biggest coward in the world.
i can't, i just, can't. i dunno. it's hard to explain. it's my fault of course not even trying to explain but i already give my best. this is my best.
yeah i know it's pathetic. i won't deny anything about that.
i born timid, and i guess i'll die timid too.

if you see that what i write looked too cryptic, i don't blame you. i never was a good one at telling what i had in mind.
and this was a writing i made for myself, to try to understand what's wrong with me. but yeah, i guess i sucked.

and sorry for the grammar and low caps, too lazy to care about that.
