I want to dieI'm so sick of my life. I hate everything about it and it's been one big embarrassment. I wish I was man enough to kill myself.

I'm going nowhere and I'll be a nobody. I can't stand living with my fucked up family any more. 

I can't connect with anyone and haven't for 6 or so years now. All contact I have is so awkward and disconnected. I've been isolated this long.

Above all, I just want to be more than fucking average. I don't want to be this puny person who goes into the factory of life. I want to do something and change something, but I wasn't born with the capability of doing so like other greats: Mandelbrot, Newton, Godel, Bach, Fermat, etc etc etc

Life is so pointless.
