It's going to fucking happen. Not today. Not tomorrow. But it willI'm having a really bad episode? I guess. Will delete this in the morning, maybe. I just need to remind myself that it's real. 

My "girlfriend" might be mentally abusing me but I can't tell. Or maybe I'm the bad person.

I want to drink but I can't. I have shit to do tomorrow.


Fuck everything



I'm so fucking alone


Edit: Thank you /u/Jag_lee and /u/bloodywarz

I haven't had a lot of great human contact recently. Your interest honestly helps. I can't talk to my friends (if I have any left, I'm not sure) or family about this shit at all


Edit2: I'm need to leave this thread undeleted and open on my computer so I can see it in the morning. I need to know this is real
