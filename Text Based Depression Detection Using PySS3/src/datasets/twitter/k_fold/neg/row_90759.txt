My letter is written out..itâ€™s to my family, to my friends, to my dog, and to the man who I thought was my forever. Iâ€™ve given up and Iâ€™m done. I tried and tried to be a good person, but itâ€™s just ever good enough. Itâ€™s typed up but Iâ€™m not sure when I will send it. 

To my parents: Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t make you proud or the daughter you wanted me to be. I always wanted to make sure you guys were okay but I know I can never be that person. 

To my friends: Iâ€™m sorry I wasnâ€™t always fun to be around. I know I just didnâ€™t have the best social skills. 

To my sweet dog: I love you. Youâ€™re the best first dog anyone can ask for. I know you will be well taken cared of when Iâ€™m gone. 

To Alex: I love you x a million. You know how I feel and how I will always feel. I wanted to be by your side and help you achieve those goals. I wish you would have just let me. I wanted to be your wife and the best wife anyone could ask for. I wanted to have a big family and share those milestones that our children would have. I wanted to give you the world, I just wish you wanted the same for me. I love you, I always will. 

Iâ€™m done. Goodbye.
