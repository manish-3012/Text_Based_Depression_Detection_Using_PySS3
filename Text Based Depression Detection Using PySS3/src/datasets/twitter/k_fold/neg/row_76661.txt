what's the point if i can't relate to anyone?I don't agree with mostly anyone at any given subject, be it religion or philosophy. I hate people, they seem to be all ignorant and believe in any kind of shit they hear on tv or others types of media. You may think I'm selfish for thinking like this, like if I were better than anyone. I'm not. I hate humanity, I am very often left alone in conversations because I can't seem to agree with anyone. This shit we call life is so fucking complex I would rather die, so there would be no problems to be solved. Why do we humans need to seek an answer for everything?
