Being told not to kill myself by people who don't even know me. How bad does it have to get before people say, fair enough just do it?Some background about me; 23 m from New Zealand, been suicidal on and off since I was 10 which was my first (admittedly shit) attempt at suicide. Since then they've been scattered throughout my life, I've ended up in hospital multiple times after attempts, and had overdoses as common as weekends. 

It sounds like such a stupid reason, but the human touch/connection is so important, like there's billions of people in the world you could get a hug and conversation from anyone, but I feel so isolated. 

I know this subreddit is about preventing suicide, but not everyone has the same opportunities, upbringing and resources to make their life better. Suicide is the final solution, but sometimes you've used up all the other options you have. What is the point of waking up everyday wondering how you're going to do it this time, having to take days off work because you're not in the right state of mind. Whats the point in going to sleep and waking up with nightmares of still being alive?
