I think about suicide every now and then, and even kinda have it worked out.For the last few days I've been thinking about suicide and how i might do it if it comes to that. I would wake up at like 5:00am, write a note for my family, then go to a parking garage nearby. I would go to the top, and just after dawn, I say my prayers, and step off the edge. But i don't think i could actually do it. I'm kinda thinking I've been thinking about/liking the idea of it more than anything, but mostly problems with my sexuality has kind of brought me to this point of confusion and anger and sadness. I've never been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disordor or schizophrenia(which i fear i may have((or ocd)) so i just don't know.
