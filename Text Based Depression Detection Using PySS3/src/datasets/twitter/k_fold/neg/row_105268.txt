I embrace death.Haven't been here in a while. Suppose me coming back is a good sign, eh? Well. I don't want to kill myself, I don't necessarily *want* to die either. It wouldn't be fair for me to put everyone around me in that position. Is that fair on me though? No. Why should I care. I do though. 

For death to come onto me? Well that's a different story entirely isn't it. 

Thanks for reading.
