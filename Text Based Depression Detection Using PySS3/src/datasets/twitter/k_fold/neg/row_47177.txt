I almost went too far, should I have kept going?Slightly graphic warning.
Iâ€™m a cutter, for several years now. I am working on better coping mechanisms, but cutting is the most effective. Tonight was no different. I used a belt to cut off the circulation, and waited. After a couple minutes, my hand was a different colour, and it started to tingle. I cut into my forearm, I left the belt on. After a couple more minutes, my hand was full of pins and needles, it was throbbing, and even my minor cuts were flowing dark blood. I panicked and removed the belt. I still feel so miserable though. I almost want to do it again and forget everything.
