Goodbye :")
I finally got the courage today. I will no longer be a burden anymore. I'll no longer have to live my life like a shut-in good for nothing lazyass anymore. I'm going to take a final walk out now and after I come home I'll kill myself. I'm sorry I can't continue anymore . Finally I'll be able to meet my eternal summer. 

Thank you all for being with me . My journey ends here. I hope y'all do better.
