I want to leave something behind.I'm 17. I love baking pastries. I love doing live theater. I love my cats: Parker, a beautiful calico kitty with a half face, she drools when she's happy. Her brother Cloud, my sweet baby, a flamepoint siamese who is white with a pink nose and blue eyes. He loves chewing on hair. Percy, our big boy, who is a siamese. He loves dog food. Little Gal, our tiny ruler. She is a tabby and likes to steal food. I love my sister, even though she is busy a lot and can't talk. I love my 15 year old brother, even though we're not on good terms and don't really talk to each other despite living together. I love my mama. She loves me. I don't know what has been happening recently, we've been drifting and fighting a lot. I love her. I only have one friend, Madi. She is amazing. Without her I would sit alone every day and do nothing, I'm so grateful for her. I'm also so tired. I can't do this anymore. I wrote this to leave something of me behind. Thanks for listening.
