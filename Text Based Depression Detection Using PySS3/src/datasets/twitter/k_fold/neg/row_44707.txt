I'm losing all hope.Four months ago me and my fiancee split up because she thought I had cheated. I never really had a great life being bullied etc. I've never really had any friends, still don't most of my life I've been alone had to fight my own battles, pull myself through this life. and once again I find myself losing hope will I be forever alone.

Since me and my ex split up I've tried to stay positive and keep moving forward with my life. I've been out partying more or less every weekend. but she haunts me I'm always thinking about her I was under the impression we'd be together forever.  No matter how much I try to forget to move on I feel like I'm trapped in a box never going anywhere. 

I'm 19 years old and once again I'm struggling to see what the point is in carrying on. On Christmas day I was stood on a bridge ready to kill myself and I feel like I'm going to end up there again. To make matters worse I have her wedding dress. I haven't looked at it yet and I also have her engagement ring. I have no idea how I'll sell them.

I keep fighting so hard but the knock-backs I've had throughout my life I just feel like I'll never truly be happy.
