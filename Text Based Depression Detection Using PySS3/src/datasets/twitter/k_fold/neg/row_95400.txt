I just want the pain to end.I am twenty two years old. I never graduated high school. When I was sixteen my mother left the trailer we were living in while I was staying at a friends house and didn't bother to tell me. That friends mother took me in and exposed me to oxys. I became addicted and lost any motivation to do anything. Became clean a few years later. I now live with three people who don't give two fucks about me at best and are emotionally abusive at worst. One of them recently introduced me to kratom. I started using it daily to cope with my anxiety, depression, and stressful telemarketing job. Now I am addicted to that. I am begging to preform poorly at work  and don't know what i will  do if I get fired. I hate every moment of my life and just want it to end. I have to feel guilty about wanting to kill myself because I have two sisters that love me but one lives across the country and the other is too caught up in her normal life so we don't see each other often. I have no skills or motivation to get my ged. Every morning I wake up is a curse. I am scared and alone.
