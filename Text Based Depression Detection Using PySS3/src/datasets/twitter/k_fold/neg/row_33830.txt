I'm coming to the end of how much I can cope.Everyday is a struggle and I'm seriously thinking about, if not planning to end it all I don't know what to do. I guess i'm just venting right now, I know it wont change much. I hope some how that I can get rid of this pain, I don't even care how anymore. Drugs, Alcohol, self-harm, I've run out of options. I can't keep myself safe for much longer.
