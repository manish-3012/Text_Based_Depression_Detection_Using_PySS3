I've got a million problems and possibly dying from coronavirus is only one of themI'm only thirty. I'm tired. I thought this month it might get better, and I dared to hope. Then, the virus came. I'm almost in the red zone, full of people who have it, possibly in my town too since they are lazy with testing. I had many hospital visits planned for me and my mother. She is a wreck and I'm doing everything for her even though I'm sick too and my sight is getting worse and worse. I have no job and receive no help, I have to pay even going to the hospital for a check. I thought with the paperwork done we might get an invalidity pension from the state, but the virus came so we halted everything. I live in a little apartment with only me and my mother, it's infested completely by mould. I fought with the company that owns the house to clean it up and now we halted that too thanks to the outbreak. So, we live breathing black mould. I managed to save to buy a new pc so I could search for a job online, and now I think that it might have been a waste of time. I wanted to open an online baking account to pay all the debts and bills online so I don't have to physically go out and risk getting infected, the bank just told me they will only consider doing it in person. So, tomorrow I'll go out. I'll have to prep for a month at the grocery store. Only me and a bicycle. I'll need to carry all the water and food by myself. With a heart condition. And I'll have to get out again for the bank and maybe to pay another pair of scum that refuse to take an online payment and demand to see me in person. Why is Italy so stupid? Do people really want to die? I didn't, not until today. Today I'm giving up, if the sickness takes me, then fuck it. At least I don't have to suffer like this anymore. What else can I do?
