Finally feel like I can take the leap. No more pain.(Sorry for the length)

Life is too much for me to handle at the moment.

Over the last few weeks, my ongoing depression has taken a sharp downward turn, eating away at who I am. I feel like a shadow of myself, a zombie, with no emotion except a vacant sadness, occasionally fluctuating rapidly towards "manic upset". I find it incredibly difficult to show any interest, enthusiasm or care towards anything. Overall, it is markedly more intense and soul sucking than I've experienced in my seven years of ongoing depression issues.

The PTSD has been fuelling my flashbacks and nightmares recently. The last night I spent with my now-ex-girlfriend, she told me about something that had happened to her a couple years prior. More extreme and violent than what happened to me, and utterly heartbreaking to hear. I have vivid images that spontaneously flash into my mind, particularly at night, and they're massively debilitating and enhancing a lot of my own memories. To an extent, I care about her more than I care about myself, and it hurts so much more to think of the pain she is going through. This is so hard to handle.

And my anxiety (along with my lack of purpose or self worth) is crippling my search for a job and a house. Every ad I see adds a huge amount of stress, and it doesn't take much to tip the scale into over-stimulated-panic-territory. Basically, I'm unable to function beyond seeing a post for something and stressing about it.

But I've been homeless for over two months now, going from couch to couch, and I've very almost run out of friends to help me. I'm so close to being out on the streets, and the council isn't helping me with their support because I'm apparently too young(23?).

I've been speaking to the doctors about my latest run with mental health troubles for over 15 months, and I am still yet to see any therapist. I've tried six anti-depressants in the past that I didn't get along with, and am now taking beta blockers for my anxiety. The health system here is slow, broken and poorly equipped for mental health support.

Over Christmas the police found me on a local suicide hotspot bridge, and from there I was held in a mental facility against my will for awhile. There my anxiety and suicidal mentality rose significantly, and I gained no support other than them taking away my ability to do something drastic at the time. A few weeks prior to this event, I also tried to take my life at the train station.

I've been back to the suicide bridge twice this week, and this evening, for the first time so far, I felt a genuine, real urge to take the leap. I always used to prefer the idea of being hit by a train, and the idea of heights has always terrified me even in the face of death. But today, I was ready to go. But I held back for now, as I promised my ex that I would at least make it through the end of the day.

She is the only reason I'm still here. She's been very supportive to me since the breakup, but it's taking a massive toll on her, leaving her constantly worried about me and having to go to the hospital a few times. I am not okay with this, and hate it so much. If I could make her happy, I would. But she is also the source for most of my depression at the moment.

When I was with her, everything was so much nicer. The time I spent with her directly before the breakup was magical, and I genuinely thought we were planning for our future together in her home country. For the first time ever, I was excited about the future. And then she shot it all down in the space of a couple of minutes. My world totally fell apart. And whilst I've tried to move on (not talk to her, try to find someone new, distract myself etc), she is on my mind almost constantly, and it's killing me.

She's made it clear that she doesn't even want to meet me, at least any time in the near future, let alone get back together. She was the light of my life, and now it's been blown out, and I have nothing left. My enthusiasm for anything has been entirely replaced by my anxiety and sadness.

Try as I might, the rest of my life only seems to get worse. The majority of my "friends" leaving and ignoring me, my family kicking me out of their house for panic attacks, my stepdad's creepy behaviour prior to this, being homeless for months, having no job or any desire for one, no proper medical support. I could expand on each of these aspects in ways that will open ten times as many stories, but I have already said so much.

The only reason I'm still here is because I love my ex so much. She is the only thing I am passionate about, and it breaks my heart to hear her crying on the phone to me when I tell her how I'm feeling. Maintaining a relationship with her is not easy, or perhaps not even healthy for us, but she is the only close friend I have, and I need her.

Despite this, when I feel suicidal, I get tunnel vision and lose care for / forget how she feels. I feel very guilty for this, but I cannot help it. When I think about how everything in my life has fallen apart over the past few months, and how my situations keep getting impossibly worse, I fail to see anything but my desire to leave it all behind. These lapses of thinking about her, combined with my futile outlook on my future and the point in suffering any more for the pointless exercise that is life, are pushing me over the edge.

I'm still in the area for a few days. I've now written my suicide note, and given myself a little extra time to tie up some loose ends. I don't know how I will feel the next time I visit the bridge. Whether I will pussy out like I have a couple times prior, or whether, like tonight, I am able to shut off the guilt and take the jump. I'm deeply ashamed and incredibly sorry for my ex if so, but the pain is just too much for me to bear through any longer. I just wish I could hug her even once more before then.

Edit: Formatting.

TL;DR: homeless, incredibly depressed, anxiety, ptsd, ex-girlfriend, excluded from family, lack of support from health services. Been contemplating suicide lots lately, now starting to feel ready to take the leap for real. Sad for my ex-gf. I truly love her, but I'm so pained.
