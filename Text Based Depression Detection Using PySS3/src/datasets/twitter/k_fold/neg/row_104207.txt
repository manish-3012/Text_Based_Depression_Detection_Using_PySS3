The feeling of guilt....I don't know the best way to say it but..
I lost my only friends out of something stupid i did and now they hate me and have blocked me on all social media. I now have nothing to live for as I don't have anymore friends and no life , never been in any kind of relationship and now I'm over 350 pounds and still going .

The guilt is very overwhelming and it's just making me suicidal and very depressed.  As of now I do not know what to do as that's why I am contacting reddit
