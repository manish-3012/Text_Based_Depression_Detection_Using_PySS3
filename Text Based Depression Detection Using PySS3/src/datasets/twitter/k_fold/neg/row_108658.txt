Kind of just an admissionI hung myself in my closet using a belt last night. I did it a few times, right until the moment where I'd start to get dark rings in my vision, then I'd restart the process. Once I figured out the position I needed to be in, I let myself hang there and I could feel that I was losing consciousness. I stopped because I realized I hadn't written a letter, and when I sat down to do that, I got caught up answering messages from my best friend, and then I had to sit and mope about loving him. 

I'm going to try and talk to a friend about it today. I asked him early in the morning if he'd be free, and told him I was considering asking my therapist to put me in the hospital or something. 

I have no joy, I feel weighed down physically and mentally. I can't see as far as the end of the day, most of the time. I've lost my ability to think forward. I'm alone most of the time, I don't have much family, and I don't want to be a burden to my friends. I think I already am, though. I feel compelled to live just because I love them, but that's wearing off.

Last night was a step towards going through with it. I can handle the physical pain now. The only thing stopping me is the chance that I'll fail and be forced into the hospital, and then miss a job interview that I desperately need. It's strange, but maybe it's what I need.
