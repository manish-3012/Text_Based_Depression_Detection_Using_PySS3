Message to me, a hopeless person. A week ago I was writing my suicide letter, today I'm kicking myself to push through engineering school. If I hadn't broke down in tears in front of my childhood friend and admitted that I have been suicidal for the past 3 months because of the situation I put my self in, I wouldn't be alive now. 

I had faith in myself, that is when I was a fat guy. After loosing almost 75 pounds within a few months, I lost my identity. I lost my purpose in life. I didn't know who I was. I was locked in a body that didn't belong to me. I went from the nerdy guy who used to live life as is, to that handsome guy walking down street, mere eye candy. 

I pity myself, I pity what people around me have become. I was defeated, I was terrified to become them. So now I have decided to think of my as that same fat person, I'll admit its not easy for me to go from a dark period of my life to a brighter one on my own.  I never really had a real girlfriend because I sheltered myself from women, as I had been rejected so many times that I decided to reject with no thought to it. 

I have a purpose in my life, that is what I keep telling myself. I don't know what reality tells me. I have a great group of friends, whom call me "awesome." I live by myself, I'm always by myself. I barely have any friends that live around my area (walking distance). 

I'm only writing this right now because I felt that I was going back to what I was 3 months ago, I apologize for annoying anyone. 

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.
