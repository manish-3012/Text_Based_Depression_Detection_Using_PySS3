i am giving a lot of advice but my depression won't let me utilise my own advicemy severe depression has gotten in my way of my own advice that I am giving out on reddit and real life but I don't want to be in real life. i want to not be in life at all. can anybody help me? of course I am seeing a therapist but it has only helped slightly and now no one I know likes or cares about me. i don't know what I did wrong or why me. i have felt like this since my parents divorced and I have only felt like this since at school everybody hates me including the teacher because they call me shit like mood killer when I bring up serious issues like my depression or other stuff and I only do this when it's relevant to the conversation luckily guns are illegal here otherwise I would have shot myself ages ago.
