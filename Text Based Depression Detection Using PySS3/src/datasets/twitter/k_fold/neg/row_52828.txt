Evem thought I'm feeling ok now, I'm worried that one day I will give up.I don't know if this is appropriate but I need to write this down.

I've felt suicidal many times before and have made some "feeble" attempts in the past. I've not felt seriously suicidal for a long while but I've been thinking a lot over the last few days.

Have any of you mourned the loss of Scott Hutchinson from Frightened Rabbit? It's hit me quite hard. Not necessarily because of a love for their music but just because, here's another person who has battled mental health problems for a long time, and has reached his 30s and lost it.

It's just been making me think a lot about whether that will be me. I know you can't predict the future and I should try not to think like that but I'm just so scared that things will get worse and worse and then it'll just be too much and I will follow that path. It's a feeling I've not properly had before. I've dealt with actively feeling suicidal but I think right now I'm confronting my mental health problems as a potential lifelong condition that could have suicide as a future outcome.

I might not be explaining myself right. And I know there are people on this sub who need more immediate help but these thoughts are really upsetting me and I wondered if anyone here could relate. It all just feels very real and the though of potentially getting happier but then shit just falling apart feels scarier to me than anything else. Maybe that's a good sign? Maybe that means I want to be alive and I'm scared that my brain's going to mess that up one day in the future? I just feel very unsettled.

Peace to all of you x
