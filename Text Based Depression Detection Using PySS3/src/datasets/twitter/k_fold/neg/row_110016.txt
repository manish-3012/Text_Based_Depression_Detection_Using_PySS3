So fucking mad at myself for thisReally sick of feeling like this. I just cried for no reason then had to scream at myself to stop crying while I rode home. I must have looked a mess. I told my friend tonight that I need help and immediately felt horrible for making her worry about me again. I need my friends but I can't keep doing this to them. I'm getting worse and I don't think I can make it till March when a psychiatrist can finally see me. I'm getting desperate.. Crying again fuck.
