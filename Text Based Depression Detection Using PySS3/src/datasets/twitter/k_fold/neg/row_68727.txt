I don't know what to doI don't know what's the best place to ask for help. I don't know where to start. I'm from an Asian family with an Asian upbringing. I don't have the resolve to take time off university to get my shit together or whatever because all I've ever been taught since I was born was "you need to study hard! Competition is very tough out there!" "Work a respectable job!!" (I'm studying engineering right now) "This kid on TV finished high school by 12 y/o he's so much better" 

Until recently my family started noticing how lifeless I am and they've been really easygoing with me but that way of life has been ingrained into me. 

I moved to Canada 3 years ago for university and that's when I started falling away from happiness. All I did was study and I left all my friends behind. I'm very social and I can make friends easily but both my personality and my relationships are shallow. I haven't properly hung out with anyone in 3 years and I'm very homesick. Except I don't have a home to return to because all my friends moved to different countries. I don't click with anyone here. I don't know how to move friendship past classrooms. Sorry for being sort of incoherent. I don't know how to arrange my thoughts right now... 

Over the last few years I've been ignoring how lonely and sad I feel but occasionally I notice it and break down in tears. My first thought of finding peace is always to just end everything. I don't want to. But it looks like the only way out sometimes. I badly need close friends. I act very social and you wouldn't know from seeing me how hard I find it to connect with someone. I don't know what I'm saying I just needed to tell someone (anyone) about what I'm feeling. I just wish I didn't think of ending it every few months. I wish I wasn't so lonely. 

I don't want to die.
