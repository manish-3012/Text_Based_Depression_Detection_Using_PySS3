Everything HurtsI honestly don't know how to find any semblance of meaning or purpose for existing anymore. I feel like the past few years have been me hanging off a cliff holding on for life. I'm tired out. It all hurts. I feel like I've given it my best shot. I'm not here anymore. Physically maybe, but already ghost. 

How can you even heal from this? I wish I could give my life to someone more deserving.
