The Death of a Salesman-esqueI am in my mid-30s.  Husband, father, self-made and from a poor, broken home.  A professional, mentor, friend.  I grew up, and still am, willing to give the shirt off my back to anyone in need I run across.  My siblings, mother, spouse see me as a success in light of where I came from.  ...and I have battled depression and suicidal ideations for almost 20 years.

I am the head of a unit for work.  High stress, demanding, but I have always been confident in meeting every objective.  I have 20 employees and my organization is profitable.  Unfortunately, I have always been in a position where my healthcare is scrutinized by superior units.  A damned if I receive behavioral health, damned if I don't, dilemma exists.

For the last half year I have been unable to rid my mind of the desire to recluse, and die.  As passive as that sounds, the urge is mostly active.  What has me holding on is my family, but even that is slipping.  Reading the thoughts and experiences of those who lost a loved one to suicide have helped, but their aid is as short lived as those moments of sunshine through the last half-year's clouds.  

I have told my spouse over the years of my thoughts, and very few others.  Due to my position, and expectations in my profession, I dare not share these feelings with friends.  With all of the problems that I continuously solve, with all the support and encouragement I give to others, I just can no longer help myself.
