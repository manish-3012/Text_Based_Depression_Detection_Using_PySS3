Can you get over chronic depression?Hours ago I really wanted to kill myself. I finally got rid of the suicidal thoughts just now. But Iâ€™m quite sure it will come back whenever a tiny thing goes wrong in my life. 

Both two psychologists I have seen and my boyfriend think that my life isnâ€™t bad at all, and I have no reason to be depressed. Despite that I told them about my suicidal intentions, one of my psychologist asked me if I â€œjust want to live my life to the fullestâ€ because she didnâ€™t think I have serious problems. The other psychologist said that he thought I had been functioning well. I have to mention that both of the two psychologist I have seen are reliable and experienced. They have been working in the clinic in my college for years. So their words should have some truth within. However I have no idea why Iâ€™m feeling so bad from time to time.


My boyfriend, being more blunt than the psychologists, said he thought I was spoiled. In the end I donâ€™t trust anyone and I have to deal with the whole thing by myself. I canâ€™t talk to my parents either. They have put a lot of expectation on me, spending a lot of money on my education and I cannot let them down. Maybe my issue is not the typical depression which is much more acute and persistent. I have been feeling bad about myself and my life since 13 years old until now (21 years old), and yet nobody knows Iâ€™m depressed unless I tell them.
