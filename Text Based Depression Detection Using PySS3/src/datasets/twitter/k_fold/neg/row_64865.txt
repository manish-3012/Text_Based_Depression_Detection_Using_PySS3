I just want everyone to know how much I love my mother, Edie and my brother Zach! Fuck you bothDue to my health concerns the demons in my head have finally taken over. I cannot sleep more than 3 hours at a time...Jesus fuck as Iâ€™m writing this I now realize how pathetic and unpleasant I must have been to live with in the past months. 

I tried reaching out take the hotline but... I hope they treat folks better than me, just made my  decision easier, was actually expecting to be talked down off the ledge.  

Fuck Iâ€™m scared and I never knew how much I love my brother and mother until now. This is not a cry for help or an attention grab,itâ€™s too late for that, fuck jwouldnâ€™t have even taken the tone to post this if the â€œhotlineâ€
