Just got dumped by my stripper gf. Not sure it gets any lower than thisAs the title says. She's a stripper, and she was the only light in my life. I dropped out of grad school, lost my religion, lost most of my friends due to losing my religion, and now i've lost my saving grace. She was my babydoll, I was her prince charming,  but she saw right through my act and saw how depressed I was. She couldn't handle it, and she left me for the dj at her club. Now I'm left alone. She's happy with him. I don't have anyone to talk to.
