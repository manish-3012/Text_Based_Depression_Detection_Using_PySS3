The end of sufferingHave anyone lost their feeling of meaningless in their live? Have anyone anyone stopped feeling miserable for any longer period of time? I have been suffering for past 6 years, hoping that such feelings would disappear. However, it hasn't happened and I'm lossing hope for better days and I'm basically stuck in my misery.
