My birthday is tomorrow, maybe a change of plansmy original idea was to go to Thailand in late August with around Â£4000 and end my life when my money is almost all gone (already booked the flight), but its my 27th birthday tomorrow, and yesterday I started having this idea or urge to end my life on my birthday, starting asking myself why should I go to Thailand, whats the point blah blah..maybe I could buy a tent, a charcoal grill and charcoal and burn it inside the tent somewhere private, not sure, I'll have to think about this one, easier said than done of course.
