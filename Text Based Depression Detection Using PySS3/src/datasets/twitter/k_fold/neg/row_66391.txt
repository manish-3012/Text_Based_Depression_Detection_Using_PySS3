Just got my first real job...is it worth going on?This might seem a little weird.  I recently got a job in my field that is really well paying.  I know that this should be a good thing; however, I worry that the rest of my life will basically just be working all the time.  I enjoy playing video games with my friends and I realize that when I am working during the day I obviously can't do that, but I keep getting scolded about how I won't even have time to game with them at all.

Basically, I have come to the conclusion that a life spent working all the time is not a life worth living.  Why work, just so that you can get food and shelter to prolong your life long enough to work again?

I want this job to be enjoyable, I want to find new friends in a new city and maybe even a girlfriend, but I get the feeling, from family members, that it is a foolish notion and that I must choose between living an enjoyable life and working.  

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this, I do my best not to inflict myself on people.
