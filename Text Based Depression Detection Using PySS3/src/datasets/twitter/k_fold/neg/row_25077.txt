suicidal with PTSD. shit comboI'm both desperate to sleep, and horribly afraid of it at the same time. I'd like to to be unconscious, but I'll just wake up again. I'll have nightmares, that will lead to flashbacks when I awake. Then once I wake up, I physically won't be able to sleep again for at least another 12 hours. Sometimes the fear of nightmares becomes so strong that I don't sleep for days and days.

How do you live with this? Even just walking around the street (if i can make it out of bed) and looking at people - we're just sentient meat stacks ambulating about the place as though everything is normal, and the world isn't massively fucked up.

I've been awake for a while now. I get triggered by everything that exists. Even intensive therapy has done barely anything for me. PTSD and trauma and unresolved, unbearable grief has driven me to the brink of homelessness, suicide, the end of it all. I would not survive on the streets, I freeze for hours when someone so much as bumps me accidentally on the train.

I don't know how to stay alive. I just don't understand how it can be done. I live in endless terror, when I'm not severely dissociated. Sometimes I can't even turn the lights on, because I can only bear to cower in the dark recesses of my apartment and tremble until I can remind myself that it is safe, the room is safe.

What the fuck do I do?
