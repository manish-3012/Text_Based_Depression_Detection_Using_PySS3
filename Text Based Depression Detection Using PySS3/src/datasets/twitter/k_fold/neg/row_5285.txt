I will do it one day... very soonI don't have any energy to keep going on like this. 

I had social anxiety my entire life, I barely have any good friends in my life, I am 18 years old and never had a girl friend. My parents are sorta ok but sometimes not the most supportive ones, in the last months depression really got me and I felt like dying every day. I don't know how much more I can take, I just failed getting into a good university, I think that I will have no future now... I fucked up badly and I don't feel like there's a reason for me to live anymore. It just keeps getting worse and I can't anymore. I really wish that people would just stop caring about me, because every time when I wanted to do it, I remembered how much I will hurt my parents and one of my best friends who sadly... cares too much about me. I will never understand why I can't be like everyone else, have a happy life, a lot of friend and someone special... instead all what I get is having to live this hell every day. I am so so sorry for wasting your time, I just wanted to let someone know how I feel, and sorry for this garbage english... I am so bad and I suck so much at everything that I can't even write a nice post...
