im 20. i think i dont want to live anymore. i cant imagine doing anything with my life. im empty.i have spent the last 4 days inside my bedroom getting high, jerking off and watching half of a different movie every few hours. im really sad today. i think life never gonna change. im gonna sit here thinking the same thoughts for the next 60+ years then im gonna die. why postpone it? itll only get worse. i just read about the rapper guy xxx who died. he was the same age as me. i still feel like a child. ive done nothing. i have no job no friends absolutely nothing. what should i do with my life?
