im sorrymy parents hate me and dont trust me. i feel so lonely, i had my phone taken away. mom changed the fucking netflix password and netflix was my distraction. my phone was my only distraction and everyday its just the same day over and over again and its worse with no phone now what the fuck am i supposed to do i have no motivation to do anything else. i sleep for fun and i dream for fun but after 15 minutes my fucking dad busts in and yells at me about sleeping too much. my dad takes me on walks just so he can fucking yell at me in public about how much mom cant even look at me and wishes how ive never been born. i wish ive never been born and i hate how much of a burden i am to my family. i hope they can rest easy knowing i dont have to bother them anymore. i can too. mom and dad i never meant to hurt you in any way, i know ive disappointed you but youll feel better soon. im sorry for all the pain ive put you through and i hope you forgive me. goodbye.
