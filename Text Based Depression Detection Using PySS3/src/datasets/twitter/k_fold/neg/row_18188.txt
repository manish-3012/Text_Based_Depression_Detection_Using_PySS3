I really need to talk to someone. I feel that I want to kill myself more than anything but I feel like a coward for not being brave enough to do it. But I also feel like a coward for not being able to live as a normal person.Everything in me feels numb. I canâ€™t enjoy anything, other than weed, porn, and fictional books about a less complicated world. I have never been this disappointed with life, and I have no hope that there will be a positive future for me. I truly donâ€™t know what to do. How can I switch perspective into a better world, or better yet, escape from this inescapable feeling of suffering and negativity?
