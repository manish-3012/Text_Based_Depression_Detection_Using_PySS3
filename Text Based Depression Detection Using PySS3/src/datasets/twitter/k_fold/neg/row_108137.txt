Walked in the cold for two hours at 3AMHome now, safe and glad to be alive.

I was functioning off a day of no sleep, walking in the cold while carrying several bags. 

I guess I need to sleep.

Long, complicated story prior to being stuck outside. Gist is a guy Iâ€™ve been texting wanted to hang out for a while...and we finally did last night. I couldnâ€™t be intimate with him, so that made me useless to him. I shown a few red flags cause when 3am rolls around I was requested that I leave when I was crying on the phone to another friend. I guess I was crying too loud. 

That friend is a good friend. I donâ€™t really see them often, but they were willing to talk to me. 
I wish I have people backing me up. No one to run to when I need it cause you can only stand strong on your own for so long. 

Iâ€™m mentally unstable.
 I was cold and holding out.. had an urge to just jump off the highest floor of the parking deck.. whatever to end the torment. 

Found someone awake, he was warming up his motorcycle I think. He saw my horrendous, swollen crying face as I asked how to get out of the apartment complex.

Again it was really cold. I didnâ€™t want to just freeze to death.. I wanted something quick if it did happen this night. I held out.
Took a while before asking an officer drive me somewhere to charge my phone and catch a ride home. 

Itâ€™s 5am now. Not sure Iâ€™m making much sense. I need someone to call me to keep me sane
