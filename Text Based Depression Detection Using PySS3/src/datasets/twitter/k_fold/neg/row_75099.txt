It's really bad this timeI'm sitting here in my dorm room feeling like I really just want to be dead. It was getting bad yesterday and I thought if I just went to sleep it would be okay and I'd wake up feeling a little less like shit. But I woke up feeling worse. I'm supposed to have class at this time and I'm skipping is, which is freaking me out becase I need to maintain my good grades but I really just feel like I cannot handle classes right now. Also I'm super disassociated right now; it's like I'm watching myself type this, like nothing is real. And if you looked at me you wouldn't even know how raw and awful I feel on the inside, because I'm not crying or anything like that. I'm just calmly sitting here typing this. And calmly thinking about the bottle of 200 ibuprofen over on my desk. I have friends in real life but I'm too scared to talk to anyone about it. So I'm posting here. I don't know why it's so bad this time but it is and I don't know what to do.
