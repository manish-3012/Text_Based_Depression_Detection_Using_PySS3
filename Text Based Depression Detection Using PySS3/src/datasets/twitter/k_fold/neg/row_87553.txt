I donâ€™t feel like I have it in me to live anymore.Itâ€™s just not worth it anymore. Iâ€™m just a failure. Iâ€™ll never be anything. Nobody is there for me in my life even though Iâ€™m there for others. Iâ€™m not going to graduate from high school. Iâ€™m not good enough for anyone. I donâ€™t deserve to be loved. Iâ€™m good for nothing. Thereâ€™s no point in living if Iâ€™m just going to be a failure. Iâ€™m not made for this world. I canâ€™t handle responsibility. Itâ€™s too much for me.
