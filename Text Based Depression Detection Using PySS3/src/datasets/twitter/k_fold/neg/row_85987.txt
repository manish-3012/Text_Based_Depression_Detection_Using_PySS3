Still suicidal... But I don't think I'll go through with it anytime soon.I've wanted to give up so badly lately. Under any amount of stress, my automatic thought is "I can always kill myself." I've always thought I'd be destined to take my own life.

But lately it just doesn't feel right. There's a lot I'd miss out on.

1. I can't bear the thought of leaving my foster dog alone, not being there to give her the attention she needs. She became so much happier and well-adjusted since I started giving her regular attention and love. She wouldn't understand why I'm not there.

2. There's lots of concerts and famous people I'd like to see.

3. My grandparents would be absolutely furious with me. I have 3 pairs of grandparents/older relatives that I have to outlive. All of them are in their 70s and early 80s and in good health.

I've been thinking a lot lately about getting a hotel room and just picking out one of the methods I have in mind. But when I go online to look at hotel reservations and the items I need for my method, it doesn't feel right. I feel stupid. My brain then wants to back out.
