Why do we live?Plenty of younger people deal with depression, and everyone talks about how everything only gets worse as we get older. As we age we have to get jobs (which apparently we inevitably will hate, but that's normal), pay taxes, deal with the death of our loved ones who have been with us all our lives, among other things. So if it only gets worse, why do we live? Why are we expected to just watch our lives get worse and worse? Why should we continue to live when the bad in our lives outweighs the good?
