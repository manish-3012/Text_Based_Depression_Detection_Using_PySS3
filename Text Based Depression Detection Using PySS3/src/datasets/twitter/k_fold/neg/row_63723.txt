Iâ€™ve battled my demons for long enough.Iâ€™m 21 and going nowhere fast. Iâ€™m in college and probably wonâ€™t graduate until Iâ€™m 24 because I took a year off like a dumbass and did nothing for that full year, and now Iâ€™m a full-time high gpa student and not taking courses over my summers. I have no work experience and Iâ€™m so low functioning that I feel dread every time I think of applying to a part-time job along with my studies. I have nothing to show for my age. No internship program will want a 21 year old who has no experience in anything except one job I had for a few months years ago. My mom knows that Iâ€™m a failure, my debt from school is going to be a burden in the long run anyway. Iâ€™ve struggled my whole life going in and out of homelessness and facing failure and now Iâ€™m just done. I am the only daughter my parents have. The daughters they did have died from prematurity or illness in infancy. Itâ€™s fucked up, but sometimes I wish I couldâ€™ve died so that they couldâ€™ve lived. This is going to hurt my parents, I know, but I have other siblings that will keep them going. Iâ€™m not even afraid of death anymore, as Iâ€™m more terrified of living and failing my attempt. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for two years and this coming Monday night Iâ€™m going to get drunk and go for ligature strangulation. Itâ€™s going to be difficult and it may take several tries because statistically the probability of succeeding is against me, but Iâ€™m not going to stop trying until I get this over with. I donâ€™t care if it take a week to finally figure it out, Iâ€™m determined. Iâ€™m getting drunk tonight and writing my notes in an empty journal. Iâ€™m posting this here and I have no idea why, maybe just because Iâ€™m not telling anyone I know personally.
