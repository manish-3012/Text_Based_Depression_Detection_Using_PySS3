I donâ€™t want to do this anymore.I canâ€™t stand this life anymore. I have OCD and Major Depression. Abandonment issues. Trauma. I canâ€™t stand it anymore. I donâ€™t want to be scared that everyone is going to leave me. I try so hard to be nice and supportive to people but I always come off intense  

A friend threatened suicide this weekend and we had a falling out after trying to help because I accidentally developed feelings for her. I wanted to be there for her and bring her the happiness she deserves. 

If life is always going to be like this, the. I want to end it. I canâ€™t stand myself anymore.
