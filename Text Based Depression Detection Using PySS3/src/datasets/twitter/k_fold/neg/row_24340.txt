I desperately want to overdose on my anti-depressants.I'm very young and I'm now entering my fourth year of suicidal thoughts and depression. My mom is threatening to put me into a foster home or back into a mental hospital. 

I just want her fucking boyfriend to move out so I can feel more comfortable, but she doesn't care. She complains about my bills for therapy, medication and other shit. She causes so much of my pain. And while I was in the hospital she was crying and shit about me. Which was so hard to fucking believe. I literally just want to die so my mom will lose her oldest child and she can finally LEARN something. 

I don't even care about myself, I'm so numb to everything. I missed two months of school last school year thanks to my shitty health. I don't want to go back, school, band and other shit causes so much stress. I just want to die in my sleep. I literally just want to cause fucking pain to my mom because she tells me everyday that I'm sick, I belong in a foster home. My friends don't listen sometimes and my mom almost never schedules therapy. I literally just want to take all my leftover medication and die. I never feel fucking validated.

Fuck you, Mom. You've never showed me a single ounce of what a Mom is suppose to be. You're threatening to leave me behind in the US while you go to China and start a fucking business. You blame me for who my dad was, which YOU FUCKED HIM. I was molested by him and you threatened me with not making a police report for 6 months. I hope your boyfriend is worth more than your fucking child's life.
