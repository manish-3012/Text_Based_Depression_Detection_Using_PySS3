Every living thing dies aloneWell, Here I am. 

I'm here looking for advice..

Since I'm posting under this category, and the title, it's clear that I'm depressed. I also have terrible anxiety and a drinking/ pill popping problem. 

I'll try to keep it quick and clean. I hate myself. I hate everything about myself, from my body, to my personality. I hate myself more everyday because I don't have to balls to just off myself. Instead everyday I wake up alone, and a little more empty inside. 

The only thing that has kept me going this long is knowing I will see the girl of my dreams smile at work. She is the sole purpose I get out of bed anymore. I've come to realize that I really just don't feel anything anymore. I wake up, go to my shitty retail job, and go home and drink myself to pass out. I don't sleep anymore, and I feel like I'm coming undone. This girl is the only thing that could change my mind about my upcoming life choice(s), and I've recently found out shes moving. 

Don't get me wrong, this isn't some soppy love story, and I'm not looking for some "Time will heal all" Answers. I'm here because I hate myself and want to die. (Insert Nirvana song) 

Call me selfish, Call me a bastard, call me what you will. 
My heart has felt sour twice before, but now I feel empty. An emptiness that can't be filled. 

I just NEED to know someone else is out there like me...I'm just scared of being alone.
