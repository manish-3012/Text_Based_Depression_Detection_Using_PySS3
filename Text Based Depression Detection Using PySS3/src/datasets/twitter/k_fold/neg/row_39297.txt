Randomly saw my ex's face on facebook. I'm relapsing.I've had a really [shitty year](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6501ks/my_26m_fianc%C3%A9_of_5_years_28f_dumped_me_2_days/). I wish I was dead. Honestly, I really do. But I had help which ran it's course.

I just saw my ex on facebook, I feel sick. I want to throw up. I feel like I'm suffocating. I'm shaking and have been for the last 10 minutes. I'm fine. I don't think about her. I don't lust for her or miss her, but when I sleep for longer then 6 hours, there she is. Right infront of me, every single time. Good dreams, nightmares. She's right there with me.

I tried to move on, I have moved on, I believe so. Then why does this all continue to happen. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of everything.
