Tied a nooseI set up my chair, climbed on top of it and tied a noose from the ceiling fan. Put my head in it and really wanted to tip the chair off. I don't know how many more times I'm NOT going to tip the chair off.
Nothing makes sense. Why do I even hope that there'll be a better tomorrow when all I've known through my years is complete sadness, unfulfilled wishes, the deterioration and absolute destruction of my parent's marriage and they're constant fights. I remember I used to be at my friend's place and they'd be so happy playing some random board game and I'd come home to find my mom crying and my dad on the verge of beating her (he's not a bad man, but has a temper). My sister cuts herself and has a personality disorder. I've read too much philosophy for my own good. Started observing the behaviours and facade of people too much for my own good. I just don't see the point in living for like 50 more years (I'm 21 btw). I have 'close' friends but they clearly aren't close enough of I'm venting to random strangers on the internet. Never had any luck with women, other than the random instances of making out in college. Like what really is the point of life? I keep thinking if I get a girlfriend and have sex and live the life so many people claim to live, I'd be happy but I always feel like there's this unending supply of sadness in me. To be very frank, sadness is my default state and I sometimes feel happy, and then back to being sad. Like what is even the point of moving forward, getting married etc? I don't even know what I want but I know that I'm too tired of feeling like this ever second of every day. Sometimes this random feeling of crippling loneliness just numbs me. I have insomnia and anxiety and I recently started seeing a therapist but doesn't seem to work. I just don't know guys.
