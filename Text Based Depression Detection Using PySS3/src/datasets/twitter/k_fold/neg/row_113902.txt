Suicidal and worried about my wifeMost mornings, I wake up, get in the shower and fantasize about blowing my brains out. 

My wife knows I've been experiencing suicidal thoughts and she's been very supportive. She's told me several times that she wants me to talk about how I'm feeling with her, and that she worries more when I'm not talking with her about it.

Even though I have no reason to not believe her, I can't shake the guilty thought that I'm a huge burden on her emotionally. I've recently started medication and I'm seeing a therapist next week, so we have reason to believe things will get better. Still, the thought of her worrying about me killing myself just breaks my heart. 

The most I feel like I can do is be open and honest with her, and be grateful when she's supportive. I still worry that it's not enough.
