So I've been kicked out of the hosueWell my relationship with my perents is ok usually. We have our fights like any other family would but we normally all make up in the end. I'm 17 and I've just gone thought my summer exams. I have ad a past of anxiety and have attempted suicide once. I thought those days were behind me but today. I paniced and had a little breakdown before my exams. I ended up running out of school and I effectively skipped it (note that these exams are not really important as they dont play a direct role in my future). Anways o told my pearents and they were mad. When I got home iw a the only one there ( as everyone was at work). When my parents got home well shit went down. They shouted at me I shouted at then I tired to explain about the breakdown and they werent having it.anyways they told me to get out of the hosue and here I am its 1 am and I'm staying at a friend hosue for the night.
This is the first time somthing like this has happened
I feel sick
My parents didnt text me to see where I was staying the night and ngl that worried me.
It hurt
Is this normal? Is it normal to have these kind of fights? 
Would also like to add that I am nothing haveing suicide thoughts or anything like that
Sorry if this doesnt make sense
