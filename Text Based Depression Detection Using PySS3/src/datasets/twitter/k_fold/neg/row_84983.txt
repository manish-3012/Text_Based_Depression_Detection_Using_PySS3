Does anybody else get very brief - like seconds to minutes - flashes of inspiration of hope, before it dissipates away?Maybe once a week (or less), the sun will come out. Never for more than a couple of minutes. And when it's out I can see a future where  I might be happy. I feel motivated to move away, to see the world, to have experiences.

But then it all crumbles and I'm left in the hopeless pit of despair that I'm always stuck in. Only even more miserable because I got the briefest reprieve and let myself feel like maybe I could be happy.
