Feeling cheated out of death.Some time ago I hallucinated and attempted to take my life before the cannibal hoards could catch me and eat me alive. I was saved and taken care of. I feel I'm lucky to be alive actually. Anyway, I do suffer from depression and it's been terrible lately. I keep thinking, with the most bitter pain, that I was robbed of my death back then. I'm going to talk with my therapists about this but I wonder if this sort of thinking makes some kind of sense to anyone.
