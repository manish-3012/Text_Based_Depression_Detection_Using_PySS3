3 of my friends committed suicide, my grandma is slowly and painfully dying, and my boyfriend left me for being too sadWithin the last few weeks three close friends of mine completed suicide. One had terminal health issues but the others just had mental health struggles. I'm a caregiver for my 98 year old great-grandmother and she's rapidly going downhill, she just started being completely bedridden three days ago and I've witnessed about ten "episodes" that they think may have been strokes or seizures where her body seized and flailed and her eyes rolled back, she can't swallow so she can't drink water, she has bladder cancer and her catheter bag is filled with pitch black urine, she has wounds all over her body because her skin tears so easily, and last night was the worst of all - she woke me up by crying out in a childlike voice and saying "mom? please help me, mom it hurts" "I wanna put on my dress mommy" "where are you mom, I miss you, help me" and calling for her husband that has been gone for about twenty years. She keeps telling me she's afraid to die, that she's afraid Hell might be real (she was raised catholic but never really believed it) that she doesn't want to leave me, etc. All I hear all day are her pained cries, gurgling sounds because she can hardly breathe, the screams of a 98 year old woman in pain just wrench your heart out. She's reverted back to a childlike state and is very ashamed constantly, she cries every time I change her diaper or bathe her and apologizes that I have to do it. She has trouble talking and struggled so hard just to say "I love you" to me and now she just makes pained noises and wails.

My boyfriend of two years that I've known since we were about 12 has avoided me for the past few days and said he's uncomfortable being around a dying person he wasn't super close with and that he'd be "intruding". Which is fine I suppose, but I don't stay there overnight (her son helps out too) so I kept asking him to come by and talk to me because I really needed someone. He basically said he's over my shit, that I'm "always bitching", that I'll never be happy and he's busy with work but apparently trying to make a life for us isn't enough and that he can't deal with me any more because I'm so "mentally unstable". I'm going through the most traumatic period of my life and he's never had a person close to him pass away, especially not so horribly. There are other people I could turn to I suppose but he's very close with my family and I wanted to lean on him but he's just tired of me I guess, great timing.

I have nothing, I have no job, I keep dropping out of school every time I try because I just CAN'T make it every day of the week. I have binge eating disorder so my weight is out of control and I feel horrible about myself every day. I have BPD (I think? I've been to many different doctors and they all say different things) and during my average day I try really hard to keep my emotions down because I get so overwhelmed and my day can be destroyed in an instant. Right now I just can't take it. I can't live like this. I can't watch my grammy suffer one more day. Every time I walk in the room I start panicking thinking she's dead because her breathing is so irregular.

Also, it's my 20th birthday. My birthdays always suck but this is a new low.
