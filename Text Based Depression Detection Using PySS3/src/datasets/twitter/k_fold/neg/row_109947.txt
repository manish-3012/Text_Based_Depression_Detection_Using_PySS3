My step-brother-in-law committed suicide this morning.Hello, all. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, going off what the title says... My husband's stepsister's husband committed suicide this morning.

You know when something bad happens, and people say things like, "I can't imagine what they're going through"? Well, the thing is... I kind of have this super-empathy type deal. and I do this thing, where I can't help it. I... imagine things from all points of view. like, I'm imagining things from his point of view, pulling the trigger. Her point of view, trying to calm him down and crying, desperate as the love of her life takes his life in front of her. Their baby's point of view, too young to understand, but scared why mommy and daddy are fighting and what that loud noise was... and what's going through their mind right now. replaying the scene back and forth through her eyes and my eyes...

I guess what I'm trying to say is... is this crazy? I can't help myself, it's automatic. but does this make me insane for thinking like this?

Thanks in advance...
