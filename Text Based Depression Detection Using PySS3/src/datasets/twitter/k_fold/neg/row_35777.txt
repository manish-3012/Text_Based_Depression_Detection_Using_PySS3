Trying so hard...This would be my second post, and since my first, I've seen so much sadness on here but twice as much love, thought and support offered(fuckin blubbing while writing this) and its warming to see, You all deserve thanks! But then I have to return and look at reality.. and it all seems pointless. Work(in an office, mostly, back Monday), Food/water, PSVR(sounds stupid, but I really got into this last year, was an amazing escape after work), washing, tidying.. all seem nonsensical now. Without her. She was the tree I'd built my life in and I needed no one else. Now shes gone and I need her to hold me now more than ever! I've sat here all morning with a rope slung over the bathroom door, just looking at it, crying, and I'm sure thats all I'm going to do. I'm(was) too fricking perceptive to walk blindly into traffic, "Just fucking take me!" I've screamed to any god or devil that would listen, to no avail. I might just go for a walk? Get rid of phones and just walk.
