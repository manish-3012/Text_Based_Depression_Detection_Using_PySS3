I never really thought Iâ€™d get to this point.I never got to have a childhood. I always thought Iâ€™d kill myself before I turned 18, and now here I am. I donâ€™t know how to take care of myself. I donâ€™t know how to be a human being some days. I wake up at 10 PM and I lay in bed for the rest of the night, by myself until I can finally go back to sleep. I dread having to be awake. I dread having to be alone, because I canâ€™t handle myself. And now here I am, asking for sympathy from strangers on the internet because I donâ€™t know what else to do. I donâ€™t even eat anymore. I hardly drink water. Itâ€™s a miracle if I can manage to get myself out of bed for long enough to shower. I feel so terrible because I just scrolled through other posts on this sub and I donâ€™t have a right to feel like this. There are people out there who are going through way worse than I am, and I have the nerve to sit here and say that I want to kill myself? I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just want this all to stop. I donâ€™t want to feel a thing anymore.
