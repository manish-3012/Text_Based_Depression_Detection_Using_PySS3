Hate myself...I hate myself. Everything went badly for me today when I was dealing with the social services people. My aunt who was trying to help me yelled at me for being honest. I didnâ€™t want to get into legal trouble so, I was honest. I really donâ€™t see the point in living anymore...

But, if I want to kill myself, my aunt said to not to do it in her house.

Maybe Iâ€™ll do it tomorrow instead of going to my friendâ€™s place...
