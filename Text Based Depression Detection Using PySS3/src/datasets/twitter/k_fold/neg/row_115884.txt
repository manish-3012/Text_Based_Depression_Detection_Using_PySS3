I Called A Suicide Hotline And It Made Things Worse. I Made A Post Here And the Moderators Deleted ItIt's clear that people really don't care and I really have nowhere else to turn.

I want to say thank you to everyone here that posted comments in that thread before it was deleted. I'll never be able to see them unfortunately.

I have less than 30 hours to live now. It's better this way. Nobody cares about me; not even the people who pretend to be there to help.

I'm sorry for being such a failure.
