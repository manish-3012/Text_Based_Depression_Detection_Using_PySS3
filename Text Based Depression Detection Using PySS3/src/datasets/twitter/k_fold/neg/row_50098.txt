I tried killing myself last night and for the first time in months I feel aliveLast night I made the decision I didnâ€™t want to be in pain anymore. I didnâ€™t want to wake up with the pain in my chest again. I was tired. Hopeless. I hated, and still hate myself.

I grabbed an ice cube and a new razor blade. My dad was in the shower, I went into the guest bathroom and made a cut from my wrist to my elbow. It didnâ€™t hurt until I hit my artery.

I put on a hoodie, cleaned up my mess, lit a cigarette and went for a walk. My plan was to go to the park and die there, but I got a text from my dad asking where I was. I pulled up my sleeve and noticed it wasnâ€™t bleeding anymore. So I kept walking and somehow ended up home again.

I told my dad I did something stupid. And woke up in the hospital.

For the first time in months I woke up without anxiety, without being hopeless. I donâ€™t regret what I did. Iâ€™m more embarrassed than anything.

For the first time in months I want to live. I still feel down, I still hate myself, but I want to live.
