Like everyone, I have some problems.I'm 28, officially jobless (mowing lawns to pay bills at least), type 2 diabetic (uncontrolled with medicine), and every time I feel like I'm making progress in something, it blows up in my face.

My job fired me even though I loved it, and they put me down as quitting (fixed it with SS, but they won't hire me back).  Due to medical and mental conditions, I don't have a lot of job options in my town.

I try to eat healthy, try to stay away from diet sodas, but the stress of no good job and little money pushes me to stress eat.

I'm in love, been so for years, but she got married to someone else.  I still love her and it hurts so much.  I can't stand to try and forget her, but it feels like I wanna vomit knives when around her.

I can't afford a therapist.  I can't talk to family again.  I can't go to any friends and put this burden on them, and I'm sorry that I put this out there on all of you.  

I just need to be told things will be okay.  If you need .e to tell you that, I'll be happy to.  Please.
