Fuck lifeI'm 16 (m)and people believe that I'm happy. That's just a mask. All I think about it's going home and feeling the cold medal blade cut threw my skin and watch the blood run down my arm on to the floor. I only dream about killing myself. Maybe I should. Maybe I should just kill myself no one loves me. No one cares I'll just me a nother teen that kill myself. I have to friend. My dad is gone my mom's a drunk my brother doesn't care about me. People tell me yo kill myself maybe there right. I should end it. Fuck this fucking peace of shit life
