An Interesting TitleHi I'm sorry for wasting people's time but would just one person be able to talk to me? I guess I just realised tonight how back to shit I have gone and my partner won't listen to me. Even when he does listen he just sits there completely quiet until I get upset and he says "I dont know what to say" (every time). I know my life comparatively isn't that bad since I'm not homeless and the option of some food is usually available but yeah. I'm not a good person.
