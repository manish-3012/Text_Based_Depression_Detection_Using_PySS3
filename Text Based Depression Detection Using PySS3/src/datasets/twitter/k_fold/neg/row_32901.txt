I really wanna stop existing right now...I'm (F 18) about to graduate with no job, no money, no drivers license. My family keeps ignoring me when I wanna talk about my mental health and want to get help, they just want me to shrug it off.

And when I become sad or a little upset because I have depression, they put me through shit by calling me names or just giving me the silent treatment because they are used to me being friendly and helpful.

Meanwhile my brother (M 16), who is straight up aggressive, shouts and is narcissistic gets away with anything. While I make a sad face or get a little bit upset, I get grounded and sent to my room.
