going through a tough time.I graduated University with good grades and started working as an intern immediately. I then got a Full Time Job within 3 months and started working there, even though the salary was low and the workplace wasnâ€™t the best, I always thought I would leave once I get a good job. I finally did, Oil and Gas job in the world's biggest company, amazing salary great package. I resigned from the company and started the process to shift to the new company. But, I live in UAE and as an expat, I have to apply for visa.  My father is an old man now, barely able to work but was still doing because of the visa and his salary was good. But then he quit his job because I finally had a job which paid more than his. The new company applied for my visa and unfortunately it got rejected. I was born here, I studied here, I graduated from here but my visa was still rejected. I was devastated. I tried everything to get it passed but to no avail. Losing the job wasnâ€™t that much of a problem but seeing my father in such state where he regretted leaving the job and being sad just broke me. I wouldnâ€™t consider myself a sad guy rather the opposite, I would laugh even the most tense of situation but at that moment, I cried. Now I'm searching for another job in a hopeless market without enough experience and each day seeing my father and my mother like this is slowly killing me and the thought of suicide has crossed my mind multiple times. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore and I always have this feeling in me of unrest (donâ€™t know how to describe it).
