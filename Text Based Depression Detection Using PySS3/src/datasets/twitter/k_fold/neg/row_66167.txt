I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m suicidal. I just donâ€™t want to keep living.I donâ€™t even want to post this. Feels stupid. But there it is. I hate being alive right now, but I also donâ€™t want to kill myself. I just want a car to hit me head on or something.

And before you go on about how I need help...I know. I just literally donâ€™t have the time, money, or emotional energy to put toward the right kind of help.

So if somebody wants to hear a long story...here I am.
