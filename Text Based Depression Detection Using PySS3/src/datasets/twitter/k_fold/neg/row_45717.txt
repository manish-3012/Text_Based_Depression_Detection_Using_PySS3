I wish I had another choice, but I don'tI truly wish I had the option to do something with my life. But my disability(both physical and mental) just make me a useless piece of cunt that doesn't deserve nothing.

So I will take my life between this week and the next one. 

I have no hope, every time I told myself that things will get better they didn't. Everything just went worse and worse and I can't take this anymore. 

There is nothing more I can do to improve my life, at this point killing myself it's the best choice.

I will hang myself somewhere. I still haven't had the chance to buy a rope but I can use a bed sheet probably, it will save me some issue.

I have a plan. I'm going to delete my social media and reset my phone and computer before doing it.

But I'm ready. I'm ready to go and I will this time. 

I hope no stupid jogger will pass while I'm trying to hung myself but I have s place that's fairly isolated so no one should be there.
