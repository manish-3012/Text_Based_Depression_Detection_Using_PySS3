This sub is so hard to readI have mixed feelings reading the stuff that gets posted here...like I agree with them, but I want to help them at the same time. It's hard wanting other people not to feel like you do, but at the same time, well, *feeling the way you do*. At the very least, this sub lets us know we're far from alone.

Also, sometimes I feel like the line is blurred between nihilism and depression, and can't tell which one more accurately describes me.
