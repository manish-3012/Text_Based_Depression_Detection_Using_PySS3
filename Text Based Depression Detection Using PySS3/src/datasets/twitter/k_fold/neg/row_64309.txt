isnâ€™t it weirdyou know, i started planning my suicide and wrote all the letters and looked up the side effects of an overdose and everything. my letters were filled with how sorry i was i was causing pain to my family and friends and it made me feel so bad. i was crying because i felt so bad but the time came and i was ready to die. i really just want to die because i donâ€™t enjoy things anymore and my brain is on fire with stress and anxiety about everything. i just want to go to sleep and never wake up. so i was sitting there pills laid in front of me, i counted and i had 20 pills which was 3000mg. that seemed like it would do the job if i wasnâ€™t found and brought to the hospital for a couple hours. while sitting there i was still crying because i really didnâ€™t want to cause anyone pain and it was tearing me up that i had to. my friend busts into my room to find me sitting there with my pills. she came because i was ignoring her texts and she was worried. she told my family and they all came and everyone was telling me i couldnâ€™t do it they couldnâ€™t lose me. i started out feeling absolutely selfish for wanting to do this but i started thinking and itâ€™s actually very selfish of them to make me stay. saying iâ€™m not allowed to kill myself because they donâ€™t want to lose me. i truly do not want to be alive and i wish i downed all those pills sooner. but yet i have to keep living and going to school and getting good grades to please everyone else. i donâ€™t want to do it, i want to fucking die. this is a sick joke that i â€œhaveâ€ to live for other peopleâ€™s benefit like they donâ€™t care that iâ€™ve lost my mind and any motivation to live, eat, drink, or anything else. this is the sickest joke iâ€™ve ever encountered. iâ€™m stuck in a fucking loop that iâ€™m â€œnot allowedâ€ to break.
