Feeling Depressed over the Success of othersHey everyone. Just your average Joe here. I'm in med school and throughout my life I have always been melancholic. I suffer from High functioning depression and always try to push myself to do my best and get sad over my own shortcomings. I absolutely have no skills or talents except stupid humor that I use to keep myself from falling over into the existential dread. 

It's hard not feeling depressed when all the other students who are in your college are somewhere or the other involved in some extracurricular activities and keeping themselves busy. And I think I don't have any skills except sit in my room all day and study. I am absolutely good at nothing. I have tried picking up on a hobby, but I am never able to get through it. In my spare time, I write a blog or end up going to the wards at my hospital to look at patients. 

And it sucks even more when you see your friends interacting with others and being social. All I want is for people to like me. And it also doesn't help that my girlfriend left me because her friends thought I wasn't good enough for her. I need someone to talk to. Any help guys?
