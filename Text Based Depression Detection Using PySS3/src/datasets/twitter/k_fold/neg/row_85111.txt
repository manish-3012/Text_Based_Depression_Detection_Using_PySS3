It is strange when you think about itWhy do we think life and living in general is that great, heck it is expensive, I'm not condoning suicide or living in general but if you think about it, we are just some biological piece of sh** floating around aimlessly wandering around in space just to die in the end.. I think those of them who tried to stopped me from suicide are s***" who don't understand the fundamental concept of reality,, I think life in general is a load of bs and bat s crazy stuff .. Mine was depression, financial difficulties and philosophical problems, the problems I had to face in the past due to poverty selling drugs, got beaten almost to death just because I sold drugs for food,  for food btw for food to feed my family because I lose a ton of money in some shitty financial crisis (and no I don't even drink alcohol and I don't do drugs), living a s***** live, mom's cancer during our darkest family poverty days, dad's alcoholism (death again) due to depression because of the financial neck deep sh** we've gotten into and finally the death of both my parents and to add some salt to the wound, the death of my only best friend led me to conclude that, for some of us, Live is not worth living the problems outweigh the things I will obtained in the near future, and even if I have financial security I will never bring back my loved ones, I think reality just don't rhyme well with, ahh it will be better, eat your anti depressants, and s*** like god and optimism is so f****** annoying , be strong and all these forced lies are somewhat, to me, Ignorant, Arrogant and insulting to my intelligence and the sh** ton of experience I was forced into... Now I think there is a fair point , a reasonable point for me to commit suicide, life is not great to that guy who is about to say it will get better because no, I'm about to be homeless with no job, debts and the same s*** I've been into , why should I desire to live?? For the better days I will be sleeping in dirt and rain? People who have been through shit harsher and worser condition may give me advice and practical solution the rest can shut the f up because I've been through hell more than you.. And I don't need your money or help i need a sound practical advice from people who had been through this so called 'Wonderful Hobbesian world' worse than mine, and no, doctors, if you are a practising psychiatrist you can f*** off because you don't mean s*** in my situation drug and therapy don't help in these s***** situations.. And ps these physicians have the nerve to save my arse twice.. Like a have a stable job like them
