Taking my own life seems to be the only option that makes senseI am going to be fired from my job of 15 years in the next few months. When I lose that I will very quickly run out of money and lose my home and lifestyle.
I have great friends and family who are very supportive of me but everytime I look for alternative work it's fruitless and I can't rely on them forever. I can't even get an interview for a job at the moment and that is before I have a sacking on my record.
I don't know how I am going to move past this. I don't want to hurt my friends and family but ultimately the only thing that gives me a sense of calm and even the slightest sense of control is the thought that I can take my own life.
