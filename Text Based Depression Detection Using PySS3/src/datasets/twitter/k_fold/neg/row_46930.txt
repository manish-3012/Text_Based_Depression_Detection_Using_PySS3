A way out.Throwaway for starters and on mobile, so I apologize for the format.
 I've been struggling with depression from a young age along with Pervasive Developmental Disorder and lately I've been thinking more and more lately about suicide. Currently on medication and with psychiatric support but I can' stand it anymore. I struggle with everyday things and especially with social relationships. I get anxiety attacks from pretty much everything and lately I can't find happiness or satisfaction or any kind of good feeling in my daily routine. I feel like I am robot who doesn't get anything from life other than anxiety,stress and sadness. I keep comparing myself to everyone I meet and I keep telling to myself that I am inferior to them even though sometimes in reality it's the other way around. Some people are gonna miss me and that's what is holding me back, all the sorrow and the sadness that I would bring to my loved ones. But I don't see a future for me. I am tired of struggling throughout the day and really I don't see a light in the end of the tunnel. The only light would be my departure because then I wouldn't feel anything or think. 
Anyway I had to taken this out of my chest, because  few people know about my condition and only my psychiatrist knows about my some times suicidal thoughts.
