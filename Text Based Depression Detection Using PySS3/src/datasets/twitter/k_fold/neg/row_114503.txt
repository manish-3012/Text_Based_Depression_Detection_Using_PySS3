WillsI am 21 years old and recently properly wrote my first will opposed to a rough draft and just need 2 witnesses to see me sign it and the 2 witnesses sign it also. Am I too young to write a will?

NOTE: Although, not feeling suicidal at the moment and my mood is very low; I would not care at all if I were to die tomorrow or soon and truth be told, I wrote the will in case I die in an accident and suicide is not an option I have ruled out but I think about my death daily. Can anyone else relate?
