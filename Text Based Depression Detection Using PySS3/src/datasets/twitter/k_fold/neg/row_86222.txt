Help me hold on.Girlfriend left me saturday. Reacted by being as cruel as I could be, probably lost her as a friend forever. Got drunk, did drugs. A lot of them. I'm not sure if I was trying to get high or just die, but either way I'm lucky I woke up. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to. My mom is concerned for me but the degree to which she doesn't understand me makes it more difficult than helpful. I have an appointment with a therapist on Wednesday, I couldn't get it sooner and a friend of mine who has recovered from a drug problem can meet me on Thursday to help me deal with those issues. I'm confident I can get my life together. Every couple of minutes I even think I'm a worthwhile person and with therapy and counseling, I can reconstruct the shit show that is my mind right now, but the waiting is tearing me apart. I really just don't know if I can hang on, then. If I felt I could trust anybody in real life right now, I'd go to them, but I can't. So please, just please, give me a reason to wait until then. I'll take corny bullshit about how life can be beautiful, I'll take people telling them how much getting help has done for them, I'll even take somebody recommending I do something new, because I really want to fucking live but right now 24 hours seems like forever.
