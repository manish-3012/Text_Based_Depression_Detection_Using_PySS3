Do I have liver damage?I'm  am 16 and after 5 months of quarantine i decided to get  drunk andd drink a ton of alcahol  (e.g. 2 beers and 9 shots of spirits). I threw up but wasn't knocked put and just may parents just got home and I'm in the middle of cleaning out my vomit. Do you think I could have permanent lung damage and  ice drunk a bunch of water but do you know any other way t0 get rid of alcohol 

Thank you
