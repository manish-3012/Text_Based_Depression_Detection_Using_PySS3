I've abandoned everything because I intended to kill myself. Now it's been months after failing my attempt, and I can't go back to who I used to be.If anything, I'm feeling empty more than ever. I've lose interest in doing anything. I'm tired of waking up just to found out that unfortunately I'm still living.

My parents expected me to be okay all the time, which I'm not (but I pretend to be). I can't tell them about this because they often invalidate my emotions, and I hate that. My siblings is apathetic as ever. 

My friends reached out to me, but when I tell them I've failed suicide attempt, their responses doesn't really changed anything. It doesn't make me feel better, and some people just make it worst.

Now I'm just distracting myself everyday, try to entertaining myself just because it doesn't make me want to kill myself. But then I quickly lose interest again, so I find new things to do. Then I lose interest again. And the cycle repeats. 

I will try to kill myself again as soon as I am certain that I won't fail again.
