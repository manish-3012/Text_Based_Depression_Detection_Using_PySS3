Idk what to do and Iâ€™m going to die if I do nothingIm a sophomore In high school, Iâ€™m new to reddit so Iâ€™m not sure how it works entirely. I hope no one I know sees this but my user name is the same for everything. Anyway Iâ€™m posting here because Iâ€™m depressed and I donâ€™t know what to do. Ive had depression for awhile and i always just talked to my friends and things felt better. But over the summer i started pushing everyone away and Iâ€™m not sure why. Now Iâ€™m not close to anyone and Iâ€™m really lonely. I miss how things used to be and I want everyone and everything back. I have no more friends and I miss everyone so much. I should explain that Iâ€™m not close with my family and my friends are all I have but now I pushed the only people I loved away and I have no one. I decided that I only have 2 options.

1- I get everyone I love back and try to turn everything around 

2- I end it all. 

Iâ€™m not going to see a therapist or tell my family anything because I donâ€™t want them to see me like that. So yeah thatâ€™s pretty much it. if you have advice or anything it would be greatly appreciated thank you for reading and Iâ€™ll be sure to update soon.
