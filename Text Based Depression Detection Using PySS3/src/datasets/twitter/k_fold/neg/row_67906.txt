I wish that my parents would forget about me so that I could disappearWhy did I have to be born into such a burdensome world? It feels so pointless working and studying just so that I can get a 'better' job later on, only to end up working more. I feel so selfish because I've known people that've gone through worse struggles than I have and yet I'm the one that wants to disappear. I feel so selfish because my parents have worked incredibly hard in hopes that I can have a successful career and a good life and for me to disappear would have been a waste of their time, money and love. My parents are getting older, so if they happen to pass away I really don't think there would be any more reason for me to continue living. Anyone else feel the same?
