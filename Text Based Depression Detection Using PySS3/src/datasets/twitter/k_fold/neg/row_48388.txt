Mental IllnessI have a mental disorder called misophonia and I can't stand being with my mom and her boyfriend in  the same room for more than 1 minute because of how much "noise" they make with their mouth and lips.

I don't think I can ever have a girlfriend because they would want to meet my parents, and that would mean I'd have to be there too, and they'd find out I am mentally ill and see how fucked up I am. (Fucked up because I treat my mom like shit every time she makes these noises.)

I made this thread yesterday and I'm re-posting it because some people were confused by the post, because they thought my parents were being dicks to me or something, but that's not what I meant. They make involuntary noises and I get super upset about them because of my mental disorder.
