When everything is a struggleHow do people get through the day or week when all you can think about is the life you want and how out of reach it is but every day the thoughts come and over power everything. 
I've always been alone was bullied and sexually and physically abused in high school my parents never cared my dad beat me. I'm overweight and no matter what I do I can't lose weight. I'm stuck on a farm for another few months and everyday feels like a million years. Seeing people happy or talking about their good lives and relationships makes me even more depressed. I really don't want to die but I don't see how I can keep doing this with no relief in sight and no reason to be alive I wish I was just sedated all the time.
