Suicide and daily thoughts.I donâ€™t really understand, Iâ€™m writing this from the floor in my bathroom after attempting to slit my wrists, stopped because it hurt too much. I have assessments due tomorrow and for the first time in really forever Iâ€™ve stopped panicking and doing them last minute. Every time I get close to killing myself I wake up the next morning, whilst having previously planned it. Not wanting to. I wake up with this want to be happy and then throughout the day it cycles back to me wanting to die severely. 

I donâ€™t understand why? Iâ€™ve wanted to die for the past 5 years but something always stops me from going all the way. I have no means of painless death and thatâ€™s all I want. Itâ€™s strange that my mind understands this but cycles through this reliving pain every day. I donâ€™t want to have a future. I donâ€™t see the point in trying to get happy when I know I never will truly. I just want something to stop this endless torment. I hate that no matter what happens in my life either good or bad, I will never escape this pain. 

Iâ€™ve thought about writing a suicide note, but what would I say? How do I explain all my thoughts into a document to all the people I want to say goodbye to? Who would I leave to entrust giving it to everyone that I want to see it? And what if after I send it I fail again anyway? I just really donâ€™t understand life anymore. Why does it keep me alive. Every day it gets worse. My anxiety, my focus, my drive to talk to friends and loved ones. I genuinely just want to drift peacefully so that I will stop worrying every single minute of the day. Even in my dreams I see the people I love disappointed in me, I slowly tear them down with me just trying to explain to them that I need them for support, I tell my best friend that I just want them to speak to me like they care, but I ruin it. The people here. Whoever reads this. I might finally do it one day. Maybe Iâ€™ll post again a few times and maybe Iâ€™ll post why so people can not make the mistakes Iâ€™ve made, not go down this path of torture and be happy. Iâ€™ll never understand not worrying all day. Iâ€™ll never understand what itâ€™s like to be content. I love all these people in my life but I donâ€™t want to cause them more worrying and pain.

Thanks
