The only thing thats stopping me is a fear of failureI have opportunity tonight which is rare. Im not allowed to be home alone ever because of past attempts. My grandparents will be watching me tonight and they sleep heavily, so i could easily hang myself in my room with a noose i already have. 

What is stopping me is that i am worried i will be sent to residential again, which is awful and the staff are abusive i received bruises and injections from them.. My peers bullied me in there...I still have nightmares from the last time i resided there for months. 

Ive been on many medications and many mental hospitals and none have helped. I have no interest in getting better, im not broken. I just would love to die. I hate existing and to be honest i dont care who it may hurt, ill be dead so i wont feel guilty when im worm food. 

I probably wont use my opportunity because im so scared to returning to the residential treatment but i do hope i take the risk and just do it. I have a few hours before decision time.

I dont want people to be all nice and try to talk me out of it, for once i just want someone to listen and tell me im right.
