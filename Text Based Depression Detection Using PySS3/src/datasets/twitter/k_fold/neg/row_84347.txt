Evolution wants us dead?Do you ever think weâ€™re suicidal because thereâ€™s just too many fucking people in the world? That itâ€™s natureâ€™s way of taking some of the useless, biologically weak humans off the earth? 

Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m spreading my shitty genes around and I donâ€™t contribute anything but litter and smog to this planet so why should I even still be here? Better off that I cut myself out of the equation before I broaden my carbon footprint.
