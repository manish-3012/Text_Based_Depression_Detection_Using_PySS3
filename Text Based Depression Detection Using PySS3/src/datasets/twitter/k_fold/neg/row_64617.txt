I don't want to do it, but I feel I need to.My pain is completely stupid. I have everything: Good friends, education, food everyday... 

But I hate college. It wears me out. I don't even know if I'm bad or good at the subjects because I don't try.

This is my second semester (both of them online) and I think I'm gonna fail everything and get kicked out of the school. And my family... I'm gonna disappoint them so hard. I don't even work. What's my excuse? I just feel numb everytime I try to study.  I want to, but I can't. 

I like life, but I feel a failure. Sometimes I go out to watch the sky and feel I'm small, just like my problems, but then the desperation comes back. 
I only want this pain to end. This stupid and worthless pain. I'm just a big disappointment.
