I'm nothing but a burden.my life has been going to shit for the last ten years, and I'm only 21. undiagnosed seizures until the age of 17, abusive relationship from 15-17, numerous assaults, diagnosed with tic disorder last year.

I'm in chronic pain everyday of my life, and everytime I feel like I'm getting back on track, it feels like life hits me with a train. it seems like nothing I do is ever good enough for my family, friends, and partner.

I'd do them all a favour by ending it.
