I'm scared of getting helpIn early November I went to the docs about how I felt 
It's taken some time due to the time of year but things are starting to fall in place with me getting help 

I applied for voluntary sectioning early December because I had to be coerced away from a bridge ledge and it was from there I saw the serious need for help 

I have my initial assessment with a mental health hospital in 6 days and from there a decision will be made if I'm being taken in or not(if I'm not mistaken that's how it works?) 

I have always been terrified of being put in a mental health hospital, so it shows how serious I am about getting help, the fact I applied to get put in

I'm worried that I won't get better, and there is no getting better, I'm doing this because my friends are clearly either fed up or struggling or both, to be there for me, and without support I know I'll do it

I've already thought about doing it if I'm not taken into the hospital, but that's if, a big if I can make it to the appointment, I'm struggling to stay sane, I had a meltdown over new years whilst my entire family(aunts/uncles, grandparents etc) were just a floor down

I'm thinking about self harm a hell of a lot more than I ever have, and it's so scary

Tldr I'm scared if I get help, I'm scared if I dont
