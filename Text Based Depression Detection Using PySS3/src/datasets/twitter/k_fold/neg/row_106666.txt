Feeling suicidal due to anxiety being triggered by situation with fwbSorry but this is going to be a long post. I don't know how else to give appropriate context to express the gravity of my anxiety. I am 30 years old who was raped as a toddler. It's left me with deep seated trust issues as the perpetrator was family. Over the years I also realised that my past was making me paranoid and anxious. I was in a 5 year same sex relationship that ended very badly when she cheated on me. Sam sex relationships were not legal in my country so we had to constantly hide it. That's when I first noticed my anxiety issues. I was always afraid of being filmed or getting caught. When she left me, my best friend of 7 years and girlfriend of 5, it's obvious that it left me broken. That was 5 years ago. Since then I reconnected with an old friend and it developed into a Fwb situation. 

He knows about my past and how that stops me being sexually intimate or how I have certain triggers. But he has never truly been a halfway decent friend to me. We are very much alike and think the same way so we get along but He's never really been there for me in my time of need. I don't know why, but I always end up giving him the benefit of doubt and believing the best of him. And he keeps on letting me down. Recently we both got drunk and we ended up in his office after hours (want to specify that we were both drunk and after making out a bit I felt uncomfortable and asked him to stop. He did but I was partially nude by then)  that's when I noticed a cctv camera there. I freaked out and asked him about it and he said it's a fake. I should add that he is a compulsive liar. He's admitted that to me many times but he'll deny it if I ever bring it up. I was drunk and dazed and just wanted to get out of there so I didn't push it. When I returned and the alcohol had started to fade, my anxiety started to take over. I asked him if he knew it was fake for sure and he said yeah because he bought it. I ask him for receipts or something tangible that I can dissipate my anxiety with because I don't trust him at this moment and he says he has nothing. My anxiety was getting worse so I decided to meet him today to show him how bad it gets for me with the panic attacks. After trying to reason with him for hours, he tells me he has brought girls there before and then showed me a marginal message of a conversation with this other girl asking him the same question. It was enough to allay my fears and we left after a difficult talk. I get home and I can feel myself relapsing into the same paranoia so i ask him to send me a screenshot of the same msg so that I can just reason with my irrational side. I told him to blur out her name and everything. He refused to do it. This girl he has known a few weeks compared to me he has known years. I know what I asked was unreasonable but I had just spent the better part of the day trying to tell him how badly it was affecting me. I wanted him to take every measure to protect her privacy. I just needed to read those lines about cctv being a dummy. I can't explain it but in times like these my brain latches onto this one tiny minute detail and says- if this is true then you're safe. And at the moment to me that is the girl's msg. But his refusal is making me suspicious again because he is a compulsive liar and he could have simply led with the fact that he's brought girls there before and it's never turned to anything bad. Instead we spent hours where he tried to emotionally gaslight me into believing I'm too blame. That everytime my life is going fine, I somehow subconsciously seek him out and then give him trouble for my paranoia. 

This is where a previous incident is important. He is a serial Cheater. He lost his virginity to his aunt which I found out about just months ago. He got his gf pregnant one time and still isn't particular about wearing a condom. The first time we nearly had sex, he wasn't wearing a condom and although I made him stop I was still paranoid about precum etc. In those nerve wracking weeks waiting for my period and being driven to insanity by the emergency contraceptive, he was absolutely unavailable. A "work emergency" had conveniently come up. Months later he confides in me that in those few weeks he also slept with his ex gf and was going on dates with girls he met online. You know, during this supposed work emergency that made him unavailable for me. Today he used this instance basically as another example of how everytime we hook up there is trouble. I know at this point one is probably wondering what I'm even doing being friends with this guy but I don't know why I keep getting dragged back in. I don't trust him. I know he isn't a good friend. Or good for me. Yet I get drunk and we hook up. It's not like the sex is great either. I don't know what to do. I am equal parts afraid of him using my emotional vulnerabilities and frailties against me and equal parts like - nobody else is going to get me. 

Today my question is, I am very very close to doing something stupid and I just want to believe him when he says that it was a dummy. But the fact that he didn't immediately tell me it was a dummy or that he bought it and can't give me any proof of either, makes me think he is lying. The one proof that he did show me today, but not immediately..the girl's message asking about the cctvs in her office(thereby implying that they too had done it there) he showed to me briefly where I didn't get all of it or the context and now refuses to show it to me again. I've already given examples of how he is a cheater and a liar and reckless enough to not wear a condom even after getting a girl pregnant and having it aborted. And I am aware that much of this is being driven by my paranoia and anxiety issues, but I just want a solution. Because im having panic attacks and I don't know what to do. I want to believe him but I just can't. I know him intimately enough to know that he is compulsive, manipulative and reckless with no care for anyone else but himself. 

Tl;dr- girl with anxiety disorder hooked up with fwb and realised there was a camera. Having trouble believing him about it being a dummy due to his past of manipulation, cheating, lying and gaslighting me. Please help!
