I know whyI know why.

I know why you jumped off the water tower that night.

Your mom found you,

14 years old, with "so much going for you".

People keep saying they never saw it coming,

That they could never understand why you would do something so...

"*selfish*",

They whisper behind the pews.

God, if they only knew,

What it felt like to drive your car, and know that with one jerk of the arm

All the pain could be gone.

Because I know why you did it.

I know you loved your mom.

You loved your sister and your dog and all the waterfalls that you'd photograph in front of,

But sometimes, that's not enough.

When you're always swelling,

Not with pride,

It's just your throat,

Never satisfied,

With living.

God, it hurts,

All that living.

When the pain keeps you awake at night,

And stops you from wanting to wake up,

Every morning.

But you still get up. 

So yes, I understand.

I know why you did, what you did.

But I know that I must keep on waking,

You even said, 

To "live hard".
