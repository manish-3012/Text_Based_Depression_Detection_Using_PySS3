I'm so torn on whether or not I want to die.I mean, most of time, I absolutely want to. I just don't want to put my family through the pain of it. But I've gotten to the point where my pain is greater than my ability to cope with that pain. And I can't live the rest of my life like this. I've tried counseling and it didn't work and I'm supposed to see a counselor in a couple of weeks to possibly be sent to a psychiatrist for medicine. I want to think I can be happy again one day, because I used to be, but nothing works out for me and my life just keeps spiraling down. I don't know what I hope to accomplish with this post, I just wanted to get it out there.
