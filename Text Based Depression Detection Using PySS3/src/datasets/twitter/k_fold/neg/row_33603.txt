Iâ€™m tiredIâ€™m at the point where my mood is on edge. Haveing depression, anxiety, and now possibly bipolar hasnâ€™t been the nicest. Iâ€™m at the point that I donâ€™t care if I live or die. Whatever happens happens. I donâ€™t know why I feel this way. I have a wonderful family and life, and besides my sister and the occasional transphobic person others leave me alone. W
How come Iâ€™m sad with no reason.
