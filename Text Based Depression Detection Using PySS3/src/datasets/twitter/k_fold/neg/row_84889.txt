I'm burning my life downI've been fighting this depression for years. About a year ago I decided not to see 2018 unless I could see a way out. With the rule I had to try, really try. A week or so ago I realised that I seemed to have made progress, despite failing to find effective help. (stupid system here leaves me with the option of the psych equivalent of a crash team - career and life destroying - or basically nothing). I thought I'd reset the clock, give myself another year. But in the last week it's proven to have been an illusion, it's all crumbled away and I feel worse and more hopeless than ever. All I can see now is blackness ahead of me.

I've already made the preparations - the plan, the insurance, the arrangements for my wife and my children - they're ready to go. I could do it today, maybe. But it'd be too complicated. Better to wait until the date I originally chose.

But this is a last resort. Not because I love life but because I know no matter what the impact on my family will be hideous. I've arranged for it to be an accident, I've worked out how to ensure they get the maximum payout. It won't be enough, but then neither am I. And it's more than I can give them like this.

But I need to try just one more time. I've activated the system. I've pushed the button that might get the crash team. Fuck, it'll save me, maybe, but destroy everything I've worked for, make me even less. Humiliate me. Shame me. Not that I have any right to the pride necessary for shame.

But it's taking time. I'm here online waiting fir the response. Waiting for the answer. I sent it out "dear God please save me" and waiting to here if they will is eating me.

I'm not sure if I hope they make it in time or not.
