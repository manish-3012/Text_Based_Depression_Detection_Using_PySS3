I got caught and see no way outI peeped on a girl showering on a festival and got caught. I was working as a volunteer. I got backlisted and sent home. I have a girlfriend that doesnt expect me back until monday. This happened two hours ago. I have no clue how to explain this to her or my friends that also work there. My psych coaches I wont see until later this week and Im not normally suicidal or an intensive case. What do I do
