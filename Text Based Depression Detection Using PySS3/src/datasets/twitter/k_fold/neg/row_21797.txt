I'm going to kill myself next week.I have been suffering from severe multiple chronic ilnesses since 2010, I have been through so much pain, so much suffering and after years and years of going to doctors, trying different medications and procedures that didn't work, there's not much doctors can do now, not even to relieve my severe pain. I'm in pain 24/7, I can't sleep and I go days with no sleep at all, the only way I can get some sleep is if I take a lot of sleeping pills and they knock me out. I can't do this anymore, I don't have a life, all I do is feel pain. I can't leave the house, I don't have friends, a job, I don't have anything and I never will because I will never get better, doctors told me I have to accept it and learn to live like this. I can't and I won't. I'm afraid, I have tried it in the past and I was found by my mother who rushed me to the hospital and I survived. I don't want that to happen again, I want to make sure I'm dead once she gets home. I would do it somewhere else but I don't have anywhere to go. My only worry is my mother, as you can imagine she almost had a heart attack when she found me last time, passed out on my bed, I don't want to scare her, she had a heart attack in the past and while I know there's no way to make this easier on her I'm trying to think of some way where she won't be as affected. As I have said I would do it somewhere else, like in a public bathroom but I'm afraid I will be found and taken to the hospital. I don't want to survive this time, I want to end this suffering, that's all I want. I'm sorry for the rant, I have no one to talk to.
