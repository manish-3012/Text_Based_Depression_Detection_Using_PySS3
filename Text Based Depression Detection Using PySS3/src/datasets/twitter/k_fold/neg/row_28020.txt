Is there something wrong with me?I live just like everybody else I know. I have a job that pays decent enough, I live in a house well sized, and I volunteer at my library every week. But theres a line. Some times, when I get bad news, it doesnt affect me at all on an emotional level. But there are other times, like today, when someone tells me im sick. Like, I play with my dog but he is terrified of me, or I tell a joke that I think people will get, but they tell me I have a sadistic sense of humor. I would like to figure out whats going on here, but I dont have any money to pay for a psychologist or a therapist. Theres obviously something wrong with my mind. Im sick, and if I cant figure it out than theres just no point in living anymore. I dont see what it is. Its right infront of me, taunting me. Why do I even exist?
