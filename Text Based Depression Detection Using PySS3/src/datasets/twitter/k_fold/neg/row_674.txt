Suicide bridgeI'm jumping off the Pasadena suicide bridge.  Xmas eve.  It feels good to say it.   It's happening. I'm leaving 3 kids behind and an ex wife. I'm tired off feeling worthless and alone. I'm done.  I wish I could fast forward till xmas eve.  I hate that I have to wait.  But it's one of the last times I'll be completely alone
