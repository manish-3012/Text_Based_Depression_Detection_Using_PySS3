Not quiet sure if this is endorphins or if I've cut to much this time but either way I'm readyI'm shaky, I feel like passing out on my floor here, but it feels so good, just being up this high, no stress or looming pressure or sadness, just me and my bliss. If I'm being honest, I'll do anything to feel like this all the time, even if it kills me. I have nothing to lose at this point, I've already lost it all when my friends left me, my ex broke up with me, and my parents have never helped with anything. I'm ready to let go.
