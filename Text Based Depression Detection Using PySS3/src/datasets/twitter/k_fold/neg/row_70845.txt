We're all the same ... just have some hopeI like to study people around me, not that I am weird or something (which I am) but for the sake of knowing who they are and what they consider me... 
People classify you nowadays as "profitable" or "useless", they simply consider anything as an investment... and don't get me wrong, that's totally fine by me .
What's not, for instance, is the fact that I grant too much trust on people who dont deserve it, just to see that generosity grow on their greedy faces and become venom they spit on your neck whenever you show any form of vulnerability ...
People want to debunk your success, and try to convince you that you're a heavy weight they are obliged to put up with ... making it all seem like a huge favor ... but guess what ... you don't need/want that 
You don't need the moon to guide you just because it's dark as it will fade by dawn and only the campus you carry will help you reveal your path to unleashing your true potential ...
Just be the outcast and live by your own rules and let your reward be what you truly seek in life and not those who surround you, greedy retards who keep on nodding their heads in front of you and talking trash behind your back, and keep on hoping that tomorrow will be better and that the future you, will collect eventually the reward of your sacrifices ... keep on holding on to that dream ... while gripping to life before diving into your storm of thoughts
