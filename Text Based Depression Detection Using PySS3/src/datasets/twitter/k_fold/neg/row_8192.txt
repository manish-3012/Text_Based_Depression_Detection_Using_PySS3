A dark momentItâ€™s 4 AM, and I am sitting here alone while my partner and soon-to-be-two-year-old sleep. 

I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. I am just very, very low. I have been spiraling for weeks now and as much as I know that they need me, I am having a harder and harder time keeping these thoughts away. My dad killed himself on January 2, 2017. I have seen and felt so deeply how it feels to be left behind after the abrupt departure of someone that you truly love... but I have never felt so dark before. Iâ€™ve gained a bunch of weight, am finally heading back to a job I hate on Friday, and feel like a depressing burden that gives nothing to the people around her, only takes. I have no effort or desire to participate in the life that I live anymore, and the only thing stopping me from giving it up is the people that would be hurting so badly in the wake (which I have the experience to understand). I feel so fucking guilty for even feeling this way, which actually makes it worse. I have always maintained the idea that I would and have never felt this way, even before my dad hung himself, but I just feel defeated in a way I never have before. Itâ€™s probably too commonly said but I donâ€™t need sympathy or pity, Iâ€™m just hoping that saying it to strangers on the internet will help, because at my core I wonâ€™t want to die and leave the people I love to hurt because of it. I know that pain. I just need a ray of hope
