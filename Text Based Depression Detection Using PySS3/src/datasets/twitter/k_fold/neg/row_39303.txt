I ruined it myselfI have made a huge mistake. I have exactly one person in my life that makes me really happy. And the dumbass that I am, I took a job 500 km away from her like a year ago. And now the time approaches that I have to move cities. I have one week left and after that she agreed to stay with me in the new Appartement for 4 days so I donâ€™t feel lonely right away. I also wanted to make some memories with her because her health is not that great. But now her mother got sick and she may need stay home, but itâ€™s not certain yet. I donâ€™t think I can handle being cut off from her this abruptly. Sure I guess I could visit once a month or so, but I could not bear to see our friendship be destroyed by the distance. Should that scenario come true Iâ€˜ll have no one to live for. When I took the job I just wanted to get away from home, but as cheesy as it sounds, home is where the heart is. And Iâ€˜m about to leave my heart
