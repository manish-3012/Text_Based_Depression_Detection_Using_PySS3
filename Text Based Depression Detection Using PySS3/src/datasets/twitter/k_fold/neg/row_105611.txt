What i'm dealing withMy mother tells me everyday of my life how horrible of a person i am everyday and how i'm to blame for everything wrong in her life, my father left me at a young age and decided he didn't wan't a child, and he tells me i'm a mistake, my grandmother is the only person in my life who cares about me, the only person who loves me truly but her health is deteriorating. I'm broke, no job, no one, i'm a piece of shit as my mother tells, maybe if just end the pain of existing maybe it'll go away i'm 17 and maybe if i could get help maybe i could live past that age
