I did something terrible and I canâ€™t stop thinking about itIn 9th grade me and a 6th grader sexted on snap, it ended because her dad told to me to fuck off basically, rightfully so. Itâ€™s been a few years since and I havenâ€™t done anything else like that but holy shit I feel so bad now like thereâ€™s a hole in me and that Iâ€™m a pervert, maybe Iâ€™d be better off dead for everyone. I hope sheâ€™s ok and I didnâ€™t scar her or something but I have to get this off my chest.
