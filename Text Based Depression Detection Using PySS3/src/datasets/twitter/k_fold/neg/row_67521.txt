smoked some weed, tripped hard, now got suicidal thoughts. the experience showed me the most basic parts of my personality. i wasn't prepared for it, and it blew my mind. it made me confront all my fears, my sexual needs, my deepest and darkest emotions. it broke me. at some point i realized i got some suicidal tendencies. i will see a therapist ASAP, but right now i feel kind of lost.
