Nothing is enough anymoreI can't stop thinking about suicide. I keep trying to think about something, anything to keep trying for, to stay alive for, but it's not enough anymore. I just want this feeling to end. It has been really really bad the last couple of days.  
  
I have never been able to summon the strength to hurt myself but I do not know if I have reached my breaking point. I don't know what to do. I have a bottle of pills I've been saving up that I could take but I have no fricking idea what they would do to me.  
  
I'm so tired. I have told myself I don't want to live to be 20 and well, that is... very very soon. I don't know how I will make it through the rest of the year, let alone the month. God it hurts so much, I'm just crying here making a post on reddit as some sort of desperate call for help and attention... god I can't take this anymore I have to do something
