Watching the world self destruct, just canâ€™t take it anymore. Death is honestly more preferable at this point.27 million people in my nation out of work, the scenario around our intel agency is predicting something far worse than the Great Depression. Media lies every single day. Predicted civil war, riots, looting if the situation continues much longer. Most people have not received stimulus or unemployment yet. Donâ€™t expect it quickly as the system usually processes 100k claims a week. Supply lines already shutting down. Milk, meat and other food plants shutting down because the food is going rotten. Half of congress wanting to shut the down nation for 18 months. We wonâ€™t survive two or three more, never mind 18. 

At some point people need to realize the cure is far worse than the disease. I donâ€™t care what party youâ€™re in, Democrat or republican, just know that the evidence is there thatâ€™s thereâ€™s people in the shadows who want us to go into geopolitical collapse to utilize their own agenda.
