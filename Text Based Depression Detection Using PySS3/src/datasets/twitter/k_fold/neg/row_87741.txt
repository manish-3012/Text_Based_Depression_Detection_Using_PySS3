Sometimes everything gets so heavySometimes stress piles up, and everyone has a suggestion on how to feel about it. Sometimes there may not even be stress, but the routine is enough to suffocate a person. Sometimes it isnâ€™t about how bad things are, but about the nothingness instead. Today I find myself at a loss. Everywhere I turn are responses from people who mean well but have no idea how awful it feels to be the owner of this brain right now. I appreciate the reminders that itâ€™s temporary, that I wonâ€™t feel this bad forever, that itâ€™s the stress doing it. I hope everyone here knows that. Also, youâ€™re not alone.
