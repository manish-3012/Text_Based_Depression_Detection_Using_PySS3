I fantasize about my parents giving me their blessing to go ahead and kill myselfThat's pretty much all I want at this point. I love them so much, and they're the only reason I don't just get this over with right now. I wish I could explain to them that I don't want them to be sad but this is what needs to happen. I daydream about them saying "ok, yes, this is better for everyone" and then sitting with me while I fade out in an overdose. I wish they would stroke my hair and hold my hand while I die. That's so fucking pathetic, I know. I'm 26. 

I know there is absolutely no way on earth they would let me commit suicide on their watch, but part of me is tempted to ask them anyway. Just in case.
