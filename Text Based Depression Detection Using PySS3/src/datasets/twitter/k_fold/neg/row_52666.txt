I donâ€™t want to continueIâ€™ve made a lot of bad choices in the past three months that make me want to kill myself. 
I tried last night, and couldnâ€™t even do that right. 
I just want to die quickly. I donâ€™t have anything else to live for. I canâ€™t seem to find anything to live for. Not even my mother.
