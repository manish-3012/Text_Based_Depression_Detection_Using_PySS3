i just cant anymore, guys. i just cantim a 13 year old trans guy and i cant get anything to help until im at least 18. ive been depressed since 4 for that exact reason. my parents are emotionally abusive, and i cant leave because if i do my siblings will start getting abused because im basically a shield. I mean, i dont really WANT to die, but thats the only way to end the suffering and i think about it every once in a while. there were a couple times in the past couple years where i would be holding a hammer and just sit there staring at it thinking what would happen if i hit myself in the head with it. im also kinda scared of what my depressed ass will do. like i think about suicide all the time even though i dont wanna. im kindof scared that one day i will just become a witness to my body just walking over and killing myself without even wanting to. i wanna get through this but at the same time i dont really want to. i just dont know anymore.
