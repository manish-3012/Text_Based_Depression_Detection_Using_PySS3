40 something Dad having trouble going onHello. I've been having really bad thoughts, methods to consider ending it all. I have been suffering in silence for months. Actually longer, but it's gotten real bad in my head lately. Life was good until about 5 yrs ago. Had the house etc. I was a "super dad" doing it all. My ex wife relied on me for everything. I coped with a business and marriage failure with drinking - where that was never a problem 4 me before. Fast forward to now and I am broke, filled with guilt and shame and I have prostate cancer - which is curable 4 me, but I have been putting that procedure off. The side effects from this condition now and after treatments r also very depressing.  

I take meds and put on "fake" smiles when I c my kids or other family. I also still drink but my family does not know since I don't live with them and never drink the day before or when i c them. I don't care about my health right now and I am severely depressed over it all. There r full days where I don't speak to anyone. At this moment, if I could die - I'd be more than fine with it. Txs for reading.
