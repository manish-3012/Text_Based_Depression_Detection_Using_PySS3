every time i feel better it always gets worse.i have too much anxiety to tell my therapists whats really wrong. i cant tell my friends or family. i cant do this by myself. im loosing my mind more and more every time i think about the shit that happened. im not diagnosed with ptsd yet because i cant talk to my doctor about it and i feel like im making it all up and its all in my head and im fucking doing this to myself. im losing my fucking mind i dont know what im feeling and i dont know how to say it.
