What should I do?Maybe this isn't the right place to post this, but I feel compelled to help this girl but I don't know if I should get involved.

Basically an old friend of mine's little sister has been making a lot of FB posts about how she doesn't wanna be here anymore and how she feels like a waste of space, a burden, etc.

I've had a hell of a fucking year and I know what its like to live in pain every day. I want to reach out to her and encourage her to get help or at least seek support through subs like these, but her and I don't talk and she isn't my biggest fan.

I guess I don't wanna intrude on something that isn't my business or reach out to someone who doesn't want help. What should I do?
