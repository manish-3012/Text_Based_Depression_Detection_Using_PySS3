why should i liveeverytime i try to do anything i fail, iâ€™m afraid to try anything new now because iâ€™m afraid of failure. everyone i thought was my friend betrays me. my family is dysfunctional and everyone hates each other. my best friend is dead and has been for 6 years. why should i pretend iâ€™m ok, why should i even bother putting on the facade of cheerfulness, my boyfriend is a liar and is manipulative and the only person i can turn to is moving. someone please help me iâ€™ve hit rock bottom and iâ€™ve never wanted to die more than i have right now
