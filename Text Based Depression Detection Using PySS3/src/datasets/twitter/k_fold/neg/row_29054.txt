I've just attempted to kill myselfAnd honestly, it was probably the best thing i have ever experienced in my whole shitty life. Didn't succeed because im retarded and didn't restrain myself, but next time is the good one.

 A this point, i've lost interest in pretty much anything, except in attempting to kill myself. I think now im good to go, 16 years is more than enough for me. I just don't think life is made for everyone. 

Life seems so pointless
