Was just reminded that Iâ€™m a fucking burdenJust as the title says, today I was reminded that Iâ€™m nothing but a fucking burden to the people around me. If someone shows some kindness I latch on. Iâ€™m a parasite and all I do is nag and annoy other people. With my parents just got a fucking abortion when they had me.
