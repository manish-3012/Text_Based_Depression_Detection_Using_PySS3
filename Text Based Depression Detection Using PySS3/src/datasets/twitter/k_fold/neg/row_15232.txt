I dont think its possible for me to better myself.Im 20. I failed two attempts at highschool. Im now in oversimplistic vocational school and just finished my first year with pretty bad grades.

I spend my free time studying economics and philosophy. It might be deep and I might be good at these things but theyre a waste of time if noboy is going to give me a chance at that.

Ive spent so many years unhappy, ignoring my duties trying to stay sane by distracting myself. My parents are sick of my problems and want to kick me out.

No matter what I do, I end up in the same situation. Im good at work and people can rely on me there but thats not going to help me when im kicked out and have to take some dead end job and be homeless.

In my childhood and teens my parents checked my IQ cuz I always underperformed in school. The tests came back with ~138. I am a waste of that gift and I use it only to discuss economics and philosophy online, and read relevant books.
People around me that are self centred and egoistic and small minded in their view of the world perform way better than I do.

I dont know what to do. Ive been trying to better myself but everytime I see a little progress I get reminded of the 100 other things im insufficient at and ive put off.

I have found a real passion in philosophy, its the only thing thats kept me sane, but I think I will never be able to really practice it and my interest in it might just be a waste of time and life.

Either way. I if I fail the upcomming test Ill be thrown out of my home and lose my job. If that happens ill likely kill myself because I dont know if I have the energy to face the world.
