I just really want someone to talk too (15m)I have always had anxiety and depression. Recently I have been getting more and more suicidal. My gf left me and if i'm honest I don't/didn't think anyone does/will love me. We dated for around a year and a half, and then out of the blue she sent me a text saying it was over. I tried to talk to her but she told me I was gonna end up dead because I haven't asked for help. Shes so mad at me now and for the person you love so much to say the things she said. I feel so crushed. I have been looking into suicide methods for about a year now. I always thought it was comforting that I could just stop the pain ,but now I think more and more about it and i'm thinking its almost time. I guess i'm just looking for a reason to get off the edge. I'm so scared of death but I can't stand another day of trying and trying for nothing. I just don't want to be a problem anymore. To be clear I have talked to my mom who is the only person I can imagine caring about me a little. I told her for 20 minutes how much I hate myself and just want it to stop. She talked about getting me help and then forgot about it. I don't think I can do that again. It was so draining to tell her all of that for nothing. I know i'm just another kid and maybe this is all going to resolve with time but I cannot stress how much I just want a way out. I have been searching for my moms gun and when I find it that will be the night.

I just want someone to talk too if its not too much trouble 

Thanks for your time
