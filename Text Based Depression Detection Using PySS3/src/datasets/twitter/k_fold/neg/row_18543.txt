Need help with my friendHello EveryNyan I hope you all are having a spectacular day. 


I come today for advice on what to do about my friend, heâ€™s someone I know very well from an internet chatroom, a group of swell lads. Iâ€™ve known him for 3 years know and I guess you can say weâ€™re best friends but in the last year or so every message he sends is casually joking about suicide and it worries me ever so much. Heâ€™s always been a hot topic kid, liking hard metal like Marilyn Manson, children of bodom and bring me the horizon, bands like that. 


It might be really stupid of me to say, but over the years iâ€™ve grown to love him. I know heâ€™s bisexual and Iâ€™ve always been straight but every time i see a picture of him with his long hair, I get butterfliesâ€¦ Iâ€™m really concerned for him on more than a friendship level, a very emotional level. Heck I love him.

He lives in sweden and iâ€™m stuck in dumb ole texas (&gt;_&lt;) but Iâ€™m saving up to visit him one dayâ€¦. If he doesnâ€™t do anything too rash. I donâ€™t know what to say or do, I love him and I donâ€™t want him to hurt himself but Iâ€™m scared he will reject me and Iâ€™ll say something that will trigger him to do more self harm?????


Any advice would be welcomed. Thank you and have a blessed day.
