Am I selfish for wanting to live?So I have a pretty good life tbf, but i'm a massive dickhead, i mean reeeeaaaaal dick to those who are close to me and i don't fully appreciate how kind people are to me. I always think that it'd be a whole lot better for everyone if i didn't exist, sapping all their love and giving nothing back. Or for future friends, lovers, children ect. who will have to deal with me. I have been thinking that i could just get rid of myself and make it alot easier for possibly dozens of people. But i don't want to die. I love life, there's so much that i love doing. But this just makes me feel even more selfish because i'm only staying here because i have such a good time personally. I don't know what responses i want, if any. I just needed to let someone know this because i'm usually quite a happy person and i doubt anyone would ever think that i'd ever even considered suicide. Thankyou for reading anyway.

Edit: Just ignore this, i don't really think i plan on killing myself and there are people on here who reeeaaally do need help, i just wanted a bit if an outlet, i'm sorry.
