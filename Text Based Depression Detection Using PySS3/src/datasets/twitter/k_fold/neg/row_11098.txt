I might just let myself die.Im 17.  Ive been kicked out of home and have been living at my friends house for the last 6 months. I have cystic fibrosis. I have crippling apathy and multiple drug addictions.  In a month I have to move out, and I have nowhere to go.  I have no job, no money, no desire to move into my parents home (even if I could), and nowhere to go.

I could try and get a job, and I suppose I could find somewhere to rent/board, but why?  My health needs make it difficult to be independent, as well as making holding a job near impossible.  I hate having to rely on others for assistance and knowing that I will probably never be truly independent.  I cant juggle hospital appointments, keeping a job, medication, finding somewhere to live, buying groceries, and even if I could, whats the point?  I'd have next to no time for myself.  And I dont see the point in living a life devoted to trying to stay alive?

I dont want to move back to my parents.  I just dont want to go back to having to rely on someone to do everything for me.  It makes me feel like less of a person than 'normal' people who can do all of the things I cant.

The way my health is going, I dont see myself living beyond the next few years anyway, and I dont mind.

So whats the point?  Come the end of this month, I will probably go back to being homeless and allow myself to quietly die of starvation or something.
