i'm might do it tonighti really hate to blame my family but it's because they keep pushing me to the edge. they also tried their best to help me but it clashed with them shaming me for everything i do. 'The family is like this because of you' unfortunately that was the last drop. i hope my dad doesn't kill himself but at least they will reach some kind of economic relief after i pass. i decided overdosing would be a better choice than jumping off my grandmas apartment building. less messy but my family will be the first ones to find me. i'm worried about my dog the most. i hate to see him sad.
