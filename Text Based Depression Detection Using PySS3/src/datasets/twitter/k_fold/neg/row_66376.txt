I self harmed today for the first time in months. I want to die.I've been having a hard time with life in general. I never thought I would live this long, so I have no direction in life. I keep arguing with my ex, we're still seeing each other but we both know I'm too unstable for a relationship. I don't want to let him go, he doesn't want to let me go but it hurts so much being friends and knowing we love each other but it'll never work.

I self harmed on my face. I can't go outside because people will stare. I did it to calm me down. I want to die, I've attempted before in the past but now I want it more than ever. 

No one would notice I'm gone. I have no friends. And I know my mum and siblings will eventually move on.

I don't want to leave my cats because they always come over for cuddles when I'm sad. When I spend all night crying I wake up and they're both sitting next to me, they never sit next to each other unless I'm sad.

I'm sorry this is a useless post. I just feel so alone.
