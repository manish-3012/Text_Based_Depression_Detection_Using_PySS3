Five months ago..I  was happy. I had something to look forward to. I had a reason to be happy. I had a reason to be here. I had a reason to *be*. I don't have that anymore. I want to die. I want to be at peace. I want to sleep forever. I'm tired of being a burden on myself and everyone else. I can't fucking do this anymore. Why can't I just be happy? I was happy...
