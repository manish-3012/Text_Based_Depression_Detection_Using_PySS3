Need advice, I can't sleep at nightTo begin with, I'd like to mention that this is not common insomnia. I was struggling with lots of anxiety and panic attacks before, but since quarantine began they became more frequent than what i can handle. 
Each night is the same, i try to go to sleep but falling asleep feels like dying (no joke). I get tachycardia, palpitations, my arms feel numb, I can't breathe properly, low blood pressure (some of them heart attack symptoms, yet i did a lot of medical studies and I'm perfectly fine. All doctors said it was something related to stress and anxiety). 
I went to therapy for the first time on January, wishing i could fix myself. Everything was going well but quarantine got me not only stuck but even worse than i ever was. My therapist said there's actually no actual way for me to feel better while being in this situation, i need to go out with my friends and make my surroundings more possitive, yet I can't. 
I don't know what to do to feel better, if someone has any advice on how to calm myself down, stop feeling like all these symptoms are real and get to sleep it'll make me really happy. Thanks in advance and hope you all have a great day!!
