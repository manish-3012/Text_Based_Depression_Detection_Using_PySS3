i'm hopeless and can't do anything anymorei've been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for years but today was just a really bad day.

I graduated from art school with a degree in illustration and it's been about a year and half since i graduated and i still don't have a job in my field. I've been working at a retail job part time. And it's not that no one will hire me. It's that i don't even try. I'm lazy. I just can't do it. Every time I even think of looking for a new job i get so overwhelmed. There's too many things i have to do first - redo my resume, find references, write cover letters, look for job openings, etc etc and it gets to be too much. And I don't even know where to start looking, I used to know who i wanted to work for and what i wanted to do and now i just don't know. the honest answer is that i don't want a job. i don't want to do anything. i'm so apathetic about everything and honestly i don't care what happens to me.I can't bring myself to care if i die or if i have no food or if i end up living in a cardboard box on the side of the road. 

I've been living with my parents since i graduated and they aren't happy about it. today i had to deal with being yelled at by each of them (my mom this morning when i woke up and my dad about an hour ago) and both of them made sure to tell me that i was a waste of their money and a disappointment and i feel bad because it's true but i just can't DO ANY BETTER.

I found this reddit while looking for a place to vent. i don't want to talk about this with anyone i know irl. I want to die and i want to kill myself, but i'm not actively thinking about doing it because committing suicide requires planning and that's just too much effort for me right now.
