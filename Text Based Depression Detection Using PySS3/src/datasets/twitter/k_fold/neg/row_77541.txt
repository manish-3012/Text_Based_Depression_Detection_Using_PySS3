completely wrong body, feels like constant suffocation, i just want to destroy this body and enter the afterlife where i can be the real meim supposed to look exactly like my profile picture. every day its just dysphoria. it never ends. i cant even properly describe how horrifyingly painful what i call artstyle dysphoria is, but this is the best way i can think of: it feels like im stuck inside one of those latex halloween costumes but its my whole body, there are no breathing holes anywhere, and its constantly suffocating me and its impossible to break free. i cant breathe. in the afterlife i believe in, i will finally get my real body, and i finally wont feel like i cant breathe and im not being suffocated. no matter which way you look at it the only way i can breathe is if i die. i dont know how anyone can help but if youre reading this, please for the love of god help me. please help me, i am begging you
