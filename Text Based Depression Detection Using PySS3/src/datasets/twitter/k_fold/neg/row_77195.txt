Life is too much and I'm too weakFuck that. My therapist seems to never be half ok about what I'm doing and to her literally everyone sightly older than me is right even if we're both adults.

Like recently one of my professor insulted my, I admit, only average capacities in maths so I just responded to him that I was doing what I could and that insulting me won't help, he said that I shouldn't talk to him like this and it was utter disrespect and put me the lower grade without even looking at my finished work while I worked on this type of exercises and I knew I ended up doing well. It was very upsetting so I told her. But apparently I should take every insults from professors, if he said that I had no more knowledge in basics mathematics than a 10yo, he was right to say it this way, and I should just be ok with it. It really hurts that she's ok with what happened, we're both adults, he has no more rights than I. And she is telling me that I'm doing wrong in so many occasions. I feel like my entire existence is wrong.

 The professor that is supposed to help me through my years of college genuinely hates me and constantly insults me in public, mostly in class. No one acknowledge all the work I do. I don't want praise, I just want them to stop insulting me saying that I do nothing.

Everyone say that I don't follow anyone's advice and that's why I fail, while I'm doing it, I'm following every single advices from my professors and I showed them proof of this. My mother who's working her ass out for me will soon know how terrible I do even if I'm working constantly. And I have absolutely no friends to talk to. My mother is working to jobs to pay college for the failure that I am. I want to try to be a good artist, I don't even practice daily, I apparently don't do anything good for me and my future and it ruins my mother and myself. I hate myself. Why can't I be good like everyone else.

If this is life, count me out.
