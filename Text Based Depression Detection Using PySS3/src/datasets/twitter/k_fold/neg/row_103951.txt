no one will care even if i'm deaddeath is all i can think about now. i think about dying the most brutal way possible. i always wanted to be accepted and normal. i guess dying at 15 won't be so bad. i want to stab myself until all of my guts are ripped out. i will make sure i won't ever be a burden again.
