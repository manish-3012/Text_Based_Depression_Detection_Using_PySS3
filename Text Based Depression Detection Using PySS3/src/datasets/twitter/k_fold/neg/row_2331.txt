Iâ€™m going to loose it any day nowIâ€™m going to loose it. Everything is absolutely grey and nothing makes me happy anymore. Iâ€™ve burdened my family and my significant other too much. Iâ€™m a broken record at this point. So Iâ€™m fine until Iâ€™m not and I completely break. Iâ€™m so sick of feeling alone. I donâ€™t want to spend another birthday by myself. I donâ€™t want to be alone anymore I donâ€™t want to be alive. Iâ€™m done Iâ€™m fucking done. 
 
Thanks for listening
