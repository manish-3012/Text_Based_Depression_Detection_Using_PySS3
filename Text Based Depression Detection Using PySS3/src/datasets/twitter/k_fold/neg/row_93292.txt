i can't quite fathom why i'm still here.i've been thinking about it lately. why the fuck am i living? i am merely existing; and usually in a  state of pain, depression and anxiety. so what's the point of my existence? 

nobody is benefitting from having me alive. i have no close friends anymore, except my roommate. but i feel more like a burden to her than anything, i am always bugging her with my problems. i have a boyfriend, but he's grown tired of me and i know he's gonna dump me any day now. he doesn't love me. this i am now sure of. i broke up with the guy who actually loved me this past springtime... we lived together, we were together for 4.5 years, we were engaged at one point. i know we weren't really "right" for each other in a lot of ways, but it hurts to not have a home anymore and it hurts to not have someone truly love you anymore and support you in the ways that he did for me. i'm not close to my family at all... i have 3 siblings but we barely speak. my parents are long dead.

for the past few months it's just been a stream of steadily worsening depression and anxiety. i kept things fairly under control over the summer, because i was exercising quite often. that helped some. then i got a full-time job that takes up all my free time and totally saps me of my energy (i am on my feet the entire shift, lifting boxes and so forth). at night when i drive home sometimes i just cry, i try to soothe myself into believing this isn't all pointless but i truly feel like it is.

i got my college degree last spring, too. i thought that would change something. i was really proud of it, even though i didn't have parents or anyone to congratulate me. i don't know... it was such a struggle for me to get it for a variety of reasons. turns out it doesn't really matter at all. i applied for tons of jobs before i finally applied for this work i'm doing now; i could never even get interviews. makes me feel like i wasted all those years and money for nothing. 

certain things make me mildly happy, like music and reading and my pet rats. but all that stuff seems pretty inconsequential. when you have no family, friends, and barely a boyfriend (just waiting for that heartbreak to happen...), who cares what kind of dumb hobbies i like or things i do? what's life without love? without purpose? with a job that sucks the life out of you, physically and mentally?

i was at work earlier today, just going through the motions. doing okay, thinking about stuff as usual but zoning into my tasks. then one of my bosses made some dumb comment that made me feel stupid, and i almost cried when he walked away. and then the sadness hit me in a wave and i had to hold back the tears for hours after. that's not normal, i know. i can't even stand this boss and i don't give a crap what he thinks of me. i just couldn't stand any more insensitivity from people. i feel like i want to have friends and be around people sometimes, but i'm too full of sadness and i know nobody wants any part of that. and i don't like people hitting on any of my raw nerves, either. i get enough of that from the boyfriend.

i find myself more and more lately thinking of ways i could die. that scares me. but i don't know where to turn or how to reach out for help. i have attempted suicide in the past, so i know that dark place beyond even the depression zone is very much familiar to me. i don't want to go there necessarily again, but i can feel the pull and i don't know how to keep resisting. i feel too tired to keep fighting all the time. i can feel myself giving in to whatever wants to consume me, and i'm too exhausted to bother caring anymore to stop myself.
