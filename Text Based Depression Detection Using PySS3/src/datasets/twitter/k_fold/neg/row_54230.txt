I feel like I'm imploding on myself.Soon there's not going to be much left of me. I mean, I've tried suicide before, and I've contemplated it again so many times, but really, what I'm worried about now more than anything is curling into a ball someday and just staying that way, not moving from my bed except to eat or piss/shit. Maybe that's not as "glamorous" as suicide. But I've already done that for long periods at this point. And I don't know what else to do. I'll probably do just curl up into the fetal position for the long run soon... Happy 2012 to anyone reading.
