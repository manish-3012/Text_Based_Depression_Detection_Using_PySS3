22F, losing hope on things ever getting better.Iâ€™ve had depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 13. Iâ€™m now 22, married with a child and things just keep getting worse and worse no matter how much I try. Iâ€™ve been on medication, been to therapy, practically living the life everyone aspires for, yet everyday things get harder. Iâ€™m literally in emotional agony. The only people who keep me going are my husband and baby, because I love them dearly, but itâ€™s just not even enough anymore. Iâ€™m lost on where to go from here.
