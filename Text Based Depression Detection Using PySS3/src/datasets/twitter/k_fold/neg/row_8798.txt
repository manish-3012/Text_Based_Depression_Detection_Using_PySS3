18/f I donâ€™t see hopeIâ€™m 18 and Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself since I was 11. My mother is super abusive and my father is too, but not as bad. I have clinical depression, generally anxiety, and an eating disorder. I donâ€™t really have any friends, I work a lot, and go to school full time. I dream to research cancer or be a forensic pathologist, but Iâ€™m so depressed I can never show up to school. I have no motivation to get out of my bed anymore. I am probably too dumb to be a doctor or maybe my mental illness is just holding me back from it. I have to drop this biology class, because itâ€™s just too much for me right now I cannot do it. I donâ€™t see a future or any hope for myself. My family doesnâ€™t even love me. Iâ€™m sure my mother is a overt narcissist. Iâ€™ve also been through many traumatic things like my father kidnapping me, sexual abuse, bullying, abusive relationship, domestic abuse, and etc. i really donâ€™t see hope for me at this point. I hate myself so much hahah
