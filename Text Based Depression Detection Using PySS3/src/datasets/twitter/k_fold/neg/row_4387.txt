i hate being alivequarantine has made my life living hell, i havenâ€™t seen anyone besides my family in months because my mom
basically banned me from leaving the house for no reason. iâ€™m too depressed to even do anything anymore and my mom just tells me iâ€™m lazy, i just want to die. i never feel like leaving my room because all i ever hear is how much of a disappointment i am.
