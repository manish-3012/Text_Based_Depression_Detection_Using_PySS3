Not suicidal, but I think my sister could use some help, what can I do? What do I tell her?So my sister is 27 and she's done a lot of stupid things over the last 10 years.  A lot of drugs, she's spent thousands of dollars over the years from both of the guys she had kids with on cocaine.  She's constantly falling back into the same old traps of drug addiction, self destructive behavior, terrible relationships, and just general irresponsibility.

I don't think she's going to kill herself. She's having a fucking hard time getting on the right track, and I'm not sure if she even wants to or if she's still trying to exploit my family for money and stuff like that until she can go elsewhere and get another sugar-daddy.

What kind of advice do you have?  We've talked to her about rehab but she doesn't seem interested.  It's like she doesn't want to change.  What do I tell her?
