HelpI'm falling back into the darkness that has led me to try suicide three years ago. But in the end I did not and I kept going, trying to live my life. I thought everything was fine .... but now I do not even have the strength to get up in the morning. Now for me nothing has value, even my life. why should I continue to live it? I do not want to go back to that period, but I'm alone no one ever noticed my pain three years ago and do not see it even now. I've got some cuts on my arms, they were shoutings for help but they did not see that either. I'm alone and I do not think I have the strength to survive again.
