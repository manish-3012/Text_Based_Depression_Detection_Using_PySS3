Iâ€™m waiting for mail...That will either change my life or destroy it. Iâ€™ve applied for disability in the US because my mental disorders are making it impossible for me to work and Iâ€™ve been hospitalized before. Iâ€™m living with my dad and he is paying for everything for me. Iâ€™m grateful but heâ€™s one of the reasons I even have these disorders. He is a huge trigger for me. I already self harm to release the pain and hold it at bay. I want to live to see my baby nephews grow up. If I donâ€™t get approved for disability though and have to wait another year and a half to appeal, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll survive. I canâ€™t keep living in hell while I battle my mental health and try to keep peace with my dad. Iâ€™m grateful for what I have and that heâ€™s helping me. Heâ€™s also very controlling and Iâ€™m paranoid and hyper vigilant because of it. 

I honestly donâ€™t know what my reaction will be but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll come out alive after the breakdown Iâ€™ll have if Iâ€™m not approved. I have no insurance so canâ€™t get hospitalized again.
