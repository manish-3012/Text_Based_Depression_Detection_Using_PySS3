I just want to end it.I cant stop tinking about how i just want the whole world to stop. Ive lost all my friends, my family is mad at me, i had my heart broken.

I cant stand the way im feeling. Its been three months and i cant stop feeling like im just a burden on everyone.

Im trying, ive started working two jobs just to stay occupied and exhaust myself, but it doesnt work. My body is in pain but i still cant sleep.

The first person i ever fell in love with just left me and my friends all did too. I cant stop thinking about all of them.

My mom wont talk to me because she doesnt ubderstand the way i feel.

I just want it to stop, i want to stop feeling this pain that i have. I dont know whats wrong with me, in trying but life just seems to be slipping away from me and i cant stop it.

I just want to die and the few people who do care might be upset at first but i feel like it wil unburden them when im gone.
