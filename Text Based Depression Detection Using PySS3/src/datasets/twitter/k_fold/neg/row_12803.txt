Donâ€™t know what my point is to staying hereIâ€™m ugly, friendless, will never get married or have my own family. Iâ€™m stupid, Iâ€™m losing my career because Iâ€™m crazy. I was given real bad genetics, itâ€™s why Iâ€™m on this sub and how I became this way. It seems the world tells you who you are suppose to be, by what genetics you are given. I donâ€™t know what the point is to stay around anymore. I gave it a good shot and my dreams were destroyed, Iâ€™ve lost everything I have accomplished, I lost my career in the military, my security clearance, my pilots license, every girl I tried to date. I only feel obligated to stay around cause my family will be sad. But itâ€™s getting hard to do that anymore. 

Itâ€™s weird I feel less and less connected to my family as time goes on, I think it is because I hate myself so much I canâ€™t imagine them wanting to be associated with me. I wish they just hated me so I could end it without guilt. Guilt and obligation is the only thing keeping me alive and Iâ€™m scared of going to hell. Iâ€™m miserable. I donâ€™t feel like trying anymore. I have to start over with a new career. But for what? Just to keep myself alive longer to zombie through a life I hate? I donâ€™t see the point to it. Everything has been robbed from me and I have nothing left inside me. No motivation, no dreams, no passion. I wish I never been born. 

I keep fantasising about taking a trip to San Francisco, having one last night on the town, get drunk beyond belief and then plummet off the bridge. I will leave my keys in my car with the door open for someone to take. I would write one last text to my family saying Iâ€™m sorry, I love them, itâ€™s not there fault and then throw my phone over and jump.
