because im tiredlul

there is not much left to do

Iâ€™ve lived my life full but short

and while im sitting with my tv on the floor and the 

smell of pot brownies wafting in the air....i see things.

Iâ€™ve realized when i was who i am

the me that has been stored away and the key lost

i spend everyday searching for something that canâ€™t be found

and Iâ€™m exhausted 

there is no point in fighting a fight that canâ€™t 

as the voices in my head scream louder and louder

i know that soon i will silence them.
