Don't want to stop drinking because I want to passively die.I've been struggling with alcoholism for about 5 years. I've been unemployed or only partially employed for about a quarter of the last 4 years. Lost my college gf of 5 years a year and a half ago. Some supportive friends and family but I cannot shake the feeling that everyone I positively interact with is taking pity on me because I'm sick. Very sick. I'd be sick without the alcohol but it sure doesn't help. And I don't want it to.

They say you need to want to stop drinking to succeed. I believe them. If alcohol is a pathway to death and I cannot stomach other forms of suicide then what motivation do I have to quit? My life will get better after the fact? I was massively depressed and suicidal from age 10 forward, a decade before alcohol became a life-altering problem. At this point I feel like escape is impossible unless I accept alcohol as my killer. It's doing me a favor albeit slowly. 

Somehow, death by accepting the status quo is more appealing than taking myself out. 

My life has been relatively privileged. No trauma or extreme hardships except those self-inflicted. I've spent my whole life trying to be better and nothing works. If I'm doomed to prolonged self-torture, why stop drinking only to prolong it? 

Anyone else here passively suicidal? Anyone else recovered from a situation like this?
