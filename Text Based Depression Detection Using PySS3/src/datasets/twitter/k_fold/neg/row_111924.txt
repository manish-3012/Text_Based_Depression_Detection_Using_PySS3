I'm just going to leave this here.All I do is mess up and I'll never amount to anything in life I am a disappointment to my entire family I am a lazy little shit that has so many fucking problems. Everyone would be better off if I were to die right now I feel like I just annoy everyone. I feel neglected and mentally hurt, I have to take Meds every day just to act normal I have a wonderful smart girlfriend who is the only reason why I lived this long but I can't take everything else anymore. She would be better off without me too, not holding her down. I don't deserve her. I am a waste of space. A waste of a human body, a waste of potential. Goodbye.
