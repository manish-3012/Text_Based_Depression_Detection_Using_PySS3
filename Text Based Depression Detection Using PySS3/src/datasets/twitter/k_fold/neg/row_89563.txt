I always had a voice telling me to kill myself because i'm a failureI fight that inner voice everyday, but it's getting real difficult.

Every night that voice tell me to impale myself to the ground, to shoot myself, to jump under a train or any other really violent way to end myself. Honestly the only thing that kept me from hurting myself during the years was the disgust to the things that the voice tell. The really first time i heard it was when i was 6, it told me to kill my little sister. I cryed really hard and waked up my parents, telling them i didn't want to do it, but the voice didn't stop. Since then the voice told me to kill me. During teenage years i was bullied and i didn't have any friends, so i didn't tell anyone of it, because i didn't have anyone to talk with.

I feel i'm a failure, i'm not worth of anything.

From the outside the only thing you can see of my inner me are my eyes, i have a hard time sleeping at night.

I'm really scared to have a psycological visit because it could take away from me everything i fought to have over the years. I put a mask on everyday, and the mask change to be the perfect person in the eyes of the people in front of me.

I just can't do it anymore. I'm tired and i feel i lost the energy needed to act everyday and to keep the voice quiet.

I don't know what to do, but i want to live free from this.

I was diagnosed with autism/mental retard when i was 2-3, but thanks to my mother i had a 'miralously recover'. I can understand every little aspect of human emotions and so i learned to think as the people in front of me.
The strangest thing was anger, it was very difficult to understand what it is and why people feel it.

This a throwaway account because some people knows my real account. I needed to tell this to someone, so i can feel a little better.
