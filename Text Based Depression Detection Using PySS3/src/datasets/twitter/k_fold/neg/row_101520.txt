iâ€™m toxic, and toxicity should be erasedeverything i do makes people uncomfortable i thought i was being good. but iâ€™m not, and its everytime i do something i enjoy too. 

not to forget iâ€™m toxic in general. always looking to start conflict with others if i see it or iâ€™m just a generally aggressive person. people around me tell me it takes a lot to be truly toxic and that iâ€™m not toxic. that could be the case but how dare i let myself think about anything remotely positive about myself? 

i want to take my own life, theres been a strong urge this year.
