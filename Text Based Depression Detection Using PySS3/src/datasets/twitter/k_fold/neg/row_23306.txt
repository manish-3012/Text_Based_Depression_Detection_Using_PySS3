It's been a month since I failed to kill myselfI can't do anything right. I could have done it, I didn't want to. Belt around my throat, couldn't breathe, the awful throbbing in my head, like it would explode. I can't get shit done. What do I have? I'm only living for one thing, for one person. I'll never be with them. Never. So depressed. Pills, therapy... doesn't work. I need to stop kidding myself. It scared me. I've been depressed before, I've been suicidal before, but I never tried... not like that. After the feeling passed a little while later, I was shaking. I couldn't believe it. I should have done it. I hate myself. My life will never get better. I still can't believe it.
