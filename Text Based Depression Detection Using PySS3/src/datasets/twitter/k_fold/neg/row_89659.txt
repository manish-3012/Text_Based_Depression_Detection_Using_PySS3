No Reason to keep on goingI have struggled through this long enough that now I donâ€™t see an end. Iâ€™ve cut so many time and stared at a noose or a pile of pills to much. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I have lived this long purely for my dog but she can survive with my parents. You can see my previous rant on my bio. Itâ€™s been good reddit. 
Fight the good fight,
