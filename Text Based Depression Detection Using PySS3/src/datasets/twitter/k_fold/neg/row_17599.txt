I feel that I'm stuck.My wife and I are fighting again. I said some things about divorce and I'm actually thinking of going through with it this time. However, I'm so fucking scared of being alone. I've got two boys (8 and 6) from a previous relationship. They stay with me at all times. Then my wife and I have two children. One boy (2) and a girl (4). If we get divorced, she will most likely move back to Texas. We live in Iowa currently. I can't lose my youngest two. I know that I'm not strong enough to make it without them. I'm so stuck and scared. I don't want to end up having my wife, but things aren't changing. I'm too lazy to do what she asks and she doesn't follow through on things she says she will do. I wish I never had kids so I could kill myself and not leave my kids behind. I'm trying to stay strong and keep on going for my kids, but it's incredibly hard. I just want some peace and happiness. I want that for my wife too and I can't give her that.
