Cry for helpHi everyone,

Can't believe it's come to this but I don't know what else to do. 

I'm 23 years old and I live in the UK. I also have cancer - ovarian, stage 3. 

I tried to overdose two weeks ago, but obviously failed. 

I am really struggling to find the motivation to keep going. I just want everything to end.
