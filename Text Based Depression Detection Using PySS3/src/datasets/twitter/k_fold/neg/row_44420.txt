Fuck-You Mother's DayThe woman who birthed me should've never had children. She's even called it "her biggest mistake" to me. Multiple times.  

She's been a lot of things, but never a mother. 

Thanks for the decade long eating disorder, "Mom". Thanks for the shame. The anxiety. The fear. And thanks for the betrayal of trust and the lies that have brought me to this point. Again. At 25 years old, I should've known better than to trust you. I foolishly thought that things could be different now that I'm older. 

You convinced me to give up my job so that I "could focus on education." It was just another way to get your talons back in me. A way to seal off the exits. 

I have no one else and I trusted you. And you betrayed that trust, then lied *repeatedly* about it. You can't lie yourself out of this again. 

I'm done with you. I'm done with your lies. I'm done with you turning my sister and father against me with your deceitful skills. 

You're a liar. A manipulator. A sorry excuse for a human being. A person who never admits fault. A perpetual "victim." 

The only reason I still have breath in my lungs is because of the dog. Not because of you. And that's not even enough right now. 

If I lose this battle, I will be sure to personally name you as the final straw. Maybe then, you'll take some goddamn responsibility for yourself. 

Even if you don't, at least I'll be free of further disappointments. Because I'll always still want you to act like a mother should, even when all you've ever done is act otherwise.
