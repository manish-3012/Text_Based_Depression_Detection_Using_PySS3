I feel like iâ€™m about to ruin my life and my familyâ€™s life and itâ€™s killing mewe had a speaker at school come in to tell us about dating violence and i had told her about my step dad who, to put it lightly, did some not good things. well i wrote it to her and iâ€™m not seeing her till Tuesday so i told my counselor. she had to report it and i had to talk to a detective and a dcs worker. i have no idea whatâ€™s about to happen because my mom will find out and knowing her, sheâ€™ll be on his side. sheâ€™ll probably not believe me or wonâ€™t think itâ€™s a big deal. iâ€™ve always thought of my step dad as a nice guy usually, but the program at school made me realize that he was manipulative as well. iâ€™m probably going to get my shit thrown out and never see her again and iâ€™m so scared about what will happen. i feel like its pointless to even keep going.
