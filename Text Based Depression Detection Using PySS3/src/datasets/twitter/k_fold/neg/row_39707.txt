My mood is up and down, but when it's down, it's really badI can't shake the feeling of wanting to die. I've chickened out many times before, and have even failed, but I feel more brave than usual to actually go through with it. I keep waiting for things to get better and it never happens. I think people would be happy if I died &amp; I would be happy too. There aren't any caring and nice people in my world and I have no hope at all. I feel like I'm not living, only existing. My relationships are near to none, guys are only interested in one thing at my age (21) so I have no companion to talk to about these things. I have a handful of friends but I feel like they don't understand what I'm going through. My emotions are so intense right now that I can't even fathom thinking about a happy future. I don't want to wake up tomorrow.
