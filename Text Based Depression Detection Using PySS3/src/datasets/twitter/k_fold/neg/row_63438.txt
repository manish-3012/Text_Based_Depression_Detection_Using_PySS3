loopbeen depressed since 2 years ago, i know it's not long but still. i've been wanting to pull the trigger long time ago too, but i just can't find the courage to do it. god i'm hopeless at everything. i have friends which are caring and such, but i feel weird opening up to them about depression. being an introvert makes it worse too. texted one of my close  friend just now, and he asked whether am i ok or not, i really really want to open up, but depression just takes over my mind and saying that i'm fine.  didn't even bother speaking about it to my family, as i'm trying to distance myself away from them since 2 years ago. i keep having suicidal thoughts over and over and over again even though on days where i'm fine. i don't know what to feel. i seriously don't know what to feel anymore. i'm sorry.
