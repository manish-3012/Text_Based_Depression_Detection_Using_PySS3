.Dearest Reddit

You and I have always been on great terms with one another always finding a way to put a smile on my face.

But the time has come to make my farewells.
I feel totally shattered, people whom I used to call my friends have stabbed in the back waaaaaay too many times for me to feel comfortable around them, I have watched several girls whom I have developed feelings for simply walk away and this has caused me unimaginable emotional pain simply because I believed they thought I was different.

They didn't.

And now here I am. Someone has to die and it is going to be me. There is no other way around it. I made mistakes and now I am paying for them, I will not emerge a better person if I live through this, I will simply become utterly destroyed. That is why I choose to end my life on MY terms. 

I thank you all for being there for me :D

See you in whichever afterlife you believe in.
