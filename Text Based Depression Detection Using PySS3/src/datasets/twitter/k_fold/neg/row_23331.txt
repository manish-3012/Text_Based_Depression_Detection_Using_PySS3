Thinking about it.Ever since I got married everything in my life has gotten so bad. While I love my wife, we got stuck raising her mentally challenged brother. She deals with her problems by working so she is never home and this Iâ€™m left to take care of him when Iâ€™m not working.

I work a job in customer service, so I spend all day getting yelled and then go home to be yelled at by him. I pity him because their parents abused him and it messed him up that much more. She says she will work to get him into a care facility but I know she is lying. She canâ€™t stand the idea of him being away and not being there to take care of him. She has told me outright that he will always be her priority now. 

I also have a chronic medical condition that is only going to get progressively worse with time so Iâ€™m in constant pain. Iâ€™m thinking of enduring 2-3 years to make sure she is at a point where they are stable financially and then just ending it. Itâ€™s not because Iâ€™m just upset, I know that can pass. I just donâ€™t want or have any more reason to live this life.
