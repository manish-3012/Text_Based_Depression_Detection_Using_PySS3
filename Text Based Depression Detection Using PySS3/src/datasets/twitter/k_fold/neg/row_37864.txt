AutopilotI woke around 6pm on the couch, I didnâ€™t remember falling asleep. I still had my pack on. Without thinking I got up and walked a few blocks to the grocery store, I purchased enough dog food to assure myself that they would be okay for a while. I cried uncontrollably the entire walk home. I fed them when I arrived home and said my goodbyes. I then went to the basement, grabbed a chair from the corner, grabbed the extension cord and tied it to a storage hook, wrapped it several times around my neck and checked to see if the hook would hold. The phone in my pocket started ringing and even given the circumstances, my curiosity got the best of me. I answered and it was a friend asking if I was okay. It was only then that I realized exactly what I was doing and stepped down, said I was okay and went back upstairs feeling rather empty. I felt like I was on suicide autopilot, guided by hands of the dark. Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal ideation for most of my teenage and into adult life, but nothing like this. I now feel like a ghost, a shell of a human, nothing, no one and everyone keeps asking if Iâ€™m okay, I donâ€™t know if this will happen again, but Iâ€™m not scared, in fact I wish I wouldâ€™ve just done it. Next time I wonâ€™t answer the phone.
