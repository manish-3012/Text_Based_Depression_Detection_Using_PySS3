So my parents just asked me what I wanted for my birthday...This is something that I did not think of when I chose my date. 
Seriously though, what the hell am I supposed to ask for? Candy? A fancy urn to put my ashes in?
I asked for nothing but they said no. 
How do I inconspicuously ask for something that my family could get more use out of than I would?
