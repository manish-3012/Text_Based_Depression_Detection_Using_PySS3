washed up friendi feel like since this depression spell has hit iâ€™ve been seeing a lot less of my friends + my friends are making new friends + friends with each other + truthfully i hope that works out for them. erase me + make it easier. 
iâ€™ve talked everyone down enough times to surely save my own ass a seat heaven, but i do not belong there + i am not as good at they make me out to be. iâ€™m sour + rotten + ugly + lost. 
iâ€™m likely soon not to be a part of invites, because iâ€™ve been watching this all unfold within the year and all signs are pointing away + im just waiting for the moment to pull the string.
