how to make this as little painful as possibleis there any way I can make this easier for my family? fake an accident might be it, but is it enough closure? I know families destroyed by accident, because all got ripped apart, without explanation. would it be better to write a note explaining why this has become unbearable? I am sure they would want the best for me, but I am probably not in the right mind and what I see as best for me might look as egoistical or a mistake, leaving them asking why I did it, and why I didn't ask for help. sorry, I am just trying to make this as easy as possible for my loved ones, I can't go on like this much longer
