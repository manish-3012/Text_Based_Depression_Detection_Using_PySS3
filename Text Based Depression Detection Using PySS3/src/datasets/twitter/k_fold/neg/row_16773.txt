Im lazy to live.Everyday i wake up, with same thoughts, the same routine, its like the same day everyday for me. I have nice friends that try to help me, the ask me how im doing and i started lying to them, saying that im fine and blablabla (i used to tell the truth before). I really think life is meanless,boring and live is suffer for me. Lost a lot of friends, loved relatives and one ,of my best firends, my girlfriend. Im writting this, because i cant hold this feeling in my mind, it makes me better writting it.
