I canâ€™t calm downGod I canâ€™t calm down I canâ€™t calm down I canâ€™t calm down, ever since Monday morning, Iâ€™ve been so fucking anxious and I donâ€™t even know why, itâ€™s not like anything different or especially bad has happened, but for the past week, I constantly feel like Iâ€™m about to have a panic attack. Sometimes I almost seem to calm down, or the energy turns into excitement instead of anxiety for a short amount of time, but it wonâ€™t last! None of my usual coping mechanisms (good or bad) are helping, I canâ€™t focus at all, Iâ€™ve barely done any school work and since itâ€™s the beginning of the second quarter, my grades have already dropped, Iâ€™m failing two classes, Iâ€™m trying so hard to get it done but I JUST CANâ€™T! The only thing I can focus on for longer than 5-10 minutes is drawing, but I canâ€™t just draw all day, I have so much I need to do! I just want to fucking die already. I havenâ€™t felt this suicidal and on edge in a couple of years, Iâ€™m so fucking tired but it wonâ€™t STOP! I feel sick, physically sick from all this anxiety.
