So close to justi'm sitting here at work and none of them know. i've been trying for months to make myself enjoy the things i used to. laughing with friends. everything is a lie. ive been searching ways on how to kill myself for months over and over how can they not tell? gave myself 100 days i only have until april 7. told somebody but he doesnt care enough to think it's true. i dont know who else to tell. like im sitting here and i want to die and they don't know a thing.
