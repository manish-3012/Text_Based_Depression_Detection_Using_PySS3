My therapist took me to the ERI scheduled an emergency visit with him for today. I attempted suicide last night. I obviously failed. So much shit has happened and I just wrote a suicide note and my friend was texting me and she talked me down. The next day I was still in a very rough place and not very safe. My therapist realized this and we spent half an hour talking and him trying to convince me to let him drive me. I eventually agreed and he drove me down to the hospital. It was reasonably quick that they got me a bed. I had to take off my sweatshirt and everything but I got to keep my leggings on. They gave me a robe and blanket, both of which were warm, which was nice. They took blood samples and I'm supposed to give a urine sample later. It's been hectic -- so many doctors kept asking me what I was in the ER for, asking me to describe how I did it. I'm going to miss school but my teachers are okay with it. It's really been a whirlwind and I'm still very ... (the word is not confused but it's something similar). There's someone watching me, but I'm just kinda chilling here for a bit.

Update: I've been committed to inpatient for 72 hours. They wouldn't let me go to the bathroom alone in the ER, but at least here I can pee alone. I'm strangely happy about that.
