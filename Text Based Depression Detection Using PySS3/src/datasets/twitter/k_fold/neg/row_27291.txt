Literally no point anymoreThis is kind of awkward and new to me since Iâ€™ve never in my life told anyone except one person but Iâ€™ve been suicidal and depressed since I was 16 and now Iâ€™m 22 and things have only gotten worse and will continue to get worse. I hate myself and hate my life, and after years of thinking about life Iâ€™ve realized that there is literally no point to it. Why do I want to live for 70+ years if Iâ€™m lucky and for all those years work for 50 years, from when Iâ€™m 15-65 and then once I retire sit on my ass all day and watch tv alone like an old fuck. Life is just a rinse and repeat cycle for the majority and then the other parts just arenâ€™t satisfying. Why cause more pain for myself. And no matter what I do the mistakes that I am constantly making effect everyone else around me more than myself and it truly is an awful feeling. I donâ€™t have the strength to keep going and even if I did I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d want to. Why have all these shitty memories over taking all of my good memories. The good memories are fading away at this point and I canâ€™t even fucking remember who I used to be when I was younger. Why take 60 years of shitty memories to the grave when I only need to take a few. I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore
