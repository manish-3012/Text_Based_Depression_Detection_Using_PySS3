I know I'm going to off myself.Not now, but one day. I don't see myself living to 25 at this rate. I was bullied and hated all throughout school, and I know high school problems don't matter but memories have continued to torment me years later and I'm sure they always will. It's affected my life to the point where I can't do anything right and I'm convinced that I'll continue to be rejected by everyone I interact with. It still happens every now and then. And I don't want to live life knowing that I'm this repulsive thing no one wants anything to do with. I figured I should at least get help, but my doctor can't even bring herself to care about me. So I know that I'll end it eventually.
