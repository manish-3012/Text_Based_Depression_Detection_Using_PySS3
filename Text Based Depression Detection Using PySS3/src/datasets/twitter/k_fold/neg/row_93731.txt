Emotionally DrainedI feel like I'm emotionally drained. I'm pretty sure my family wouldn't care if I died. All I ever do is make situations worse. I hardly have any friends except for on twitter so I'll probably be easily forgotten. I selected a suicide date but I'm unsure if I should even wait for that date to come.
