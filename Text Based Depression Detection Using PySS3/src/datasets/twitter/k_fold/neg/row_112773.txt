Not sure why I'm posting this but I'm done.I'm 21, I had a full ride scholarship to a good university with a double major and a heart full of blind ambition.  I only need a few more classes to graduate, but I let my mental state affect my studies and at this point I'm likely to lose my scholarship funding and be expelled from university.  I'm not sure how to word my thoughts, as I've always found great trouble in expressing my emotion.  I found out in conversations with my Grandmother that my mom was concerned I was autistic as a small child, as I expressed many of the 'symptoms'.  I have since been diagnosed with ADHD, but both of those points are only meant to convey that I'm pretty bad at expressing how I feel.

&amp;nbsp;

I like to think of things in terms of their components, so I'm going to explain my whole college situation in a few parts.

&amp;nbsp;

Academics: I've basically ruined everything these past three semesters by failing four classes and dropping two to avoid failure.  The classes were disappointingly easy, but I failed all of them due to missing discussion/laboratory attendance checks, not turning in homework etc.  I even had an embarrassing moment in which a professor called me up in front of a ~75 person lecture hall during the final exam and berated me because he did not recognize me, and did not believe I was enrolled.  I already received the first e-mail this morning about 'revoked funding'. 

&amp;nbsp;

New Friends: In my four years of attendance the only friends I have made are via mutual friends of the only two people I befriended from my dorms.  Rather than the lush social life I had envisioned for myself, I can count on one hand the number of college friends I have.  There were a few times where I almost made new friends, but they never stick around.  The longest time I maintained a friend was three months, I still miss her, we used to talk about stuff.  I've thought about casually texting some of these people to hang out, but then I look their facebook pages and assume they would look at mine, and I decide not to text anyone.

&amp;nbsp;

Old Friends: I want to keep a long story short, my high school buddies who go to my university hang out with each each other but exclude me because for a brief period of time I was a "downer" (they're probably right). So, no.

&amp;nbsp;

Another way to make friends: As the only member and president of a mental health organization, over 3 years I managed to grow membership and create a healthy organization (well, affiliate) dedicated to mental health awareness.  I had already given up my head position (the organization's gotta grow), but the executive board that I created decided to kick me out.  I thought I had become friends with these people that helped me grow this humanitarian organization, but I guess I must have some character flaws if they really can't stand being around me.

&amp;nbsp;

Other shit that bothers me: anxiety, depression, I am more of a drug dealer than a "son" to my father, molested when I was 8 (not really relevant), lack of social interaction, unbearable apathy 
&amp;nbsp;


Sorry if this is hard to read, I'm high and rambling.
Basically, I think I'm done, and I think I'm going to finally get some sleep.
