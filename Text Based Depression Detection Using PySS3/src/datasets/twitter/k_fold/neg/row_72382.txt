I wish my family would help meI've been suffering with suicidal thoughts and tendencies for years now and it's only got worse over the years. Being a broke 18 year old drop out with no money or insurance in the US, I'm not really currently in the position to get help. But they really don't make it any better. They just call me lazy and it hurts so much because I was already hurting inside, enough to come to someone else for help. I post here way too often, and it's probably because my "friends" all ignore me. My family doesn't include me on anything they do, I'm always left out. My "friends" want nothing to do with me because I'm never happy enough for them. I feel like I type out this post with different words every other night. I'm just so tired of being alone and suffering. All the people I thought really cared about me basically abandoned me when I became depressed. To just now come to the realization that no one actually cares how I feel is devastating. I literally just stay in bed all day at this point, and I'm more of a burden on everyone than anything. I just want the loneliness and suffering to stop. That's all I want and I just can't have it no matter how hard I try.
