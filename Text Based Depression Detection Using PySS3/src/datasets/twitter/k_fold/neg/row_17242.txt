Should euthanasia be available for mentally ill patients?I have extremely resistant depression and thereâ€™s nothing for me to live for other than not destroying my family. 

Nothing gives me joy. Hope is nonexistent. Well, basically any positive emotion is since Iâ€™ve never felt any. Every second of every day, I just wish I had cancer or that I could die. 

The only happiness I have is knowing that one day, my death is 100% guaranteed. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. 

Iâ€™ve lived like this for all 19 years of my life, almost 20. Nothing can make me â€œbetter.â€ Help doesnâ€™t help other than increasing my desire to die.
