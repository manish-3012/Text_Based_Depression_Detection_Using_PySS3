Only thing keeping me here is my mom who has stage 4 cancerI have just been overwhelmed lately 
I dont have it bad by any means, i go to a good school. I am doing pretty well. I dont have many friends but thats ok. My mom loves me. But i cant get over the fact that i hate myself and anyone i try to get close with, i push away or let my insecurities eat me alive. Im just not understanding how to see past tonight some days, it seems to get harder and harder.
