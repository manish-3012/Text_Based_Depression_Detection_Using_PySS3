No matter how hard I try no one acknowledges me.I live life too scared to talk out loud. Most days I don't speak more than 2 sentences in total. I don't have any friends with who (would it be whom? I don't get that rule) I can talk. When I can finally talk to someone I'm so proud of myself for not being a complete failure. But no one ever cares. Ever. People ignore me and pretend I don't exist. Death is the best choice I think. I don't like being alone. No one wants to be friends with an ugly cutter who has no worth.
