I just don't get it..It's like, I push off my depression as much as I can to have fun with friends on a night out, and as soon as I'm by myself I have suicidal thoughts... I really don't get it. I hate myself so much. I come home visibly sad and my roommate asks me if I'm okay, I instantly chipper up and tell him "no I'm fine, I just am tired and don't feel well." As soon as we stop interacting, boom gut-wrenching depression.
