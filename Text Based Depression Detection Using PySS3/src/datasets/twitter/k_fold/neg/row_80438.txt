I'm incompatible with life.Notes to mom, brother, ex husband, son.
Give Michel my Jack White ticket
Steal grandpas shotgun
Save money to see the ocean (Never have before)
Road trip to ocean. Family won't find me there. 

I've been thinking about it for years. Building my conviction for years. I'm so tired of being tired and alone. I know life is beautiful. I know people love me. I'm just incompatible with everything, everyone. I'm ready. I'm not even scared.
