Just got turned down for a job, I've never felt like a job was more perfect for me.It had everything, all of my experience matches it perfectly, my interviews were perfect, I got on really really well with everyone I met whilst I was there, just, everything.

Then bam, turned down, "someone else was better unfortunately".

Can't even go and get a job that was on a silver platter, what's the fucking point anymore.
