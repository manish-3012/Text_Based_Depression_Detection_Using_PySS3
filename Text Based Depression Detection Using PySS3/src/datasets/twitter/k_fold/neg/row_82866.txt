I really want help, but I don't know how to get it?I've been constantly, highly contemplating suicide for the last five days, and I have enough strong prescription drugs stockpiled to do it, but I don't want to. I really just want things to be okay, and I want to grow up and get married and be a musician and raise cats, but I feel like I'm trapped, and I can't get away from my anxiety and nightmares and an extremely strong desire to end my life, and it's so hard, and I wish I could just get the thoughts to go away, and I want help, but I'm so afraid to tell my parents that I want help, because I think they'll be angry and I still won't get help and then I'll be even worse off. I don't want to die, I just want to feel normal again and I feel like wanting to be normal again is hopeless because I never will be. I start my junior year of high school in a week and I'm really worried that the added stress from that and the horrible ways that my classmates treat me is going to push me to do it. I don't know what to do. I've been depressed before due to past traumas, but it's never felt so out of my control. I just don't know how to get help, but I want it so badly.
