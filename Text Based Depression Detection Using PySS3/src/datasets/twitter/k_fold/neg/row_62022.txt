Life is So ExhaustingI don't think I actually will kill myself, but thats because I'm too scared to, and not because I don't want to. I've thought for many months. I'm really stressed at the moment. My mother is a  textbook narcissist and radical christian. I wouldn't say she was a terrible mother, but she certainly had her moments. She always passive aggressively attacks my sister for moving in with her boyfriend. She's all about how we were put on this earth only to suffer, and all that bullshit. It freaks my sister out every time she starts going on about any of that stuff.  I'm at home right now with my parents for summer break from college trying my best to be the mediator between my mom and my sister. My sister constantly comes to me for advice about what to do, even though I'm the younger brother. My dad on the other hand is one of my favorite people in the world, but I worry about him so much. He does all the work around the house, handles all the finances, 90% of the cooking and cleaning. Takes care of all the animals (I basically live on a farm), and nobody takes care of him. I try my best when I'm home to help him as much as I can. I bust my ass to help him out, keep my mom off her mean side, and protect my sister. Me personally, I'm so lonely and sad all the time, I don't have any friends really, and I'm just so tired. The idea of not existing anymore seems so wonderful. I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up.
