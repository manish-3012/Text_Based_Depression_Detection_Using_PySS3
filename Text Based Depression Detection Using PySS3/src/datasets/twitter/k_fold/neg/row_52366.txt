I don't know what to do.I feel really lost and stuck. The things causing my depression and anxiety are relatively out of my control. I both want to die and do not. I see no-other way out but I don't want to hurt my family and friends. But I've been like this for so many years and I feel alone. I don't really know why I'm making this post, guess I'm just hoping for someone to say something that makes sense.
