I'd rather die than lose my husband.Recently I have slowly dug myself into a hole of lies with our finances. I thought I had it handled and it just got worse every payday. I kept getting payday loans to make ends meet and the entire time I told my husband everything is fine. Now everything's becoming too much and we don't even have $50 for the next two weeks for food or gas. 

I lied to him because 5 or 6 years ago I made a similar mistake except not a million payday loans, I poorly budgeted our money and when we went on a vacation it all blew up because we suddenly had no money. 

He saved me from my abusive family and I moved 500 miles away from my family to live with him as soon as I turned 18. I would do anything to stay with him. He's my entire life even if I make horrible mistakes. 

My husband recently told me these exact words "to me, love is trust. If there is no trust there is no relationship". Without him I am nothing.

I have never been suicidal until these last few weeks and now that it's too hard I'm done. I have to tell him and lose him or die. I want to die before he has a chance to leave me. 

I think I'm going to play it off like it's nothing for the next 2 weeks and after my sister comes and visits us. I don't want to ruin her vacation plans to visit me and see this band. After she leaves I will kill myself. 

I don't know how i will do it because I am scared of pain but I have to do it. I can't live without my sweet husband.
