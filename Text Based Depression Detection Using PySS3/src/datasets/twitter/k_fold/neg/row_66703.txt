I hate how much I isolate myself. But good god do I just fucking hate being around other peopleI long to be able to enjoy spending time with others, but eventually everyone gives me a reason to be disappointed in them. The worst part is thatâ€™s all on me, Iâ€™m not someone designed to be social but the loneliness was crippling. Iâ€™m a misanthrope for seemingly no reason, and itâ€™s the reason living is shit
