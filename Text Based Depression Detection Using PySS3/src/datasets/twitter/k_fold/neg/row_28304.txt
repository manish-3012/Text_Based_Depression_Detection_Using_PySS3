TonightThrowaway account. I know weâ€™ve seen this a lot before, people saying today is the day.
Iâ€™ve struggled with depression since I was a teenager. Quietly, aside from doctors and therapists, only speaking to my ex-husband about it but he encourages me, or tells me Iâ€™ve always been a coward. 

Today is the day. I am driving 5 hours to a park that is one of the darkest spots on the East Coast, Iâ€™m going to lay out a blanket in the middle of the field, drink a bottle of wine, look at every single star, the Milky Way, and take a full bottle of Percocet and Xanax. These are prescribed and filled yesterday. 

Iâ€™ve been to therapy. Been on every anti-depressant anti-anxiety bi-polar combination possible. This has been my struggle since I was 15. I am now 31. Not once have I had a good year. Not once have I said â€œIt will get better.â€ And then it actually does, itâ€™s never happened for me. I drag through life with every attempt to see any color or happiness and it never happens. My family is established and well known and loved by everyone, but Iâ€™m the misfit. Iâ€™m the woman that became nothing but a housewife to a wealthy man who cheated and kicked me out of our house and life two years ago all within an hour one Memorial Day. 

Iâ€™ve tried building my own life and creating my own foundation. There are some weeks I have $5 to fuel my car and feed myself and my son for the week. (Iâ€™ve applied for assistance, the system in the US is an absolute joke). Iâ€™ve actually been caught and arrested for stealing a bag of groceries because I had absolutely no food and no help. I was so hungry. 

I have a son. He is 9 and autistic. Unfortunately, I feel this an easy way out. He will be upset when Iâ€™m gone, but he will get over it quickly and adjust. He is better off with his father. He is able to provide him with a good home and time spent at home when all I can give is a tiny apartment and work 12 hours a day with absolutely nothing to show. 

This was long. But this is my life. And Iâ€™ve had it. Iâ€™m simply just finished with existing. Every time Iâ€™m driving over 60mph, I want to jerk the wheel to the right and pray I hit a tree. This is no way to live. Iâ€™ve tried everything. Nothing works. I am cursed and I am ending it all. No pity needed. No need to talk me out of it. Iâ€™m leaving a note for my son and thatâ€™s it. Not a single family member has ever loved me enough to get the dignity of a goodbye from me. Thank you for listening.
