Tonight will be the lastWith any luck. I first attempted ten years ago when I was sixteen. I struggled for a long time then when I was 21 I had a relationship which I thought would never end. We loved one another for who we were, got engaged, had nothing but pure honest love.

Then it ended. After three years, because my mental health deteriorated for months and I was in so much denial. I thought things would never ever get better.

Then a year ago I met someone. I fell in love and so did she. But of course depressed reared its ugly head again and everything else that came along with it. Paranoia, insecurity. It ended.

So now I'm here. I haven't told anyone what I plan to do. I've got a gram of cocaine, 2 grams of weed and some booze. Once I'm fucked up, I'll take a noose and end everything.

To anyone else suffering, I hope you make it. Some of us do and some don't. Best of luck to all of you.
