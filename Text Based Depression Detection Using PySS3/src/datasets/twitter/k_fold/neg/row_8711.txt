Iâ€™ve never felt suicidal until recentlyProbably dropping out of uni for the 2nd time and the shame of telling my parents is so much, it was the first time I really considered killing myself. 

Iâ€™m not super close with anyone, including my family, and this was all I had. 

Itâ€™s something thatâ€™s been in the back of my mind the past couple of days.
