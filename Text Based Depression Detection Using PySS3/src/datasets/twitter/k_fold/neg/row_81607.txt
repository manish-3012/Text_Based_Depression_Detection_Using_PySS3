Iâ€™m 13 and planning suicideFor a good year Iâ€™ve considered suicide but never had a gun. I recently looked it up and discovered that you could kill yourself using sleeping pills, which there are a lot of. Iâ€™m planning to write a will and notes to everyone I know and do it about a month after my fourteenth bday.
