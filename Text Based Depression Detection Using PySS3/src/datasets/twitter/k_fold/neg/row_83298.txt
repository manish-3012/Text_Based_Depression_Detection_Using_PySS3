I'm hanging myself tonightThe dissonance is far too much to bear. Neglect makes me desperate for any sort of attention and validation so I'll post outrageous trash online in a mad attempt to scream ar the void and have even a singular soul say 

"I hear you"

Instead of continuing this toxic trend that years of therapy and medications and myself have failed, I'm just going to end it.

Who needs silly emotions when you're hanging in your closet by a noose you've tied too many times in your life. 

Whoever I actually was, nobody got to meet him.
