I just don't want to be a disappointment anymore.I keep falling back into my suicidal thoughts. It used to be once a month, now it's twice a week. The only reason I'm still here is so I don't dissapoint the few people who DO care. I'm grateful that they care, but sometimes I wish they didn't so I wouldn't disappoint them if I killed myself. I'm afraid my depression will drive these people away like I usually do. I just had to type down my feelings.
