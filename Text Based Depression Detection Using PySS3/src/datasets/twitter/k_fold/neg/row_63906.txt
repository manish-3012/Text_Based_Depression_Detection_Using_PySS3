Is this how it starts?I have no diagnosis, and I wonâ€™t claim that Iâ€™m depressed until I have one. But Iâ€™m constantly fighting these thoughts of being an awful, lazy, worthless person. My mood seems to dip suddenly from moment to moment. Iâ€™m not sure how to describe it.

I have been struggling with self harm for just over a year now. For 18 years, I was certain that I would never do such a thing. I never thought that I would cut myself, or want to commit suicide.

But I hit a low point, and I started thinking about self harm after an small accidental injury. The thoughts passively creeped in until I was thinking about it every day. I just wanted them to stop. I was desperate enough to actually try cutting myself. I had hoped that my brain would remember that pain is bad and then the thoughts would stop, but that didnâ€™t happen. Instead I became addicted to self harm.

I experienced some fleeting suicidal ideation at my most desperate, but that went away after I started cutting myself. But a few weeks ago it started to come back. Iâ€™m a little scared. I didnâ€™t take my thoughts of self harm seriously, and now Iâ€™m immersed in it. 

There are people who love me, even though I donâ€™t think I deserve it. I canâ€™t do this to them. Should I say something? They found out about the self harm, and theyâ€™ve been so supportive, but nothing seems to help. I donâ€™t want to be locked up somewhere or hospitalized. Iâ€™m unmotivated, but still functional, I shouldnâ€™t need constant supervision. There are other people who need help way more than me. 

Iâ€™m so confused. I donâ€™t want to die, I donâ€™t want to hurt the people I love. But Iâ€™m so tired of these thoughts. Iâ€™m so tired of waiting to feel better. Iâ€™m a drag on other peopleâ€™s lives. Iâ€™m a disappointment. Iâ€™ve been given an easy life, but I donâ€™t deserve it. Iâ€™ve never had a real job, I complain about the smallest of things. If Iâ€™m not going to contribute to anything, why should I reap any benefits? I feel like a bother to everyone. I wish I could shut myself off from the world and never inflict my presence on them ever again.

I just need to know, can these thoughts go away? Or will they escalate, like my thoughts of self harm, until I finally act on them?
