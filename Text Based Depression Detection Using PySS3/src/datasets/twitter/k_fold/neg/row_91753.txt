i want to kill myself. please help.so i'm at a high and high-pressure school. i'm terrified, guys. i have quotes for my last 2 finals (Weds morning and Fri), but I keep freezing. I want to die. I haven't studied as much as I need to because I'm disabled and that's really been taking it out of me - I accidentally overslept for 20 hours (!!! I know) after my first 2.

 I've attempted suicide before and it didn't work (took a year out, felt better, but the last 2 yrs have really taken its out of me.) i feel like i'm about to fail &amp; am terrified, but don't want to walk away because i can't stand the thought that all this has been for nothing. can someone help?
