I wish my parents would pass away so I could take my life without hurting them and itâ€™s the worst feeling in the world.I feel like Iâ€™m suffocating on my own life - destine to strive for the middle class dream made up in the â€˜50s, go to school, work until I retire have two kids. Cute when everything was exponentially cheaper, and the education system wasnâ€™t ready to rob you blind and watch you fail. The political climate is fucked the actual climate is fucked the world has real issues and the insignificance of me is laughable so if I could without hurting others why wouldnâ€™t I.
