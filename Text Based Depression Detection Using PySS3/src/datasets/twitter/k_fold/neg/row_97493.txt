When your conscience and clear mind has determined it's time.To whomever may read this:

Growing up society has taught us that we're in this together. To look to your left and right. To consider those people and to have them consider you. Something always felt off to me about it all. Coming from an unstable childhood  with no proper parental figures nor role models, I was always told people have it worse/going through the same ordeal. It wasn't until i went to a therapist that I was informed that  everything up and to my current life situation was by no means "normal" or "ok". Years of childhood/teenage/adult trauma not "bottled up" but rather written  off as "The norm" or "what everyone goes through". During my youth there were times when emotions ran so high that i considered "resting" to give it a more thought out term. I was told the feeling will pass and is apart of growing. I was told things  would get better. With my emotions and thoughts in check, my history taken into consideration, I can most definitely without a doubt say......things have never gotten better. Continually  things proceed to get worse and worse. I am not sad, I am not lonely, I am not afraid. I am tired. I am so so very tired. When asked what was the last happy memory I had, I was taken back. Shocked as to find that I coudn't  remember no matter how hard I tried. Excitement, joy, sorrow were all things I had put on  as a facade to blend in to work and home and friends. I  don't  remember feeling anything. Growing up I never developed correctly. I struggled with anxiety and paranoia. I felt as if everyone would leave me at one point in time, which in turn ruined a great many frienships/relationships. Only one time did one girl I was dating see that it wasn't about her. That it was something much deeper. She offered to help but once I realized that she knew i pushed her away out of fear that it would be too much and she would leave anyways. I'm just so tired, of  loss, waking up everyday, pretending as if things are going to get better. It's scary for someone to experience an inconvenience and determine that it is their time. It's an otherwordly feeling when without emotion you determine that you want to rest. I have no motivation nor will. No expectations nor excitement. No attachments nor responsibilities. I have come here as a last resort. Something I owe to my conscience mind. To counsel and determine to an absolute that my  time  is up.  So please, by all means. Remember this isn't driven by  an inconvenient emotion or happen chance. This has been  stirring for quite a while.
