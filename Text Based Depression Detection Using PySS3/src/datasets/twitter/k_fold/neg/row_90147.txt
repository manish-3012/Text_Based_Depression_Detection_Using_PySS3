Accident anyone?Scrolling through Facebook and general news outlets I always see these small blips about ppl dying accidentally, and I always wonder why not me? Why canâ€™t I die in a freak accident by AirPOD, or a heart attack in my sleep?!!
Life seems so hard for me. 
Yet itâ€™s not as bad as the stuff I read here which is why I come on this site. 
To talk myself down from the proverbial ledge.  
I have it pretty good, ppl like me, ppl think Iâ€™m attractive although I donâ€™t, and I donâ€™t like myself. 
Also worth noting is that Iâ€™m going through a really tough breakup and at the same time Ive also broke my ankle, plus I had to relocate to somewhere I donâ€™t want to be. 
Emotionally Iâ€™m drained. I want to be with my partner but I worry that I fukD up so bad this time that I wonâ€™t be able to have them anymore. 
And although I know I wasnâ€™t alone in the screwup that was our relationship, I canâ€™t stop feeling the blame and wishing myself away just to stop the pain. 
The pain of ruining an otherwise decent relationship and the pain of betraying the trust we had. 
I just want my friend back. 
Worse is I have several other ppl who are trying to court me, but all I want is my friend back. 
Also worth noting that I havenâ€™t masturbated in almost a month now which was something I did daily and also contributed to the demise of my relationship. 
I wonder if I did jerk off, would I feel better. 
Probably not. 
I just want to die, or have my friend back. 
I also know that if I die, the option for things to turn around are squashed.  
Long story short-
It would be so much easier to die. 
Worse part is due to my broken bones I canâ€™t even get to anywhere to do it.
