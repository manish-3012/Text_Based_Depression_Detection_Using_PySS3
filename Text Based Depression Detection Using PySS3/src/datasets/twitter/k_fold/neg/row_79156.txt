TitleBroke up with my "girlfriend" a month ago and today she told me me she never had anything for me and was just using me for validation. Apparently she also cheated on me with 2 different guys. She was the only person I felt some sort of closeness to and I really loved her. How am I even supposed to cope with this? It hurts like hell and I have absolutely nobody to talk to about it. I'm literally unable to function, I'm just trying my best to get through the day.
