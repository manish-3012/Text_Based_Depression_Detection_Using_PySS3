I'm never getting out of hereI've been living in a rent subsidized apartment for 6 years on account of being unable to maintain FT employment due to severe depression. My neighbors are atrocious, loud and ignorant AF. My neighbor above me OD'd and I'm actually jealous of her. I wonder if she went peacefully and if she did it on purpose. I turned 30 last month. I feel like I'm never going to be able to leave this place. I think I'm going to die here just like she did.
