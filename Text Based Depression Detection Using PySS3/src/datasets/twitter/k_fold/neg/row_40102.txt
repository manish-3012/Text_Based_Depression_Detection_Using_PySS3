No one caresI can prove it. I have three friends I talk to.

  


Today I'm stressed to the point that I'm falling apart. I have to find a place to live by the end of the month. All three asked why I was stressed. I explained. At some point I mentioned that I'm having a hard time dealing with suicidal thoughts.

  


Two immediately stopped talking and haven't responded in hours. The third says "not going down this road today".

  


Not even my 'friends' care.
