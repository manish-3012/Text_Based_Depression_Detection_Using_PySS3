Reddit encouraged me to post this here so its a WIBTA question. Would I be the asshole if I told my exs best friend about her suicidal threats?My (now) ex girlfriend of 2 years and I just had our final break up. Weâ€™ve broken up a few times in the past , all of them had been â€œher faultâ€ as in of her actions. I wonâ€™t go into details but Iâ€™ve always gone back and forgave her. One of the time she threatened me with suicide if I didnâ€™t return. (I was about to board a plane to korea for a few months but as far as she knew it was forever). I eventually returned she said she got therapy and I did see a change in her and her actions, but then quarantine in the US broke out and so our therapy stopped. Long story short we broke up in a messy argument that I caused. It was my own insecurities , and she kicked me out of the house. Didnâ€™t let me take my dog and gave my dog away. 3 weeks prior to this when I tried to leave , she physically didnâ€™t let me and said if I tried to leave that I would come back to a pool of blood and her laying on the ground dead. 
- she knew this would keep me there because I just recently lost my SIL to suicide. 

My dilemma is this because I donâ€™t know if this is over stepping her boundaries or what. 


So my question is , WIBTA if I did reach out to one of her best friends and tell her to keep an eye out on my ex because of said threats? (I donâ€™t think she knows about them and Iâ€™m not sure if I am overstepping a boundary but Iâ€™m also scared of what she might do) 

Also - her best friend isnâ€™t taking the pandemic seriously so then I worry she will want to go visit her everyday or every other day  and Iâ€™m scared sheâ€™ll get Covid.
