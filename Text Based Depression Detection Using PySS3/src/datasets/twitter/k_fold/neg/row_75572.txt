Having suicidal thought but I am still in control...Hi. Here is my story: https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/4ue3fn/i_can_feel_the_depression_coming_all_comments_and/

Because of all these family problems, which have existed since I was 5, I feel overwhelmed and deeply burdened. I am always trying to do things to make myself happy. Every day is a struggle to keep myself sane and it is very tiring. 

I am asking myself if it is all worth it. I am tired and sick of taking care of myself. I heal, then a problem arises again and I feel tired. I feel like a victim of circumstances from which I cannot run away.

I wouldn't kill myself because it would hurt my family. But these suicidal thought are very disturbing. I had taken 50 mg Lustral for 1 year and my doctor switched to 75 mg 3 days ago. Can this be the reason? How can I get rid of these feelings?
