I Really Want to Kill Myself but Other Times I Can't Even Imagine Wanting to do it.For the past while I've been suicidal. Recently though I've thought about it a few times a day. I'll have a good day sometimes where I'll think about how I am working on getting help and all that. Normally I feel sad but not suicidal. However I get these kinda pitfalls where I'll feel depressed and that's when I continue to make my plan, perfect my suicide note, practice tying nooses. Not able to start therapy until two weeks from now and don't want to talk about it with my family.

I don't know what to do. Each time I get depressed it seems to be worse. I'm worried I'll get in that mind space again and actually go through with it soon

Edit: Really don't want to do any inpatient thing either, I'm worried it would screw with my life/ school far too much
