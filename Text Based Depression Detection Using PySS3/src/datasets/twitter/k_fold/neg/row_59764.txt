Options for a Friend with NothingI'm not too sure what to do..  I became friends with someone that others warned against, due to them being a walking disaster.  Because I refuse to let such chaos control who I am kind to.  But, I have no idea how to get them on some kind of stable path.

She's 21, alone, and has a 2 year old daughter.  Her entire family are absolute savages.  And she struggles as a result of never having a healthy support structure.  She's at least stopped all recreational drug use and puts her daughter first.  And she doesn't have a history of addiction.  But...  between being a horrible driver and getting into constant wrecks, having no assistance from family and nearly no friends, she simply can not get a break.

I help her out occasionally, financially.  She never asks, and is extremely ashamed to ask for help.  And there's really never a week that goes by where she doesn't consider suicide.

Unfortunately, I'm stuck with a complicated room mate situation and I'm having trouble finding good people who are okay with living with a single mother.  I really don't know many people myself, I guess.

I don't even think she can go to a halfway house, due to not have a bad history/record with abuse/drugs/etc.  And she doesn't need someone looking over her.

She just needs good people in her life.  A good room mate.  And...  I dunno.  I wish she could get a job where she didn't have to drive at all.  She's just had her fourth wreck in under two months.  And constantly repairing her car is destroying all of her attempts to become independent.

I'm not even sure what to ask...  I'm doing what I can..

I've crawled out of this void myself over many, many years.  But I at least had one or two people there for me.  Seeing so many horrible, horrible people in one person's life - and not a single good person - is just too cruel.  And I can't do enough.

Anyways.. thanks for any tips.
