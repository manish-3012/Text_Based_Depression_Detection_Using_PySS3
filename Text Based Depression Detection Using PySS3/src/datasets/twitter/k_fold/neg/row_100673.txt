Suffering from severe suicidal depression, I think it's caused by Chantix.  I'll be ok.I started taking this drug again a week or so ago because I wanted to quit smoking, and also because I suspect it played a role in my multiple suicide attempts recently when I was taking this drug, and I wanted to test this theory.  It turns out I was right.  I stopped taking it today.  It's so difficult to think of anything but suicide.  I know it's just a reaction to the drug, and it will pass in a few days.  It's still very very hard to fight these impulses.  It's so strange to both know that it's not real intellectually but also feel the compulsion physically to such a degree that you can watch yourself taking actions that you don't want to take, and being powerless to stop.

Anyways, I'm fine.  I just needed to write this out, perhaps more for myself than for any other reason.  You don't need to respond, go help others who are in need.

I did quit smoking, though, so it worked.
