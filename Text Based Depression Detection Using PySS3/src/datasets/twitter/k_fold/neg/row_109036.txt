I just don't fucking know why.So I posted here about 3 months ago. A shitty post with shitty grammar and just overall shit. I set a date but fuck it. I probably won't kill myself.

It's like a roller-coaster. I start at the bottom, feeling like shit but then I say to myself: "Hey, maybe it isn't so bad, maybe life is great." and so life gets pulled up by the chain. Then I reach the peak, and I feel great, I'm happy and all those other positive feelings. And I bet you saw this coming, I have to get down eventually, and I do, be it because of my father or my "friends" or just my own self hate I become sad again. Then it just starts over.

I wanna try to fix it but I don't know how. I guess this is my life.

Sorry for the bad grammar again.
