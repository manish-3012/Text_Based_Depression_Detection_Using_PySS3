Depressed and aloneI live in a situation that is very dysfunctional and it's hard to talk to the people around me bcuz they think I'm just being weak/overdramatic/weird whatever they think, my thing is I'm trying so hard for nothing, my friends don't like me they literally treat me like I don't exist unless I have money or I can do something for them. I want to get out there and meet people But I'm pretty sure people don't like me. Ive been told I'm intense. I just feel sometimes I don't want to deal with people's bull, people get to say what they want and people flock to the lies, I say what I want and I'm weird and shouldn't be paid attention to. All I know is that life is making me very sad I don't think the world is a place for me.
