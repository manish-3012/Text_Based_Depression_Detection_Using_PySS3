What am I to do when nothing matters to me?I've lost interest in everything. Nothing seems interesting or fun, I dont care about anything I used to and it feel weird how I used to want to be good at studies or other stuff and now I dont give a shit if I were to go homeless. I know my situation is good and I shouldn't complain about anything but I just can't care at all even though I try to get interested, I'm just pretending to be in the end.
