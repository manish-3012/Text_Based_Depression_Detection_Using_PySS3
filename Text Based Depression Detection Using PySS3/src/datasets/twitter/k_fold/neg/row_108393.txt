im backso ive been gone for quite a while, last time i was on i told everyone i was going to hang myself in a few hours from the post going up... i tried... but i failed yet again. i then ended up cutting myself really deep then crying on the floor. ive been gone for a while because i just needed a break from all this stuff and i needed to concentrate on my future (if i even have one that is) and if i get through past my teens, ive decided to try and be a musician and i want to be in a band and travel the world together, that seems like a fun idea right? im still depressed as fuck but i got some shit figured out now at least.
