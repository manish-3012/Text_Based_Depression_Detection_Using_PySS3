Sudden motivation to do everything before killing myself?Has anyone experienced a sudden motivation to do things because of your suicidal thoughts? 

I just canâ€™t do it anymore. Every month it gets worse, every year gets worse, it never ends. But at the same time, Iâ€™m more motivated than I ever was before to truly try to do things, because Iâ€™ve always had a fear of failure, or that things were pointless, but now it doesnâ€™t matter and I donâ€™t care, Iâ€™ll do everything Iâ€™ve been wanting to do. 

Iâ€™ll give myself some months. I canâ€™t imagine things getting worse. But it depresses me because, despite when things start to go well, it has always gotten worse in the end. 

I canâ€™t escape from this nightmare. I have even dreamt my suicidal thought track, and Iâ€™m fearful. I canâ€™t even sleep well, I probably have some sleep disorder too. 

Everyday is living hell, itâ€™s as if my reality is carefully designed in the best way possible to torture someone. There is no hope for me, and I am terrified of myself. Iâ€™m scared of myself. I hate myself, even though sometimes I donâ€™t, I still do. I hate everything else too. I hate it all. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve already fallen, like Iâ€™m already dead, and this is the ongoing nightmare- like there is no escape, thereâ€™s no escaping the clock, there is no getting out. Iâ€™ve hit a new fucking low and I canâ€™t fucking believe how this is even possible.
