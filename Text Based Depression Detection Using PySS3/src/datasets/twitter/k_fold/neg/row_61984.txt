Finding it hard to stick aroundMy life has slowly been falling apart since August.  I lost my job of 10 years and my wife wants to split, unrelated.  She says she felt like this since before I lost my job and didn't want to burden with me with it after losing my job but couldn't live like that anymore.  I'm not abusive.  I've done everything you're supposed to do, but I have been a little distant and I was trying to get closer to her, but I think since she felt this way she was already closed off to my attempts.  

Now we will have to move away from each other.  I'll see less of my daughter, and less of my wife.  It doesn't feel real, and I don't know how long I can be strong enough to stick around.  I keep thinking that my kid is only 3.  She will ultimately never really miss me.
