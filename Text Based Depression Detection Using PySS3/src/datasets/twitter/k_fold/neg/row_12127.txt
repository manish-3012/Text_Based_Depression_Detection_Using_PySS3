If it wasn't for music I would of killed myself by now.I've always been described as someone with potential. And potential is all it was. I've been good at things, and just dropped them. I feel hopeless sometimes, a failure. 

I've never had someone on the regular around to talk to, or a hand to hold. I don't have anything in common with my parents, and I won't talk to them. I feel like my friends are fake. Don't even bother asking me if I've had a girlfriend.

Music is the only reason I'm here. If you know, or have felt that "Wow, life is incredible" feeling, nothing else gives me it. Whether I'm at home, lying on my bed, listening to my absolute favourite album of all time shutting out the rest of my surroundings (Porter Robinson's Worlds) or at the front row at a concert in absolute euphoria, it always seems to pull me from the pain.

Can anyone relate?
