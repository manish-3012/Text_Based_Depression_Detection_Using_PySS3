I need some helpI have been getting close to a friend for a few months now, and ive always wondered why she didnt want to be in a relationship, she always just said she didnt want to be in one. Well today I found out that the reason was that she is extremely depressed. and is considering suicide. She didnt want to drag me into it, but she told me today that she had tied a noose and was ready to use it, but then decided not to. she told me all of this because she wanted me to know the reason, but also because she wanted me to make a decision whether or not to commit to her. Right now i feel like her executioner. But I dont think i'm strong enough to take all of this on. Reddit, what should I do? how can I help? For some background she said she has cut before, deep enough to lose blood and conciousness, and she has seriously considered suicide multiple times.
