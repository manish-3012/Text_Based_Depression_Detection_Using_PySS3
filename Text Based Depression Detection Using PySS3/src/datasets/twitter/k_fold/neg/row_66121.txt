I'm counting down the days of my planned suicide in hopes something will change before then..I plan to kill myself on May 13, 2020 sometime around 12:00 pm. That is the date and time I took my first breathe into this world 24 years ago.....

There's so much going on in my life...I have trichotillomania, PTSD, depression, and anhidrosis possibly more illnesses...I'm tired of waking up over heated to the point of feel weak and ill the entire day and it happens so often...

I almost died so many times throughout my life....I remember being thrown in the backseat of my mother's car by my mom to protect me from gunshots, being in a fire surrounded by flames with my sisters and my mother, seeing my mother stab my father and his blood everywhere in our bathroom when I was six because he molested my eldest sister....I was also my mother mostly throughout my life...Molested throughout my life...Raped when I was very little....The list goes on....

Despite what has happened, I love my family to bits and pieces.....I have issues with them and feelings of not belonging but I do have fond memories I want to hold on, until the very last moments of my death however I may die.....

 I left my family to move out of state to breathe and find myself so to speak but I barely have contact with them because I am just in a runt and I am dating who lowers my self esteem,etc....Yet he says he cares which is bullshit and he's the only one who knows what I am planning to do...I doubt he would stop me if I actually tried anything...........


No one would........I'm going to start taking walks near the river, putting my feet in the water for a bit to see how it feels.....I'll start taking  baths instead of showers and to hold my breathe underwater to see what it would probably feel like to drown.....

Starting today I have 161 days left until my demise..........
