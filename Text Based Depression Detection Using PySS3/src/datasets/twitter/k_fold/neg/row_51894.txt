My first relapse, how have you guys dealt with it? With things that can be done at home with this pandemicHello, Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with MDD since I was 16. Iâ€™ve had 2 suicide attempts when I was 18. After my second one, I was prescribed citalopram, buproprion, and Mirtazapine with success. My depression has subsided and I was able to continue into university and so far am going to graduate with honors on May 2020. I have plans to apply to PA school. My problem? 

My depression relapsed. I donâ€™t know if it has to do with this stupid pandemic, but all my coping strategies (drowning myself in school, work, and binge eating) are all taken away. I am now starting to get suicidal thoughts again. My depressive thoughts are changing my perspective on my loved ones as well. I feel like everyone hates me again, and I hate myself again. Iâ€™m recalling all the unfortunate memories of being sexually assaulted 3 times. 

Iâ€™ve in the past, I used therapy then stopped. I recently  tried calling therapy again, but with covid they havenâ€™t called me back. I was using the gym as a coping mechanism but itâ€™s closed. And now my state has a say at home order, so I canâ€™t go out for walks or anything. 

I wish I can kill myself to be honest. But Iâ€™ve made it this far and Iâ€™m so close to helping others with mental illness just like me. But at the same time, the thought of death and being freed from this suffering entices me. Ugh. 

What have you guys done to deal with this relapse? This is my first one so I donâ€™t know what to do
