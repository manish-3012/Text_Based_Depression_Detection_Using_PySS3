I am choosing to end it all very soon.I don't see a way out of this lonely, pathetic existence, other than death, which I am planning to bestow upon myself very soon.

What do I want? Friends, success, brains, a relationship, experiences, courage, a great job, a family, and a great passion. I have none of these, and the path to obtain these feels too difficult, so rather than try I think I'm going to kill myself. You might say I could obtain these with a lot of effort, but honestly even if I knew I could I would rather choose death as it's easier and requires less effort.

At least point you're probably thinking that I'm a lazy, pathetic, stupid loser who may have a chance to change but is too cowardly to put in the effort. Guess what? You're damn right. You might even want to encourage death, as some people have done in the past.

I failed school because I found what most people claim to be incredibly easy too difficult, I have no friends and I have never had a girlfriend because nobody wants to hang out with such a failure. MY peers can't even bare to talk to me. I a fully grown adult by the way, which makes all this extra pathetic. 

Everything is trash and I'm worthless to everybody, I have a crap job which people laugh at (and no hope or ambition to change that), therapy is either too expensive or I have to tell my boss I'm going in work hours as it's cheaper (I'd rather die than do that), and nobody wants to talk to me. I don't even think I've had a full conversation with a girl before, and I can't blame them for ignoring me. My funeral will be very small and I can accept that since I'll be dead.

The one fraction of contentment I've had over the past decade was choosing to end my life. Why shouldn't I end it?
