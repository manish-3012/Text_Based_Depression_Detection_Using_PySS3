Thinking about a plan gives me a rushJust thinking about Iâ€™m letting everything go. By killing myself Iâ€™m escaping this world. It gives me the same rush as watching aome thrilling movie and it feels youâ€™re in the experience kinda way. The rush is amazing. Just thinking about saying goodbye to everyone i respected gives me a rush. 

Anyone else get this feeling?
