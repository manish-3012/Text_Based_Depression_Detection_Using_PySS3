Long-term effects of suicide on family?Curious as to what the effects are on friends and family in the long term, preferably hearing it from someone who knows someone who has. 

Considering the option pretty heavily lately but have been feeling guilty about it because I know how much it will hurt my parents. What I really want to know is if people can get over it in the future and move on with their lives, pretty much to the point they were before the death.

Cheers
