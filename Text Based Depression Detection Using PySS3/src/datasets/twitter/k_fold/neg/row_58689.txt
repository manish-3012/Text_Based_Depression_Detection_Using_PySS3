I don't think i can handle being homelessI've been homeless for 2 days and i just can't.  I can't believe how low i fell.  I'm disgusted with myself 

The past 12 hours  , I've been in a Colorado bus station.  Denver is my stop but I'm terrified. I don't wanna leave this bus station because i have nowhere to go.   I don't wanna go to a shelter,  i don't wanna apply for food stamps.  I want to end it already. Such a disappointing life i lived so far
