Are you honest with the people around you?Are there any friends or family that you can be completely honest to about your ideations? How can you speak to someone about wanting to end your life when you know they will feel a duty to intervene ? I feel like saying anything close to the truth is a cry for help, and I donâ€™t want help. So what if itâ€™s prolonged? And youâ€™re still working on day-to-day issues. Do you give people hints or act stoically and not say anything?
