I am so tired...I've come here today... Maybe as a last cry for help... I really don't know.

I'm middle 20s, married, dogs, no kids. I don't have a degree, but i got a good paying job that i now abhor. It sucks me down every day, but i feel completely trapped as it is so specialized that there is really no where to go with the skills i have.

I have had health problems for most of this year. Started with one thing, fixed that and another arose, and now i live in constant pain.

I cannot emphasize enough. Constant. Pain. Im living on vicoden, one every 4 hours and a skelaxin 3/day. so i go from feeling drugged, to excruciating pain and migraines. The world has seemed fuzzy for months now, and i feel like my life is a blur of nothingness... As i am either asleep or just laying there...
But even the pain pills dont seem to be helping much any more.

Every test leads to more tests, leads to more problems, leads to more tests... Ive seen countless specialists and doctors, been to ers a dozen times, scans, surgeries... It just all seems pointless in retrospect...

I have been able to work.... Some... But as my performance review showed, my boss hit me hard for having to use so much sick and vacation time... When this all started to go bad, i was told not to look into fmla.

And i had to cancel our vacation this year due to not having time, so now i have nothing to look forward to until next year.

I am so tired... I just want to go to sleep and never wake up...
I just don't want to do this any more. I know there are people worse off than me, but i don't think i can handle this any more. I don't have the will to fight it.

I have tried talking to my wife and mom about this, but they don't understand what im saying. They don't get how much this is affecting me. Im living in constant agony...
I have ~35vicoden at home. I just want to take them all and finally feel better, finally  have a nice nap...
