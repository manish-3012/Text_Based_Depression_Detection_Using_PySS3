TerrifiedI'm sorry in advance I have terrible writing skills.
I've been struggling for the past couple weeks with having a lot of anxiety around school and home mostly the people there. The only people I feel safe and like I'm not going to yeet all over is a person from my church but he is homeschooled so I only see him twice a week. I dont know what triggered all of this cause I was fine at school until a little and now just seeing people I consider my friends give me anxiety. I hate it but I also think anorexic thoughts are replacing my suicidal thoughts and I feel like puking if I eat a bite of food. I hate the feeling cause yeah the suicidal thoughts have gone away but I feel like a fucking mistake if I eat any food and i cried today cause i ate an actual meal. If anyone has advice or something please help cause I dont know what to do.
