Please help...I'm done now.  At 42, I've realised that I will never have the life promised.  I have no wife or girlfriend, no kids or pets, no friends in real life.  I'm done.  Can someone please give me advice on a simple way to die?  I keep thinking of jumping in front of the train but it is daunting to really be there with all those people.  Is there a nice over the counter drug interaction I can use?  or something?  Please help me.
