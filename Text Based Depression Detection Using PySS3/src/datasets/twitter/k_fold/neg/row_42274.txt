Learning disabilitiesI'm someone with dyspraxia or Development Coordination disorder which affects my motor skills and speech. Is there anyone here with such learning disabilities? My disability is the major cause of my depression and going by doctors there is no cure for it. I don't relate to any of my friends and family members and I feel so lonely. The advice given by doctors is that I should learn to cope with this but I don't want to. I want the constant mocking to end. I want the constant fear of going out to end. I want the suffering to end. Is there anyone out here experience these problems which are causing suicidal thoughts.
