leaving this group.not because iâ€™m doing it but quite the opposite. i mean i still think about it all the time, but just now i was in a relatively decent mood until i saw a post on here and it reminded me of my dark side again, hoping to start getting out of this mindset, itâ€™s harder than hell and wonâ€™t be anytime soon for sure but leaving this group is a good start i think. wish me luck
