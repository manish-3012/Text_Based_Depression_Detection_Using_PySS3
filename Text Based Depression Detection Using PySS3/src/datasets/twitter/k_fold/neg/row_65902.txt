Anyone else struggling to go through with suicide?I have been having some strong urges to kill myself lately. I am struggling to find work and have been falling closer to being homeless after college. I have been fantasizing about ways to kill myself such as stepping in front of a train. Is anyone else struggling to bring themselves to just get it over with? It seems like the hardest part is making it happen once and for all.
