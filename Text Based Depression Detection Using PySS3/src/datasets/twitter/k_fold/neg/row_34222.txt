I'm gonna hang myself now but I'm scared of death.Im sickly scared. I have absolutely no clue what happens after death and I fucking hate it. I dont want to die, I just dont have any other way out of my pain. I gave myself 17 years, and it only kept going further into shit. I will never ok. I will never be loved. I will never smile or laugh sincerely. I'll never amount to nothing. Fuck this. I quit.
