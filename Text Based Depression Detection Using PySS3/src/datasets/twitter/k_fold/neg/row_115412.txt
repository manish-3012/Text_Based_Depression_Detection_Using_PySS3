My mom makes me suicidal.Every interaction with my mother tends to be a nail in my mood. I suffer from depression and eating disorder and i have autism and anxiety. I have loads of issues. But i take medication but she with her narcissistic attitude barges in and makes me want to die. She hates me for who i am and that hurts me and makes me feel like i am a burden. I am a burden. 

She called me an immoral person today because Iâ€™m dating someone who she views as mentally ill (heâ€™s TRANS!) and as ugly cause i chopped off my hair. 

I am 22. And every action i take is scrutinized and if itâ€™s not to her liking or for her i am judged and insulted. And i want to DIE!
