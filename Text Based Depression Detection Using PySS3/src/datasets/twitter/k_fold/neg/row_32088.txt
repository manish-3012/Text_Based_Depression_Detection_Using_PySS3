I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™ve been okay for the past couple of months, with suicide rarely entering my mind as an option. Iâ€™ve been on medicine, I got a therapist, life was okay. This past week has been a mess. Iâ€™m constantly thinking of killing myself and I canâ€™t really talk to anyone. I have an online appt with my therapist soon, but for now Iâ€™m alone. Itâ€™s honestly frightening to know that you can be so close to death. But when I go bonkers and wrap something around my neck tightly, I feel like I deserve it. I feel so forgotten, none of my friends talk to me and my sisters make excuses when I call, this sucks.
