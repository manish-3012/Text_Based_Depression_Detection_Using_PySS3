I feel so fucking alone and uselessIâ€™m currently in high school and everything feels so god damn stupid. Since last year Iâ€™ve felt so hopeless and that it wasnâ€™t ever gonna end. That life was this repetitive cycle of bullshit that would never end, that that was it. I considered suicide so much and I still think about it. Itâ€™s so frustrating thinking that Iâ€™m this piece of shit that canâ€™t do anything right. That Iâ€™m the only one frustrated with everything, that Iâ€™m the only one going through this dark tunnel. People always say that theyâ€™re there for you but it doesnâ€™t work out like that. They say they are and then never respond to your texts. These â€œfriends.â€ I feel so isolated even though Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m so afraid to talk to anyone because I feel like Iâ€™ll be such a burden on them and anyone around me. Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™m just an attention-seeking moron who needs the acceptance of everyone around him. I put on this facade that everything is okay when I know itâ€™s not. I want to think that it is but it just doesnâ€™t work out like that. Iâ€™m and unhappy and I hate myself for it. Iâ€™ve tried to ignore it but it just didnâ€™t work out like that. Iâ€™m so angry at myself because this all just feel like Iâ€™m putting it on myself. Thatâ€™s it my fault that Iâ€™m feeling this way. That I canâ€™t accept myself for who I am and itâ€™s all me. I fucking hate it
