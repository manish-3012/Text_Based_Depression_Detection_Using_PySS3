There's no reason anymoreWhy even deal with this bullshit anymore, I'm unemployed, my credit cards near maxed, my gf left me for someone, my family resents me,I dont have any friends anymore, my self esteem is gone, and I just want to die. Why even live anymore, its an uphill battle, there's nothing here anymore, I just want out. I've decided to just cut and slip away. The world doesnt need another fuckup.
