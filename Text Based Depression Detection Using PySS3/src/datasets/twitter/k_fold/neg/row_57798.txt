all aloneWhat's wrong with me that nobody wants to be around me, hangout with me or talk to me? I spend so much time being there for other people, and I just feel used. Used for car rides, just a warm body, like I am not a human being. My family avoids me, they know how depressed I am, my dad is a psychiatric worker and avoids me, he gets angry when he sees how sad I am and doesn't talk to me. my friends couldn't give two shits about me, my mom isnt around, I have no boyfriend and I've failed relationships. now I cant make connections with anyone, I feel like ive been hurt so bad and I have no self esteem, I just want to die so bad. I pray to god I don't wake up and it shows. I've got things in order but I don't have the balls to do it. I fucking cant stand to be here any longer, if there is a god he is evil. he would let me suffer as I have suffered in my 20 years of mental anguish. god let me die. I get closer every day. I dream about my funeral, it makes me cry so much
