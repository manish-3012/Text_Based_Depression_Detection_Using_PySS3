Still lost.I keep feeling better. I keep really thinking I'm getting betterâ€”but I'm not. I'm just as lost, and oftentimes feel just as hopeless. 

Sometimes it's more intermittent rather than constant misery, but it's all the same in the endâ€”whether it be after a few hours, days, or weeksâ€”Im just as lost. 

I'm tired. I'm so tired. It feels like this is really it for me, you know?
