Losing everything.Iâ€™ve been alone for months. Will be alone for months. Then Iâ€™m slated to be away for years. Iâ€™m watching the woman I love find other people to take my place in the bed and in the daily life. My kids have been gone for the most part of their lives. I donâ€™t keep friends. I donâ€™t see people. I literally just sit and play on my phone and chainsmoke. Pleas just tell me some shit to look forward to for at least a few more days.
