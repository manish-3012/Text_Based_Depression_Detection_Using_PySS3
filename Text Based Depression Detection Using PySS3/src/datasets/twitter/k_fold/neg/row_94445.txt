Iâ€™ve been a complete wreck for the past 3 years after experiencing a toxic and abusive relationship.. just as soon as Iâ€™m getting my shit together and feeling better my dad dies.It was all completely sudden, he just got out of treatment last Thursday. 2 days later his body was found outside in a pile of dirt.. I honestly have no fucking clue what to do and Iâ€™ve been thinking about self harm for the best few days. I canâ€™t stop thinking about the stupid mindless shit I was doing while he was literally in the process of dying alone. I was laughing and having fun looking at pictures of moths. If only Iâ€™d been with him or if I could have called him that day.... I just feel so broken right now. So many things are up in the air when it comes to my future and I donâ€™t know what to do. I just want to rot. I know it would be devastating to my family.. but at the same time I only feel close to my mom, grandma, sister and one friend. All these memories keep popping up and I keep crying, this is just the beginning of the rest of my life without a dad.
