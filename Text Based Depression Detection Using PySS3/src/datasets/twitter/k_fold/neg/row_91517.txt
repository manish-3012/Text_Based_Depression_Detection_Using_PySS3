When I told her I tried to kill myselfShe laughed. Mocked me. Taunted  me by pointing to the balcony outside. I bit my tongue and held my breath and tried to wish myself away. Then she said that I shouldnâ€™t try it again. Not because she loved me, or that I mattered (really all I wanted to hear) but because the government would investigate and arrest her.

And that it would be shameful to the family.

It worked, I guess.

Motherâ€™s Day 2017 was the first time I tried. 
I took a random pill bottle as I was in a rush. Downed 20 pills on the way to church. I was 14 then.

Nothing happened.

My family went to dinner without me after so I thought that would be a good time to try again. I topped it off with 5 pills more and went to bed.

I survived, clearly. But I my vision was hazy and my stomach hurt really bad so I drank like a gallon of water. My pee smelled really bad for the next few weeks lol.

Itâ€™s not better but Iâ€™ve found better coping mechanisms.

Anyway. This is a throw away account but I feel like I just need to get it off my chest
