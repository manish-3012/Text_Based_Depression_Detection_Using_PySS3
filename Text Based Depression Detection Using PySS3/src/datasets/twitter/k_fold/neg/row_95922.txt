Iâ€™ll never have sex, Iâ€™ll never be me, Iâ€™ll never be happyJust the objective truth.

Iâ€™m trans, I hate it, I hate being a freak stuck inside a deformed body. I canâ€™t afford grs, laser, etc. Iâ€™ll never have the money required and if I die by then itâ€™ll be too late. Itâ€™s already too late. I e missed out on my childhood and life. 

I also canâ€™t have sex. I have a stupid penis. And my asshole is all kinds of fucked up. IBS/Chronic constipation, chronic anal fissures, chronic hemorrhoids. Theyâ€™ll never go away.

My dick itself is fucked up. I have urinary strictures and the only thing theyâ€™ll offer me is a urethroplasty. Thatâ€™s not what I need. I need a vaginoplasty. Two birds one stone.

Etc etc

Probably kms by December tbh.

10000% convinced life is Hell.
