I really need some encouraging words right now and didn't know where else to go.I know I'm not going to kill myself. I know that I've never been strong enough to kill myself. But I don't know where else to post, and I really need some advice or something to keep me sane.
So here's what happened.
My mother has always been someone who says things and doesn't realize they may hurt someone. She over reacts, and gets mad. She loves to take it out on people, especially me. Now, this may sound like 'woe is me' but I'm being serious. 
I don't know why, but she just has a certain dislike towards me. I've always thought because I was more like my father then her, which is why she prefers my sister. I know she prefers her, because she's practically said to my face before.
so about two hours ago, she was upset because she couldn't find a shirt she was going to wear to a funeral. She had let me borrow it before and thought it might be in my room.
I told her I thought I had given it back, but I would like anyways. She got all pissed and started going on about how she has no idea why I was ever born, that all I do is fuck up her life, i've never done anything good for her. All because I couldn't find a shirt she lent me. I found it eventually, and then twenty minutes later she started going on about how it's not my fault that I'm a fuck up.
I don't know, typing this out make it seem like it isn't that bad, but i've been crying for about two hours now, I feel numb, and all I want to do is drink myself to sleep, or puke my heart out. I just don't know what to do right now, I feel so hurt. I'm still in high school, only one year left, so it's not like I can live on my own. My parents are divorced and I love my father, but I'm not willing to leave because I want to finish ny last year of school here.
Tl;dr: my mother called me a fuck up and told me she doesn't know why I was ever born over something ridiculously small and I don't know how to react to anything.
