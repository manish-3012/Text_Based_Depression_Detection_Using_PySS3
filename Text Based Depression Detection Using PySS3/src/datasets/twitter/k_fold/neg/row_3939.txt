Iâ€™m probably going to do it tonight.I have my suicide planned for today, April 21st, 2020. I made a pact with myself a year ago that if my situation didnâ€™t get any better, that Iâ€™d go ahead and off myself. 
Well, itâ€™s been a year, and to be completely honest, itâ€™s only gotten worse. College makes me physically sick and suicidal but my mom has convinced me that if I donâ€™t go any only choice would be being a deadbeat with no degree who would work minimum wage for the rest of her life. My family says they accept my lesbianism and yet they continue to try and find â€œthe right guy for meâ€. I canâ€™t live like this anymore. 
I donâ€™t know for sure how yet, but I assume hanging wouldnâ€™t be too hard to carry out. My mom has a death grip over my life and itâ€™s impossible to be happy while she still exists. Iâ€™m 18 and I just want it to be over already. I want to fall asleep and then wake up as a brand new person with a new life. 
Iâ€™m going to miss my friends a lot. Iâ€™m sorry I worried you, you really meant a lot to me. I donâ€™t want anybody feeling guilty over this, itâ€™s for the best I just try and start all over again.
