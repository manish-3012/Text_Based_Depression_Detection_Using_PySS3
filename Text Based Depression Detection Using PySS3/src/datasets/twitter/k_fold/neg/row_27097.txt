I'm done.I don't see a point to life when I work 80 hours a week only to have my paychecks gobbled up by Cunty debt companies and rent/bills. Last month I got a third job and am now working around 90 hours a week, and I'm actually getting more into debt every month. 

Literally no point in life if this is the situation I'm in. There isn't a way to get out of it. Only more debt from these greedy cunts. 

I guess I wanted to say goodbye to someone.
