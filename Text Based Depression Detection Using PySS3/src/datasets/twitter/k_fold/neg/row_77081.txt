i am exhausted.I was a bad friend. whenever I felt hurt by friends I would end up talking crap about them and they all found out because they set me up. they ended up pairing my phone and have been seeing my text and photos, listening to conversations etc to get back at me. its been going on for 3 years and i keep changing phones and nothing changes. I'm literally exhausted with the situation. I've been contemplating suicide for a long time. but at the same time i am scared to do it. i just want it all to stop. i am mean to people who are in my life currently because iam always stressed about this and they don't deserve it. ive tried to change myself so much but the longer this keeps happening the more i keep holding everything against myself, and the more i feel like i don't deserve to be here. I'm just going to keep hurting people. i lost all my friends and they all think i don't deserve to have friends . I'm tired of everything. i want them to understand that i am sorry for what ive said. but they don't care, they just want to keep doing this to me. ive tried to explain where i was coming from and how i felt hurt too but nobody cares. idk what to do but its hard for me to keep going... i feel like giving up all the time. i feel like i cant escape. and i feel like i'll never be able to heal.
