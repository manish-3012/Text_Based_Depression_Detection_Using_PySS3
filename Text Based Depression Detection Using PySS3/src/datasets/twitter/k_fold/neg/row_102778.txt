Itâ€™s getting roughI havenâ€™t been forced to be in the presence of a toxic person in a long time. The last time I was, I was a teenager living with my horrible mom. She just had to have a perfect daughter to the point where she was willing to let me die. Now Iâ€™m stuck in a similar situation again and I canâ€™t escape. No wonder first responders off themselves so much. Line officers will treat you like shit because they know theyâ€™ll get away with it. Reach out for help? â€œYeah, weâ€™ll get back to you in 2 weeks.â€ Thanks. ðŸ˜ž
