thinking of jumping off of london bridgethis would be my second attempt if i do this. earlier in 2018 i went to hospital due to a suicide attempt (overdose) and stayed there for about a week. now iâ€™m considering jumping cause the thought of taking pills is weird to me since then. would i survive or live from doing this at london bridge? i donâ€™t have any motivation to live anymore. i try to find aspirations and ambitions for myself to keep going and see a future but itâ€™s like they inspire me for a few days then iâ€™m back to before . i just want to sleep and not be here. i have no motivation , i donâ€™t care but care at the same time and wishing i could do more. i have a good heart iâ€™m a waste of potential and iâ€™m wasting my potential. i can do a lot more. i donâ€™t want to be here no longer
