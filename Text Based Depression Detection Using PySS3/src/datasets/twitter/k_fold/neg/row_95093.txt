I'm always the asshole.To preface, I just got off a fight with my mom. I hate it so much. She always thinks she's the right one because she's older. Its just how she grew up. She never thinks she's wrong and when I point it out she just tells me to shut up. She always uses the word "disrespectful" but in my language. Except you can't think of it the same as English, apparently this word can only be said from someone older to someone younger. I'm always the one in the wrong when we fight. I'm always the one who has to say sorry. She never admits her mistakes and she manipulates me. I'm not an angel either, it usually starts with me doing something or not doing something, but it always ends with her saying (in our language so it's a bit iffy when translated) "You want to be disrespectful to me? Fine, I'll stop talking to you. You think you're all grown up and you want to leave this house so badly? From here on, you can do everything by yourself." Sometimes she even throws in, "if it weren't for you being so young (or something else), I would kill myself. I'll hit my head against the wall so hard that I'll kill myself right now if you want." She honestly probably means it. Today's fight happened because I didn't want to go outside. I did go outside after a few minutes though, it was nice. And then she locked me outside? Or she told my younger brother to, I don't know. Anyways I got angry and said I'll be going back inside and it's her fault. She got angry because it was just a joke. She started yelling at me and I yelled back. I told (yelled at) her that she never considers my feelings and she always says what I do wrong but never fixes her own mistakes. I asked how she felt if I were to lock her outside, would she be calm? Why is she angry at me being angry when she would be angry herself? You always tell me to shut up whenever I say something. She responded it's because the more you speak the more disrespectful I get. And the thing is, I'm the only one who's disrespectful, my brother yells at her? Nah it's completely fucking fine. I'm the asshole. I told her to hit me if she thinks I'm being disrespectful (I regret that) I said that she never apologizes. And she goes off with the fact she's older or whatever again. Why do I have to apologize when she started  it? And she starts it again, "fine I won't talk to you etc. Etc." Then she goes off with killing her self again, but she was kind of crying? I feel bad and It's my fault that I overreacted but she always does this. She always emotionally manipulates me. I do yell at her and sometimes I agree that I'm disrespectful but what about her? If I use that word against her she gets even more angry. Woo time for us to ignore each other for a week or so again...  honestly, I hope I die very soon. I want to die, I don't want to live anymore and everything seems very pointless.
