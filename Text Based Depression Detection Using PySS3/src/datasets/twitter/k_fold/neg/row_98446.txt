I've never really felt happy, and I'm worried that I never willI was raised in a very religious family, but early on in my adolescence I realized I was gay. It was jarring and it cut me off emotionally from my family. I had always been a quiet and awkward kid, so I didnt really have anyone else to turn to for support, so I just sorta receded into myself. I've never really been that emotionally open with the few friends I do have. I told myself that when I moved out everything would change and I'd come out of my shell and grow into a stronger person. but I moved into an apartment with a couple friends six months ago and nothing's really gotten better. I started drinking and smoking weed to cope with everything but I still feel miserable and hopeless, I still feel like I've devastated my family by leaving their church, and I havent even told them I'm gay, and I think being so reclusive during my adolescence robbed me of the chance to mature emotionally.
