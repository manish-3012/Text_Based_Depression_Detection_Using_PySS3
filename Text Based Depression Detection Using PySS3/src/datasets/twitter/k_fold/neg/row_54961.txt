I don't know what to do.My friend is suicidal, I know their super stressed, and I know their trying to say how they feel. They do. I knlw they don't want to talk to any adults in school about it. I know their gonna lie about how they feel if asked by an adult in school, and I know that they don't want to outright tell me or any other friends about everything. I really wanna help, because their one of the primary reasons I myself didn't take my life. They really helped to brighten my life, but now that there in a dark place I don't know what to do. I really want to help them. I'm one of the people in contact with him the most, along with one other so I definitely want to help as much as possible
