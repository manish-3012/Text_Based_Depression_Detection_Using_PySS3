only 18 and already feeling too tired of life to take any moreright now i need to talk to reddit because i have no one to talk to in real life. my whole life has been shit, im german, grew up in america for 3 years then left all my friends there, then had to make new friends in germany, left them after 3 years to go to Papua new guinea with my parents till this last year. all my friends are still there or in america im in germany. so right now i have nobody to talk to.

im 18, and i have problems. its not that im fat or overly ugly....but i have this feeling of worthlessness that i CANNOT get rid of. I really should be getting a job, but i have social phobias. i go to the gym when the least amount of people are there, i dont get out much cuz i havent found any new friends in germany. i just feel like i cant do anything. theres a constant fear in me of failing people or of what they think of me and its really really starting to just tire me emotionally.....

so i need advice on how to deal with this. ive tried suicide before but i pussied out...how can i gain confidence to deal with life???????
