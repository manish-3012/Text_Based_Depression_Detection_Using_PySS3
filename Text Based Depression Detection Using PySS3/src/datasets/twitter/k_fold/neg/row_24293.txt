I have a son, he is the only reasonI have an amazing 3 year old son, that's the only reason why I haven't. I proposed to my soul mate  of 5 years and she turned me down and walked out of my life. She told me she can't continue to be hurt by me without giving me an actual explanation of why. We were dealing with allot of stress the previous 5 months before she walked out. Before that we were great. She has been convinced by her ex stepmother that I was cheating on her the days that it would take me any longer than the hour it normally would to get home because of rush hour. Prior to that I never had to deal with a long drive or rush hour because I worked only 35 minutes away right off the highway. I love my son and enjoy every day I have had with him the past 3 months. But I just can't go on without her in my life. She is everything I could have ever imagined. She made me into a much better person than I was or could have ever been. She is the best thing that ever happened to me other than our son. These past 3 months have changed me into a better person and I did everything I could to change what I have to for the better in my life, and our life. But just knowing she can never trust me ever again and doesn't want to be hurt by me ever again for something that I never did, I can't go on. I can't do it knowing that she will never believe me or love me again because of something I never did to her. I just can't do it anymore.
