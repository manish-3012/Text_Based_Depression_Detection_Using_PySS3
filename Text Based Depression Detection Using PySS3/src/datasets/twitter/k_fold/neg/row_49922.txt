I lost a friend yesterday and I don't know what to do anymore*This post was NOT made for karma or attention purposes*

*If it matters i'm 19M &amp; will be 20 on the 12th*

I met a girl back in May and her and I became friends. She inspired me to change in so many ways &amp; become less lazy as well as a better person in general. I started eating better, working out &amp; seeing a therapist for other problems Iâ€™d been having &amp; I even started to do things that I knew would help me overcome these problems later. My parents and sister even noticed and were proud of how much i'd changed, though only I knew it was because of her. Just two days ago we hung out with someone else (I even have pictures of us from that day) and just yesterday me &amp; her had a short videocall. A few hours after the call I made a joke that was just that, a joke. It was a playful jab that wasn't clearly mean or rude or attacking or shaming, but she took the wrong way and now she wont talk to me and has blocked me on pretty much everything. I start school on the 10th of August &amp; I just dont know what to do anymore. I'm generally bored and sick of nothing in my life going right. I'm sick of only being happy for short periods of time and having my happiness taken away from me just when everything seems to be going alright &amp; i'm still in shock and sad at how quickly such an amazing friendship ended. I still had a month left in summer and we had so much planned and now its all gone. just like that. I don't really have too many other people to hang out with and I think that if I don't die or kill myself before school starts I know i'll just feel alone and empty, and I don't know when it'll end &amp; Iâ€™ll be happy anymore and I kind of donâ€™t feel like waiting
