I lost everything that mattered to me Long story short, I pushed my best friend and only true love away like 5 years ago and now I canâ€™t move on.. Iâ€™ve tried everything. I moved cities, I made new friends, I had lots of sex
But I can never get her back after hurting her
I regret everything but I feel too sick and guilty with how I abused her to ever want to insert myself back in her life
I am so numb these days
