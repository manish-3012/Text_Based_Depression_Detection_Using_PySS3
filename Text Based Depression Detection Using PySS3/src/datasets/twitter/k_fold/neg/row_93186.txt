things have gone wronghello. I am 16 years old. I have never been suicidal before. I have been diagnosed with GAD and MDD. In March, I accidentily overdosed on meth and xanax sending me into a state of suicidal psychosis and screaming threats of self harm. These were purely drug related. I was admitted to a mental hospital and spent two days there while i detoxed. I have never felt popular. Ive never been to a party. I have a small circle of friends at my boarding school. Me and said friends are avid weed smokers and occassional psychedelic users and very aware of the dangers. Recently however, as Ive been home during quarentine, my girlfriend who had been with me through shoplifting alcohol and my overdose, broke up with me very suddnely and explained ho much of a shitty boyfriend I was. She has tried to convince me it isnt my fault entirely, but I dont believe her. I feel like a complete freak to anyone at my school and fear if they find out about my overdose I will be socially exiled. I feel like I have caused nothing but dissapointment to my family, friends and girlfriend. I just dont want to be a burden anymore.
