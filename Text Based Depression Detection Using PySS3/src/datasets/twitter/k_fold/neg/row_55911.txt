It's sad really,I want to document my last week alive through a stupid blog like Tumblr or something similiar. But who would read it? Who would care? Not one single person. Just got kicked out of my mom's house, moved into my dad's. He's absolutely broke and I'm nothing but a financial burden. Worst part is, my girlfriend who moved across the country to be with me and attend the same college as me is now in my shitty situation.

I can't find a job. I've been here two days, applied to probably twenty and the flow of rejection letters just keeps coming. I'm young, just 17 but I was living on my own up until December at my girlfriends mom's house in NH. 

I got kicked outta there for legal reasons (she's in the middle of a divorce and her lawyer said I had to go), and had to run home to momma who is now withholding all of my belongings and hates my guts for literally no good reason. She's always been crazy though.

So now, I'm dragging my father down financially, my girlfriend down situationally. Did I mention that I fell in love with another girl states away? What a piece of work I am.

I leave nothing but destruction in my wake, there's little of this world worth anything beyond a handful of people that I constantly hurt anyways. 

The only thing I have to offer my dad for Father's day is a reminder that I'm a failure and am now putting a huge burden on his shoulders. 

How's your yesr been going Reddit?
