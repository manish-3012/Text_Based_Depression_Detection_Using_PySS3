I'm here for something different.I constantly think about killing myself, ending it all. I have gotten to the point of wanting to do it and even formulating a plan, but never taken steps to do it. I don't currently want to die, I want to leave. I would like advice on how to leave.  
- I live in the Midwest (US) 
- Under 18  
- Access to physical goods totaling over 10k~ (3k Cash, ext)  
- No licence (car)   
- Parents split, much freedom  
- Passport  
- Gay male
I guess this might be the wrong sub, someone can tell me if it is. I just... I don't necessarily want to die, I just want the situation to change. Maybe I'm depressed I don't know. I just want to leave, get it all over with. Maybe i'm just a spoiled brat, idk. Thanks  
Edit: By leave I mean get as far away from the midwest as possible.
