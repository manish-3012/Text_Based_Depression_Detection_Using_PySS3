Suicidal InsomniaI can't sleep, I have constant suicidal thoughts, I constantly feel compelled to kill myself, everyday is awful, I have no reason to live, I just don't want to upset my parents, I want to slit my throat, but I don't want to be in pain. I'm almost 30, I've been this way since about 15, I can't take it any longer.
