I'm struggling tonight.There's a lot going on, I guess. Everything is crushing down on me at once. I'll probably make it through this but enduring this night, the next couple of days, is going to be so hard. I'm in withdrawal from one of my psych meds and I won't have more for a couple of days. I want to block my ears to all the positive messages I keep seeing. I just want to drink and hurt myself and write poetry and goodbye notes I'll end up deleting. I am selfish and a bad person and I don't deserve any help but I want a hug so badly... Then I want it to be over.
I'm sorry for posting. I know tonight is bound to be really busy and for that reason and others I'm not going to the hospital. I just... I don't know why I'm bothering. If you want to help someone tonight, help someone who wants to get better. I'm too stubborn to be helped.

If you're here to help people tonight you're a saint. Good luck.
