I am convinced I will never lose my virginityI look okay, have a decent inteligence, friends, but I am socially crippled. Being a virgin at 19 has been the worst experience in my life, and has distracted me from classes and family. I have gone on so many dates, I have attempted to talk to so many women, but I always end up scaring them away. 

It does not help that I have seen pretty much all my friends lose theirs over the past 8 months I have been in feeling this. It's so easy for everyone else, but impossible for me. I cant stand it anymore! It haunts me constantly, and no amount of pills or counseling is helping. 

I just want to be with someone who wants to be with me. 



I really just wan to die. I think I will just hang myself
