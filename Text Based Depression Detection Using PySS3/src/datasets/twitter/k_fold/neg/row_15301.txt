~Â°â€¢An Interesting Titleâ€¢Â°~I'm so tired of life. I'm tired of what people say to me and how people treat me. I'm tired of other people getting appreciation for things that I did. I'm tired of nothing ever going right. But most importantly, I'm just so tired of being *me.*  I'm tired of continually being a failure, I'm tired of having no energy to do anything but the bare minimum, I'm tired of everyone depending on me and being responsible for other humans beings when I feel like I can barely be responsible for myself, I'm tired of caring about people that don't care about me, I'm tired of running around hiding self harm or restricting or anything else while feeling like a goddamn teenager again, I'm tired of having any and all feelings whatsoever.


Keeping it all together is just too much, but that doesn't matter because I'm the only one there that cares enough to do any of it. That doesn't matter because people don't *actually*  care even when they say they do.


This is starting to be so much harder than I expected this to be. I expected to feel like shit while scrambling all of my things in order, and then to immediately kill myself. Instead, it seems there's going to be a long winding road of losing myself completely and falling back into behaviors and substances I haven't done in years. Just one constant downward goddamn spiral. All because I'm trapped. All because I can't stand to leave things unfinished and uncared for when it shouldn't even be my responsibility in the first place. I guess literally *everything*  really is harder when you're an adult, including killing yourself.


*Somebody fucking shoot me.*
