I know many don't really care about the truth.I've been always in thought and thinking about my past and what I became to be of today. 

I really want to do it, but, it's still a crime to commit suicide. Many may not agree with that but, this is my opinion. 

I just "tried" of doing something in life but, I'm just a waste less runt just like any other human being on Earth. We're just energy consumers and thoughtless creatures. I just hate being on this Earth and state. I hate everything I do and everything I do isn't helping and I feel like an amoeba. No purpose, no nothing. 

I'm getting to my limit of suicide because I'm just an imperfect human being. No matter if I develop, my inner self will come out. I just hate everything and everyone no matter. Even right now, I'm thinking about the people's responses. "Do we really care about your feelings? My x and y situations is far more serious than yours to compare. At least we get physical attacks that are life threatening." I'm just tired of humanity and just people and myself in general. It hasn't formed with hatred of myself, it's just EVERYTHING.
