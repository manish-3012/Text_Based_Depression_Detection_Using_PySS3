If I did kill myself no one would noticeIsn't that fucked up? My roommate wouldn't notice unless it started to stink, none of my "friends" talk to me now. I know my family would notice but only after 2 or 3 days of me not texting them. Life is one painful son of a bitch and everyone is too selfish and narcisstic to help those who need it. I hate my life and I hate that even though I don't talk to my so called friends anymore they still affect my mental health. One of these days I just might do it so I can have some peace and comfort but who would want too knowing they wouldn't be missed?
