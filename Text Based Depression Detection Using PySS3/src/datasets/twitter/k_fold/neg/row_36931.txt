Contemplated this morning about commiting suicideIâ€™m tired of living with this family. Toxic friendships. Everything is making me want to cut off everyone. I used to be depressed but I feel itâ€™s coming back. This morning when I kept coughing and having an asthma attack. None of my family went to check on me. I walked everywhere. To them it all seems normal until I end up in the ER because I passed out. The reason is always because of my grandma. She keeps cooking things Iâ€™m allergic too. She would purposely use strawberry scented soaps or candles. When I smell them I get an instant asthma attack because I have a berry allergy. 
Eating it is worst. I get hives and sometimes I canâ€™t breathe at all. ER. One time my grandma put cranberry juice inside my coke. I got hives and passed out on our kitchen floor apparently.

The doctors at the hospital already gave my parents a lecture that, THIS COULD ALL BE AVOIDED IF THEY FOLLOW. 

The doctor would always be like, â€œYou again? Whatâ€™s going on?â€ When I told him. He just sighed. He probably knew that they didnâ€™t take it seriously. He just saw tears dripping in my eyes and handed me a tissue.

Today, I thought about not getting my inhaler or taking reactine. I knew my asthma attack was pretty bad. My chest felt tight I felt like I was gonna collapse. I thought about not taking it.
If I didnâ€™t then all this pain would go away. Everyday trying to breathe is hard. With this pandemic I canâ€™t even move out till August.

I really hate home. My mom yelled at me and said that, â€œI have asthma but Iâ€™m not like that.â€ OBVIOUSLY thereâ€™s different stages of asthma. Are you dumb? Mine happens to be worst and she doesnâ€™t care.

I donâ€™t wanna live. I hate my life. I thought if I just kept thinking positive Iâ€™ll be fine but honestly. Iâ€™m tired. I know other people had it worst but my thoughts I canâ€™t control them anymore.
