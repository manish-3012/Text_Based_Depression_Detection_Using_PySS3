Now I'm getting "help"Just wanted to fill those who read the last thread in.. I talked to my mom and now everyone I know is going crazy.. I probably will have to go to a suicide-watch ward thing.. It sucks that it ended up this way.. I hope things are better. Thanks for the help guys. I really messed up this time.
