I've been suicidal for years without ever thinking I'll really act on it apart from one or two moments, but it's always been there in the background. Anyone else?I think the worst part is knowing that it'll always be a part of me, just this lingering sense of depression that I'll always be able to tap into, that good things in life are just a brief distraction from. It was my birthday yesterday and the whole weekend was great, but here I am just kinda daydreaming about depression again and the most scary part is how casual it all is, how I can just causally think about suicide like it's no big deal.

I used to imagine asking friends to kill me as a teenager but now I'm in my mid-twenties and it's kinda just never left lol wtf. I'm a therapist now, how ironic is that.
