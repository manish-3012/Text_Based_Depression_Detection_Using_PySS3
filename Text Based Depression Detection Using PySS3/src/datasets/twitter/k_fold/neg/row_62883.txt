Whats wrong with meI was raped about 5 years ago by a female friend (im also female) and just recently it has caught up to me. I hate her alot and i wish to never see her again but for some reason i cannot cut contact with her. Off and on again i add her, delete her, add, delete- over and over again. More so recently ive been wanting to be raped again? I dont want to experience it again yet i do. If it happened again I obviously wouldnt be into either? This is not a fetish / kink thing. I dont know what it is or what it means. Im unable to tell anyone about it right now because of personal problems but can someone please tell me why i feel this way? What it could be? She has forced me to send her nudes in the past, as early as January this year. A few years ago just before or after the rape happened she would also suffocate me for a few seconds and be incredibly rough and abusive with me, we were never in a relationship, never kissed or hugged but she really made it seem like we were in a sexual relationship â€” an abusive one at that.
I feel a connection with her, a loving one- but a one i do not want to be a part of. Please help me.
