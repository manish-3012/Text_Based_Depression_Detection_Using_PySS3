Nights are so hardSince I donâ€™t have any friends to tell this to I guess I will just rant about it here. 
Why are nights so hard? I spend all nights feeling bad about all the problems that I shouldnâ€™t be feeling bad about and then canâ€™t get out of bed cuz Iâ€™m too fucking tired because I spent all night being sad. The game is rigged and Iâ€™m just about done playing.
