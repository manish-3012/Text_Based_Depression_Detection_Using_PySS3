I'm so angry and so upset and i just want it to be over... pleaseI'm so tired of my own restrictions...i can't get a relationship because I'll ostracised by society...i can't live in peace by myself because i get made jealous...i can't get a job because i bomb interviews (i get so anxious and it shows)...why am i here? To suffer and to watch as others have normal lives around me? While i can't even get out of bed? Is this it? Why? Just wanna cry and want it to be over
