Graduate this past December, still haven't found any opportunities and I'm feeling like a burden.So I went back to school about four years ago because I wasn't finding work. So I found something I enjoyed, I worked through a lot of my problems to be there succeed. I really thought i nailed it...Now, it's been three months since I've found anything, I have a huge debt and time is just flying by. I'm doing my best to look for opportunities but I'm running out of money, places to stay, and more quickly losing confidence in my abilities as each day goes on.  I always said going into it, if it doesn't work on, I could kill myself. I worked so hard for that to not be the case but I feel like it's a fast moving, unapproachable future.  
  
I've been making some goodbye letters to friends and family this week, written on postcards/ thank you notes I had bought for job interviews.
