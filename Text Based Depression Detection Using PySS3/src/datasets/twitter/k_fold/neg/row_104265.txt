Iâ€™m about to lose my mother, and I donâ€™t know what to do.My mother has been diagnosed with a lung disease that is incurable and has a very high chance of death after 2 years. She is my only parent left because my father died when I was 7 years old. Iâ€™m a 20 y/o college student, and she lives across the country. Iâ€™m depressed as it is, and Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™m gonna get through it when the time comes. Iâ€™m heavily contemplating suicide since I feel like I have no one to turn to. I canâ€™t financially support myself, and if I want to, I would have to drop out of school. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
