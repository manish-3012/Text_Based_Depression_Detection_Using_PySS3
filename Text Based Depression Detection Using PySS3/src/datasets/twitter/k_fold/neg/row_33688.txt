Killing myself by the end of the month. In a hopeless situation, and alone..Semester has been shit and I haven't been able to focus on my studies because of depression. Gave my first exam today and it was utter shit, I'm not gonna get enough to pass. One is fine but I have upcoming exams for 5 more subjects and if I fail in any of them it'll come down to me repeating the entire year. All that time and money gone, not to mention I've already dropped out once before. Would also squander my chances of getting out of this shitty country. 

Can't have this happen again, I'd rather die. I live in an Asian country and it would be an extreme source of disappointment for my parents. Literally a complete fucking failure. Results come out end of this month, if they're not what I want I'm offing myself. I've already been tethering on the edge of it all, and this would be the thing that would finally give me a concrete reason towards ending it all. All the better cuz I'd been finding an excuse to get out of this shitty existence since forever. 

The only thing that's stopping me is the grief that it might cause to my close friends and family. But at some point, I'm gonna think more about myself and my pain than I'm gonna do about them. They'll move on eventually, I guess. Everyone dies anyway..

Ugh, I really wish I could have a normal life and I didn't have to leave my close friends. They mean so much to me and helped me tremendously recently :(
