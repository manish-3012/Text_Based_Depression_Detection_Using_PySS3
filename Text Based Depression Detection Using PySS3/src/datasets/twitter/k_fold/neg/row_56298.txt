So I decided to finally talk to someone about getting helpThanks to some encouragement from a Redditor on here who commented on my first post, I talked to one of my best friends about my cutting, my suicidal thoughts...and attempts. I also talked to my mother about what was going on. It was tough...opening up like that. But I'm glad I did it. I've decided go to some kind of counseling as a first step sometime this week. I'm nervous about talking to a shrink, but I want to get better. I don't want to be depressed. Wish me luck.
