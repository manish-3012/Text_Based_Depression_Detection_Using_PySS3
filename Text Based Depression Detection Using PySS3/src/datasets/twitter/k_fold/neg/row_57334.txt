Bad nightIve been suicidal for as long as i can remember. My friend died a little over a year ago and its still so hard. 
i was going through old photos and i saw some of him and it hurt so much more than i expected it to. i feel like vomiting..
he ended his own life with a gun and all i can remember is the last time he came to my house was for a small party i had. he wore pajamas and stayed away from everyone, left early. i never reached out to him, i wish i did. i wish this wasnt such a fucking horrible ending.
i think so much of going back in time its unhealthy, sometimes its all i can dream about. seeing him and helping him.
It hurts so much i just wantnit to stop
