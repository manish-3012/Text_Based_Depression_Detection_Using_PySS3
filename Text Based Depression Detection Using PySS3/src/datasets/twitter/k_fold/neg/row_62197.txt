Throwaway. My girlfriend killed herself last year, and it has been hard to not follow in her footsteps. I am afraid I will tonight.I have been trying for so long to stay alive and fight my suicidal impulses. My girlfriend of 3.5 years committed suicide in April of 2018. My best friend for many years drugged and raped me in 2017. I have been fired as a result of calling the police when the cook at my job assaulted me (he was arrested). My father has shown his true colors as a textbook narcissist and has abandoned my family. I've dealt with Bipolar disorder (type II) for as long as I can remember. Shortly before my girlfriend passed, the work of Albert Camus cured the suicidal impulses I had been dealing with for many years. The Myth of Sisyphus in particular, a reason to live is just as good a reason to die, and vice versa. When my girlfriend shot herself a few weeks later, my resolve to never commit suicide was solidified through my understanding the impact her action had on her family, me, my family, the list goes on. However, after months of heartache, I started feeling suicidal again. It has only gotten worse. I have grown so disconnected and dissociated from my surroundings. I can think of killing myself and the effect it would have on my family, my girlfriend's mother (whom I am very close with), my friends, and more people than I can comprehend. But when I think of this, and think of the pain I will force people to endure because of my selfishness, my desire to die is unaffected. I bought a green cheek conure in August 2018 and she was shipped to me in September. I did this because when I thought of the effect my suicide would have on a bird that is obsessed with me, I actually cried. It was the first time I had felt human in weeks. I love this bird. Her name is Kiwi. Sadly, I am no longer affected that way when thinking of leaving her. I want to join my girlfriend. I miss her so much. I'm sorry Kiwi.

I have not told anyone close to me my choice to end my life tonight. I could never plague them with the thought that they could have stopped me, no matter how much I want to talk to someone about it. I am selfless enough to realize that. I am posting here because I have nowhere else. I used to be scared of committing suicide. But these past few days, I have been craving it. I recently rolled my car and (some have said) miraculously survived with few injuries. I no longer have reliable transportation to college. I am still technically in high school, however, I have finished early and rather than graduating early, I am taking advantage of a state program that allows high schoolers with good grades to go to college early. I am a junior in high school, though I haven't had a high school class since summer 2018. The crash is a turning event, as I no longer have the freedom to do what previously made my life worth living: succeed academically early and actually have something to work for. I feel hopeless.

I used to ponder my girlfriend's decision and question her motives and never be able to find an answer. Now, over these past few weeks, I can confidently say I understand her actions and I can sympathize with her. It's eerie and morbid, but it makes me confident in my feelings.

I am posting here because I have nowhere else. I don't expect anything. It felt nice writing this all out. If I follow through with my plans, I will make sure this note is easy to find for my family and friends so that they can better understand my actions. I don't expect for them or anyone to sympathize with or understand me completely. I am aware of how selfish I am. I am flawed, and I am broken. I am done, and I look forward to joining my girlfriend on the other side.
