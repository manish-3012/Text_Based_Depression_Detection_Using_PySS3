I had it all and I fucked everything up like always... Goodbye K10 years with you.. I didn't show you how much you mean to me often enough. I tried to change but in the end it was too late and I had already pushed you away. I wanted to give you everything. In the end I gave you nothing but pain and anxiety.

So thankful I have more than enough pills to not wake up tomorrow and not feel this pain I caused myself anymore.
