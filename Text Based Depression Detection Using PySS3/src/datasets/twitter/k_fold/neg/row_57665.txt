Been having a rough timeIâ€™m not sure what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve been failing a class almost the entire year, which is the first time this has ever happened, and actually cheated on a test in another class that I was scared I was gonna fail as well. Ended up getting caught which just lost me more points. My own family makes fun of me for it, other people make fun of me for it, and I feel so guilty and useless.
