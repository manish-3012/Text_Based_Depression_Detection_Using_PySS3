The fear and guiltI read a post on r/AskReddit about what people who had died and come back had experienced. It changed everything.

Now, the fear that was holding me back is gone. But how do I deal with the guilt? I don't want to leave my family behind with my debt, with my bills. I want to make things as simple as possible. 

Every day hurts. And I have to put up with the pain so my family doesn't hurt. And I hate it.
