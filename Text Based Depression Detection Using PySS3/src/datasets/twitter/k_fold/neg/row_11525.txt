Waste of oxygenTo anyone who reads this, Iâ€˜m sorry I bother you but Iâ€˜ve been crying for the last half an hour and maybe if I share this I will be able to finally fall asleep. 

I feel like my depression is getting worse and I donâ€˜t really understand why, the world just becomes this grey mass. I care less and less about anything and everything loses meaning to me. Itâ€˜s hard to see that now even your subconsciousness is preparing for you to die.

 Idk how to reverse this I donâ€™t want to be like this but I know that if this continues suicide eventually will be all thatâ€™s left for me because there will be nothing worth living for.  I am on meds but they donâ€™t seem to have the desired effect They occasionally help me not care as much about how much everything sucks. 

I despise people but I find myself needing them but I donâ€™t want to need anyone and now I even stopped caring about people I actually love, I stopped fighting for whatâ€™s important to me, I stopped having any wishes or expectations, 

I am existing but not living. And thatâ€™s a waste of oxygen the earth might desperately need.
