The real world finally caught up to me.I'm 21 and I've been depressed my entire life. I literally can't remember a time when I wasn't depressed - I've been having suicidal ideation since I was in the second grade. I've never been able to hold a job, and I'm going to therapy now, but it's a slow process. 

My family supports me financially, but not emotionally. My dad left me a long letter today detailing how he won't continue allowing me to live in his house without paying for things, and I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.

I've tried to hold jobs, but always ended up quitting or freaking out on the first day. I just wish my parents asked me how I was feeling and tried to work with me rather than holding a sword over my head. 

I don't know what to do...
