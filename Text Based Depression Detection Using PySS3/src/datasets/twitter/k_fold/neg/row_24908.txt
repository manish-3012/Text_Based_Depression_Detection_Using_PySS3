I don't know why I'm so depressed/ suicidalI think about suicide daily. I don't know why I just do. It could be because of economic reasons , personal reasons (I'm gay), I have HIV, I hate where I live. I'm 24 now and I feel like I've wasted my life. Oh god most days I wish I was dead. . . and when I think of suicide, I try and say 5 things I'm thankful for but I always end up being sad still. I hate this shit
