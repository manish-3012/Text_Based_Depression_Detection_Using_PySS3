I give up; I'm doing it right here, right nowNo-one can stop me. I'm breaking the cycle, once and for all. I've got the belt ready. I'm just gonna listen to my favorite piece of music then do it. It feels so great. This finally feelsâ€”after about 10 attemptsâ€”like the one that'll actually succeed. I feel like laughing in my grief. Anyways, bye everyone! See you in hell.
