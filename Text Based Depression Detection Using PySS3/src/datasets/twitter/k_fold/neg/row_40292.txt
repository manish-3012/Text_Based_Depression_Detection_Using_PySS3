I tried and failed just like everything elseI spent my day so far preparing for my suicide getting things in order and rewriting all my suicide notes as well as picking how I wanna go out of the plethora of options ive prepared. About 15 minutes ago I was finally ready I put a bag over head the oxygen ran out and became extremely uncomfortable and eventually I panicked and ripped the bag of my head I regretted it immediately no clue what to do now.
