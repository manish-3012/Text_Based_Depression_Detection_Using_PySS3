I want to sufferI finally figured it out. I don't want to die, I just want to suffer. I want something really bad to happen to me. It would allow me to just be depressed without hurting people close to me or being called a pussy or a weirdo. I have what many people would consider a great life and nothing to be depressed about, but I just am. I feel guilty about being depressed. If something really bad happened to me that was out of my control, I could truly let out my emotions. I realized that I have been the happiest after I have suffered and recovered.

I am a selfish asshole for wanting this, and it really concerns me.
