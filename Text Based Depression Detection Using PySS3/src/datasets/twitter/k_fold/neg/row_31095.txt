I hate myself for how emotionally abusive I am to my mom and sisterIt's out of fucking control. I just fly of the handle with texts and spew pure vitriol and hatred at them. They know I've had a hard life and they still root for me and try and be nice to me and I still always treat them like dog shit because I hate myself. Doesn't seem escapable?
