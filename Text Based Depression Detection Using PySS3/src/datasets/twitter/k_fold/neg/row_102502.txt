My mom is suicidalThis isn't about me, so I'm not sure if it belongs here. My mom told me last night that she's suicidal. She said she would go to a psychologist if I went with her. But she won't make the appointment, and she's almost treating me as a psychologist, unloading everything onto me. She also told me not to tell anyone, but I told my (adult) siblings anyway. I know I should take this seriously, but it's hard to when I see her with these options and try to help her, but the only help she wants from me is to listen to her. I feel like I'm not qualified for this. What if she doesn't go, and does actually kill herself? What should I do?
