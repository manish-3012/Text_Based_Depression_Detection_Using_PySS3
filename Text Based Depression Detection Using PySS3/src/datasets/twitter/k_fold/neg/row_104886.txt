It's over, I'm doneIt took me 3 years to get over a girl I dated for 2 months. How long will it take me to get over someone I dated for 2 years? Can someone do the math on that? Not just dated but loved with every atom in my body. Only good memories. Soul mates. Perfect together. The only person I could fully be myself around and understood me completely. It's useless trying to put it in words. I'm not going through that pain again I just can't and I won't.  
This will most likely be my last post. I will delete my Reddit before I go so no one(My ex) finds it and feels guilty. He doesn't deserve that. 
I tried the hardest I ever have in my entire life, like really fuckin tried for once, I still couldn't fix my mistakes. I failed once again. I played with fire, I burned it all down. I'll be going now. I'm not gonna give every reason I'm killing myself but don't think this is only cause a damn relationship. It's like all signs are pointing to one thing and I feel stupid for even finding a reason to stay and fight it. I guess I lost. 20 years to amount to nothing. I truly believe I wasn't meant to be born. To many problems to count and it feels like most days I'm only pretending to be a person. There was one person that saw anything in me and I made him hate me. I'm righting this on here cause it's the only way I can truly say how I feel. Iits gonna happen this weekend if I can last till then. Goodbye.
Sorry for any typos, I typed fast and didn't read anything. 
TL;DR I'm gonna kill myself
