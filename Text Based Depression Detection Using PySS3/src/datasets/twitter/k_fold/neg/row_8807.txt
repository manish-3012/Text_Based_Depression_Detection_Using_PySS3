If it happens, it'll happen soon.I'm about to finish my Master's Degree in music.  My plan has been to stay at this school for my doctorate.  My teacher just told me that he doesn't want me to stay and it's because I'm not playing well enough.  Feels bad.

Sometime over the last two years I just lost my way.  I'm not sure where or how but I feel so lost.  I used to work so much faster and harder and I used to be fearless.  Where did that go?  I was killing it!  Now I'm just slow and stupid and afraid of everything.  

I don't really have a backup plan for next year.  I feel like I'm just going to end up getting some lame job to make rent and never be a musician.  That life is not what I went into debt for.  

ugh
