DivorceMy wife is finally leaving me. Good, she should be happy (this is not knock against myself). I'm about to pick up 14k from my fathers life insurance. I'm thinking things would be easier in the long run if I leave that to her and our child, and bail the fuck out so he can have a "together" father figure. I know she's already into someone else who is amazing, so why bog my son down with me?
