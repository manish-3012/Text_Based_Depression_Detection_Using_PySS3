I think I'm readyI've been suicidal since I was six. Every year I'd tell myself to give it another chance. See if maybe things would get better, but they didnt. I stopped making that promise years ago, but always held out because of a quote "it's not worth the bother of killing yourself, because you always kill yourself too late" and that helped for a while. But I can't handle it anymore. 

There's nothing particularly bad about my life. Yes I was raped. Yes I've been abused by many people, but right now, I've got a flat on my own and am going to uni. I can't really complain. I'm a social outcast, but I don't mind. I read, and I game, and that works fine. But there's something that makes life unlivable for me, I have borderline personality disorder. I'm constantly breaking down, constantly paranoid, always scared. I can't have a normal relationship with anyone, and I never will be able to. 
I'm not smart enough to pass uni, I can't manage to get a job, despite three years of trying. And you know what? I'm done. I've scheduled emails to the police telling them where to find my body. All my payments are automatic, and my things are sorted into boxes and labeled with where they go, so my parents wont have to do much. 

I'm tired. I've lived my life doing things for other people, so im going to do something for me.
