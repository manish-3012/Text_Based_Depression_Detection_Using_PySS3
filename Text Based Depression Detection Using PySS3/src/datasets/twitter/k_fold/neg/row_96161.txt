Can I talk to someone for a while?Hey. I'm 17 and my name is Andre. I'm dealing with a lot and it would be good to have someone to talk to, because I'm alone right now fighting my thoughts. It's fine to talk about anything, just please be careful not to overload me, because I get anxious easily.

Thanks for reading, whether you respond or not. I hope you have a good day. I love the people on this sub.
