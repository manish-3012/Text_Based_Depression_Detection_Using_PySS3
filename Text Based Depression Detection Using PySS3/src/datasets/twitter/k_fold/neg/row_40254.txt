Ashamed Of Myself &amp; AloneI have battled depression for years but somehow managed to hold on to hope no matter how hard life got but now I feel the situation I am in is finally the tipping point in losing my fight against suicide. I feel ashamed admitting this but I am gay had two hook ups recently and quickly regretted the second one in particular and with no one to talk to it all and knowing that if I did people I know would accept I am gay or my bad regretful decisions of hooking up with two random people; therefore better off dead to everyone as I can go living feeling like this even if I have a job interview in a couple days time and have a dream to become a Entertainment person because love movies and talking about them on my YouTube that has been inactive for a while. I am sorry for being burden on you all with all this
