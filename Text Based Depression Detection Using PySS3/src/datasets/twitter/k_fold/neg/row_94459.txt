iâ€™m gonna do it todayi donâ€™t want to do it anymore. my girlfriend left me. she blocked me. i loved her so much. i still love her. i see her in zoom meetings smiling at the kids jokes and i canâ€™t take it. i fucked it up so bad. iâ€™m autistic. i canâ€™t eat normal. iâ€™m ugly, i canâ€™t get into any colleges. i donâ€™t have any marketable skills. iâ€™ve been thinking about my life, present, future, and past for the past so long, and i canâ€™t find a single reason to keep going. itâ€™ll make everybody i love sad, but i donâ€™t have to deal with the guilt of that, cause iâ€™ll be dead. i love my sister and my two friends so much and i canâ€™t imagine how itâ€™s gonna hurt them to know iâ€™m dead. but i canâ€™t justify living anymore. everything i do is just to make somebody else happy. iâ€™m never gonna make my self happy, iâ€™ll never be good enough, and i canâ€™t make anybody else happy. i thought i made her happy, and she said i did, but she lied. she admitted it. so iâ€™m done. iâ€™m gonna find a spot thatâ€™s high enough that if i jump off it iâ€™ll die. i realized that i donâ€™t exist to other people a few nights ago, and i canâ€™t stop dreaming about her. thank you so much for you support and your time, but i canâ€™t exist for your pleasure anymore. especially when iâ€™m failing. sayonara guys, see you on the other side
