Over the last few weeks Iâ€™ve been feeling like shit suicidal thoughtsIâ€™m a teen and already I feel like Iâ€™m gonna get judged by everyone 

My issue is that Iâ€™m too afraid to talk to anyone, cause I think theyâ€™ll assume Iâ€™m just seeking attention 

Whatâ€™s the best way to talk to someone about it?
