Need help but don't know what kind or where to get it.So why I'm posting here is obvious... I've tried to stay hopeful about my situation but the time is just wearing down on me. I've tried therapy and it ended up with my therapist (who I genuinely think is a good therapist) saying that there wasn't much we could do through therapy alone. So I've been on meds for around 3-4 weeks now (yes I know that's like no time at all... but still). There's been no noticeable improvement and I'm just continuing to spiral further and further. I'm just at a loss I guess. And the way I see it suicide is a (final) solution to the constant pain. Every other option seems exhausted...
