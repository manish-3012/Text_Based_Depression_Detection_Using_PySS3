I'm scared I'm finally going to kill myself.That's it. I'm scared I'm going to do it. I still make throwaways when I post here because I'm scared about someone finding out who I really am but now there's a part of me that hopes someone does. I've given up on life. After 7 years waiting for "it to get better" I'm drained. I feel empty. Sure there are short periods where I feel ok, but pushing my way through every day with a feeling of complete worthlessness has depleted me. I used to say the only thing keeping me from killing myself was my old dog and best friend. He's been dead for 6 months and 5 days now. I'm scared.
