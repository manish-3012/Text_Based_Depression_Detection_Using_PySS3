I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t go with itI live such a miserable life. I am a fat, ugly pig that no one wants to be around with, I have a bad temper and none of my family members like me. I donâ€™t really see a future for myself. I am going to college but I honestly have no interest in school. So my question is why canâ€™t I really do it ( kill myself)? I have tried so many times before, using different methods too but when I get to that point I always chicken out,as if I have anything better to do. So please help me finally get the courage to end it all.
