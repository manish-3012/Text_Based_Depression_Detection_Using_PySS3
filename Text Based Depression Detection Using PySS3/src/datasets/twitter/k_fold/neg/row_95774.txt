Need advice for helping niece, please. [x-post r/truerainbow]My apologies if this isn't the correct subreddit. 

Background: We have a 19 year old niece that we're very concerned about in regards to her mental health. She appears to be severely depressed and has made suicidal comments in passing. She does not work or go to school. She basically just sleeps all day and parties at night while living in her girlfriends' parent's basement. While her immediate family tolerates her they definitely don't support her. She has pretty much couch-surfed since she was 15 (although due to the fact she wasn't comfortable at home not because she was kicked out). The family is dysfunctional in so many other elements that we don't believe her depression is only related to her sexuality but we do believe it plays a large part in it. Her mother forced her to stay in the closet from age 12-18. Her family are religious conservatives. She has never had a relationship with her father. She's been in a lot of trouble with the law in the past. And, so on you get the drift. While we have always maintained a good and positive relationship with her &amp; have been supporting the LGBTQ community since before she was born -- we're at a loss for how to help her.

We have tried staying in contact with her but she remains distant. When we do get to see her she avoids any real depth of conversation. We've offered her housing, help getting quality therapy, hep with college expenses, etc. The rest of the family just brushes off any concern over her and we're at a loss on how to go about making sure she doesn't become another statistic.

We want her to be happy and content and productive. I feel that until her depression is treated she can't progress in life &amp; yet we can't force her to get help.

Anyone that has advice for how we can support our niece we're all ears.
