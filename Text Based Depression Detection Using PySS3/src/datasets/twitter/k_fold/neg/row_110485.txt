I have no purpose in life and I'll never be successful.I've been depressed since 8 or 9 but it was a more innocent form of it. I never had friends in middle school and was bullied a decent amount. The only friends I ever made either found me annoying or got tired of me clinging to them. I have OCD and I definitely went overboard with following them around/frequent calls. I'm not like that now but it was a big part of why I never had friends. Then I got into high school and my depression multiplied. I was lucky to make it to school 3 or 4 days a week. I hardly ever did my homework and at the end of my sophomore year I missed a month and a half of the last bit of the school year. I got a chance to go to this really good charter school. The teachers were fantastic but I wasn't taking my meds at the time. I didn't do the homework for 3 months and ended up dropping out. I tried to commit suicide 2 times that year plus took aspirin to punish myself. In high school almost all of my few friends were online. One of the few friends I had met in 4th grade was always really popular and had an easy time making + keeping friends. I was always really envious of her.. She made friends on the second day of our freshman year and was still friends with them two years after that. I was spending a lot of time online and I met this girl that I became best friends with. I ended up dating her and we knew each other for less than 4 months before we cut things off. It took me more than two years to not regularly think of her anymore. She literally would keep me up at night and make me feel sick because I would remember all the stuff she said to me. I stopped being friends with her in December of 2012. 2013 rolled around and I felt like I could get my shit together. I stopped starving myself (I was severely underweight) and eventually gained almost 140 pounds over the course of two and a half years. It had to do with my current medicine plus I started eating more. I'm now stuck with really noticeable deep stretch marks all over my entire body. It was really hard to go from 83 pounds to 200+ and it made me hate myself so much more. Going back to 2013, later that year I met my current best friend plus started dating someone. I felt pretty happy but I broke up with that person the same year. In 2014 I started being friends with this person that eventually became my other best friend. As of two months ago I'm no longer friends with him as well as his boyfriend. I lost 5 friends this year, 3 of which I was really close to. I'm turning 19 in less than a month and I still haven't gotten my GED. I can't drive, in fact I haven't even sat behind the wheel of a car EVER. I have no motivation, no happiness, and I hate my life so much. I forgot to mention my housing situation. My house is so messy it doesn't feel like home. It's just somewhere where I exist. I get a lot of frustration from living in a place where I'm constantly bumping into stuff. I just want all the stuff to disappear so I can have people over at my house. My mom always says that if I even do 20 minutes of cleaning every day it'll make a difference. I can't do anything for myself and I'll never survive without my mom. I don't have basic life skills and I've never done laundry. I let soda cans pile up because I only get up to get a new soda and don't discard the old can. It honestly feels like it'll never get better. I'm not cut out to be an adult let alone a successful adult. I'm sorry that this post is a mess. I'm so tired of being alive. I hate feeling like my few friends don't even like me that much. I only have one friend I can hang out with in person. I know that suicide is inevitable for me but I don't know how or when it'll occur.
