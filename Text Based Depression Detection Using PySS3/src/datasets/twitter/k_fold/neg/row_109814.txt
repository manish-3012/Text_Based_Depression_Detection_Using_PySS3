I don't know how I'm going to get by in the next few hours.I don't want to live anymore. I'm tired of caring about anything. I can't make myself do anything but cut myself. I want to die but I don't want to kill myself. I don't know what to do.

I have no idea how I'm supposed to put my feelings into words. I'm just sad. I don't feel like doing anything. I'm apathetic to everything around me. I can't focus on anything. I don't know what's wrong with me.

I'm scared I'm gonna do something that I'll regret later. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to live like this either.
