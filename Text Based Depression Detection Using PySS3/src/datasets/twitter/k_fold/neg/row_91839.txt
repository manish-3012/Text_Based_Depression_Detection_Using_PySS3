Lost everything and everyoneIâ€™ve lost everything and everyone I loved, I pushed everyone I loved because of my mental state. The worst part was that no one cared. No one even tried to help. I feel so alone. I have no one. Iâ€™m stuck. Iâ€™m a 17 year old guy with nothing to lose anymore. The person I loved the most tried to help but I pushed them away and they havnt tried to help anymore. They recently unfollowed me on Instagram and now I know they wonâ€™t be tryin to help. I miss them so fucken much but at the same time I donâ€™t want them to help me anymore. They deserve better, right?  Theyâ€™ll be better off without me, right? I want them to text me so bad but then I get the thought of, you can miss something but not want it back. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve been taking pills for a long time now and recently been taking kore each day hoping one day I donâ€™t wake up, Iâ€™m tired of not having hope anymore. I just wanna give up. It wonâ€™t be hard, I already have a plan. I miss everyone but no one misses me. When I die I donâ€™t want anyone there because no one was there when I was alive.
