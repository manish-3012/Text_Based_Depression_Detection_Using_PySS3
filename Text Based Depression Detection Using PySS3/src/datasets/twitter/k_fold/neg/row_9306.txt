Life long death wishI am 38 and chronically suicidal. I am not planning anymore. But death couldnâ€™t come quick enough. My life wonâ€™t change anymore and will probably only get worse.

Years long therapy hasnâ€™t worked. Antidepressants donâ€™t work anymore. Self harm isnâ€™t sufficient anymore. I take morphine to numb myself. 

People who tell me please not to kill myself enrage me. It doesnâ€™t work. 

Every night I pray I wonâ€™t wake up and every morning I do.
