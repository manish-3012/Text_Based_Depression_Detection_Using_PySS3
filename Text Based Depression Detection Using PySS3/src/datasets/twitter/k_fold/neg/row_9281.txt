Why am I still alive :(So before I made a post saying that I did lose my job and I was very angry at myself and etc. People gave me some advice and I did appreciate them but unfortunately, I still got no callbacks I got some interviews but I know that goes they just interview me and they never call me back. Why am I even trying? I know I will never get a chance anymore cause I know no one will hire me. I really want to give up I really do why am I still alive after people making fun of me in my past even teachers made fun of me like why did people really wanted to hurt me in the past. All I want to do now and just sit there and just wait for something to happen.
