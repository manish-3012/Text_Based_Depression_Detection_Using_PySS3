I'd rather end my suffering than wait for things to get better when I know they won'tI've already picked out a date before the year ends and I actually feel very at peace with my decision, as well as relief knowing that I won't be tortured with horrible depression every single day. I've suffered from horrible depression since I was 13, therapy and drugs never helped me at all, and now I'm at a point where I can't even afford it anyways. My family doesn't want to have anything to do with me, all of my old friends have moved away or have new lives and have cut off contact. the only good thing I had was a relationship that ended a couple months ago, and the breakup really fucked me up mentally, and I know I will never feel better. I know no one else will want to date or associate with me and I'm just done with trying. My life doesn't have a meaning and there is really no other reason for me to be here. I just waste people's time and resources and take up space. For once in my life I actually feel at peace knowing that I'm in control of ending my own suffering.
