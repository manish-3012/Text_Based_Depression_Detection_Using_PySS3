"Where is Death?"My brother sent me a text a couple of months before he passed away. 

He stated that his cancer pain was so intense, that he internally and secretly would scream, "Where is death!?" 

I find myself doing the same thing, except my pain isn't for cancer and everything that goes with that. It's only emotional and psychological pain. 

I haven't attempted anything. Although, I was close to doing something the day and week of his death. 7 months later, I'm still here. Mostly on auto pilot, however.

 But grief is the worst and strongest emotion that I've ever felt. I've always been depressed/anxious/passively suicidal, but this pain has been very intense for me.

I always see people dying all over the news from one thing or another. Some deaths make dying look so easy. And I wonder when it will be my turn. Where is death?
