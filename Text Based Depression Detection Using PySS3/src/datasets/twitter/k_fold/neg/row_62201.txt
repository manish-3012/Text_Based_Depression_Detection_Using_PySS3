Train StationI've recently fallen deeply and quickly into a bad depressive episode due to a series of events in my life, so much so that it has pushed me into regular self harm for the first time. I suffer from suicide ideation, I really don't want to be alive but I also don't want to kill myself right now.

Just now at a train station I had a profound experience.  A train was passing straight through and I had stood up to wait for mine, and decided to stay near the front of the platform when it passed, just to feel the strength of its passing. It was intoxicating in a weird way, the shockwave of air which hit me and nearly knocked me over as it shot past, to feel the force of an object that in a moment like that really could snuff me out of existence in an instant. The sheer power of it, and the closeness to it spoke to me on a weird level (I know how bizarre this sounds).

I didn't want to throw myself in front of it, nor would I use such an inconsiderate method if I were to want to die one day, but I just enjoyed that brief moment of feeling truly close to a possible force of death.

Sorry if this post is inappropriate or anything, I just felt like sharing and didn't know where else to put it really.
