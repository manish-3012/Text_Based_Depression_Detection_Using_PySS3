I still do not want to die. But i can't kill myselfI have begun to question things, how it is really to love someone like me, really my relationships have ended with my problems because of my borderline personality dissorder along with them my aggressiveness, emotional limit and certainly my depression.
I would like to do well, feel good again with myself, but even that does not happen.
