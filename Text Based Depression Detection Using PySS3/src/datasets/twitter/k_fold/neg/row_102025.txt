22 and a whole life of BSI'm turning 22 in a few days and I can't believe I held on this long. 

My arms hurt a lot due to my last bout of self harm and I recall that a year ago I said if I didn't get therapy in 6 weeks I'd be dead. Well I didn't, and I tried and I know I'll try again. 

Having BPD is so hard to live with and they keep giving me medication. It sometimes helps, I won't deny that and I'm not childish enough to. But the bad dreams, the not sleeping, the withdrawal. It's such a pain.

I've been telling them for nearly 3 years that all I want is therapy, I just want to talk about all I've been through. How I went from Gifted and Talented to a College and University drop out. The mistakes I've made and can't handle.

But no. They say they're scared I'll kill myself if I bring it up to someone. But I'm also going to kill myself if I don't.  I go through it all every day in my head alone and I just want a professional there to listen and helo but they never do.

I don't fucking want to reach 22. I don't want to.
