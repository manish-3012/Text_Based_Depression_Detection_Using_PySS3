I snapped tonight, and I've done some things I wish I didn't.....My friend was talking to me over the Xbox, and when finding out it wasn't actually them, all of my trust just dissolved. Something snapped, I have no fucking clue why or how, but I suddenly became 1000 times more hostile. I was barking into the mic, not talking at all at most times. I gave up, turned off the Xbox, and sat against the wall with my hoodie up, crying.

Why? I have no clue. I began talking to myself, telling myself just how I wasn't near good enough, would never fit in, things to that extent. I was crying so hard I was shaking.

I started picking at the scab I had from when I cut on Sunday night, and soon found myself with a screw scraping at my arm. It wasn't working. I threw it in disgust, and kept spitting the phlegm. Eventually, fed up with myself in some sort of way or another, I started gagging myself. The whole bulimic part of me was showing through again.

I stumbled downstairs, found a pair of scissors, and finished the deed on my wrist. 

I have no fucking idea what's wrong with me, and why I just out of the blue did this. My friend says this was a breakdown, but all he knows is I ran off crying. I turned into a monster in a matter of minutes. A bulimic, anorexic, (yes, I am both, don't question me), emo piece of shit who sat in the dark listing off ways for me to die. Any help?

I'll respond in the morning. It's 1am and I'm going to sleep.
