I feel like such a failureI've worked at my job in healthcare for 3.5 years on the same unit. But I recently got my nursing license,  so I can't work as my former role (tech) anymore. I interviewed for a nursing position there last week and just got an email of declination. From the unit I've worked on for 3.5 years. I feel so betrayed. I mean.. if they don't want me, why would anywhere else? I've been out on maternity leave, and was slated to go back next week. But now I can't go back. I didn't get to tell any of my friends a proper goodbye. They all thought I'd be coming back. I just don't know what to do. I feel like a complete and total failure. I just want to keep taking my anxiety meds until I can't feel anything. 

I want to scream. And.. ask WHY?! What did I do? I thought I had a family there, but obviously not .
