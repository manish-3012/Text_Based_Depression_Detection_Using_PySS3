social anxiety is ruining my lifeI'm 20 and have had crippling social anxiety my entire life. When I was very young my parents thought I had a disability and didn't say anything because I didn't understand what was going on but that wasn't the case. School was a nightmare, in elementary school kids would take advantage of my inability to say no, and in high school I had a teacher who told me he called on me in class just because it made my face turn red every time. My mom died when I was 14 and everything has been going downhill since. When I was 16 and didn't want to get out of bed because I felt so depressed my dad's solution was to yell at me for being a baby and then pull me out of bed and try to take my pajamas off so he could dress me for the day. I went to counselors but was too afraid to talk to them so it didn't help and my dad didn't want me on medication so that was that. I'm currently unemployed and can't get or keep a job. I've been to 4 interviews but before I even sit down in the chair my heart races, my mind goes blank, and my throat feels like it's closing. I've lost count of how many opportunities I've missed out on because of social anxiety. I spend the majority of my days in bed, I gained 35 pounds, and I buzzed off my long hair because I had stopped taking care of it. I was looking for a doctor until I realized that my insurance won't even work for anything other than emergencies because I am in a different state than my dad now. I'm just tired of being miserable.
