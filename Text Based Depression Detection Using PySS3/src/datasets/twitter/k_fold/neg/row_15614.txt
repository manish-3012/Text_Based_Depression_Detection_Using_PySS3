My mother told me I was a cowardJust what the title says. I've been struggling with thoughts of suicide for the past two months and have been talking to my mother and brother about getting help, but I guess I wore them out. A few hours ago, my mother got back from work and got into a huge tirade about how I was comparing myself to trauma victims who were raped and abused by being suicidal, and how I was wasting all the work she had done for me, and how if I kept talking about suicide she would kick me out of the house, and completed her tirade by tossing a pillow at the floor, screaming at me that I was a coward(she said it twice, more than merrier I suppose), then leaving the house and driving off. I packed my things and left. My grandmother was at the house, and tried to convince me to stay, so it was hard at first, but I had to go. After walking down the street for about 40 minutes my dad came to pick me up, so at least my mom was decent enough to call him when she found out I left. I'm staying at his place for now.
It just really hard because I'm not trying to compare myself to trauma victims. I can't even imagine their pain. I've had a good life, by all accounts. It's just been hard. What's even harder is that my mother has been a Christian for almost two decades and works as a psych counselor. Guess she doesn't risk losing a job if she calls her depressed son a coward and not a patient. My brother hates me a lot as well, blaming me for hurting mom and grandma. So that part's tough too, especially since he's a good guy. I don't know. I want to cry, but I feel detached. Even when I left home I didn't put that much thought into it. Things are just tough right now.
