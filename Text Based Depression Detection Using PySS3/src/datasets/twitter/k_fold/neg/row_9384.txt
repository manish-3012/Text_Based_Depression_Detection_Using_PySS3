Where do you people get money for therapyWHY THE FUCK DOES EVERYONE TELL YOU TO GET HELP WHEN IT COST SO FUCKING MUCH. 

I DONT have Medicaid and even then I cant fucking afford dedutible because i dont have any fucking money due to being fired many times for my incompetence. What the actual fuck, i am barely able to sruvife, sorry, i dont have fucking 100 dollar per session, no way to get properly diagnosed, no way to get ssi for schizo. 

What are we supposed to do? We want help yet you say to get it while shoving half our weekly pay check per session.
