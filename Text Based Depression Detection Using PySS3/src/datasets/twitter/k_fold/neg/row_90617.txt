Im not scared anymore.I used to be afraid of having a gun in the house, over the fear that I might use it to end my life one day. I don't think I fear death anymore; the consequences that will remain for any loved ones I have left, sure. I now view it more as a ticket out that I can hold onto for a while. 

Telling myself that things may one day be better doesn't help. Pretty sure my brain is just stuck the way it is and I'll always be miserable and make everyone around me miserable or hate talking to me. Can't blame them either, I know how exhausting I can be. I still wish they cared, or noticed at least.

I'm just too tired of everything being the way it is and I feel powerless to change anything. Oblivion doesn't seem so bad.
