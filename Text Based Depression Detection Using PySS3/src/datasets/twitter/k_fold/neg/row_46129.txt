I want peaceI am suicidal because something is wrong with my body and is causing me to smell like feces or a fart. Iâ€™ve had the last 7 years of my life taken away from me by this mysterious illness. It has affected everything from my presence in school, the ability to work an hold a job, interactions with people, the way I act, and so much more. I am just tired of having to live this way in so much emotional pain with absolutely no support. Itâ€™s not a hygiene issue but I bet most strangers think it is. The worst part of it all is that I cannot smell it myself.
