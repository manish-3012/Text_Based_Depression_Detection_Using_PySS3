This city has a beautiful skyline, I'd really like it to be the last thing I see...I'm going blind very quickly.  The nightmares of my abusive past keep me up at night.  Chronic physical pain compliments my chronic mental pain perfectly.  I've been alone romantically for 10 years, my family no longer speaks to me.  My "job" as a stand up comic at the open mic level is terrible, the only thing funny is that I thought I could ever be good at it.  I've been struggling with my self harm habits but it's not enough, I just want to climb up the closest parking structure, look off into the beautiful night, see the colors of the buildings I'll never afford to live in full of happy people who have a love for each other I'll never know, put one foot in front of the other just one last time and exit this cursed fucking existence.  I may just do that before this weekend, perhaps before this night is over.  If it comes to pass, be well Reddit.  I love you and there's not a thing you can do about it.
