Going to war with myself to exist everyday.These thoughts become more intrusive everyday from the moment my eyes open, if I can even sleep. I donâ€™t think someone like me can live as a normal human being. I have lived through too much violence and itâ€™s left me stunted. My mind feels like itâ€™s white knuckling to get through everyday. I think the only kind of relief will come when I go. Unfortunately I have two people financially dependent on me but Iâ€™m almost done paying for my siblings college, if I can make it past that I wonâ€™t stick around. I canâ€™t cry or communicate no matter how hard I try. I am tired.

I feel shame in writing this to strangers but I do appreciate it. First time I have ever written any thoughts down.
