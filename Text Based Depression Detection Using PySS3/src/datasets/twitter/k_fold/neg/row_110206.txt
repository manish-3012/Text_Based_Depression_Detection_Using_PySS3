My only goal in the end is death. There is nothing in between. Iâ€™d rather skip to the end quickly and save the filler.This is going to be a long one. It is probably going to be incoherent aswell so be warned.

Ever since i was 5 Iâ€™ve always craved death. It mystified me. It was the one thing i looked forward to, for the better or worse.

Iâ€™ve had my share of pain and misfortune. Life never was in my favor. 

From an outsider standpoint, it would seem as though i had a great life. Sure, i may have a better life than others but it never felt like that.

My dad is a stoner, he gets angry when he doesnt have pot and is emotionally abusive.

My mom is bipolar. She lives in denial of it, but everyone she knows has told her she is bipolar.

Both parents cause me enough stress as it is. But my friends cause stress as well.

My friends are really cool. I love them. I cant even explain how much I appreciate them for being here.
Im always scared that they will eventually leave me. I dont know why i am. I always try my best to make sure everyone else is happy. No matter if it hurts me.

I dont think im an angel, to be honest i think i dont even deserve life. My motivation is at the bare minimum and i know i serve no purpose to this world.

I have 5 failed suicide attempts at the age of 13 (3 of which were between 11 and 13)

Everyone (besides my friends) who ive talked to about my suicidal ideology thinks its for attention.

I want to kill myself just to spite them. Just to show them that i wasnt joking.

I fucking hate everyone on earth with a burning passion. Iâ€™d never take it out on anyone, but the hate lies within me.

I take my hate out on myself instead.

I suffer from depression on a daily basis and a undiagnosed eating disorder. 

I dont wanna live anymore. There is no point
