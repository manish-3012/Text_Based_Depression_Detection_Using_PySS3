Fuck the Suicide Hotline...I just got off the line with the Suicide Hotline... Waste of fucking time. I feel like I've gotten more empathy when I call Comcast. Here I am, crying, and I suddenly get "Well, we've talked about a lot..." which is call center speak for "time to go, get off my phone". 

I'm giving up. Not even the fucking national help line gives two shits about me. Why should I even try to carry on? 

All I gotta do is pop some pills. I did the calculations and I have enough for the desired effect. I have no reason to try anymore. Fuck this planet, and fuck the people who "care".
