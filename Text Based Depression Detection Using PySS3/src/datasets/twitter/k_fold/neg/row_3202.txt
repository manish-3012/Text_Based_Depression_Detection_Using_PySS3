I wonder if Iâ€™m too scared to end it cuzI told myself I would write letters to everyone that matters and all that shit. Maybe clean my room, tell my best friend my laptop password so he can have access to all my unreleased music and make more shit off my laptop. Give different people different things of mine that I want them to have. 

I told myself I would do these things about a week ago and I havenâ€™t done it yet. Either Iâ€™m too lazy or too scared because I havenâ€™t done shit and I still feel this pain every day.
