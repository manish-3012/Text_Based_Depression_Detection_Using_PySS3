I'm willing to listen if you're willing to talk loveI'm going through a rough patch and often find myself contemplating suicide but while I may think this way I also feel so much sadness knowing others feel that way. If you need to talk or vent please message me. I might not have many talents but I'm a fantastic listener. I'd love to try to help however I can.
