Hanging on by a thread.Iâ€™m afraid to die but I truly believe it is the only way out. I have spent most of my existence being miserable and hating myself and my life for no good reason other then feeling hell inside my mind. I donâ€™t even want happiness or fulfillment any more I just want nothingness. I just want to not exist.
