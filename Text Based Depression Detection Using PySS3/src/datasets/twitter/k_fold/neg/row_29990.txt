Give me some good reasons on why I should keep living-no one likes me at school

-I'm failing miserably in school

-pretty sure I'm really dumb

-no girl wants me

-people mock me every day which resulted in me becoming shy 

-I don't like myself anymore 

-I don't like the way I look 90% of the time

-I'm dumb

-I'm lazy

-even the things I used to enjoy before are now becoming less and less enjoyable for me

-everywhere around me are happy and successfull people that are better than me in every possible way

Sry for my English it's not my first language
