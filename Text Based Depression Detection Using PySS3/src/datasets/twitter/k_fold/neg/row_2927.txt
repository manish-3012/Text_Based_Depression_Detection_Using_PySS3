I failed at everythingfailed at everything, I have no idea where time went, I just turned 26, I have no job no friends, didnâ€™t graduate high school, I donâ€™t even know how to drive a car, for the past 6-7 year I literally been in the house. Seems like depression took over my life, not to make things worse I could even pass the ged test, I literally feel stuck in my head filled with anxiety and paranoia.my only option is to get a minimum wage job by the time I save enough money to buy a car I will be well half way in to 27 Idk how bad my situation is but it has gotten worse. Something about my physical appearance has always kept me from life. Itâ€™s possible that all these years in isolation I fucked myself into brain damage. Since ever I could remember I always felt lesser than my peers maybe itâ€™s bcz I started school late and never caught up, I have no talent I literally canâ€™t do anything useful, life has turned to hell, I have seen this coming since I was 13 suicide is the only option for me, I hate this so much I donâ€™t want to die, I donâ€™t want my life to be like this, chained in my head and I literally can do nothing to save myself whyyy do I have to die whyyyyy whyyyyyyyyy
