My mom says she wouldn't want me to kill myself, but she acts like she doesn't care about my problemsThat's all she says. She doesn't ask *why* I want to kill myself. That's why I just ignore her. I don't believe a word she says. She may not be happy if I kill myself, but she won't be distraught either.
