I don't want help anymore, I don't want anything, I just want to dieI just got kicked out of the only group I enjoyed being in on my campus. I can't even hate them for it because I know, deep down inside, that they were justified in kicking me out. Now, now I don't want anything, I'm tired of them trying to help me, I'm tired of anyone trying to help me. I'm supposed to go to therapy tomorrow, but, I'm thinking, fuck that. I'm going to buy alcohol tonight, as volatile as I am, as bad as I feel, I know the chance is I will kill myself if I drink tonight. 

I'm just tired of living, I feel so sad and sorry for the pain my friends and parents will endure, but I just can't keep doing this, it just hurts too much, every day I lose more hope, every day I lose another thing I love.

I didn't choose to live, but I can choose to end my misery, I can stop this downward trend. I just don't have any other option.
