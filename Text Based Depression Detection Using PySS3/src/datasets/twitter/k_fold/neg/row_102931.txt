Give me one good reason I should keep trying?Every time I make a stride against my anxiety, I take two back because something happens in my life. First my uncle dies, then I'm becoming more confrontational with my SO who I love to pieces and now my dog has a slipped disc in her spine. It's almost like everyone I hold near is either getting physically or emotionally abused.

I blame it all on anxiety, a selfish illness by any other name. It didn't kill my uncle or hurt my dog, but it's making me become more toxic little by little. I stopped self harming long ago but today I bashed my legs with a hammer in frustration after arguing with my SO. I even tried to choke myself with a hoodie sleeve. Not to kill myself but to injure myself. I love her to death and she loves me but I think she deserves better than a walking piece of debris like me.

What's more is earlier in the week I promised to try and take more steps to control my anxiety and depression, then life decides to dump a load of shit on me. At first I could deal with it, but a man can only deal with so much BS before he gives up, and I reached my breaking point.

So again I ask, why should I bother living if all that's going to happen to me is shit like this? The only reason I stopped choking myself was because the phone rang and I got distracted. I want a reason to continue trying because everything else is going to shit
