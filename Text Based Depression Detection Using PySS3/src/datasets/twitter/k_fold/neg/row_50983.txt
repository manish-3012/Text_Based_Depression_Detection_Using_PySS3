Everything seems like itâ€™s getting better on the surface, but every day I feel like Iâ€™m getting closer and closer to ending my own lifeI pushed everyone away, when Iâ€™m sad I have no one to talk to now so I just let it rot inside me. I want to cut myself but I know that self harming will only be temporary and then I will be feeling this way again.


Iâ€™m sick of feeling this way. Regardless of the fact that Iâ€™ve got a new job and a scholarship I just want to die. I donâ€™t want to earn money and â€œenjoy my lifeâ€ because I honestly canâ€™t find enjoyment anymore because itâ€™s always overshadowed by betrayal and distrust


One day Iâ€™m going to leave and never come back. Whether thatâ€™s through suicide or just running away I donâ€™t know yet
