my heart is soggy like breadim drinking gin and tonic to make it easier to think and to slow my breathing. IDK if i can do it, i think maybe i just want to be hospitalized but i cant go back to normal life after skipping out on all of my schoolwork and not even starting my uni applications, I'm too neurotic for A levels, I shouldve just gone to college and learned a trade. even then i wouldve been a depressed mess, unless i lived a perfect life (and middle class is super fucking lucky anyway) i physically cant be happy. obviously there's a decade of baggage and bullshit i can talk about but this is what makes me want to plastic bag in the present, so its probably the best thing to mention

This is all dumb and i know i havent given anything to latch onto and reply about but i just wanted to put something out there before i maybe die. i love you so much i unironically shed tears thinking of the idea of people suffering way worse than me
