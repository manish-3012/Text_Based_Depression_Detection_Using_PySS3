I have a plan to kill myself, I'm having suicidal ideation.Hello, my name is Chris. I'm 21 years old. I've battled with anxiety and depression for a large part of my life. I grew up in a low-income family immigrant family. My parents were fought a lot when I was a little kid and my father would emotionally abuse me and my mother, and my mom considered getting a divorce for a while, but they stuck together for my sake, I guess. My dad got diagnosed with late-stage cancer and passed away when I was in the 5th grade. That was the very first time I fell into a depression episode. Despite that setback, I still did pretty well academically in middle school, but I got bullied for being smart and introverted. I developed really low self-esteem and social anxiety as a result. High school was somewhat better in that I made a few friends, but I was still really introverted and mainly just focused on getting good grades through high school. I got good grades in college too, but my anxiety and depression got worse and worse. I ended up dropping out after my sophomore year. I started working at a restaurant for a while and saved up enough money for a car, but I feel like such a failure. I have no motivation to try harder at college, I have very few friends, and I have never had a girlfriend. I recently bought a rope and stool from Amazon just in case I can't take it anymore and I attempt suicide.
