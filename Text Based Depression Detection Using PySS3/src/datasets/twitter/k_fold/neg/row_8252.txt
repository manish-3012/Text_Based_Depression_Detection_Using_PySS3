I am not really sure where to turn for help or if I even want any help...I have been thinking of suicide daily as of late. Mostly work is a source of stress and anxiety for me but I cant just quit as I need to provide for myself and my wife.

My stress is starting to show through at my work and it is possible I will be terminated anyway in the coming weeks.  I can't even keep a job for much more than a year.  I constantly job job as my anxiety is too much to handle.  I make about $60000/year and I am wondering if it makes sense to just go work some minimum wage job with zero worry and stress.  I do not need much money to survive as I have zero debt.  i don't think that is fair to my wife though living super simply just cause my brain can't handle a real job.

My wife said she cannot help me as she is not qualified to deal with how I am feeling.

Basically my life sucks and I don't feel like living. I have already planned how I will end it I just thought I may as well reach out before I do anything final.

I don't think anyone wants to be bored with specifics so I decided to keep this post short and sweet as it were.

And in case anyone is wondering I have decided to go with an exit bag. Zero pain and quick so I would not be watching myself die for a prolonged time.

Edit: I thought of doing a long term disability through work as I am covered pretty good with benefits.  I just don't know if I can get a Dr to sign off on that.  I imagine lot's of people try to go this route just so they do not need to work
