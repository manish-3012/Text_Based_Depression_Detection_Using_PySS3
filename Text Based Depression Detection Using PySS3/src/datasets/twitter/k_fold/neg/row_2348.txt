I don't want to hurt anymoreI've pushed everyone away. I live on a couch that's not my own. I'm 34 and I have no direction in life nor any desire for it. I feel like I'm screaming and no one hears me. 

I finally told the person who says they love me. They want nothing to do with that part of me. He's been nothing but cold and mean ever since.

I know how I'm going to do it and the best time to do it, I just have to choose who finds me. I definitely won't put that on my daughter, I'll make sure she's not here.

This is the farthest I've gotten into planning.

Every moment is pain. I'm all alone in it.

And it's all my fault.
