Some introspective thoughtsI don't know if I'm really depressed or not, I'm a bit hesitant to really declare thus when a lot of people probably have it worse than me. But tl;dr since a relatively minor thing that happened a few years ago, things just started building up and I've just kind of felt not really sad but tired/frustrated/empty. 

I've never tried suicide, but I've thought about it plenty, as a simply pragmatic way of quitting, because 'Why not?'. Yeah, I'm fairly confident that I'd probably have a decent life if I stuck around another decade, but, and I don't mean this in any piteous way, why bother? I've never been scared of death as a concept or event, it's just another thing. Why bother going through all this sh*t, for what?

I don't really know what I want or aim to achieve with this post, but I can't really talk about any of this anonymously with any friends without them misunderstanding, and it feels pretty bad to not talk about it. I guess I just needed to vent and rant this a little bit. Idk, sorry.
