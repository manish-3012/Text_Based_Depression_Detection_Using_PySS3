Really want to do itSo imma be completely honest, im 18 years old. Im a very shy person, and I always struggled to have friends. I currently have like 3-4 friends but we don't really hang out a lot.

So almost 2 years ago I met an awesome girl who made me change the way I looked at my own life, she made me happy, she made me feel like there was something else to live for. She is the first and only person I've ever loved. The only person that truly understood me.


Now shes gone. Several trust issues and low self esteem from both of us made us fight a lot. I still love her and im sure she still loves me but she tries to convince herself that shes better off without me. 

Before her I felt sad almost every day and I never really tried to kill myself but I still wanted to do it. Now I've become a dependent person and I literally need her to feel OK, without her I want to kill myself and I just feel sad overall. I already tried ODing on some substances but it didnt work

It's not good. I don't like my life without her. She was perfect for me.
