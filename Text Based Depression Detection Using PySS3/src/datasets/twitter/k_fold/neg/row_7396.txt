Iâ€™m readyI thought I was holding off on killing myself because I wanted to get â€œeverything setâ€ for the people I love. But I just donâ€™t care anymore... I know theyâ€™ll figure it all out. Itâ€™ll be hard but theyâ€™re strong.

I just canâ€™t do this anymore.  Iâ€™m ready to end it all. All the pain and suffering. The nightmares, the panic attacks, the  constant internal agony. Iâ€™m numb and Iâ€™m ready. 

 Thank you to everyone for your kind words in the past. I hope that you all find happiness and joy..
