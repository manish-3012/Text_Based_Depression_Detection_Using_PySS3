I wish someone would kill meI'm too much of a coward to do it myself. I want people who tossed me aside and neglected be me to be sad about it. You should've listened to me. I asked for help, I was honest about how I felt. I tried so hard to work towards something I wanted to do, but I've just been rejected. 

I don't even want to eat. I want to waste away in my bed.
