Itâ€™s happening, again. Now, I just feel nothing.3 years I went without feeling like this. I used to wake up everyday wishing Iâ€™d crash every time I got into my car. I used to cry every single day and go to bed hoping I wouldnâ€™t wake up. I finally got into remission from my disease and everything seemed to be getting better after moving away to college. Symptoms are back, Iâ€™m alone again and Iâ€™m just too fucking depressed to do anything. At least feeling nothing at all is better than anything worse.
