Housing- Unsure what to do as I dont plan on living more than a decadeI have chronic mental illness, no desire to have kids, and little desire to be in a relationship. I feel like I'm holding out until my Dad dies because I know loosing me would break his heart.

I anticipate another 5-10 years but am unsure if I should rent and save no money or attempt to mortgage a condo. I want to do whatever would be both comfortable for the time I am living and economically viable for those still here after I go.

A few months ago I was really having a hard time and was unsure if I would even make it this far. Medication has helped a lot but I just have little desire to exist for a full human lifespan. I know I am not the only one.
