Maybe not today..I posted on this subreddit a few days ago, stating how I wanted to die and was planning on taking my life today. I was planning on buying a rope and all that shanaz...
I'm extremely tired and painful atm, I don't want to go to college tho i've missed many days recently and I don't want to piss the tutor off..or my mother. I do wish I could end it all now,or at least sleep..maybe for the whole day..but I had enough courage to tell my bf. He didn't react badly at all, he's keeping an eye on me today and I hope I can go to a hosptial or a psych unit soon enough.
I hope I can make it tonight
I hope many others can as well...

Thank u for the kind words in my last post, even tho it lifted my heart for a day..it was enough
