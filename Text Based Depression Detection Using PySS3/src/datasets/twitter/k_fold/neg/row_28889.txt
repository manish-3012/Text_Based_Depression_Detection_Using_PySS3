More and more tempting every day...Every day I wake up. Every day I wish I was dead. I don't wanna do this anymore. No friends, no job....I'm not sure how much longer my dad will let me stay with him. After he kicks me out, then what? Haven't got the slightest clue. In all my 22 years of this bullshit life I live, I've never contemplated suicide this much. I mean why not? 22 year old male. High school dropout. Tried going to college for my GED...social anxiety fucked that up for me. Can't get a job for the life of me. Addicted to meth. Alcoholic. And my schizophrenia....I fucking hate it, it gets worse with each day. Some of the weird shit the voices say makes me wanna blow my head off right then and there. It's not like anyone gonna read this shit anyways, but if you did? Much respect, and thank for taking the time.
