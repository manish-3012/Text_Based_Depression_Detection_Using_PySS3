Everyone seems to think I am overreacting.A few weeks ago I got this contraceptive implant and no one prepared me for what it would be like. The doctor made the side effects sound like they were minor before sticking it in my arm. This thing is changing me, and my mood has been taking a plunge. I went to my doctor almost in tears and all she did was tell me to "give it a chance". This was after telling me that these side effects may last for 3 months. My boyfriend told me to be patient and that he knows I can do this. I went on the Nexplanon subreddit to try and find advice and their rules said that they don't want to hear from anyone who bashes the implant and is "being a baby about" the side effects.

I don't know, am I overreacting and being a baby? I don't feel normal; I am in my initial probationary period at work and need to prove that I am hood at my job, yet over the past few weeks I have been getting headaches and mood swings at work. I am now feeling so useless and low. The doctors don't want to remove this thing from me and seem to think it is great. They want me to be like this for months before they will consider relieving me. I have alone in my flat, crying for hours. I am a bad employee, bad daughter, bad sister, bad girlfriend and bad friend. I don't see the appeal in carrying on when everyone would be better off without me. I have been searching for some rope to buy online and heard that good rope will make you pass out after less than a minute. Sounds better than jumping off the bridge I pass through on the way to work.
