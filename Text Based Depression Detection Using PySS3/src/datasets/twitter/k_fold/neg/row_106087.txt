More isolated than ever.Being unemployed and among other things,  I have realized that I am more isolated then in any part of my life I can think of.  The real problem is that all I think about is suicide.  I really don't know what to do.  I can't talk to my family about it.  I just feel at this moment almost completly emotionally dead.
