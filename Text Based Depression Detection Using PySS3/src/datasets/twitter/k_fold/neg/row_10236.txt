better to die or lose all morality I need help, I'm at a point where I'm ready, full-heartedly prepared to commit suicide. I planned every detail, I have what I need, but I'm stuck. The more time passes the worse I feel, the more I want to die. My s/o knows about this, but they don't know what to do. I'm trying to think about the affect this will have on them but I can't even think straight.

Background: My life has never been good, I have a lot of disorders and mental illnesses. Some are caused by trauma some I was born with. I have a hard time just living life and constantly feel like dying. My old home was dangerous and in my new home, religious beliefs conflict with my identity. I'm uncomfortable as I am. Then there's my therapist and psychiatrist, they're supposed to help me but they think I'm insane. Others say I'm fake or a liar, so I never even understand myself. I find myself trying to die a lot. I also realized that over the years I have become more and more destructive, more agitated, and aggressive. I've started thinking of killing more and more, it's become something that I just think about normally. I end up hurting people a lot more than I mean to, basically I'm becoming like my parents. I don't want to be like them and I keep failing at changing.

9 days until I plan to end my life, 9 days to make the final decision. I don't know what is the best path for me to take. If I die, that's it for me...there's nothing left of my existence. Everything would be gone, I wouldn't suffer but I just wouldn't be anything. If I live, I'll become more and more like them. I'll continue falling apart and someday I won't be able to resist my shitty thoughts anymore. I know I'll act on them someday. I don't know what to do, help?
