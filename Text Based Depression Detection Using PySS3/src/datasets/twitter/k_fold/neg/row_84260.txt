I can't do this anymore.Everyday is hard... but this was bad. This morning it started off with no text from him... which I expect, but it still hurts. Why did he bother getting a secret text app, so his current g/f doesn't see, so that he barely talks to me... just to keep me on edge? He knows I'm hurting, he knows about all the physical/emotions shit I've gone through this year (FOUR breakups), but doesn't seem to care. Yet I crave his attention. Texting him asking if there's still a chance is SO HARD not to do!

Then my cramps started... fuck they hurt. Then of course my spasms start... I have Stiff Person Syndrome and Isaac's Syndrome and it causes 24/7 muscle spasms (in my case in my feet, legs, hands and throat.... to where it feels like I'm choking) THEN I get nausea from all the fucking pills I'm taking. 
Then I get into a stupid fight with a redditor, and I feel like crap about it. I succumb to taking sleeping pills to try and get some relief. I dream about him. I wake up to cramps and spasms.... I just want to see a text from him. Can't stop crying. Tomorrow will be on repeat (except fighting). I have nobody to talk to except my cat.
I want to buy a gun.

I can't do this anymore.
