Here it goesLifeâ€™s just a bridge right? Well I wanna cross this mother fucker right now. I havenâ€™t got my own fucking house yet, and I stil see no reason to live. Iâ€™ll feel bad for my parents, Iâ€™m gonna feel bad for those I leave behind for sure. But this is already too much for me. This is the worst. I already canâ€™t handle anything. My best friend and cousin died a day before my birthday last week. I would tell him how suicidal I was, and he was the only one who would get it without freaking out at me. I donâ€™t have any potential, work is absolutely meaningless, and Iâ€™m not gonna just get stressed out every day of my life to just settle for a bowl at night to keep me numb. I canâ€™t take this shit anymore. Iâ€™m fucking done. Good fucking riddance.
