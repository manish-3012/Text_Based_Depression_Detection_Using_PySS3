Fuck everyoneThis happened my entire life, from when I was in elementary (primary) school until now, at the age of 22.

Recently, at my old job, I was arrested over the painfully vague and weak accusations of a stranger I'd never met (it never went entirely to trial, because of how pitiful these claims were) now, something similar is happening at my new fucking job, under different circumstances (not getting arrested, but on probation, via the company).

More and more it seems like the only remedy to my ails is the exit bag.
