You are not alone.A girl I knew just committed suicide today. I am not sure why or what led up to it. However I can say that she was loved by many people. All of her friends will miss her and none of us will ever forget her. I am still in disbelief... I wish that it didn't end this way. I wish that all the times I thought of speaking to her to get to know her better, that I had actually done so. I felt like her and I had a lot in common and I wish I could have shared that with her. She will be forever young.

I hope that anyone who sees this knows that there are people that care for them out there, even if you do not notice it. You are not alone. If only we all had the courage to talk to one another and to find each other, maybe these tragedies wouldn't happen.
