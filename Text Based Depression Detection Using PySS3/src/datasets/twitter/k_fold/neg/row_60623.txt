I need someone to talk toI've struggled with suicidal ideation for years. I have my issues almost entirely under control, and I have a loving SO supporting me with my issues. I've come here because I need someone to talk to when I'm about to hurt myself. Sometimes it's so bad that I can't tell my SO how I'm feeling or I would end up hosptilazed without actually being dangerous. I need help.
