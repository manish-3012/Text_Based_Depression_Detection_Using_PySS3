the suicidal thoughts seemingly never go awayiâ€™m planning to take a trip into the countryside this weekend, no accomodation, no nothing, just sleeping on the streets as a means of some slight escape from my home and my family especially this time of year but all i can think about is just actually going for it and killing myself in an area where no one knows me 

itâ€™s been maybe 10 days since i posted here last and every day that has past the suicidal thoughts have only gotten stronger
