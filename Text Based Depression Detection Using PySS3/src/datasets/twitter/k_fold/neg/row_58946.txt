FlukeIt's been almost a year since I survived a heart attack, almost 2 since I lived through a near fatal overdose. It feels like an absolute fluke that I'm still here. I don't deserve it.

 My body is frail and hardly functioning because of my eating disorder.  I don't want to recover. I've just been waiting until I successfully starve myself to death but I can't even do that right. I think I'm gonna attempt soon, I'm sick of waiting for natural consequences. I'm too fucking lucky and I can't stand the thought of being me anymore.

I dunno. There's really no point to posting. Just felt the need to put it out somewhere. Thanks for letting me I guess.
