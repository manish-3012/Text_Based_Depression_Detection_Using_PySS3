How do you stop the pain?I am once more at my limit. Whenever I reach this point, I strongly consider ending it all just to stop the pain and anguish. It starts emotionally, then mentally, and eventually physically. A pain in my thoughts, and my chest that I am trying to endure daily but I am getting so weak now. I don't know what I want from posting here. I posted here before and got to talk to someone who knew what to say at the right time. Now, it just feels like I'm posting here because I want some people to know what happened if the day comes. I don't want to write a note for the people who know me. I just want to be gone. Tonight just might be the night. Thanks to the people in this community who stayed with me when I had no one in the middle of the night. These people literally saved my life those nights with just words from thousands of miles away. I got to experience more good days because of you people.
