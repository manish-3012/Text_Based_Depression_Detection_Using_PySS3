Uglyim not good at pretending that im ok,
so i look like shit.

i dont smile, i still have acne (im 19), i have black circles under my eyes and i have a very pale skin ( cuz i never leave my house, only when i go to school)
so people stare at me every day. 
some of them point at me and they just laugh.
some of them give me that disguated look.
and some of them just tell me that im ugly or that i look like a fucking methhead.


im so fucking depressed (for many other reasons, but i think this is the worst one)
i also have social anxiety so i dont have any friends and i never had a gf.
when i try to talk to someone i just turn red and its so embarrassing.
i have already attempted suicide last month and i still feel like terrible.


does anyone have the same or similar problem?
i dont know what to do anymore, everyone is so fucking rude.
