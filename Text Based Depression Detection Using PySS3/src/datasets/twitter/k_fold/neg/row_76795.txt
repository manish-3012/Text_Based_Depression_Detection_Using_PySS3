Help... suicide thoughts and plans are coming back.I haven't gone to school or work in 3 weeks... I am dropping out on a medical leave probably.Â 

I haven't been eating, I stay in my room all day. I haven't seen the daylight in days.Â 

I went off of meds in August and it was a very very bad idea.Â 

I have a psychiatrist appt on Wednesday and a therapist one on Tuesday.Â 

I don't know what to do
