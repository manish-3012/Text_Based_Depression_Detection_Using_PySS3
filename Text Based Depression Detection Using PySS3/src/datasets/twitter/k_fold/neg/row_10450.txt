I want help, I just don't know how to ask for itThere have been times in my life when I was not sure I wanted to live anymore.  Thinking about suicide as seriously as I have been lately is new, though, and I know I need help.  After reading articles online for people thinking about suicide, I consciously know that life may be worth living if I can get through this and turn things around.

What I don't know how to do though is tell my friends and family.  Do I just say, "so, I've been thinking about killing myself lately."  How do I even bring it up?  How do I ensure that they understand that this is a real issue with me?  I'm good at pretending I'm ok so I know this will be unexpected for them.  I'm worried at how they'll respond.
