I got back from a mental hospital today and I already want to die againI just keep wishing that I had taken more pills and didnâ€™t ask for help. Or even just go back to the hospital. Idk why I wanted to come home so bad. I want to go back!!! 

Or I just want to go downstairs find where all the pills are hidden and take all of them. Or go to the kitchen, grab a knife, and slit my wrist. Just let myself finally die. So I canâ€™t hurt anyone else and I donâ€™t have to deal with my own pain anymore. 

And it doesnâ€™t help that I took my sleeping meds to early and now Iâ€™ll be up all night
