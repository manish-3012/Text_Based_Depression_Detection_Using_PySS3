I just donâ€™t know what is going on with me anymore.Iâ€™m just turned 20 on May 11th, ever since then I just feel panicked about everything. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t know how to go the best into explaining it all. Iâ€™m a heavy pot smoker, and recently I found out I spent too much money on weed. I tried to go cold turkey to get it over with fast, I couldnâ€™t go two days without it, I smoked the second day and I went into work the next night, I got an order wrong and I just had a panic attack out of nowhere. Iâ€™ve had panic attacks before but this one was more terrifying, I couldnâ€™t make sense of where I was or what I was doing. Ever since then Iâ€™ve just been scared of having another attack. Iâ€™m on the edge every day, I have to smoke just to be able to live I guess, I just donâ€™t know if itâ€™s he right thing for someone whoâ€™s suppose to be growing up to do. So whatâ€™s the point? I havenâ€™t had thoughts in a while but just i can find plenty of ways to kill myself Iâ€™m just seeing if anyone has any insight that can help me. Iâ€™m just looking for help, please.
