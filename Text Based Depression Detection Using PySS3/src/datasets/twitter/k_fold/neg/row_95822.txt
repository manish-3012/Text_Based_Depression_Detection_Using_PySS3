I need helpI have had a bad habit all my life destroying all I love and making it where I am hated and I canâ€™t stop.... because of my actions the woman I love has left me and will not even talk to me. I know this is all cliche but I am tired of my life I have tried to fix it and I still end up destroying it and sabotaging it. I have only kept going in life because of my children but even now how I feel I think itâ€™s better Iâ€™m gone so I donâ€™t end up hurting them repeatedly.
