Feel like i dont wanna go on anymoreI like to do art, music, and all and those keep me alive. But what hurts most is being so down to the point where i couldnt Even do those things anymore. I feel trapped and shit. I know its mostly mental but i feel like shit. I feel unhealthy, even slowly developing shitty habits. I dont eat like I used to and I havent been genuinely happy in such a long time. I wanna quit school for my health but i cant so that adds to my pain. I dont have much peoppe to talk to because i say the same shit over again and no matter how many times i try to get better i keep falling apart. Im just so sick and tired. I have genuine intentions, i have been trying my best to become a better person to at least make people smile but in the end depression is too overwhelming. I feel like i have nothing. I feel like my parents dont understand though i know they want the best for me. Its just crazy. I feel like im going crazy too. Its been a long ride and i really feel like giving up. I know it's a cowardly thing to say to some but im human after all. Maybe my dreams were too great for my situation. Ive had so many traumatizing experiences and nobody i know really relates. It just sucks. I dont know how to keep going anymore
