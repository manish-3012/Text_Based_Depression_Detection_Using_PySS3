Ghosted again.Seems like it's all I deal with now. I've had at least 4 people ghost me in the past week for no reason. I guess I'm boring. I've always thought I was witty and attractive, but from peoples actions, that's not the case. It sucks because it brings my self esteem down to non existent.

Just fuels the fire more.
