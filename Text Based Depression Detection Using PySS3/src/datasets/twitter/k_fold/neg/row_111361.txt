I don't see another wayThis has been a long time coming. I've thought this way every day for years. My insides are poisoned. I just feel "wrong." When I wake up, it's my first thought. My dreams are sickly

This is the only way out. 

I've been considering hanging myself or overdosing on pills. 

I wish that I could wake up and be the person that I was before - whole, full of love, optimism. Not this "thing." The whole thing is a tragedy. And it needs to end.

I've failed at my only task in life anyway. This is the only way out.
