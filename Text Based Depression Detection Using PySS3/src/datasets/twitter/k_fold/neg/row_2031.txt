I wish that motorcycle would just hit meIm tired 

Im not depressed. Im just so tired of pretending my life is not crumbling into pieces. Im tired from holding back my tears every time something bad happens or when someone is dissapointed in me.

 I wish that car ran me over too. I wish i never existed the first place
