I'm going to do it tonightI'm completely alone now. Every time I've ever trusted anyone they've stabbed me in the back. I trusted my dad and he drank, I trusted Jayne; my best friend for nine years and she dropped me, I trusted Liiz and she raped me, I trusted Cammi and she left me for dead, I trusted Alex; my boyfriend of over a year and he was lying the entire time; a literal sociopath, I trusted Greta and she dropped off the face of the earth, i trusted Travis and he left me for dead. I've been depressed my entire life, and struggling with self harm for 5 or 6 years. I've been in the hospital in programs for it twice and my insurance is kicking me out now. Even my doctor gave up on me. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I don't want to hurt my parents, but I can't take this anymore. I can't do this
