I'm so tired.I have been having suicidal thoughts for a long time now and it keeps getting worse and worse.

A little background on me, I'm 28 years old, I work 7 days a week. At one of my jobs I work in an office and I get yelled at by people on the phone all day while having my job constantly hung over my head. My company isn't doing well and recent rounds of layoffs have me concerned. My second job I work like a slave in the kitchen at an Italian restaurant. My life is nothing but constant work.

I've been dating a girl for the past 7 years, recently she told me she's not sure if she loves me anymore. She stopped sleeping with me and doesn't give me much emotional support.

I've gained 100 lbs in the past 3 years. I'm lacking the motivation to really try or do anything about it. I look In the mirror and hate literally everything about myself.

I never get restful sleep anymore, I always wake up feeling tired, I have almost no motivation to get out of bed in the morning.

Three months ago, my father passed away. He was a positive influence in my life and I spoke with him every day. I have no family where I live. I isolate myself from everyone I know

I'm seeing a therapist, and it's helping a little but after I leave my sessions with her I feel bogged down with depression again. She wants me to be on medication for depression but my doctor won't give it to me.

I spend my free time staring into space, or watching gore videos of people committing suicide.

I really just want to end my life, I think when I lose my job I'll finally snap and do it. I'm going to be homeless and alone for the rest of my life anyway.
