I don't really see the point of anything anymore.Hi, SW.

Recently I've lost my sense of enjoyment. I really can't enjoy anything anymore. I still do things I used to enjoy, purely out of habit. Recently, I've been staying in bed all day, and when I've gotten restless enough I've mainly just been killing time on reddit. I don't really see the point of going on with this boring and unfulfilling life anymore.

I've been diagnosed with depression since I was about 10, but recently my psychologist started to suspect bipolarity and borderline disorder. I'm also diagnosed with ADHD. 

Recently, I've also felt abandoned. A couple of months ago me and my ex broke up, and my life has been quite silent since then. However, lately it has gotten even worse. A couple of friends who used to be one of the greatest parts of my life and probably the only ones who made me feel close to happy are growing distant to me, but I can't put my finger on why. I keep blaming myself for this. I keep wondering what I did to make this happen.

So, how do I make my life worth living? Is it even worth a try?

Thanks in advance.
