Should I just end it?The first time I tried to kill myself was when I was twelve. I had drawn myself a bath and downed some pills. The second time was when I was fourteen and was half-assing a noose in a nearby barn. At fifteen I was found lying in bed, blood coming from my arms. Since then things haven't changed. I'm still just as sad, I'm still just as bitter. My parents refuse to get me medication, we can't really afford it. I've tried to get a job to buy the medicine, but I don't have a car and we have no buses where I live. I'm not sure what to do. I'm a straight A student, but I have no way to pay for college. I don't think things are going to get better for me, I'm not sure how they can. I've sold my body to be able to pay for necessities such as food and clothing. I know I'm an awful person and I've tried punishing myself as much as possible. I've cut, done drugs, starved myself, really anything to feel pain. I want to run away so that I can avoid killing myself but I don't know where to go. I've spent my entire summer trying to sleep so I don't have to be awake and feel the pain. All my life I've just wanted someone to save me, but this isn't a fairy tale. I'm afraid that I have to die to feel relief. The only time I remember being happy was when I played computer games, but I had to sell my computer a while ago. I'm such a sad person and I don't deserve to live. I don't want to hurt my family and friends, but I'm hurting myself by being here.
