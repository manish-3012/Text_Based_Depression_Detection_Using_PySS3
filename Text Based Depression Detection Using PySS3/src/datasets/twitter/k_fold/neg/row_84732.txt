Tonight is the night I die (I hope)I finally figured out how to die, and I am leaving this godforsaken world. Everything is too miserable, so it is time for me to go now. Iâ€™m getting high off my ass and then Iâ€™m going to take everything I have, and hopefully, hopefully, I can finally go home to where I belong. I am not from here and I am not meant to be here. After a severe episode of mania that may or may not still be going on, I just donâ€™t give a shit about life anymore. Itâ€™s too hard. Iâ€™m sorry to those I love. I donâ€™t need forgiveness, but I hope the people I love donâ€™t miss me too much
