I am fucking stupid.I had my mom hold onto some cash a few years back because I have a drug problem.  I dont like to keep cash handy.   That time it was around $1100.  When it came time for me to need it she had spent it on her bills.  

I cashed out my 401k in Sept because we needed the money.  I got around 5k.  My mom asked me to give her some to hold onto for me because she knows my struggle when i have lots of cash handy.  

Well, my weed dealer is going outta business so I wanted about 1k from her to stock up and have plenty of weed until I could find a new dealer.  I asked my mom to send me it....she calls me crying saying she only has $700 left and that she is so sorry, she fell behind on bills etc....i can't.  I can't fucking do this anymore.  

I know, people say that money can't buy happiness....but the idea that safety net was there if i needed it helped me so much with my anxiety and depression.  Now it is gone and i realize I am doomed to follow stupid repetitive patterns my whole life, and I just can't fucking do it anymore.
