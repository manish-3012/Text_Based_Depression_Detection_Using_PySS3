Loneliness is killing me and I just want a friendI spend my days being alone. I donâ€™t have any friends and I have a constant feeling of loneliness and sadness. I am scared. I lay in bed wishing I could have someone to talk to. Itâ€™s my fault, I am so scared of being hurt as badly as I was before. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™ll just kill myself out of boredom. I feel like my brain will be taken over by my loneliness and decide to kill me. I lay feeling like Iâ€™m not in my body and that I shouldnâ€™t be alive. I look into the mirror and see myself dead. Iâ€™ve forgotten how to make friends, although I try constantly. I am friendly and helpful, yet nobody wants to be my friend. I wish someone would be my friend because I have so much love to give. I care so much about people yet they always hurt me.
