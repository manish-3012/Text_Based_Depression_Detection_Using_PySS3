me, his honeyiâ€™ve decided on a day the first day of winter break. i canâ€™t make myself do it before his birthday. this time i wonâ€™t hesitate. more pills than last time, no goodbyes. itâ€™s gonna hurt so much. i just wanted our family. we picked names, hazel and dominic. i need to make arrangements and set some things straight before so iâ€™ll be busy. i want to leave this here as my goodbye, because i couldnâ€™t make it to him here it goes



sweetheart iâ€™m so deeply sorry. i just want you to be happy baby thatâ€™s all i want. i donâ€™t want you to go. i keep hurting you baby. i donâ€™t want to hurt you bunny. iâ€™m not a good girlfriend, iâ€™m not even a good friend. i donâ€™t want you to hate me justin. youâ€™re my soulmate. iâ€™d give everything up to be strong and happy for you justin, absolutely everything and anything. you saved me, never doubt that. you make me happy, never ever ever fucking doubt that. itâ€™s the time without you that makes me like this. when iâ€™m with you everything is quite literally perfect, iâ€™m not sad, iâ€™m not hurt. nothing from the past matters when iâ€™m with you besides our time together. iâ€™ve never felt this much love and pride in someone. since your older i was made for you. but if i has been older you wouldâ€™ve been made for me. my perfect match. my other half. truly my other half. youâ€™re the strongest most breathtaking person iâ€™ve ever had the absolute joy of meeting. see you in the next life precious. maybe there i can stay with you. i can love you. we can have our family. iâ€™ll always be the girl you called honey
