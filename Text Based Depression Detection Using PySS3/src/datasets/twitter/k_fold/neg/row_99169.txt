Goodbye friendsTomorrow is the day. Now that it's so close and I genuinely know that it's happening it feels a little bit odd. I thought I would be sad and bitter and bawl my eyes out once I made the decision but no. I just feel odd. Very relieved and relaxed. I know I'm repeating myself but it's so weird. I don't think I've ever felt anything like this. I'll see you guys on the other side.
