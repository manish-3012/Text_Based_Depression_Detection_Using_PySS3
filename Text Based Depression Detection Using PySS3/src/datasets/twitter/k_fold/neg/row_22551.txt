I think my friend is suicidal. What do I do?help. She's feeling blue blue blue, said she is going to kill herself tonight... three times. I'm worried. She's laying down in the next room and I'm wondering if there are any sharp knives in there. This thing is classic Shakespearean love triangle tragedy. He's at his mom's, She's here. Everypony is pissed off except me, and I'm just trying to make sure a beautiful woman doesn't  off herself over nothing.

ok nevermind then.
