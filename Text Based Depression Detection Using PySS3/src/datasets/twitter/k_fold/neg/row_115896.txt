(29m) Keep thinking of cutting/shooting my wristsIâ€™ve been severely depressed for about two months now.  Iâ€™ve been here before, I know what itâ€™s like, but for some reason this hole seems deeper than the last ones.  Iâ€™ve had suicidal ideation in the past, but thatâ€™s it, just suicidal thoughts.. â€œkill yourselfâ€ â€œIâ€™m going to kill myselfâ€ â€œyou should kill yourselfâ€ etc. .  This time around I keep thinking of slashing or shooting my wrists.  I know itâ€™s not as bad as other means, Once or twice the idea of putting a gun to my head has cropped up, but the thought gives me intense fear.   It just scares me that my ideations have turned to either cutting or shooting my wrists.  

Iâ€™ve even started thinking of just cutting myself in general.  I just want to feel something. Iâ€™ve never cut in the past, but the idea of it has been on my mind.  

I know I should probably be in therapy again, but Jesus is it hard with COVID.  

My support network is ok, not the best, full of people who would pretty much just overreact.  

I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but the thoughts are just so pervasive at this point that I donâ€™t know what to do to curb them.  Does anyone have any advice?
