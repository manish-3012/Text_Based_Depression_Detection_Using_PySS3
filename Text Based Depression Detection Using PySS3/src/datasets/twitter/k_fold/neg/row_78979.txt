Truly believe no one my age can relate to how much I hate myself due to my virginitySearched the word virgin on here and went through the posts. Found a post from a 16 y/o 7 months ago and was reading through it. Was pretty crazy how much they were similar to me, even down to the same medication. Went through their posts to see if they were still active, they unfortunately weren't. They only had two posts, and when I went through the comments, I realized that the account was an alt of mine. I was relating to myself the whole time. Only difference now is that I no longer take meds and I am 17. It is insane how much I wanna die over the fact that I'm a virgin. It is a burden to me and I cannot find any girls that like me. Doesnt help that I'm also extremely awkward around girls.
