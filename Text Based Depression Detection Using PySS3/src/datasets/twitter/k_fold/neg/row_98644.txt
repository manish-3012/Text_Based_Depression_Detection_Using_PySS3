I'm lost. I don't know what to do anymore.I don't know where to go. I don't know what to do. I feel dead and so depressed. I'm too shy, don't even know how to speak to people, my best isn't enough at work, I get distracted way too easily, I'm seen as a princess because I'm "so lucky" with what I have. My parents are nurses, they're both well off parents that care about family, they care about our growth and well being.. and so on. Why do I feel so empty inside? I have a boyfriend who I love so much and talk to about all my problems and he always tries to make me feel better or give me solutions. I always push him away though and feel like I don't want to improve. Why do I feel like shit? Why am I so mad and depressed? I just feel like I can never make anybody happy because I'm always so depressed and don't believe in myself. It's not easy when everybody around you seems to do so much better than you in everything, even if you tried. I don't have any real friends other than my boyfriend. I don't know how to make friends or stay happy. Everywhere I go, someone is better than me at everything. At least they have more drive to do things. At least they care. At least they're naturally faster at learning things. What's so great about being slow in learning? Who would ever want to employ someone who's slow at learning even though they try their best? Fuck this. Just thinking about everything makes me cry. Being asked constantly what college I'm going to and what I'm going for when I don't even know even after graduating high school. Everyone expects so much from me but I don't feel a drive to do anything enough to reach their standards. I wish I had a drive. I wish I felt the urge to try harder. I wish I knew what I wanted in life and what to be. Everybody's tired of my shit. I'm always so depressing and never joining things, even if my family wants me to. I just want to push everyone away because I'm too sad for them. I wish I could die painlessly when I go to sleep.
