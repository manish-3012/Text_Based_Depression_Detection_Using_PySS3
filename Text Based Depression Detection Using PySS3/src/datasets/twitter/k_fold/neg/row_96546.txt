Can't Do ItI cried today which is strange for me. As sad as ive always been, I never really cry . Sometimes I drop a tear hear and there but I don't think I've ever cried as hard as today . Some people say that it's good to cry and that it relieves them but all it did was give me a headache. In my head I just repeatedly thought about how I can't do it . And by it I mean everything.  All the time lately I've just been feeling like I can't do it . I can't get better. It's pretty much my fault too . I don't have any motivation or desire to get better . If I did I would have put that willpower to good use . I've been trying to get therapy but it's been hard to do exercises or assignments that I've been given for it . I take medication but I don't think it does anything . I'm looking for a larger dose but I don't think that will help either . To truly get better it is gonna take me wanting it . And I just don't want to get better . I plan on killing myself soon . Little bit after I quit therapy . Might run away from my family so nobody around me has to deal with the shame of pushing me to suicide. Sounds hypocritical but I can make me running away sound optimistic if I leave a convincing enough note. I will probably make sure nobody knows when or where I die. Shouldn't be too hard. I usually ask for a miracle cure when I write posts like this but I know there isn't one so no point in trying . No point in trying at all really .
