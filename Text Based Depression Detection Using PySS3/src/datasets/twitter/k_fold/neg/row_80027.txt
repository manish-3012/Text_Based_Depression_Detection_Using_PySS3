I've had constant thoughts of killing myself for the past 2 hours or soI don't even know what else to type, I'm just tired of being in pain every single fucking day. I can't even be happy, because everytime I get happy I know it'll get bad again.

I don't even have the motivation to type out a long ass essay to why I'm feeling this way, my brain is completely fogged up and I'm just done. I can't cleat think at all and I think I'm going to hurt myself soon.
