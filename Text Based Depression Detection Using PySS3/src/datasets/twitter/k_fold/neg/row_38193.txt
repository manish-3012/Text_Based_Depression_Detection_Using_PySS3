give me a good fucking reason to continue this fucking hellWith each passing day i lose more respect for my family, with each passing day i lose more hope, with each passing day i have less reason to live. why even bother? i won't be remembered, i wont do anything special to help the world, i fucking hate myself and everyone around me and have nothing to look forward to, i have no future but to be a slave to my higher ups, why the fuck should i even bother existing anymore?
