All the reasons I'm suicidal.I have autism spectrum disorder. Because of it I cannot drive, hold a job, and I have amere  handful of online friends that live about two hours away. I have been abused emotionally, physically, and at times, sexually by my father for my entire life. He is a narcissist. My mother has stood around doing nothing about it and now abuses me to a lesser extent as well. 

Before anyone pulls out that disgusting line "well you're an adult it's your fault for not getting help when you were a minor now you can just move out"

1- I did TRY to get help. From teachers. School counselors. They did nothing. I  have told COPS for fucks sake, COPS about my abuse and was told I DESERVED IT. Psychiatrist s that my parents took me to in order to stuff me with medication I didn't need did nothing. The one time child protective services did come to my house I was put in the same room as my dad who was staring me down the entire time. 

2- yes I am an adult. A disabled one, who is unable to support myself. How do you expect me to move out?? 

3- it is not my fault I was and still am being abused. It is never the victim's fault. How dare you.

4- when you are abused emotionally at all and especially me since it started pretty much when I was born, you are trained to intensely fear leaving your abuser for no rational reason by the abuser because the abuser doesn't want you to leave. It's not easy to walk out under those circumstances and even more so when you know you'll end up on the streets or that your abuser may become violent and attack you which is more likely than not to happen.

5- Even in adulthood, if you are disabled like me there is an organization to help you called adult protective services. It's a useless and corrupt organization that did nothing to help me and lead to my abuse worsening.


Earlier this year I was sexually assaulted by a coworker. I quit to avoid seeing him but i was losing my job anyway. On top of that, my abusive parents constantly nagged me about him. " why did you break up with X" " why don't you see X again" "so you two are really over?*  they only stopped asking when I finally lost it and threw a bunch of housewares at my mother in response. My dad called the police but they refused to arrest me because

1. I'm disabled 
2. They told my parents that what they were doing was considered harassment in itself because of the amount of distress it was causing me and that if he had to come back to our house again he would probably have to arrest them instead.

Of course my parents never dared call the police after the one time a cop actually did something right

I neglected to tell anyone about the assault however because I hate the legal system for how it's failed me and also because I didn't want to push myself anymore with the amount of anxiety, PTSD, and depression I already have from my parents I just wanted (and still want) to forget about it all.

My parents also gave me a ton of grief for quitting my job which added to everything else I already had going on

But the thing is, my parents don'tunderstand what autism is. I know because I asked them. My mom said something like " I have no idea, that's why I want to see X speech about it " and I repeatedly tell her that I can explain it to her but she ignores this and keeps insisting she learn about autism from a guy who don't even have it instead of me who does. They expect me to do things I obviously can't do no matter how many times I explain it. My father calls. Me a loafer and a lazy bum etc  when it's been statistically proven that fee people with autism can get any sort of  decent job and have trouble driving.

Some of the worst things he's said to me are that he wouldn't care if I died or got raped, and that im "mentally slow" which if it's even true is clearly caused by my maltreatment he also gushes a lot about how he's going to put me in a mental home which he can't because I'm 20 and he isn't legally authorized to do anything against my will and putting me in jail which he can't either because I don't do anything illegal except maybe when I lash out when he is abusing me which even if it wasn't for a reason, wouldn't put me in jail anyway because I'm disabled.

I'm also FtM transgender and because I can't keep jobs I doubt I could pay to transition


And as for the rest of my family. Let's just say they're not much better. I don't care if they're sad when I'm gone because they don't even know me, my parents and my siblings don't know me. All of them treat me like scum. And beside all that, it doesn't matter. I wasn't put on this earth to please them. I was put here to live my own life.


But I can't. Because no one will help me and Instead mu eentire family nakes sure I have no human rights. 

I don't want to die. But nonexistence is far better than abuse and suffering
