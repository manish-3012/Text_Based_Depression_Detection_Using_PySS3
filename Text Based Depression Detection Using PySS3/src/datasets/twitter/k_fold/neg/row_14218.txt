No Hope LeftI'm really over my life. I can't change myself, I can't be myself &amp; I'm never going to be able to share my life with anyone. I'm too screwed up. There's just no point anymore.

I remember too much from the past &amp; because of who I am today, I can't really forgive what's happened to me either. I'm stuck in a child's mind, constantly wanting to be a girl. Repeating reminders of the disappointments, the abuse &amp; of how useless of a person I am.

And there's no help. I've worked, volunteered, tried to distract myself, have hobbies, exercise, medication, therapy. Tried to accept myself &amp; my problems. Seen psychologists, psychiatrists &amp; endocrinologists. Tried to see a gender therapist &amp; got rejected. Nothing allows me to escape &amp; find peace. Basically I comfort eat (after losing 25kgs I put 4-5kgs back on recently), cuddle my bear, watch TV &amp; if really bad, go to sleep for most of the day. It's not a life.

I don't want to see &amp; deal with people. Friends for many years have invited me places &amp; I never show. Friends on FB have given up on me. I'm ashamed of myself &amp; know if people really seen who I was, I'd have nobody left in my life, including family.

The only reasons why I haven't done so yet is that I don't want to go through prolonged severe pain before kicking it &amp; if I don't die, I'll most likely become a massive burden, more than I am now. I wish this could end.

I'm sorry but I had to vent this today. It's been bottled up for so long again. No need to reply.
