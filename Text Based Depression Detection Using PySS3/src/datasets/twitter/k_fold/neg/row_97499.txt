I feel very alone so I wanted to swing by here and updateFor those that didn't see my previous post, I am a 27 year old disabled military veteran who's pregnant wife is currently divorcing me.

After a little over a month, I currently live alone in my apartment and after much struggling finally found  job that can pay bills but I fear the job is hurting me more. I currently work at a Vineyard on the weekends in the Kitchen, it's nice weather so I provide services to weddings quite often.

There lies the problem, almost every shift I show up and have to put on a fake smile watching a happy man and wife go though their wedding, with everyone being celebratory and supportive.

I feel more alone then ever with my wife nor her family having spoke to me in almost a month. My family lives to far away to visit with any frequency and they can't help me when I need it most which is mostly late at night.

I am behind on bills and my depression is definitely getting worse while my psychiatrist is trying to find an antidepressant that will work for me. I've gone through a couple that work at first then lose effect.

I just hurt in so many different ways that I want the pain to stop and I know it will only get worse as I approach the end of the month where my son will be born. I unfortunately will likely not be informed or invited which will hurt even more.

I just want to stop hurting and being hurt. My life is a mess and I can barely find a reason to get out of bed anymore. I just want to die and move on to whatever is next if there is even a next at all...

I realize I should be hopeful and stay alive for my children but I can't see the point if I am not welcomed into their lives. I definitely can't survive for however many years it takes for them to choose to see me and I don't want them to see me as the broken man that I have become. Despite repeated requests I haven't seen my daughter in almost 4 years. I can't go through this again with my son too. I don't even get the priveledges of contributing to my son's name.

I don't know what I expect by reaching out here. 

I've already tried to kill myself three separate times in the past. I know I don't have many if any chances left.
