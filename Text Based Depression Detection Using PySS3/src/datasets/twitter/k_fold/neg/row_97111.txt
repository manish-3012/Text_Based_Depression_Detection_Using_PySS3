Sometimes I wonder if sheâ€™s still aroundIâ€™m 25, and Iâ€™ve dealt with depression and other mental issues my whole life. I havenâ€™t worked in a year due to my declining mental health. I reached out once about being suicidal, and I was told I would be baker acted if I kept it up. So I never mentioned it again because I didnâ€™t want to be sent away. I was looking through some old pictures and messages and I canâ€™t believe how confident and optimistic I used to be, especially about the future. I always knew I would be somebody in this world. I knew I would be successful. But that woman is dead and gone. Or at least thatâ€™s how it feels. Today Iâ€™m just a walking robot. I feel that my life has been wasted and is over, I feel like Iâ€™m just waiting for death. I havenâ€™t lived. I havenâ€™t done anything. My family treats me like shit, and Iâ€™ve pretty much been a slave to them since I can remember. I feel like I was robbed of my life and Iâ€™m tired of this anyway. I wonder if that girl I used to be is still around somewhere, just waiting to come out. Hell, I wonder if she even exists anymore.
