I want you to know that it's not your faultIt's not your fault that you can't stand me. Get in line with everyone else. 

It's not your fault you couldn't love me. You can't force love if it's not real.

It's not your fault you couldn't be there for me. After all, I'm not your problem anymore.

It's not your fault that you couldn't care about me. No one actually does. 

It's not your fault that you became unattracted to me. I know I lost 100 lbs, but my skin looks disgusting, and I want to throw up when I look at myself in the mirror. I don't blame you for wanting someone younger, thinner, prettier, and perkier. I couldn't be that for you, and I'm sorry. 

It's not your fault that I wasn't enough. It's my fault that I couldn't be enough for anyone or anything. 

I hope I find peace in nothingness. That is all I want for me anymore.

I hope my dog will be okay, but I know he will be better off, just like everyone else. 

I hope my death will bring everyone that despises me peace. I should have done this a long time ago. 

I am sorry that I have hurt you, all of you. Please know this. My intentions were always good, but I must just be inherently bad. I'm not worth anyone's time anymore. It's time for this to end.

Goodbye.
