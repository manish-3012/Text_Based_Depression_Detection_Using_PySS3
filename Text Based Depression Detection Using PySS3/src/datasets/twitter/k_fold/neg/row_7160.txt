TomorrowAfter I write this, I am going out to get the supplies. I have written a suicide letter to my girlfriend. I feel horrible for what I am about to do to her, but I confess that my selfishness precedes all else. I am 20. I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I attempted suicide the first time when I was 11. I am gay. My entire family disowned me when I was 16 due to homophobia masked by religion; I am dead to them. I have little friends. 

I am going to make this as painless for her as possible and tape the letter to the door along with a piece of paper urging her to please not enter. She knows how low I am; she will understand what that means. I can only hope she heeds the warning. 

I will do it tomorrow shortly after she leaves for work. I will use my method while smoking cigarettes. As it enters my system and takes effect, I am certain it will be unpleasant at best, and painful at worst.  She hates cigarettes, despises the entire habit, but that is what I want to do. Smoke a pack of cigarettes.  

I have no reason to feel this way. I simply do. Always have. I am so tired.
