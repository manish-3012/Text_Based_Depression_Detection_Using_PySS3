I'm sick of life. Nothing seems good any more even when I'm on medication.I could write a whole story about my two dimensional shitty life but I think I'd prefer to just sum it up in the least amount of words possible.

There is no career that seems interesting to me, dead end jobs seem even worse and my family don't seem to understand. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet it because I haven't thought of a cool way to do it. I'm being serious, if my life is so bleak and uninteresting I might as well make my death quite fucking spectacular. I also don't want to ruin anybody else's life in the process. For example, I jump off a building and hit a concrete floor, I wouldn't want some poor bastard to find my mangled body. I shoot myself in the head, what about the person who finds that mess? No. Not like that.

I'm at rock bottom, the lowest I have ever been in all my life. I almost wish I was religious, maybe I could turn to a god for help at this time. I also wanted to add that I haven't killed myself because of my dad. I am his only son. My mother had a child to a different man so she would still have another son. I'm not saying that my dad would feel worse, both parents would be completely destroyed if I killed myself but you guys know what I mean? I don't think he'd have many reasons to live if I did it, whereas my mother would be stronger for my brother's sake.
