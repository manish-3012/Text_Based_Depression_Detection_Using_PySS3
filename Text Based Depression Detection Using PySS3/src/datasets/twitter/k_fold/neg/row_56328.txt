Iâ€™m so afraid of dying that I think killing myself would be easierIâ€™m so afraid of dying. Iâ€™ve been feeling this way for over a month. Iâ€™m so terrified of how quickly time passes that Iâ€™ve been counting it, and watching each moment slip by, reminding myself that it goes by so quickly. Itâ€™s as though in the next 30 seconds Iâ€™ll be 30, in the next minute Iâ€™ll be on my death bed. I have random intrusive memories of happier times invade my mind. Iâ€™ll never be able to experience them again, or being a child. Iâ€™m afraid of death because I am afraid of losing myself, of losing everything I love, even though right now Iâ€™m in incredible pain. Iâ€™m afraid of my final moments being painful or full of regret. This weekend I got incredibly drunk and almost slit my wrists. I was able to make one shallow cut and then collapsed to the floor sobbing. Iâ€™m so afraid of dying that itâ€™s made me think thereâ€™s no other option than to stop postponing the inevitable and kill myself. Iâ€™m so afraid. Right now Iâ€™m having a breakdown at work. Please help me. Please, please help me. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m so afraid.
