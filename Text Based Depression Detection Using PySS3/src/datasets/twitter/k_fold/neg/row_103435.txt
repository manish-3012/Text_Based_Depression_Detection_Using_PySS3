I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense, im pretty panicky right now. But Iâ€™ll just get straight to the point - Iâ€™m seriously considering killing my self before I go into work tomorrow. The nature of my job is extremely stressful for me as Iâ€™ve never done any office work. Iâ€™ve tried explaining that my job is causing me anxiety and depression to my mother but she doesnâ€™t understand and is instead saying things like â€˜I should never have suggested this job to youâ€™ when I explain how upset I get every morning before I go into work. Iâ€™m in tears almost everyday and I just feel like Iâ€™m at my breaking point. I canâ€™t do this anymore, I really canâ€™t. Taking my life seems like the only solution
