Please hold into me just a little bit longerIâ€™m 19 turning 20 this May. I tried to commit suicide when I was 16 and the second one was a few months ago. Firstly, iâ€™m sorry if my English is not good. It is not my first language. I wanted to tell my mom and my aunt (who lives with us) about my anxiety and depression. I remember while we were having dinner, the news was about teens having depression and so on. My aunt went saying â€œitâ€™s because they arenâ€™t close to God thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re suffering like that.â€ My mom then added that itâ€™s something that teens only invented. I wasnâ€™t able to speak up.

God knows, every night before I go to bed I pray for me to get better. I cry myself up asking him for help and strength and when I was about to ask them from my family, they judged before I could even tell my story. Then a few weeks back, I finally told them. I thought theyâ€™ll change their thoughts about it but sadly they didnâ€™t. I started to be secluded from my family. Only my older sister is the one who kept talking to me. They usually have plans to go out, I wouldnâ€™t even know about it except when my sis talks to me about it. Theyâ€™ll ask me why I eat less as if I havenâ€™t told them about what I am feeling.

And my mom, I donâ€™t really get her too at all. One moment sheâ€™s cursing me out, calling me names, shouting at me or hitting me with a short pole. Next moment, sheâ€™s all good as if she havenâ€™t done those things to me. Iâ€™ve had my dreams and now itâ€™s nowhere. In a few days, iâ€™ll be going back to school and I am anxious as hell on how will I cope along with everybody. 

I also remember my aunt bringing me to church and asked the father to bless me saying â€˜Iâ€™ve had a bad spirit on me or the devilâ€™s cursing on meâ€™ because of my mental state. Iâ€™ve never been more broken when I saw how they reacted and treated me after telling them the truth. They said theyâ€™ll always be there for me and listen to my problems and feelings without any judgements. I doubt that now. I just want them to at least be there when I need someone to talk to. 

I want to be better but these past days, their treatment became worse as if theyâ€™re giving up on me. I really am trying to be better. It might take a really long time but please just hold on for a little longer. I am trying, I swear. I just wanted a little more help from them to make me feel not alone. I never knew, my mother, my very own mother would have treated me worse just because of my state.

Thank you for reading, I hope everyoneâ€™s having a great day. We might be on the darkest times right now but stars and moons shines when itâ€™s the darkest. Iâ€™d like to see the beauty that this darkness holds more. And I do hope so that you will too.
