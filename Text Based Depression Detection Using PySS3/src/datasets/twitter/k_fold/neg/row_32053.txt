I've been thinking about killing myself daily for almost a year now, why keep trying?Literally nothing in my life is going well, school, mental health, social life, family, love life etc.

Once I finish school in June (at age 19), or if i even get to graduate, i'll get an apartment and a job and keep on living this shitty life. What else is there to keep fighting for?

It's not really any sadness involved in my suicidal thoughts anymore, it's actually the better alternative compared to keep living in my head.

Only thing that has kept me alive this long is knowing that i'd ruin my mother and fathers life forever if I kill myself, , but I don't know how much longer that'll keep me going.
