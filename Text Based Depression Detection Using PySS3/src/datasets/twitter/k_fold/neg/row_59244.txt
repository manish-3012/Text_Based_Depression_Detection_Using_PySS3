I am the personification of a "dead end"By that I mean that I feel like I was destined for a bad ending, regardless of whether I died early or spent my whole life progressing from one addiction to another, crisis to crisis, illness to illness, abusive relationship to abusive relationship (if any) etc. 

If you had an early trauma and was trapped in denial and and ongoing manipulation during the following, most crucial, formative years of your life, how are you supposed to redeem yourself from that? I can't imagine being happy and at peace with myself. At this point, imagining myself as being anything more than a rotting punching bag makes me feel like I'm not being myself - my usual self. I'm sick of people telling me I'm too hard on myself, or that I just need to 'be myself' and things will fall into place. I never had a "self" and will always be a fucking empty shell.

I watch how normal and functional other people are and I'm told they have problems too - but they don't, do they? They have friends, they haven't been taken advantage of by every person they've ever met - because they weren't taught it was their duty to be a doormat - and they can succeed academically, have fulfilling romantic lives and encounter all the milestones they're supposed to. I'm sick of being told "everyone has difficulties" when they clearly are fine enough to be accepted by society.

I'm aware that many, many people on here are lurking because they too want to die rather than looking on here to help people - but it's pretty clear that if I don't die on purpose then I will always hate myself anyway, and my life will continue to reflect that as it has done so far. Feel free to bond with me and we can at least have some sort of validation before the sweet release we are dying for (excuse the pun)
