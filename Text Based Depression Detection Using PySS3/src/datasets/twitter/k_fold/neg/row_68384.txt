I feel itâ€™s my destiny.I know Iâ€™ll die by my own hands. I want to do it but Iâ€™m terrified of never seeing my bf again. Our circumstances just fuel my suicidal ideation. Iâ€™ve fallen off the map and Iâ€™m living a lie. He wants to pretend the way things are represent happiness and this is the road to us finally being together. This may be the road to my death. 

I love him more than I could ever say and I want to be with him forever. He is my soulmate. But my mental health will never get better.  Iâ€™m trying so hard. The medication Iâ€™m taking is good but I lie to my psychiatrist because I wanna feel like Iâ€™m okay. Iâ€™m just a fraud. This whole thing. My entire life Iâ€™ve always been a liar. 

This next year. Iâ€™ll be surprised if I make it. I could never tell him because he is the sweetest thing on earth.
