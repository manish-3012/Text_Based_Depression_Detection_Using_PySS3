I have no hopeMy entire world is pain. I wake up everyday and feel like I am in hell. I am alone all day. I have nothing to distract myself with other than exercise and music and both of those are failing me right now. Iâ€™m just alone with my thoughts everyday. I read all these articles of why not to kill my self and it all says that people would miss or some bullshit. But I have no one. I know that Iâ€™m young and I have a future ahead of me, but nothing seems worth living through another second of this pain. Nothing makes it stop anymore and nobody can make it better. Why the hell should I live through another second of this?
