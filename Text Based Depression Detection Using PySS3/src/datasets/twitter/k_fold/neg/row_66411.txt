Why live when you're in a endless loop of sadness?I wake up not wanting to wake up, wishing I could just go to sleep and never wake up but sadly that's not as easy as everyone thinks. I don't remember the last day the smile I had wasnt fake, I only wish I could recall the last time it was real. I'm tired and getting taking advantage of, im too nice im starting to think. I don't care about my own feelings anymore just as long as the ones around me are happy im "happy." I dread going to sleep every night just to wake up in this world again in just a matter of hours. Overnight I just sit and think why should I live? Why shouldn't I just end it? I can't think of one reason to live, people may say "you have your whole life ahead of you." Yeah my whole life of sadness, and wanting to die... I was the statement give it time it'll get it better could be right, if it was why would I still be like this, 6 years of feeling this way is getting to much... Why don't I just die tonight?
