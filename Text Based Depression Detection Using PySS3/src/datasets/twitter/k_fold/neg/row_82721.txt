I'm growing more and more comfortable with killing myself as soon as I get back to schoolAnd the only reason I'd be waiting until then is so that I don't risk it being my family that finds me. I live on the 12th floor of a dorm building in a single room so the method is pretty much decided for me. I'm 20, would be 21 come March.

I just don't care anymore. I just had another girl tell me I'm "too good for [her], you seem like the perfect guy but I just don't have feelings for you no matter how much I want to." All the while my ex is off fucking every guy she comes across, or replacing me with guys that have never done shit with their lives and have no futures while I waste my life at some 'super prestigious' school that I hate and doesn't do shit for me. It's a lot more complicated than a simple breakup but i just don't care anymore. It's almost like I'm decided at this point. I just took a triple dose of sleeping pills. Not because I think it'll make me o.d. or anything, but because I can't stand being awake anymore. I can't bare the idea of being alone for the rest of my life and I know that's what's going to happen.
