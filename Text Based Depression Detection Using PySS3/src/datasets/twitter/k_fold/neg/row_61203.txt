I'm just so tiredI never thought 2 years would be enough to put me on my knees, but looks like it was more than I can handle
Sometimes i think to myself that I'm just a baby trying to get comfort while having a tantrum, actually that's how I feel most of the times I'm sad cause I shouldn't, you know?
I have the support of my family, a couple caring friends, decent grades even when my mind Is fucked up, everything is near perfect and somehow, anxiety always takes over
Maybe they dont really love, those couple friends are by my side out of pity, if I really wanted to I could be a good student
I've been trying to find an antidepressant that works for me, but I'm getting tired, the pills I take to sleep doesnt seem to work anymore... How did it's come to this? I used to he depressed but functional and now I need at least 1 hour to leave bed, it's seriously pathetic, geez
I've been trying, but I'm getting more tired as days and weeks go by... I just need a good day, a real smile, unexpected hug, something to remind you you're alive
Sorry for the horrible grammar, puntiation, etc... Gotta blame the autocorrector for some of that, tho
