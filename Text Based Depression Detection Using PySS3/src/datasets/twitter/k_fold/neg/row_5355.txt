30, gay, and a failure at lifeI want to die because I think I'll be 40 and in the same exact position. I'm broke, live with my homophobic mom and have been single my entire life. A third of my life is already over and I have nothing to show for it. I dread getting older because it feels as if no one cares about middle aged women. 

I don't want to tell my therapist that I'm suicidal because I don't want to go to the hospital. Especially since I have not mustered the courage to attempt suicide. I know there are people worse off but I just don't want my life and feel that I should be able to opt out if I want to. Nobody needs me anyway. I can easily get replaced at work. I cant relate to my coworkers who are all in relationships. I can't connect to any of them.

I've tried Meetup groups but I feel that'll go nowhere, just like how online dating has gone nowhere for me and how making friends at work is going nowhere.  

I cried at my desk today because of the thought that I'll probably be there in ten years and either having to put up with roommates or my Mom when I get home.

I'm just lonely, whiny and pathetic. I feel bad for posting here about petty crap. I just don't want to bother anyone in my life....
