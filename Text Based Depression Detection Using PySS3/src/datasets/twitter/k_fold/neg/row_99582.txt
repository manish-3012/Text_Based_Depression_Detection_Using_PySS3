Iâ€™m not sure how to liveI know this sounds stupid but since going back to university I donâ€™t know how to live anymore. I used to work in a dead end job and this is so much better, Iâ€™m acing all my subjects, but for some reason when it comes to human connections I end up causing more damage to myself than good. I want to not be lonely but every relationship Iâ€™ve had has only lasted 2-4 weeks because of severe trust issues I have. At this point I donâ€™t know what to do and I wish it was easy
