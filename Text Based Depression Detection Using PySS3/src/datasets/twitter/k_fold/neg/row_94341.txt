Need help for my girlfriend please!Alright so my girlfriend is having some problems with family and things going on in her life. We are very young 15 both.(Long distance ATM). Shes having thoughts of killing herself as she expresses to me. She doesn't talk to me about them as much i tell her and leave it open and try to push a little so she will talk and feel better. But its not working. I really need advice guys im lost i really am i love her so much even though we are so young. After tonight im seriously thinking she will do something and its straining our relationship. She will not go for help as much as ive pleaded for her to ask for help her parents are of no use at all. She says she will be forced to leave me( as in kill herself) if i call someone on her or try to force her to get help. I seriously dont know what to. Please help me.
