Running away/disappearing instead of ending my life?Iâ€™ve thought about ending my own life consistently for about 5 months now. Thereâ€™s not a day that goes by when I donâ€™t think about it. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with depression and was given medication for it but due to certain health conditions Iâ€™ve been forced to stop them. Opioids were on my list too but I refuse to take them since my family has a history of addiction and Iâ€™d rather not go down that rout. 

Since Iâ€™m so fearful of physically pain (which is why I havenâ€™t committed suicide) I was wondering if I just disappeared instead. Basically a person gone missing. Iâ€™ve made up scenarios in my mind of how I would do and where I would go, but itâ€™s all just a thought. 

Iâ€™m over 18 but I assume the police would still be â€œforcedâ€ to look for me if/when my parents or friends reported me missing. Have any of you attempted doing this? In my mind itâ€™s as close to a fresh start as I would get.
