I don't know what to doeveryone says 'it's going to get better,' but i don't think that that's true in the way i want it to be true. I will never be my old self. i dont even FUCKING know what my school is talking about when they say they're giving me help. There is only one time in my entire life when i told anybody what I was truly feeling and that was in my school psychologist's office. i literally broke down crying in her room because i thought she would help me. and you know what happened? meetings on top of meetings full of people in love with procedures and systems. they tried to send me to a hospital. no one believed me when i said that that made it WORSE. it did not help me in the slightest. i dont understand why, when a person is feeling depressed and suicidal, you don't LISTEN TO THEM. literally i have never encountered such fucking bitches in my entire life as the people i met in this 'process.' please god tell how filling in these sheets of 'strategies' with a fucking condescending social worker using time when i was going to do something i fucking LOVE is going to help me. please please please. i am just so sick i tried to get help and i feel worse inside and it's getting to the point where i think im going to just leave. I JUST CAN'T DEAL WITH THE REGRET AND PAIN AND FAILURE i CANT.

i feel bad because my dad tried working with me and working from home all these months so he can drive me to school and do other things to support me but i want to die.

ive tried to get better and get help but thru these months ive learned no one is going to help me in the way i need help and i can only rely on myself...

im sorry if this doesnt make sense im writing this while crying.
