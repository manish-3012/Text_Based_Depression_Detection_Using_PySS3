Nothing helpsIve been off and on meds for years for anxiety and ocd I feel like my brain is just fucked. I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself, I do all the self care in the world, I have people that love and support me, people to talk to, but the thoughts just wont stop. When I talk to people about suicidal thoughts they tell me about how my family would feel and the people I would hurt if I did it, but that only makes it hurt worse, knowing  that thereâ€™s no way out makes me spiral deeper.
