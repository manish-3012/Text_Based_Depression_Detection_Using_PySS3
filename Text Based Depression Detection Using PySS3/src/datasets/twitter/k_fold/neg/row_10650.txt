why should I stay alive for hope of a better futureHaving ASD, I have no social intuition. All of my social success is a result of actively manipulating people by pretending to be something I'm not- charming, interesting. It's exhausting and makes me feel like a bad person, which strips away any fulfilment I might get from such successes.

My genuine friends have become few and far between. Adults usually refer to this as part of growing up, but in the absence of a significant other there's nothing good about this development. I've merely lost more of what little non-biological closeness I had with other people which I had earned rather than been born with.

I've pursued a policy of "I'll meet someone eventually" with regards to a relationship for some time now. Personality plays such a large part in attraction for me that I'm only attracted to friends I've made. But they are so valuable already that trying to date them would risk too much- besides, my previous forays there have turned up nobody who reciprocates my feelings. I've got no interest in finding someone to become my girlfriend because that stinks of misguided intentions and a relationship that's going to leave someone feeling like they're being used. Besides, I don't want to be "proactive" about getting an SO- that just translates into me acting like a sociopath and being manipulative as I specified earlier.

What's the point of staying alive? I'm miserable and lonely. My friends say they are happy to listen to me vent but don't think they can do anything. I'm on anti-depressants and I've had therapy already. I speak to my dad about this sort of thing when it's bad and he's very supportive but I don't come out feeling any better because the situation hasn't changed. What reason do I have to stick around? It feels like I'm wasting my time and effort doing anything at this point.
