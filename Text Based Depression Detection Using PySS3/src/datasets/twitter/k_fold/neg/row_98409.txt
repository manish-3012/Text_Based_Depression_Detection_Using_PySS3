Nearing the endI don't think it's worth staying any longer. I'm tired. Don't mind me please I'm just venting. I'm sad and tired and want to leave. I feel like I'm fading so much faster than before haha, but it's okay it's expected. I saw this coming long ago. I wasnt meant to live too long anyway and that's okay, I think I'm ready I just..need to prepare a little more with some things then I'll do it. 
I might delete this..idk Im sorry for wasting your time
