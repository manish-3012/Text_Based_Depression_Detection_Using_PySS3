Lasting anhedonia and antidepressant withdrawalHas anyone else experienced lasting anhedonia and memory/concentration issues from tapering off of antidepressants? How long did it last and did anything help you to recover? I completed my taper off of Wellbutrin 75 mg three weeks ago after taking the drug for a year and a half. Since tapering off of it I have experienced SEVERE anhedonia and haven't seen any improvements in my symptoms.
