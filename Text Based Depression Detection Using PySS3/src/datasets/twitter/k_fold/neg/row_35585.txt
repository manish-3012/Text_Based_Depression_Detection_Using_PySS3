I feel incredibly sad and empty, my emotions are fickle as shit though. Iâ€™ve had some thoughts floating aroundTbh, Iâ€™ve been having thoughts of jumping off a bridge or putting a gun right in my mouth and pulling the trigger. I just feel so empty, i donâ€™t have any friends to talk to anymore, all my close ones are either gone or in the hospital. Itâ€™s just tough for me rn man.
