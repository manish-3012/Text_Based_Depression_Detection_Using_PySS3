What should I do to stay alive through this? Post from /r/AskRedditAlright, so I'm a college Freshman. Throughout my life, I have had bad mood swings. Usually, I get very depressed all of the sudden. This used to happen twice a year or so, but since coming to college it has started happening more. It's up to once a week and I have no idea what to do. My girlfriend wants me to go to the doctor, but the free clinic isn't open for another week and a half. The school counselor didn't help. I feel like killing myself over it at times, like right now. I don't care if this gets downvoted to hell, I just need someone to read it. To see that I tried. Even if I failed. So guys, what do I do? What is your advice?
