I lost my best friend to illness today, and I don't think I can really handle anything anymore.To start, my best friend wasn't a person. It was a little bird, a little Lutino Cockatiel. Her name was Yulia and whenever my grief and pain grew too much to bear, I'd remind myself that whatever my struggle, I was all that she had in life, and persevere. She was a loving pet and an anchor, an anchor I no longer have. I'm devastated. Depression and frequent suicidal thoughts are hard enough without the pain of having my loving little friend slowly slip away in my hands, despite the efforts of my avian veterinarian.

I don't know what to do anymore. Dunno what I can do anymore. To me, I don't really feel I have a reason to stay alive anymore.
