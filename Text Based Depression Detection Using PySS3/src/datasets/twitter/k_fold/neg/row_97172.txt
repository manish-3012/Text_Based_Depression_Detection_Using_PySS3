sometimes i feel like i have to kill myself eventually whether i want to or notim young but, i feel that i will never figure this life shit out and i have to sacrifice myself sooner than later to finally be at peace. no matter how happy i get, i get down again; so why not just break the cycle. ironically enough, thinking about the death of me makes me sad as fuck. i donâ€™t want to die, i just feel like its mandatory at this point.

ive talked and thought about it so much, i might as well live up to it. 

my brain is too much to deal with and i am drained. im trying everything.
