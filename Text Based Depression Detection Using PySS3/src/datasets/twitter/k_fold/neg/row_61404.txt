i don't feel anything anymore other than the occasional stab of painEverything around me is worthless. The walls that surround me, the different arrangements of wood and plastic in the forms of chairs and tables, the common soul-consuming technology that owns me, and most of all myself. Every morning I wake up, as if being pulled reluctantly from one world to another. And in spite of how much hatred I have for everything around me, I still tolerate it. I still force myself into a world that's entirely hostile, surrounded by people that would rather see me dead if it meant some entertainment for them, something for them to talk about, something them to *feel*. I have hated myself for so long now that I have become completely unaware of myself. My mind has completely disassociated from reality to save itself from the world that has fucked me for as long as I remember. The best part is that even when I'm locked up in my room, as far from everything as I can possibly be, I hallucinate some things so horrifying that I can't bring myself to recall them. I want someone to stab me or beat me to remind me I'm alive, because all I am is a hollow shell of what used to be a human being. I'm not only a fucking nihilistic monster, but I'm also a coward, proof of that being that I'm posting here instead of filling my stomach with pills or tearing my arteries open. Life feels like rape every day and I don't want to be a part of it anymore
