I lost my familyA year and a half ago, I had to watch my fiance succumb to brain cancer.  It was quick, horrific and one of my darkest times. 

I fell in love again.  Moved to a neighboring state to be with him and fell in love with the little life I had.  Two amazing step kids, an amazing partner and then my mental illness arrived on my doorstep.  

I forgot to take care of myself along the way and I withered.  I turned into a shrieking harpy of a partner and would lose my shit at the slightest provocation.  

I broke my partner in the end.  The love of my life.  It's too little, too late for me to do my self care.  I can't take things back.  I begged for another chance but why would he?  

I lost my little family.  My home.  Myself.
