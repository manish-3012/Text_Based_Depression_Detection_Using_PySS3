Not Strong Enough this MorningHello Friends, Id like to say Iâ€™ve come a long way from my last post. I now live with my girlfriend and we adopted a puppy. As much as I love him and the joy he brings me I still feel like an actor. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like Iâ€™m just playing these roles, when do I become the lie as opposed to the lie becoming me?

anyhow this morning I woke up feeling like a zombie, my place is a mess due to the GF being away for a week, Iâ€™m seriously behind one some deliverables for work. Maybe I just kill myself this morning, our dog walker can find me this afternoon and by the time my girlfriend arrives home Saturday any trace of me can be gone. I just feel like I canâ€™t lift the burden of this morning.
