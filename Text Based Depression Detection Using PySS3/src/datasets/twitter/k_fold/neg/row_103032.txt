I want to die but I can'tI just feel like there's no point in living and I want it all to end and just give up but I feel like I can't commit suicide. I just want to be involved in an accident or just not wake up one day and everything to be over. I don't even know why I'm writing this who fucking cares nothing'll happen I'll just keep living inside my already dead mind and body until I eventually actually die
