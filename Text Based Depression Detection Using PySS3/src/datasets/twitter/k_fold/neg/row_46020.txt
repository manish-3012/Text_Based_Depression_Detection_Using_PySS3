Yesterday, I Discovered I Don't Actually Want to Die.To try and condense this story: from Saturday onwards I was experiencing sharp, stabbing pains in my lower abdomen. They got so bad I called 999 (the emergency number here in the UK), but the paramedic hand waved it as gastroenteritis. Now, my mother almost died from a burst appendix 9 years ago, so I know the symptoms of appendicitis well. However, I didnâ€™t speak up...a mistake that luckily wasn't fatal.

I had an appendectomy last night, but let me tell you: I thought I was goner. I have never experienced pain so fucking awful ever. And I was scared shit less. 

I'm not sharing this story to imply your suicidal feelings are not real: mine certainly were, and probably I'll go back to "if I just jump in front of that train, my shitty life is over" pretty soon, but it did make me realise what exactly it is that I truly want to kill: the depression. The mind and body come as a package deal with that, and I really wish it didn't.
