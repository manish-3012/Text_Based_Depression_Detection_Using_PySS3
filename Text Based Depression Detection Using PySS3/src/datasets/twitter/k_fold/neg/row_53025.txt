i need help. how do i get help?itâ€™s been a really really bad week for me emotionally/mentally. like iâ€™ve been feeling depressed on and off since i was 9, but now i just feel like it is reaching new heights. i almost killed myself last night by slitting my wrists but decided that that was too painful and unreliable of a way to go. so i held off and after spending all day wishing i hadnâ€™t i realized that iâ€™m reaching an end point. i can only struggle and hurt for so long. iâ€™m 17. which makes a lot of adults invalidate my problems claiming i donâ€™t know about the real world. well what the fuck am i in right now? iâ€™m so stressed about my future, but they act like because iâ€™m not yet an adult the problems donâ€™t hurt. iâ€™m going to have to go to college soon. i canâ€™t afford that. iâ€™m going to have to be on my own soon. i canâ€™t handle that. i already feel so alone. iâ€™m not close to any of the friends i talk to in school and iâ€™m surely not close to my parents. my parents constantly belittle my problems. iâ€™ve tried to talk to them about my anxiety, depression, and stress problems but they donâ€™t care. i tell them i canâ€™t sleep but they donâ€™t care. even worse than not caring they make jokes about it, laughing at me. like what? i guess they just really donâ€™t believe in these sort of problems. so how am i suppose to get help if my parents wonâ€™t let me. i need help now. iâ€™m scared of what might happen if i donâ€™t get the help i need.
