Iâ€™m gonna try to write a book, I have a good story Iâ€™ve been rewriting for the past year and afterwards if it gets published. Then Iâ€™m killing myself.I made a post on here a few months ago where I talked about my life and why I think Iâ€™m so unhappy with it. Well What I didnâ€™t explain in that text is that Iâ€™ve been working on a book for the past 14 months. Itâ€™s about a boy who hates everything and jerks off a lot. He tries to kill himself but is to pathetic to actually do it. So he suffers his entire life before he snaps and loses his fucking mind. Of course thereâ€™s a lot more in my book that I didnâ€™t explain because I donâ€™t want to put out to many spoilers before itâ€™s finished. I donâ€™t expect the book to do so well and I donâ€™t expect it to even get published at all if Iâ€™m honest. But my life plan is to finish it and make it the best writing Iâ€™ve ever written in my life. And after Iâ€™m done with it Iâ€™m gonna stop caring about my life and hopefully kill myself from overdosing alcohol. Both of my parentâ€™s are very conservative and are fully against alcohol and other drugs  and I feel like I need them to numb the pain from all the bullshit. I already knew when I was 15 that I was gonna turn into an substance abuser when I get older. Now Iâ€™m turning 17 in three days and All I can think off when I wake up is how much alcohol I wanna drink. I donâ€™t care If I will die from it. I wanna die from it. Because Iâ€™ve realized that life isnâ€™t for me. Iâ€™m already drinking deadly amounts of coca cola, redbull, monster and other soft drinks right now. And the amounts of junk food I eat is unbelievable. But Iâ€™m still thin as a stick so no one notices it. I guess Itâ€™s my way of trying to cope with my biopolar disorder and My hidden depression.
