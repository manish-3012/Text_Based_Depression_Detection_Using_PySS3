I dont think nobody caresI know my family loves me, and I feel awful for them. I know that am I doomed to take my life sooner or later and the sooner I do it the less suffering I have to endure. my mind is constantly flooded with thoughts of my mom finding my body. my girlfriend (ex?) doesn't care and constantly does/qsays things that push me closer to the edge and i can't wait to jump. I desperately want to be saved but the only person that can save me is the person who is emotionally abusing me and bullying me. she's going to regret it all when im gone.

why is there this idea that everybody thats suicidal thinks they're unloved? I just can't handle the pain, all I do is lock myself in my room and abuse drugs and have constant mental breakdowns when im sober.

I really wanted to be a dad so bad. I wanted to get married and have kids more than anything else in the world. my mind is falling apart. I only live now to die in a week or so.
