I want to take care of myselfToday is the day I finally got out of school, for Christmas break. It means that I won't meet the toxic people from my school as much, and while I still have to go to church (I'm forced into Christianity :) ) I'll finally have time for myself â€” I won't have to cry over the pathetic-ness of my life. 

I really want to get productive now â€” as much as I don't like the "new year â€” new me" thing, I plan on changing. I'll take care of myself. I'll read books. I'll have good grades. I know it won't be easy, but I want to be happy, even if just for a short while.
