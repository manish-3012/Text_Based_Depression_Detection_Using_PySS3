It's about timeI hate my patologic family, I hate how everything that happens in my life is a bad thing. I have enough of everyone treating me like shit and telling me how worthless I am but they're right. I will show em how worthless I am and how much their lifes will be without me and they'll better appreciate it because if they can be fucked enough to terminate my dogs life just because they "can't afford to feed this worthless bag of shit" so they shall be happy when won't have to afford me for any longer. I feel like I'm driving on a highway where the further I drive the worse the weather gets, and all of the exits goes to the same place, I better just pull of sooner than later. I got this all figured out, I'll just inhale a shitload of nitrogen gas and pass out peacefully. I even told about my plan to one of my friends and you know what he said? He said that I'm fucking nuts and i should go to mental ward. I just need few days, few fucking days more to write letters to few people about how i fucking hate them and few to people who i actually like and say how much they've helped me through all of this and how's it not their fault. It's about time to end this, once and for all....
