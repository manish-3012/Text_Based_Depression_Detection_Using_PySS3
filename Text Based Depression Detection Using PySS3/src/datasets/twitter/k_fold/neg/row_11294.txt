I don't know what to do.I'm still in highschool and yet the world feel like it's falling apart, my depression has gotten so bad that I just can't do anything. I haven't done any of my work for a good semester and I'm failing everything, I use to be a pretty good student before but I let it bring me down this time. Me having straight failing grades makes me even more depressed. Most people would say just get up and do it and stop being lazy but it feels so much more. I am also over weight, and I want to go to a gym but my anxiety and depression won't let me. I try making myself go but I end up falling into a panic attack or just unable to move. Some days I question why I'm alive, and maybe soon I won't, but if I can answer truthfully I don't want to leave, I want my depression to get better and my anxiety, paranoia. I just need someone to talk to. I just hope it's not too late. Sorry if it's messy. I will add on later.
