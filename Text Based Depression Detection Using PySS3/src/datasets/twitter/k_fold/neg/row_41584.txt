Family ruined. No Friends. Took a wrong direction in life. All I want to do is end it.Hi. Long post, and I know a lot are going through tough times but I hope you can help me. Things are bad. I am a high school senior, sheltered for all my life, only to have things turn sour.This is my first post though these thoughts have been recurring for the past 2 years. Essentially a lot has happened in the course of 10 months. 

* My father had an affair that led to a baby. Family is crumpling apart, but fortunately my mother wants to stay. Lots of fighting persists and I have to essentially care for my little brother during these moments

* I got in a nasty car crash. My mother opted to take the blame, I was too shocked to say no. I kept complaining about cameras. I got charged with obstruction but luckily kept my permit license after traffic school. I am deathly afraid of driving. I cant look whenever we make a left turn, and this has hurt my accessibility.

*  I've been a straight A student with amazing Standardized test scores. After all of the top affordable universities rejected me, I got stuck with going to a state school. I have no one to live with, nor have nor idea how to live on my own since my learning skills have been hindered by the family crippling.

* Now that I realized by antisocial harcore studying has done nothing, I realized I fucked up. I should have made friends rather than memorize test answers. I should have  joined a club or have a hobby rather than neatly finish math homework. So many "I should have done this or thats." It is killing me.

* I have 0 friends. I have never been active or social, but usually I have people I can talk to in the hallways at high school. Since the recent events, I have shelled up. I spend my time at the library doing crap on their computers. I get especially anxious whenever they close the library because then I have to wander the hallways.

* All this piled up and now my class is requiring meet ups or socials. I cant handle that. I just want to ball up and binge watch Top Gear because that is the only thing that is taking my mind off of suicide.


That's basically the jist. My parents cant afford therapy. After all the court sessions and alimony, my father lost his job and corresponding disability leave (He is diabetic). So now we are living off less than we had. I have an older brother who basically quit on caring for us after all that happened. My younger is energetic and I love him nlike no one ever before, though Sometimes I get so angry at him that I strike him. Yet, every day I cry thinking of how terrible life must be for him.

I'm not asking for help. I just want to know if it will be okay. If someone has pulled past something similiar. How can I do something about this. What can **I** do? All I can think about is where I can hang myself, or if enough cough syrup can kill me.
