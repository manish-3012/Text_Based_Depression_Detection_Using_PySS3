A year ago, todayA year ago today, I promised to myself that if I havenâ€™t gotten better by the 25th of May, 2020 ( one day before my birthday, the 26th ) that I would kill myself.

And, I was better for quite some time. 
However, recently it all went to shit.
I have nobody to talk to, I lost a ton of friends, mostly because of my own actions, all I do is hurt the people around me.
Itâ€˜s really not like I am doing it on purpose, itâ€™s the opposite. I try my best to make the people around me happy..

Iâ€˜m on antidepressants, however I still feel so bad, I havenâ€™t been this bad since last year.
Iâ€˜m not sure what to do today, itâ€™s not like I want to die, I just want it to stop:(
