Has anyone else written out their suicide notes in advance?I'm in no way resolved to do it today, apart from anything else there are so many things I want to get in order first.

But just drafted three notes - one to my best friend and one to a lovely ex, both with practical as well as personal info - and one to my most immediate ex explaining what he can do to avoid ravaging someone's happiness / peace / sanity in the future.

I just thought I'd make a post about this.
