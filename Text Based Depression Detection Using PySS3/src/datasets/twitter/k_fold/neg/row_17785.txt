I feel like the pressure is killing me, and I haven't even started yet.Iâ€™ll be frank from the outset: If I donâ€™t pass my thesis defense I will kill myself. Iâ€™ve known this for months, but I think Iâ€™ve come to terms with it. And Iâ€™m so scared.

I havenâ€™t slept in three days. I feel so helpless. 

Some brief background: If I pass my thesis defense, Iâ€™ll move to the other side of the continent to start a doctorate in August. The school Iâ€™m moving to is my top school, most of the programâ€™s students graduate into the job I want to have. My cohort is full of tremendously intelligent, Ivy League types. I feel so outclassed and I havenâ€™t even started yet. I was the first person in my family to graduate from college. Iâ€™ve clawed my way back from being a terrible, underprepared, and immature student in my first couple years of undergrad â€“ for which I feel an enormous amount of shame â€“ and (nearly) though a masterâ€™s in a new country. This is an opportunity that doesnâ€™t come to people from where I grew up. Iâ€™m truly not trying to boast or talk myself up, I just want someone to read how hard it is for me to breathe with this much pressure.

If I fail my defense Iâ€™ll never start (or finish) a doctorate or publish any more papers. My doctoral offer, the fellowship, the reputation for which Iâ€™ve literally shed blood and tears all disappears. The thought of failing, of being exposed as a phony, of letting down my peers is worse than death. Because itâ€™s more than my peers, my advisor, my colleagues; itâ€™s my fucking career, itâ€™s what Iâ€™ve devoted (zealously perhaps) myself to for (what feels like) my adult life. It isnâ€™t that I have nothing if I fail, itâ€™s that I have nothing to live for if I fail.

The sad thing is that I LOVE my work. Itâ€™s clichÃ© (this whole situation feels so fucking clichÃ©), but I wake up every morning with a genuine feeling of hope. Like I might accomplish something worthwhile. I hate myself for being so cynical.
I feel so trapped in my head. I want to smash my face into a pulp to stop the worrying so I can sleep again. To stop drinking so much. To stop alienating myself and be just vulnerable enough to live as a normal human being. I feel so pathetic and ungrateful and spoiled and melodramatic.

Killing myself will kill my mother. I know that. I canâ€™t do that to her; sheâ€™s so proud of me. But I canâ€™t live like this. I know this will only get worse â€“ if I pass â€“ as the stakes get higher. I feel so paper thin, like Iâ€™m living on a knife edge waiting to be squished into the blade. 

This is too much for me. Even if I do pass, I know I can't do this for much longer. Something has to give. If failure is inevitable why not prevent it altogether?

Thanks for reading what I wrote.
