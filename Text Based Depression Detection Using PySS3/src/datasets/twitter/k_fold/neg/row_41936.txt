depression &amp; suicidal thoughts &amp; being along is TOO MUCH;I'm 21 years old and i feel i have nothing live forI'm 21 year old female and I have suffered from major depression since i was 9. I been receiving treatment for my depression since i was 14 and been hospitalized 3X. I actually feel im getting worse I have absolutely NO FRIENDS or social life. I dont really have family;my mother doesnt really like me and neither do my siblings i live with. I attend community college i make good grades but i have no friends and cant make any. I dont know how build relationships because my depression and social anxiety isolated me from people., I honestly dont know how be social. People look at me on outside and think I have friends or boyfriend but i dont. Men hit on me and stuff but I dont know how to react. I usually try to end the conversation. I dont come off socially awkward but "mean or rude". I dont mean to be I am good person but i dont know how to maintain relationships or even small talk. I missed out on important milestones someone my age should have experienced like going to prom, dating, first kiss, losing virginity, and etc. It feels like I never will experience that and it makes me want to give up. I recently learned to drive that's only thing i can do. In my mind I still feel like child because I missed out on whole teenage phase of life and I WILL NEVER GET IT BACK. So can i be adult if I never made transition of being a child to teen to adult? I feel invisible and alone . The depression,racing thoughts,and feeling suicidal is over whelming. Social anxiety is very hard deal with even little things like going to the store is difficult.I feel worthless and pathetic. I feel have nothing look forward to. What is point of doing well in school if I will never be able get the job , get married, or have family of my own? I am tired of being alone
