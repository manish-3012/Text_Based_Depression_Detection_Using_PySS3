Emptiness... How i feel after one of my best friends tried to kill himself.It's not totally empty... just feels like something is draining out of me. 

This happened a few hours ago, over him being upset that our other friend had sex with some other dude. (he has an extreme crush, that could never be returned)

he flipped shit and destroyed her bedroom, and did everything he could to throw a tantrum about his jealousy.

So we are pissed at him basically, but then he came back and essentially kidnapped my our friend and was yelling and crying that he would kill the guy she had sex with and kill her family, and then himself. 

he ended up bring her back home and before driving away he said he would go kill himself as soon as he leaves. 

We all freaked of course, called his parents and waited for updates. 

Turns out he cut his arms up and nearly bled out, then freaked out hard enough that he called 911 on himself. 

He's in a hospital and his parents won't let us come because he told them our friend cheated on him. 
so they're blaming her for this.

He's delusional and possibly suffers from undiagnosed multiple personality disorder. 
We've known that he's a bit off for the past 2 years but never expected him to fly off the handle this way. 

It's a weird combo of emotions. didn't know what else to do to get it out of my system.
