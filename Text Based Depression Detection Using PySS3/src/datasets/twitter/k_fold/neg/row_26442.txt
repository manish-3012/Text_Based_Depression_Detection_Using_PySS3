I can't do this anymoreIt's been three months of constant thoughts of suicide and I don't know if I'm posting this because I want to be stopped or I'm doing it to vent.

I broke up with my girlfriend which made me lose one of my greatest friends. He's not a great person and I say that as in he's not perfect. I vented to my ex about him and a load of drama that occurred over the past three months and she told him. He confronted me about it today and told me that I'm an abusive person, and I ran away on the brink of tears because I've only been trying to fix everything. He later texts me "you are going to keep my name out of your mouth and you are going to stay away from me and my girlfriend. consider this a warning." 

I'm wanting to cut but my boyfriend said he'd cut if I did so I'm not. I promised him I would make it past Christmas. I know it'd kill him if I did this and I know it's not the only option but I'm at my limit. I can only handle so much and I've reached so far past that point these past few months I can't handle it anymore I just can't. I'm going to kill myself in January as far as I'm concerned right now.
