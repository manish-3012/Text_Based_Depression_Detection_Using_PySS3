[TW] Discussion, why not?I have wanted to die off and on for years and during my last major episode I told myself I couldn't die because XYZ. Why do you choose not to? What is keeping you here? What do you say to yourself when those thoughts come up? 

My questions are sincerely held and I appologize for any damage caused by asking this question. I am new here.

Things aren't looking bright for me, pick me ups also appreciated. â¤
