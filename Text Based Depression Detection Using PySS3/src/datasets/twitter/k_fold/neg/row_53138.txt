My life is a failure (29M)I honestly have never had any suicidal thoughts in my life, but I am considering it now.  My wife left me in January, just waiting on the papers to come in now.  I learned today I was passed up for a promotion that everybody said they were sure I would get.  My job is now basically dead-end, and I have no skills to move into another industry.  Financially, I'm OK, but what's the fuckin point any more?  My job was the only thing I had left in my life.  The idea of continuing to move up was the only thing to even wake up for.

I literally have no friends, as they either all moved away or got married and had kids.  Any prospect of having another human really be there for me seems so far out of reach right now.  I don't have anybody to talk to about anything aside from my dad and my mom.  It's sad that I actually want to text my ex-wife something...anything to have human contact, but I'm not going to do that.  I don't want to reach out to my employees, as they are my subordinates and I don't want them worrying about me or knowing I feel this way.  I feel such an emptiness now, I can't describe how bad it hurts. 

I'm reaching out to you guys now.
