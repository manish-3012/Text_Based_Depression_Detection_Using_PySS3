All of my problems will end if die, but I'm scared of death.So I feel like my life is gonna be fucked forever. 

- Lost my financial aid for community college because I kept procrastinating and ended up flunking a few classes. 

- Lost my best friend and the person I love due to a dumb argument which destroyed me emotionally. 

- My mother almost lost our house due to an issue with mortgage payments which led her to declare bankruptcy and now I have to work help support her, and buy food. 

- Lost more friends due to emotional breakdowns I have had due to the distress of losing my best friend. 

- Every attempt at a relationship for the past few years has ended with me getting hurt, the worst being when someone who I was talking to for a couple months stole my money. 

- I'm an aspie which makes social shit even harder. 

Now I'm just a loser 20 year old who lives with his mom and never really goes outside  unless for work and doesn't really have any friends. I'm better off dead and honestly I should kill myself but I'm a pussy who's scared of death. Every time things look up it just goes back to the status quo, I honestly wish I died 5 or 6 years ago before things started going down hill.
