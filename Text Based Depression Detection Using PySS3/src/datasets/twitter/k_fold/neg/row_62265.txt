Help finding helpHello. Please take in the following knowing it is meant in a kind, humble tone. 

I was sent here by /r/themixednuts to seek help with my suicide thoughts and attempts. But all I see here is person after person posting they want to kill themselves and then comments below saying 'don't do it, let's talk'. That doesn't help me. 

I need to get back on my meds, but my health insurance ended. I was told by a previous psychiatrist that there are services available for people who can't pay ANYTHING. I can't find any type of help like that. I feel like I've googled everything and called around everywhere. I have clicked around through your resources list. 

I am not searching for a friend to talk to. There is plenty of love and support available to me. I do NOT feel "lonely". There is something severely wrong with the chemicals in my brain and prescription drugs help. A lot.

Every other day I get a bit closer. I have a plan and a backup plan. One of them I really want to try now, while my husband sleeps in the next room.

Any suggestions on where to seek free psychiatric services, or even where to start looking and who to ask would be so greatly appreciated. I am in the Denver Metro Area. I want to start university again, just for the mental health services. But I can't wait that long.

Thank you to everyone here for caring about each other. &lt;3
