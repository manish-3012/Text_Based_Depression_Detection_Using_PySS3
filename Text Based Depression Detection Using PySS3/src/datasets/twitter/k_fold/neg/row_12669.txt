Homophobia and the likes.Came out of the closet about a month ago and as if on cue, all of my closest friends drifited away from me. now im met with hate and resentment. Its getting to a point where i dont want to leave the house or leave my bed. Part of me wants to end it all just so i dont have to endure anymore of this hatred, yet another part of me is too scared to do anything.
