My mother is driving me to suicide.She is overbearing, and even worse when sheâ€™s drunk (about half of my interactions with her are while sheâ€™s intoxicated). Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for about 4 or 5 years, and sheâ€™s been nothing but dismissive. Reluctant to take me to psychologists, berating me for needing medication, guilt tripping me because of how much me sessions with my psychologist were. Iâ€™ve stopped being able to see my psychologist, and Iâ€™m not getting any more meds. I know thereâ€™s other ways out, but suicide seems like easiest option, and the one that would spite her the most.
