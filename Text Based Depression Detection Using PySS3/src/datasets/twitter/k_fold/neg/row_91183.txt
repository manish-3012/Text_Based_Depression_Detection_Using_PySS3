I think I'm finally readyThis has been building up for too long.   I have tried to ignore the feelings for quite some time.  I'm sick of feeling so inadequate at everything.  I'm tired of trying to be happy or acting like it may get better.   I'm sick of opening up to people  or loved ones only to have my feelings ignored or downplayed.  I've had other health issues for the last 10 years that have made enjoying life a living hell.   I need to just accept that things don't always get better.

I've thought about the burden this will put on my family.  My mom and girlfriend have been keeping me going in a lot of ways.   I broke up with my girlfriend today who I absolutely adored.  I felt more and more lately that I was just another burden and annoyance then anything else to her.  I don't want her to find out or know either.  Sad thing is, she didn't even care.  She didn't even bat an eye.  I think that only helped me in realizing how worthless I am. I was just a blip on the radar.

I hate to think about my mom finding me, or how she will deal with it.  I also think maybe i'm just being selfish and thinking i'm more important then I am.  Maybe she won't even care.   I've had a good run.  I'm ready to move on from it all.
