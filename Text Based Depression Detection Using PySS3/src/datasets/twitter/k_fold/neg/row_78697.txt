i just need somebody to confide ini feel so hopeless and alone about everything and i have nobody to talk to, nobody who understands me well enough to give me advice. hardly anyone cares for me in the first place. iâ€™m worse these past few days than i ever have been and every attempt i make to improve the situation backfires and makes everything worse. i donâ€™t have any hope left.
