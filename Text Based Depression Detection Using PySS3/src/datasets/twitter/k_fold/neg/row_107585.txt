I feel like Rodney DangerfeildBecause I get no respect from anybody. I can't tell if it's because of my small stature, social awkwardness, ugly face, or all of those things combined. No matter what I do, most people just don't seem to...really even like me. I could try to connect/hit it off with one person, fail, then watch them talk to someone else a second later and they get along swimmingly. Idk what it is. It's especially a problem with girls/women. Young or old, I seem to be female-repellent, despite the fact that I don't feel anxiety around them. I'm just trying to be my normal self, but apparently there's something wrong with that. I kind of get along well with other dudes, but I can't make "true" friends and I just never get any respect from them. Idk it's like I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. I'd like to think it's nothing, because I value myself, but no one else really does. They just call me "buddy" and "dude" condescendingly and generally fail at treating me like an adult. Idk. It mostly sucks with women because it seems I can't attract any of them and I place a lot of value on being able to do that, because I find at it's heart the ability to attract women has a lot to do with your social ability and humanity, and I just can't seem to pull it off. It's got me so down to be honest. I'll admit, so down that I think I'd rather die than be this socially-incapable.
