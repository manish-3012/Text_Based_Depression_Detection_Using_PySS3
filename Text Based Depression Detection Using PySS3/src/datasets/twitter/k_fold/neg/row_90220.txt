Is it normal to think about death often?I should be happy. There are a lot of bad and stressful things going on in my life, but that happens to lots of people. I have an ok life and would even say that I feel happy most of the time.

BUT...

I think about dying almost daily. I will be walking home after a long day and see a car and just imagine jumping in front of it at the last second. Or when I go to the kitchen I'll see a big knife and hold it up above my wrist and imagine slicing my arm open. I've never and don't plan on self harming soon. Ever since I was a little kid I always told myself that when I die, it's most likely going to be from suicide or a crazy accident. I think about it all the time and want to know if it's normal or what I could do to make it stop.
