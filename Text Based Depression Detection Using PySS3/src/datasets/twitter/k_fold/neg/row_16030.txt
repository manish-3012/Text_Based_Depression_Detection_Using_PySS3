I dont know if you guys understand me...I'm in a deep depression. My grades are awful, my dad says that I'm dumb and that I don't care about anything.
I never felt what it's like to be loved by someone that's not my family.
I have just one friend and he have a girlfriend. Like I love to see them in love but, it makes me jealous, because he have someone that cares about him.
I want someone that says sweet thing to me, that makes me feel alive and that I can pass my time with.
Some guys just want girls to have sex and then, they just dump them like the girls are just some sexual objects, but I'm not that kind of guy.
I care about the feeling, how is she. Everything.
I really think that I'll never be loved. The only thing that I'm still alive it's because of my grandma and because I want to find a girl that love me.
Sorry for being this level of gayness, but I needed to spit out this words.
I really think that when my grandma die, I'm going to kill myself. There's no point to be alive.

PS: I read the "I wish I could be loved" tread and I shared the same feels so I write this.
