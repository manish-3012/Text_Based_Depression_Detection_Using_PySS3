I'm spirallingI was good for weeks, I actually think the pressure of exams is good as it gives me something to focus on but idk I think I just snapped.

I had a dream about drowning myself recently and i can't get it out if my head. 

I'm not eating much and I notice my head just getting more and more foggy recently. 

My mum died six months ago and I just feel so guilty because she was in hospital for 4 weeks before she died and I didn't visit her once and I don't think I can handle the rest of my life without her. It's stupid I know but I just can't help thinking that if I'd    visited her and talked to her she might still be alive. Like I know logically that me telling her I love her wouldn't have made her get better but idk.

I just really want to die, I'm so tired and it's just not worth it. 

I'm sorry this isn't very coherent but it's 2:30am and tl;dr I want to fucking die and I'm just a worthless selfish piece of shit
