Her.I purely miss her I cannot get one minute of silence in my head, she is the air inside my lungs and she owns my heart. She was the taste of my toothbrush each morning and night I was there, she was the smile on my face, she made me complete. I don't want this to be a eulogy I just wish we could have worked things out and wish she didn't leave. It's been a year now and keep crying every single night and I'm only 18 years old. I am such a strong goodwill guy I like to believe I have had so many opportunities to move on or get a quick fuck but I can't I tried dating this girl I knew and everything we did together I pin pointed how much better it was with my ex and the worst part is I dream of her and me and think wow so it was all a dream and I'm so happy I wake up crying with joy and then realise that it's a reality and that were done this happens almost every night for the past year. I look to my side at night and see her silhouette she was a cute little snoring grumpy sook that always had two hands under her head layed on her side snoring and sometimes dribbling she was so beautiful long brown hair amazing body that was so comfortable to sleep on or hug up to she was so perfect her smile was so big and bright and it made her eyes squint and make her look Asian. With her little chubby cheeks you could just eat!! With a booty you could hold on to forever and everrr. she never trusted me and that hurt but I always reassuring that I loved her and only her but it never worked it became so bad she deleted anything that got in the way of us or anything that could threaten the relationship but I didn't care I loved every moment with her I gave her the world I am a good looking funny guy and I made sure she  knew she was my queen. I genuinely knew she was the one and is the one because not once did cheating come to mind not once did I get attracted to any other girl I just started at her missed out on every movie we watched didn't sleep I just felt like the luckiest man in the universe I felt truely happy with her and I know she's gone now but I'm so happy that I got to know her and be in her presence and I'm so happy she is someone I knew. It hurts because they day she left she got with another guy and Snapchat me him.and her fucking and i didn't understand I bought her Everything I made her laugh till she dribbled and snorted I always played with her siblings and helped her family with everything i only ever thought of my future with her and working till I drop to make her happy she was the type of girl to not even like presents she low-key loved them but didn't care if she got nothing she loved me and I know she did allot I guess one day her brain chemistry just changed and she said bye.  Now I put this on suicide watch because I want someone to her my story because Its to much I can't fight any longer I used to make fun and joke around about love and suicide with my immature mates but it's a reality for me now. Goodbye to whoever reads this and I hope you never have to experience this much pain.
