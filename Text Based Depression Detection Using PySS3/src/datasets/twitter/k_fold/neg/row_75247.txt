im so tiredim exhausted and alone all ive been able to think about the past few days is killing myself and i have noone i can ask for help anymore literally noone gives a shit about me i dont know why im even bothering. things are just getting worse and worse im going to end up fucking dead and noones even going to realize im gone. i dont even feel like i exist anymore. i havent been thinking about suicide this much in years but god im just fuckibg tired of not meaning anything to anyone. i dont have any friends and any time i try to make friends i end up putting forward more effort than the other person and i cant keep pushing myself when i can barely get myself out of bed and feed myself. i wish someone would break into our apartment and kill me to get it over with
