Coming up with a plan.Iâ€™m very tired of waking up everyday and feeling anxiety, feeling pain. Iâ€™m tired of not feeling fulfilled in life and suffering. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m going to come up with a plan for suicide that leaves me absolutely dead and gone. Iâ€™m going to take inventory of everything that is lethal around me, and pick the most lethal method to end my life, I donâ€™t want to come back. My psychiatrist mentioned that the medications I take at high doses could stop my respiratory system from working, I might just take both bottles before I go to bed. If that doesnâ€™t do it or I decide it may not work, then a high speed car accident is probably the way Iâ€™ll go. Iâ€™m headed to hell, and I belong there.
