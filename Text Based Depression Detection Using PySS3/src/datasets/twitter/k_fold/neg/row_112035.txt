Think it want to do it soonStuck still. Not doing shit with my life. Stuck on my ex who cheated on me. Stuck in a job that's  going nowhere. Plenty of women played me but yeah, that's the past. All my friends are these smart coders who will never have job issues in their lives. I got a BS communications degree but now I can't face people. I've tried music and drawing and im just fucking stuck on it too. How do you practice something like this everyday and not go anywhere! It's insane. 2 of my friends are excellent at that shit, have girlfriends, and they're not trying while im just staring at shit way too afraid to start doing anything important. Im wasting every day of my life and im just fucking weak because the majority of people can handle this shit. I do shit that doesn't matter. So I should just die. I don't understand women, people. I think life is more difficult for uglier and dumb people, which makes sense.
