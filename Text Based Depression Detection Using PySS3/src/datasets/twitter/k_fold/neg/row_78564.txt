HeyI don't know what to do, I'm currently at a club and a bit drunk too much so excuse my English, how do I escape these feeling. I don't want to kill myself but these feelings keep rising. I can't seem to fit anywhere, I wish someone would pay attention to me. Help me please I need some hope. I don't want to go home cause I will do something that I can't take back. is anyone here?
