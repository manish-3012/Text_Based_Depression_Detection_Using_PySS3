Killing myself todayGoodbye Reddit.

These past few months have been very hard, friends ditching me for other friends and not hanging with anyone for almost a year at this point... it drives one crazy. The I just blocked the girl I was talking with for two year, I just couldnâ€™t take the torture she was putting me through, you know?! She would say she used to like me but never said anything about her liking me now so that has driven me literally insane. She is now blocked I cannot take her bullshit. That has made me realize that no one gives a shit about me. Phones dry as hell and she was my last friend I guess... people only send streaks at me and thatâ€™s all they want from me... what have I done wrong?? Iâ€™ve tried so hard to be nice and make friends but that shit donâ€™t work so Iâ€™m just going to end it all, it seems so peaceful now... lying there with slit wrists (or pills havenâ€™t decided) as the time ticks down and then nothing... a calm peaceful nothing away from all these lying fake friend bastards. So I guess this is a goodbye post or what ever. Any recommendations on writs or pills? And before you say â€œdonâ€™t do it your life is worth livingâ€ just please stfu. I also in the past few months have tried to kill my cats multiple times, choking, chemical... etc. so no I donâ€™t deserve to live im a sad fatherless bastard. This account will be logged out of and forgotten after this post. Goodbye Reddit.
