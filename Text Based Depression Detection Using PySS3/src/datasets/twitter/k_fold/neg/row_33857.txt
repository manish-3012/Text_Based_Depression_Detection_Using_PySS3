I'm at school rn.Just made up my mind to do it. Gonna have one last weekend with my girlfriend and hang out one last time with my sister this week, and that's it. I'm done. My mother has been an abusive person for the last 12 years (I'm 17), and it has been getting worse and worse every day. 
Every day has been a little worse.
I've been carrying on empty and without any will to stay alive for a while. But now that's not enough, I just can't take it anymore.
The only way I could keep myself from doing it before and the only way I can pretend to be happy around people is by chainsmoking and getting myself drunk almost everyday.
I'm tired.
Just too fucking tired.
