Parents worked too hard to raise me.I really dislike writing this because I don't want to look like some attention hungry person but I'd like your thoughts. When I think about suicide I think about why I shouldn't do it and the reason I come up with is this. My parents had me when they were both 21. I'm sure I was an accident because both of my parents were poor and still are mostly. They were not prepared for me at all, at least that's what I think. When I look back at how hard it's been for them to raise me I get really sad. If I wasn't born they would've been able to enjoy their young lives but with me here I've costed them tons of money and time. If I killed myself now, all of that would've been waste. If I killed myself a huge portion of their life and time would be for no good reason. I think about it as if I were them. Would you want to put literally all of your money, love, and care into something and them be ungrateful enough for them to just kill themselves? For them to take what you did for granted and just go  like that? I would think no, no one would. It's just so sad. If I were never born they would've lived alright I think. Another thing is that I feel as if I know I will be dead by 30, I don't know why that is.
