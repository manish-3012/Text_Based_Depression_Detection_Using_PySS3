exhausted constantly thinking about deathfirst i wanna say i have no plan or intentions of hurting myself. since my last post here ive felt slightly better, but for the most part i still feel the same.

tldr for my previous posts -- february my partner of 2yrs broke up w/me, we reconnected in may and were friends, then he cut me off again for good in late june. another mutual friend since then has been ignoring me, and im still super close with and talk to 2 people that are also pretty good friends with him.

since this happened, ive pretry much closed in on myself -- completely abandoned posting on all social media except my private twitter account, and ive only stayed in contact with about 5 friends that im extremely close to. some acquaintances have tried to reach out to me but ive been scared to talk to them because im scared my ex friend is spreading rumors about me.

ive been feeling pretty hopeless for so long that im pretty desensitized to feeling that way. i have to constantly keep my mind distracted because if i dont, then ill start thinking about how shitty everything in my life has become and ill start thinking about death and suicidal ideation.

 m constantly anxious when i make plans to hang out with my friends that are also friends with him because ive been paranoid recently that my ex friend is trying to constantly make plans with them so they arent spending time with me (another mutual friend expressed that he implied not liking that his friends are also still friends with me, and that i was spending time with them)

i think about this a lot because even though i know itd make things worse and my family and friends would be sad, i know for a fact it would make my ex-partner-and-friend extremely happy. he called me an abuser to a mutual friend and was bitter/angry. im tired and exhausted and i know itd make him and the other friend rhats ignoring me super happy if i died, i think if i were to die in front of him in real life he would seriously laugh/celebrate.

again, i dont have a plan or intention, and im medicated and doing therapy 2x a week. im trying to take care of myself. but i still really wanna die and im really tired.

thanks for listening if you read all this, i really appreciate it. if you have any advice thats also appreciated, otherwise i just appreciate a lot you reading. thanks.
