I need to goI feel the need to die. Iâ€™ve been trying to make everything better so I wont have to do it but here I am. Iâ€™ve been telling myself that everythingâ€™s gonna be alright for anfew years now and it hasnâ€™t been better even a bit. Itâ€™s not going to be better anymore. Iâ€™m sorry for everyone whoâ€™s expecting me to be stronger; I tried. I canâ€™t do this anymore.
