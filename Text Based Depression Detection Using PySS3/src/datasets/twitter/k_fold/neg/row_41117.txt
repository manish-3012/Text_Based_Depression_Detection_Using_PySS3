I donâ€™t get itMy mom continues to get me help for my mental illnesses and seems to act concerned when in front of people
But when itâ€™s just us she yells and screams at me
Saying my life is too good to be feeling this way all the time and that all my issues were brought on by my own actions
I canâ€™t help but believe her more and more each time it happens 
God Iâ€™m so useless why do I do these things to myself
