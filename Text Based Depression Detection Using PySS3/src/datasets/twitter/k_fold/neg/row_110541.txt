Dear DyllanHey Dyllan, I hope your doing well where ever you are. Sorry I couldn't visit you, or at least give you a phone call before you died. I never understood why you took your own life until i became suicidal myself. I used to cry every time i thought of you, but now i just smile because i know you're happy and free from this god awful world. Hope to see you soon..â¤
