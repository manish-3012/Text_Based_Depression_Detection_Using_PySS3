I'm not actually going to do it, but it sounds so tempting.Fuck it, I won't use a throwaway.  It's not like my feelings are a secret.

I'm a high school senior and I've been depressed since I was a kid.  I have no idea what I want to do with my life and I have no motivation for anything.  I feel like my friends and SO would just be better off without me around, as I'm just a burden.  Essentially, I feel like I have no options for my future, and nobody wants me around anyway.  Logically I know that I don't have to choose my whole future now and that I'm allowed to not know everything, and that at least a few people are happy that I'm alive, but I have a lot of trouble convincing myself of this.  My logical parts are telling me that killing myself would be a dumb idea and that I shouldn't do it, but my emotions see it as the only option unless I want to stay miserable.  I'm listening to my logical parts, and they are winning this battle and hopefully will continue until I can get on antidepressants.  

I guess I'm kind of venting but words of support would be cool, too.
