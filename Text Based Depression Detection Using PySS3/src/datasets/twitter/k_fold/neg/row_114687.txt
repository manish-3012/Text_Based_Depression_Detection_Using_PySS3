Just dying, not suicideI've seen the impact that suicide has on friends and family. It seems inherently selfish. Choosing to end one's life regardless of the impact it would have on those who care about you. In many ways, seeing how the intentional deaths of others have affected those I've known and cared for have had a lot to do with why I haven't followed suit.
That being said, if my early death were the result of some tragic accident, and not an obviously pre-planned decision, that seems somehow less traumatic for those I would leave behind.  I can honestly say that this thought process has lead to more careless decisions: Wreckless driving, ignoring medication, excessive drinking. Usually ending the evening secretly hoping that I do not wake in the morning. Then falling asleep envisioning the scenario in a few days time when someone discovers my corpse.
I don't want to subject my family to my suicide, but I don't want to keep going. What do I do?
