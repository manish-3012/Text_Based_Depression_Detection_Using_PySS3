Obsessing about insultsI fucked myself up the past year. I quit smoking cigarettes and spliffs (weed). After that I got obsessive thoughts about dying of lung cancer. I smoked way too much. Like 5+ spliffs and a pack of cigarettes per day. After I quit 1.5 yrs ago, I first started working out 5 times per week and got an extremely healthy diet. After that I started tripping about my unhealthy past. I would just be completely defeated and constantly worry about it. I can remember myself laying in bed and thinking that it's over for me. This went on for months.

Out of desperation I cried to my ex about how I'm going to die. I provoked her and she destroyed me with an extremely harsh message that kept repeating in my head for 5 months and making me feel miserable. It's so bad. I'm sitting in the gym sometimes and then I feel like shit because it overwhelms me again. It was such a cruel and horrible message.. It's insane. 

I go to bed with a headache everyday. I want to blow my brains out to get some peace sometimes. I'm only 28 and thinking about death all the time.
