How to cope with this feeling?I'm 6 weeks pregnant. Have 2 beautiful kids, a home and a loving husband. A good job (although can be stressful but I don't mind too much). 

For years I've struggled with depression and anxiety and panic attacks. It's been good last few years thanks to the medication I've been taking. Until today. 

We had a small argument with my husband (this is very rare we hardly argue). And he raised his voice at me saying something like "this is why nobody likes you". And I just broke. Haven't been able to stop crying. I've been cutting myself. It's very obvious and it's summer here so that means I'll have to wear jacket everywhere now. I haven't done this for awhile and now I'm scarred my doctor will put me into mental facility if they see it. 

My husband is not talking to me. I'm just here crying and my arm hurts from the cuts. I don't want to die but I feel like from years of my past it's now coming back. That feeling. The need to hurt myself to cope with the pain. Is there any other way to cope? How do you guys deal with it?
