I failed suicide when took 100x500mg of analginIt was half an hour ago. Nothing happened. I didn't even feel bad. Just a little bit sick now. Didn't even think about "my friends and family", just felt disappointment.
Idk what to do. I can call ambulance but they'd expect that I want them to help we when I don't.
I feel kinda weird, I poisoned myself and literally nothing happened. Why nobody ever warns about this
