I don't care anymore.In college age 20/21 male.

I lost my will to live a few years ago and have just been on autopilot since then. I've forgotten about being happy. My childhood was good and everything but my family relocated about 5 years back and since then my depression started. Maybe it was the lack of friends or my jealousy of everyone else looking happy, i just started hating life. Since then nothing is going my way and I just don't see my future, I don't see me living a few years from now its weird. Life has constantly shit on me and I always accepted my fate in which i will never be happy. I'm unlucky i get it, but i was able to move past that and live. I realized that i've lived for 20 years and cant remember me being happy. I've done nothing wrong in my life, why do i deserve any of this. I lost a parent few years back, i can't make friends because im not social, i've always been single, which is embarrassing for me, i'm not smart, even though i spend so much time trying to study. My grades are bad and can't bring them up. The list goes on and on. Regardless i lived with it. 

In the past few weeks i made the decision that its time to end it. Its gone to the point where my nightmares are dreams of me being happy, because when i wake up i realize its not true. I constantly think about how to end it. Its just too much. I accepted that maybe i was unlucky and my life is just shit. I can go on hating myself or just end it. I'll feel really bad for my family but its not their life its mine. 

Not sure why im even posting maybe me venting just makes it a little better.
