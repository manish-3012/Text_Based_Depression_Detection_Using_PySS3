I don't want to go to university (or maybe live in general).I live in ukraine, and I am assigned male at birth, which means I have to go to university, or else I will be drafted to the army. (btw I am a trans girl).

I have a one-year ineligibility because of my mental condition, but the people in commission still want it reconsidered after the so-called "one-year". And my mom relies on me going to university. I have no idea what happens after that year runs out, but university should protect me from draft. I will be "pursuing" an astronomy degree, because astronomy is the only thing in my life I can do without making it seem like boring school.

Thing is, I want to be a make-up artist and a singer. I want to be a sensitive person.

I am not exactly suicidal in emotional sense, but I have a screen in front of me which says 

&gt;"You have played the free trial version of *Life* and now you have to buy the full version.   
&gt;  
&gt;Yes        No  
&gt;  
&gt;Pressing "Yes" will require you to comply with your assigned birth gender until the government of your country will allow you to change, with all adult responsiblities remaning. Pressing "No" will require you to be seen as a suicidal person and invoke large amounts of emotion from people, and you will still be buried as your assigned birth gender as a cute boy who cried and died.

Honestly, even if I was born in a Soviet era, and had a choice of gender, I would choose to be biologically female. I can always just be a housewife. But men were and still are forced to give up their lives for whatever bullshit reason government creates.

Advice?
