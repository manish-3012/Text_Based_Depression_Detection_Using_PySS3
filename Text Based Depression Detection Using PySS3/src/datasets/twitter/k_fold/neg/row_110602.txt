If there just would be an easy way...Iâ€™m living my life in depression, only living from day to day.... I would love to be able to finally end this shit, but it seems like thereâ€™s no way of dealing with it in a manner that would be reliable enough. Iâ€™m at the point where Iâ€™m just annoyed every single time I wake up, to find myself being alive. Iâ€™m already dealing with it by being drunk or high 24/7 and reduced eating to a minimum and maybe, hopefully, by living like this I will find peace in a death that comes as early as possible.
