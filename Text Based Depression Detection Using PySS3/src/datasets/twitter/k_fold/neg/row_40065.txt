Ending it any day nowI guess most would look at what I've got and say I should be thankful. I'm not. I'd burn down my house, blow up my car and tell my friends and family to fuck off if it could bring me anything other than the emptiness I've felt for months now. I think it's always been there, I've just been able to ignore it. I'm all alone, even when I'm around other people who care about me, I'm all alone. Only one person ive ever bared my soul to, and all they did was laugh and tell me we could still be friends. I can't even bring myself to eat. Nothing gives me joy. Nothing gives me sadness. My bags are packed, so to speak. Already have the final letters written and stuffed into labelled envelopes. I gave all my video game shit to the neighbor kid. Yesterday I held the gun to my temple, hammer cocked. The only thing keeping me from doing it was how I imagined my mother would feel when the police showed up to tell her that her son blew his brains out all over the basement. And that will probably stop me again tonight, maybe tomorrow, but I doubt it will see me through next week.
