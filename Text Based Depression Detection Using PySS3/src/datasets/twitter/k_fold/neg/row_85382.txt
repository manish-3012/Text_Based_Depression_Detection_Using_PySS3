Coming to termsI think I've come to terms with the awful things I've done. I know people will be sad but they will understand. I wish my dreams and goals were simple stuff I could see but instead the dreamers always get trampled on in this world but worst of all it's my fault. I sound so fucking pathetic even when i type this. It's my birthday soon and turning off any where that its posted means 1 person messaged me. But they are one of the people who would understand. Gonna figure out how to do it right so it's not a burden like I've always been. I know theres alot of lonely souls out there and that gives me comfort knowing if theres something more to all this i wont be alone. I'm sorry to everyone who believed in me or whose times I've wasted. Sorry to people whose opportunities I took away. I'm sorry to mom and dad. But they've lived a whole lifetime before me so I'm sure they can figure it out after. There just isnt room for a weirdo like me. I could get even more stupid and edgy than I already have but it just doesnt matter.

Thanks and sorry if you read this. Maybe on the next time around we can enjoy it all more.
