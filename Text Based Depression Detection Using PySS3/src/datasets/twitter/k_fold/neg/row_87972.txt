oh, to feel alive.i always look back to a few weeks ago. i had gotten out of basketball practice, coach made us run so much i literally could not feel my face. at rehearsal my director made me sing way out of my range, so my vocal cords were on fire. i was physically shot, but i felt alive. and that made me feel better than usual. i got home, exhausted. i did my work, and then i was left by myself. tired in every way, but it was the best i had felt in a while. then without a distraction, all i have is my thoughts. i rethink the day, cringe at all the shit i wish i hadnâ€™t said or done. i think about the state of my life. cry. be embarrassed iâ€™ve been crying so much. have the urge to bash my head into the wall until i lose so many brain cells i canâ€™t think straight. avoid doing things like that by laying down, i put on music and try to think of anything other than how much i despise myself. how pathetic my existence has become. ultimately think about it, try not to cry again. distract myself with a book or tv show until i pass out. then i wake up and am off to school. to do it again. for no reason. i just keep living through these days without substance for no reason. i wish i had the strength to go through with it. i really have a lot of options open to me, but just canâ€™t fucking do it.


because iâ€™m a pussy. iâ€™ve always been too much of a bitch for my own good. if i could just press a button to end me, i would.
