Life...or notI have been through some very rough times.  The latest is that I have been made redundant and without a job I face bankruptcy and the loss of my home that I shared with my late husband for 25 years.  No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, it seems that the universe/fate/god (if you believe in one, I don't) has it in for me.  

I have a (divorced) step-daughter and grandchildren, who love me.  So far, that has kept me going but financially they would be better off if I died now, rather than living off my savings.  My step-daughter relies on benefits and wouldn't have to if I died.  They could either move into my house and repay their own mortgage or sell it and live in their own home more comfortably, having repaid the debts that are weighing on me so heavily. 

Honestly, I am so tired of trying to live a decent life.  It seems that all of us 'little people' cannot get ahead, no matter how hard we work to do so.   I am tired of being the  Minion.  I am tired of trying to do 'the right thing'.     I am tired of trying to battle against the odds.       I am tired of life.

When do I get to resign?  What more do I have to do?   Can I die now?
