At 23 I'm a complete failure to myself, friends and familyTo start out I'm trans (mtf) and I initially went away from home because my parents seemed and were transphobic and I wasn't going to school. This lead me across the country and I started HRT which was great but my hormones ran out. I did resolve many of my issues with my parents including school but my parents still do not fully accept that I'm trans and it's tearing them apart. Parts of me feel really bad but it's still something I can't help. 

The complete failure aspect includes me never holding a job, dropping out of the military and dropping out of school. Why can't I hold onto something? Get something stable in life? Because I'm a complete idiot. I can barely tie my shoes for fucks sake. Yes I'm most likely autistic or something or a neurovariant but it's hard to get diagnosed when you're semi homeless and living on someones couch.

I tried applying at this local LGBT counseling service a week ago but they haven't contacted me back despite calling them again. I guess they don't are about me because I'm new here.

My horrible self esteem probably comes from being trans and being molested at an early age (something which I never got proper help with).

I'm just a train wreck and a mess. No point in living when I'm essentially a freak.
