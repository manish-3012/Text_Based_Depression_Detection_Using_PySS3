Can't believe this is happening to meI was one of those people who never could understand how an individual got to this depressed of a state of mind... until now. My ex provokes me to kill myself, telling me to do it and he doesn't care. I am mindblown that someone could be that heartless to someone.  Furthermore, I have been absolutely torturted by this girl. Calling me disgusting names, threatening me, and having others harass me. I have the proof, but nothing makes any difference. It is sick. My back is against the wall and I feel helpless. I am absolutely sickened of how I am being treated, like a bag of absolute trash. I hate when people state this mindset is for attention. I really never saw myself ever posting to this type of board to random strangers or being in this mindset.
