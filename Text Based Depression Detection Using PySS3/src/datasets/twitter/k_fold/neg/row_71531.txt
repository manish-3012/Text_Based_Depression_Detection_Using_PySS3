GoodbyeIt seems it has all come to a head, the tempest in my mind has reach full speed, and nothing has changed for the better, so i have finally found the strength to lift the axe again in hopes of death, I'm sitting here with it on my lap, writing this message to say, thank you all who attempted making my final days happy, i appreciate it. Thank you for your time and goodbye, hopefully for good
