I just keep hurting people.I'm 26, and I feel like I have been a failure at the things I have done in life. I have never achieved anything I can be proud of, and have taken many years to get to the lowly spot I am at today. I just want to give all I can to make other people happy and live better lives, I volunteer and am a pre-service teacher, but all I do is hurt those around me who I love, my friends and family. My best friend told me that I make them feel really awful at times, that I'm condescending and make them feel worthless, and that I can only focus on myself. I think they are right. I can't keep hurting those I care about, and I feel that the only way I can spare everyone from being hurt more by me in the long run is by getting it out of the wayl and killing myself.

I don't know when, and I don't know how, but I cannot keep doing this. I have made a note to keep on me just in case I do it so that others will know why, and to apologise to whoever finds my body.
