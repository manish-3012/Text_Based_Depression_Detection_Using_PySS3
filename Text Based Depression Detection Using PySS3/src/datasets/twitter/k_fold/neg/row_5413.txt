I'm tired.I'm 28 and I've been depressed for almost 15 years. I'm just really fucking tired. I feel empty all the time and it feels like rest and fun do nothing for me. I feel distant from every aspect of my life and every single person, place, and thing I encounter is just a bundle of frustration and self-hate waiting to be opened.

I don't want to die so much as I don't want to live. The only way I've kept going, as sad as it is to say, is by ignoring my responsibilities, disassociating, and playing way too many video games for my own good.

I just don't want to do anything. I just want to lie down in some tall grass and wait for them to find my body.
