My own mind is driving me over the edgeHi.... I'm 25.... I have social anxiety... No job.... Few friends... And I'm my own worst enemy. You know those easy things that you do and think nothing of on a day to day basis? things like, going shopping, getting on a bus, or walking down the street. Well those are challenging for me. The sad part is I've probably spent more time reading and researching this disorder than a therapist has and I know exactly what to do to overcome this. In fact, I made big progress, but I'm tired of waking up every day and having a war with my own thoughts (which is actually something that I shouldn't be doing, acceptance and focusing on something else are the key). My family and friends just think I'm lazy and unmotivated because I don't do anything. I wish this were true, being lazy and unmotivated are far better than having SA.

I can't deal with this anymore, it's becoming very overwhelming. When I look at myself I see wasted potential. I have so many irrational fears and although I know they're 100% irrational and false they've been conditioned into my brain over so many years that it becomes an automatic way of thinking. Point is I cannot deal with this anymore, it's really emotionally devastating. I feel like I'm under house arrest most of the time. I'm just coming here to get this off my chest. I really feel like letting everything go.
