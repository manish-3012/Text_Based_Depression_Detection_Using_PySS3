One yearHi everyone, I've been a fan of Reddit for a while, but this is my first day as a poster so be gentle. I've been severely depressed as long as I can remember. I can't really pinpoint a time I was ever not depressed. It's steadily worsened over the months, years, decades. I tried a few medications, at best they zombified me, at worst they brought me even lower, but not one helped. I saw a counselor in high school so they wouldn't expel me for fighting, and after two sessions he decided I was a well-adjusted kid. I've been self-medicating and getting by on sheer stubbornness since, but I'm 26 now and I can't keep that up forever. So, here we are. Next year I'll finally have insurance that covers mental healthcare. I'm giving myself until the end of next year with access to treatment to show some improvement, anything, anything at all that might let me hope for a future. If I don't, I will roll over, accept my situation as terminal, find a nice quiet motel room in another state where no one will recognize me, burn my ID, and end it in the quickest, most painless way possible. Last call for Ray. I don't know why I'm bothering to tell you guys this, except that I'm a fucking loser that has to resort to random strangers on the internet to listen to his problems. Either way, thanks for listening. I hope you all have a merry Christmas or whatever else you might celebrate.
