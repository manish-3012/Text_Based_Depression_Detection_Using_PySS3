I just can't.A girl I(M) liked but decided not to pursue became bitter and turned all my friends in college against me. One day they just stopped talking to me. These were people I really caredl about. I've no idea what she told them and while trying to keep my head up and not get involved in gossip it's crushed me. I woke up last Monday in the midst of a panic attack and it hasn't ended since. I've lost a stone and a half in a month. I've no one to confide this torment in. I'm stuck living at home with an emotionally abusive mother. I've reached my limit. I don't want to die but I can't bear this constant pain anymore. I can't even cry about it because I'm emotionally stunted, so all those emotions just hang and swirl until the pain is everywhere.
