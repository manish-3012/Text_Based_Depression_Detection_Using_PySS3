I know no one will care, but I am so alone.Coworkers taught me how to hate myself, and now I'm stuck in a loop - can't find a single person I can have a regular conversation with, and it hurts more each time I try. My boss lied to me about basically a promotion, and led me on for two years, and now he just avoids me. I've never easily fit in, and now I don't fit in at all. I can't accept that I'll always be alone, but there's nothing else I can do.
