I need help to keep goingIt's currently 3am where I live, and I'm just sitting here in my best friend's couch while she's alseep, and I don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore. 
I'm currently on a waiting list for being hospitalised in a mental health clinic. It's been three weeks, and I'm getting at the end of my rope. And I've planned this hospitalisation, because I do wanna get better, I really do. But it's getting so hard not to do anything stupid. My mind keeps sending me suicidal thoughts on how I should permanently numb myself with xanax (which is my prescribed medicine). I'm really trying, but I feel that I'm becoming less of myself everyday, I can't even take proper care of myself anymore, or anything really. I know I'm really sick and I need help, but I can't have it right now, so I just have to wait. But everyday the thoughts keep getting stronger and I'm afraid I can't hold on much longer, I don't know what to do. I would like to go out and do stuff to distract myself like go to the movie or stuff but I don't have the money for it and most of the time, not the energy either.
I need distractions, something to help me keep going until I can get medically supervised, but I don't know what. Plus it's getting more and more complicated to feel happiness, or to enjoy things I usually appreciate. I feel absolutely numb. And I know how a suicide attempt goes, I've unsuccessfully tried 5 times before, and I don't want to get to that point again. If you have any ideas, distractions, or anything really that could help during that lapse of time, that would be awesome. Thank you for reading me.
