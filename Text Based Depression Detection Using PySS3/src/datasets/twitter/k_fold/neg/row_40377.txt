I kept imagining about ending my life for the past 3 monthsEvery. Single. Day before i sleep i always imagining different ways i could kill myself and hurted everyone around me, i donâ€™t even know if this is a bad thing or a good thing since just picturing my friends and my mom (who is not perfect in anyway but keeps on trying her best to raise me) cry and gets traumatized really does makes me feel bad and also make me feels like a terrible piece of shit who only cares about myself, i donâ€™t think my life wouldâ€™ve gotten better but i donâ€™t really wanâ€™t to traumatize all these kind and wonderful people around me.

(Also sorry if what iâ€™ve just said didnâ€™t make any sense, english is my third language so im obviously not very good at it)
