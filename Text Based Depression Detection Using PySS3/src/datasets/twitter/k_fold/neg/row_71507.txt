First time...dunno what I want.I felt empty since 17. It's been a long time since then. I can't keep a job or woman after she left. I was left by my fiance when I was 19. I cant tell too much. I went to school, it sucks. Should have done maths Like I planned. Pli Sci stupid, I geuss I wanted to change the world cuz I was in the military. I was wrong. Now I'm a teller at bank. I can do maths but no one cares.

oh also I have medical bills lol; I got genetic heart disease 2 years ago. It could kill me anytime. YAY.
