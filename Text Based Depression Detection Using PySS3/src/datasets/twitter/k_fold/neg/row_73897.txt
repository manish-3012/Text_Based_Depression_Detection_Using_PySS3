Why do I hate myself so damn muchI (17M) feel like everything I do makes me look like a total ass. I've thought about suicide a lot in the last 6 or so years of my life, especially at this point in time. I got a school "counselor" but I only see them once a week. It's hard for me to talk the truth with other people and when I do try to talk about something, all I get in response is shit for some little thing I said. I've tried pushing through high school, but what the hell am I going to afterwards? I have very little motivation to do anything at all, and have no will to do anything. I feel like if I wasn't ever born my family wouldn't even be the way it is now. My mom could be having a happy successful life somewhere else, Dad could've been a successful car business owner, and well my sister wouldn't exist either. It sometimes feels like the only reason my dad is actually raising us is out of pity for my mom. Being in school feels like I'm wearing a fake mask to cover my shitty personality, I don't feel up to par with anything else. I hate the mindset that I learned from my dad at a young age, I feel worthless and family relations feel really stressed. Mom and Dad can put on a pretty show for me and my sister, but I know what's happened behind the scenes. Why do I have to be such a pushover and have a pathetic, and piece of shit mindset. If someone asked me "what do I hate the most" first thing that would come to mind would be myself, but I would never tell them that, would say something along the lines of "nothing really comes to my mind at this exact moment" kind of shit. I've tried to use the hate of my self as fuel to change myself, but in the end, ended up hating myself more. I'm so sick and tired of hearing "Oh I'm sorry to hear that, its going to get better" ok then if so when, I may LOOK like I'm probably dreading what kind of jackass ill make myself look like in the next sentence I say.
