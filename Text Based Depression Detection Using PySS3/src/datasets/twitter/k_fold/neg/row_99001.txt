I am so sadAbout two weeks ago me and my gf had a fight about her wanting to see other people while dating me and after a ling discussion of me being comfortable with her having intercourse with other people but not â€œpolyâ€ relationship she left. She blocked me on everything, then a week later sent me a email saying she had moved away and wont be back for a very long time. I have no idea where she is and it all happened over night. It was a two year relationship and i am so lost and feel alone. She was the ONLY person i had. Now Iâ€™m about to be homeless due to other reasons and i feel even more alone. I donâ€™t know what to do.
