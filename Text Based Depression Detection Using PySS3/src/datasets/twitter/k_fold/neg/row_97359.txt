Can anyone just encourage me?I don't even know why I'm here. I guess I'm just sorta depressed. I'm trying to wean off of depression medication, but no one ever told me how to do that properly and the two doctors that I've been to don't know how medications work apparently. I think it's really affecting the way that I think, because I read a lot online about Pristiq (25mg) and it seems like a lot of people have trouble going off of it. 

I live with my mom (dad's dead) and am going off to college in a couple of days. My moods have changed for the worst: I get irritated very easily and am very depressed at times (once or twice a week), although for the last week I really haven't been doing too well. I feel bad about the way I talk to her. She tries and offers suggestions to help me, but all I ever do is get upset at her. 

It started out this week with a loneliness stage. I don't have too many friends, basically just one or two and they both have girlfriends. We went to a ballgame and I felt like shit because I was alone. The girlfriends don't hang out with us normally, but it sort of got me in that depressive state of mind where I started envying them for having something that I don't have. 

And today, I just found out that I subscribed to a newspaper and didn't cancel, now I have to pay 250$ because of my own stupidity. I have the money to pay for it, but that's a fuckton of money for a retarded mistake. I just get so frustrated and down on myself; it's really all I can think about at the moment. I always beat myself up for things that I do, whether it not be doing better in school, or making a stupid mistake. I'm never really satisfied at all; regardless of how well I do on something, I'll always think about how I could have been doing better. 

I'm well aware that I'm a privileged piece of shit, richer than 99% of the world, but I'm just not sure if I can ever be happy. That's my greatest goal in life, to be happy, and I'm not sure how to get to that point. 

I'm not suicidal at the moment. Even when I am I would never do it. Perhaps it's just self-pity. But I just wanted to tell someone, because my mom's had enough of talking to me and I doubt my friends would understand. Thanks.
