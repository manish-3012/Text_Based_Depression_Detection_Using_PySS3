I have enough money saved for about a year, so about a year of life left.I've just started a new job, sadly it seems like the same kind of drudgery I've been doing for the past 5 years.

I have been unemployed June to September for the first time in years and looking back at it it was the first period in a decade when I didn't think about ending it all every week.  
Since I don't have any other skills to sell (and even then I'm starting to resent having to sell 5/7 of my time) and I'll be turning 30 next year (also no relationship) I just don't see a way out.

Might as well enjoy a year and then end it.
