partner left me; dont feel okayOver the past few years I've been going to a counselor to talk about issues I've had with gender identity, namely that I've been wanting to transition since I was very little ~9 or 10 (now 22). Weve been discussing options and talking through all of them and I decided to tell my NB partner of 6 married years (who fully understands this process, being biologically female but identifying as nonbinary and has heard about my own problems before) that i was getting serious about transitioning. I thought I was safe because they are actively considering top surgery as well as changing their name, etc.
They broke up with me point blank because they were so disgusted with the idea of dating a man that they couldn't handle it, just too gay for me. Despite them being asexual, never seeing my genitals and probably never would after the transition (not that that much changes down there?). 
I respect their choice, I understand they have all their own right to taste and preference and all that but I just feel like I'm at a loss.  I know I can't get them back and I will respect the choices they made, but I feel like at this point going through with this without support isnt an option, and not going through with it will render me miserable and I still wont have this one person that made my life bearable. I was hopelessly in love. I've already hurt the relationship too badly. 
I've been mulling it over for a few days, and amoung other mental and physical disabilities that made me give up my dream career, no family to speak of, and no friends besides shared ones with my spouse that I feel weird making take sides, I don't think theres much left going for me. 

I don't know where to turn. Why did I destroy my life like this. I was happy enough. Now theres no saving it.
