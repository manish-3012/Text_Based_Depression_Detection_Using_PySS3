sometimes i wish i had the strength to just end my lifei keep telling myself to stay alive because i donâ€™t want to make anyone upset.

my boyfriend of over a year dumped me. my best friend in the entire world gets annoyed with me at the drop of a hat. my art teacher who is so important to me just sees me as a lazy, burnout failure. my sister is more successful than me, a 17 year old, at age 14. all i do is guilt trip my mom apparently, cost my family money, and make their lives a living hell. iâ€™m fat, iâ€™m ugly, iâ€™m stupid, and im shit at the things i love to do.

so the only reason i am still alive is because i am a coward. i cannot find the strength to do the world a favor and just end myself. even though i fantasize about a world without me, i cant bring myself to kill myself. i canâ€™t even hurt myself, iâ€™m that much of a coward. 

i donâ€™t think that i should have been born.
