I doubt I'm going to last longer than a few more days.I keep going over my plan in my head. I was even playing with the moving parts of my method to make sure I knew exactly how to use it a bit ago. I keep it on my dresser near my bed and I'll only need about 30 seconds of confidence in wanting to end it right then in order to finally be at peace.

I've already reached out to people in real life in what ways I'm willing to. I don't want anyone's help. It was more just to see if anyone actually wants or needs me around. People will be okay without me. It'll probably be weeks before anyone even notices I'm gone.

I think I'm going to die in my bathtub, so that way any mess I leave will be easier to clean up. If I plan ahead enough, I'll try to be fasting too, so maybe I won't shit myself.

I've always had poor mental health. I can remember having panic attacks as early as age 4. I've been anhedonic for as long as I can remember too. It's hard to keep everything from feeling negative if winning doesn't make you feel good, losing sucks, and trying at all makes you anxious. Most of my life has just been focused on avoiding things that make me feel bad.

Logically, it seems like the right choice for me. I'm not really scared of dying either. A few years back I followed some online instructions for what to overdose on to humanely kill myself and I just shut my eyes and tried to just drift off to sleep after taking the stuff. I was at peace with it. I was surprised when it didn't work. Sometimes I think that maybe it did and I'm in some kind of hell or limbo like place.

I don't know why I'm posting here. Maybe it's just so I won't feel too much like I'll be completely alone when I die if I write down some of my thoughts and reasonings.

It's probably not worth your time to reply to this. I'm usually pretty avoidant when it comes to talking to people, so you'll probably just feel bad and frustrated if you try.
