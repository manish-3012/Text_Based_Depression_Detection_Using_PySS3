It feels like everything in my life is caving in, and I can't handle it much more...Started with losing a job last summer, and needing to go on EI to keep bills paid.  A couple of months later I have my relationship fall apart on me, as well as finding out she cheated on me.  Since we were living together and I was basically broke, I had no choice but to return to my parents basement.  I later find a new job but then learn I was hired only part time, so I struggle to make ends meet even living rent-free.  I apply for numerous jobs and hear nothing anywhere.  I am on a few dating websites and I am getting ignored and even blocked by almost everyone.  I also found out I OWE almost $1000 this tax season.  Now to top it all off, that ex I broke up with moved several hundred kilometers away and just started a brand new relationship today.

I feel like I am being beaten down with no end in sight, and rock bottom never actually being rock bottom.  I feel trapped, overwhelmed, alone and unwanted as I work a crappy paying job, stuck with bills and debt, and no woman seems at all interested in even acknowledging my existence, all while I live in my parents basement.  I feel like I'm nothing but a burden and annoyance to everyone, and the justifications I keep trying to tell myself to keep going in life start to ring more and more hollow.  Why should I even bother anymore?  What is the point in continuing when it feels like me being happy has offended the grand scheme of things, and has decided to punish me by ruining absolutely everything in my life?

I just don't know anymore...I am so tired of being destroyed by everything...I just want to give up.
