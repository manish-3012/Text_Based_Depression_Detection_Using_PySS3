I don't have the resources to commit suicide, but I think about it constantly and I kind of wish I could. I'm only 14.I'm going into my freshman year. There is nothing I like about myself. I'm abnormally short, only 5'3" and was an early bloomer when it came to puberty. My dad is barely 5'6", and his dad before him, my mom is 5'2", so I have no hope of reaching an acceptable height. I'm not attractive. Too short, too pale, bad teeth, I have a huge nose, and my face is covered with acne. I probably don't look quite as bad as I make myself out to be, but I'm not a handsome guy by any means. I also have these crazy hair genes from my dads side, and at 14 I can grow a legitimate goatee, and I have little hairs all over my face, and hair covering my arms, legs, and everywhere else.

I have a couple friends, but I moved away from my hometown where all of my greatest friends were, to the west coast where I'm in a much smaller school that just doesn't have people with any of the same interests as me. I have no drive at all to get out of bed in the morning to go to school, I want to stay home and wallow in self pity in front of the computer. That's all I know how to do. I faked being sick in order to not go to the first cross country practice today. I don't normally consider myself a lazy guy, I just didn't want to see the people there. Or more so I didn't want them to see me. All I want in life is to be liked, to be loved, to be desired. I'm too shy and unconfident to be liked, and too short and unattractive to be loved and desired. 

My parents don't understand me. Well, I love my dad so much and respect him more than anyone, and I know he would understand me. He knows how sad I am, he can tell. He tries to be nice to me, and he always tries to talk to me but I can never find it in me to tell him anything. My mom on the other had has no clue what I'm going through. She yells at me instead of talking, when I'm on the verge of tears, sitting in my room and staring out the window and she calls me to eat dinner, she thinks that I don't respond sometimes out of disrespect and not because I'm so terribly depressed. She grounded me from computer for 3 days just because I left my lunch at home. It's not that hard to do when you have so much else on your mind. And she's the one that's home all the time, my dad's always away or he get's home too late.

Please help. I don't remember what true happiness is like. I want to be able to live my goals, reach my dreams. I want to have a good job, a good and preferably decent looking wife and a family. I want to be liked, I want to have a lot of friends, I want girls to look at me and not immediately pass me off because I'm shorter than them and I'm not that good looking. I want all of these things but I can't have them. I think I've stopped smiling for good. At least as long as it's not faked. I like the prospect of suicide, not having to deal with the grief anymore. That's all I have to say.... just.... I have no will to live. I thought that maybe you guys might have something to say.
