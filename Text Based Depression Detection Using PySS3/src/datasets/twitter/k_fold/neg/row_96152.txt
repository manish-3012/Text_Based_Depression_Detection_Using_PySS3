Where to tie my noose - a dilemmaI have red rope sitting in my medicine cabinet so I can tie a noose with which to hang myself.

The dilemma is whereabouts do I tie up the noose? Do I try hanging it from the shower rod, to the bathroom door, or do I venture out into the city and find a tree in a secluded spot upon which to hang it?

The goal is to die by suspension hanging. I just don't know if it will be at my apartment, or if I'll push myself to go do it near a trail somewhere.

I feel like my suicide is inevitable. I have too much guilt and shame to carry, and the burden is really weighing me down.

Otherwise, I may end up giving into my homicidal tendencies and going out by suicide by cop. But there are too many variables with that, so hanging seems better.
