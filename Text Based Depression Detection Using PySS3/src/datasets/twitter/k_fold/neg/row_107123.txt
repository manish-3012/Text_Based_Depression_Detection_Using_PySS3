I want to do it.I've posted here before, not sure if I was ready. I feel like I am. Everything feels hopeless and my boyfriend - the last thread keeping me holding on - is pulling away increasingly. I can't figure out if I want to make an attempt or a gesture; I just know I want to try. I know that overdoses are not usually successful and are pretty risky for a gesture. But I keep thinking about the gun I have access to. I don't know what to do but I just know I want to give up. Or at least make people understand how little desire I have left to be here.
