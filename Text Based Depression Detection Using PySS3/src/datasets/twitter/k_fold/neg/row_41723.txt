Pictures at the mallIâ€™ve realized that I want to take some portraits at the mall for the purpose of an obituary. A nice headshot that looks like me, so my loved ones wonâ€™t have to search for one. Iâ€™m 32 and Iâ€™ve had more and more progressively vivid and harmful thoughts. They wonâ€™t abate, and I just want to prepare.
