My tine here is done.Im planning it all out.

December 31st I disappear. I give all of my stuff away. Donate my guitars to kids who will use it. Donate my clothes to people who need it. My bed can go to a shelter. My car can go to the family who needs it. My bedding to the shelter. Video games and electronics to boys and girls club or maybe YMCA. Pictures to my friend's. Except a couple that I'll have with me when I end it. My organs can go to someone who needs it. Maybe they'll get better use of my heart than I did. I'll have to plan it so I'll be near the hospital so I don't die and they won't be of use or something.

My letters are all but wrote. The last goodbyes. 

Meds don't work. Therapy doesn't work. I've tried everything and I'm still cursed with this disorder and condition.  I can't escape so it's not temporary. It's permanent.

So I'm making a permanent solution to a permanent problem.

Not a cry for help. 

I've even figured out how much it would all cost. 500 bucks. Not too shabby.

Last meal will be what I want. Last drink will be what I want. Last everything, I will finally be selfish for once in my life and take my life into my hands and control. I've never felt in control.

I just wish there was another way sometimes but I can't anymore. Reality is bleak and everything hurts everyday. I'm so tired.

I hope the end is painless.

You got me for 24 days. If you need to vent or talk to me send me a line. Just because I'm a piece of shit doesn't mean I won't try to help as many as I can before I go.

Bye.
