Question about ideation and medical symptomsHi all, 

I don't know if my comment is appropriate to this sub, so please let me know if not.

I have a question about the relationship between ideation and headaches. I get bad headaches semi-regularly, usually caused by stress or not eating enough. During these moments, my mood gets very low and I always feel hopeless and start having suicidal thoughts. It is very, very dark.

I am able to manage them by telling myself that my mind is playing tricks on me and that I will feel better when the headaches go away (I always do). But today I couldn't. I have had a series of other stressor and uncertainties in my life, and mourning the decline of a very significant relationship. So today when I got one of these headaches, I was already low and no amount of self-talk was working. I had thoughts and a plan and continued to think about it all day. It was not vague although nothing was imminent.

This is scary and I don't know why it happens. The pain is bad but not that bad, so I wonder if it is neurological or I'm feeling sick just lowers my already low mood (I suspect an underlying dysthymic disorder). I just worry about being unable to see past my state and wind up hurting myself. 

Does anyone else experience this? If so, how do you keep yourself safe?

Thank you.
