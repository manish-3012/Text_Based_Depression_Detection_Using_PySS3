I don't know what to do...I just don't anymore. My grades are slipping, my relationship is straining because of my constant worrying, and my life just feels like it is falling apart. I really don't know where else to turn, I try to hide my sadness and general hate for life, and I feel like I do a good job, but it is killing me. I constantly lie to everyone around me and tell them I am okay and I just can't take it anymore. I want to die, I feel as though I am just a burden to those around me and that I only bring them down. Whenever I tell anyone how I am feeling they just say "Oh well you're 15, it;s just hormones and stuff messing with you." I try to believe them and hope it will get better but some days I just can't... I apologize if it is too long, I just feel like this is the only place I can actually let my feelings out..
