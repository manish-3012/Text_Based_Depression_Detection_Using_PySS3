Mental health is going downhill.I've done several things in the last week that have made me question my mental health. 

Excuse me for being abrupt but I'm extraordinarily depressed, and only want to type so much, so this is what I've done.

I spat on and cursed at a door to door salesman. 

I wet my own bed.

I slammed my head into my wall 5 times whilst screaming.

I don't know what's happening, I'm in the UK and feel completely unable to see a therapist or get help.

What do I do?
