Losing hope with my wife and can't see life without her- helpI'm only 22 and married. I've been happily in a relationship with my wife for over 6 years with an extreme amount of trust. Because we've been together through college and still wanted to have fun we would try i guess what you'd call light swinging. We would make out with others or fool around from the waist up but always together and it turned us on. Its not for everyone, not for us either i see now, but if thats why you want to comment leave now please. 
On her 21st birthday party this weekend we got completely wasted with several friends and took two friends home with us. They were single but had a light 4some experience like usual but then it went too far because we were so drunk. My wife was fingered and made out with my friend, I had oral with the girl. When she went to give my friend oral (seeing I did it) I freaked out more because it was a friend than what it was but i stopped her anyways. I cant stand the thought of her doing that which makes me the biggest hypocritical fuck ever.
The next day we both regretted it. I cant get the image out of my head and because we were each others first the oral sex i had is destroying her. I hate myself more than anything, shes the only person i truly care about in this world.
She still talks to the friend which is fine cause there is nothing there but its killing me because she will hardly talk to me, says its because im the only one that hurt her since we're married. Shes not sure how to get over this and doesnt want to leave me but its a possibility obviously. The only reason I havent killed myself already (ive been extremely close with my gun) is because I have hope we can move on but im starting to think we wont make it through this.
I dont want a life without her, I cant handle it, but I dont want to kill myself until I know all hope is lost- I'd hate to give into impulse right now.
Please help
Sorry so long
