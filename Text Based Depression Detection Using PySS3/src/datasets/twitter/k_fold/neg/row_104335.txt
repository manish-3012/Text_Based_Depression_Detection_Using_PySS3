Losing friends...And not to death. Just from what I can only assume are my maladaptive behaviors.

We had such fun that I was almost ready to call her my best friend. Then she moved and ever since then she has become more and more distant. In turn I've become more and more emotional and I'm sure that's not helping, but in general it really does feel like I meant nothing to her.

It's been years since someone made me feel so alive when I was with them. 

I don't have many friends left, and losing her as one has hit me very hard.
