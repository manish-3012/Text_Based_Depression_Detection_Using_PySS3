Imagining 1000s ways to suicide but couldn't do itHey, have you (with or w/o mental condition) kept on imagining ways to die + the aftereffects for many years now yet still doesn't actually try? Because in the end, afraid to end it all? at least, the tiny bits of happiness we cling on from time to time.

I've been doing it since prolly 8~ when I get scolded... I haven't gotten diagnosed yet but I think I simply have an emotional mental condition prolly BPD i dunno, I wonder anyone here has similar experience
