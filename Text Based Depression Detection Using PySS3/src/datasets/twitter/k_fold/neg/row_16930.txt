Iâ€™m doneIâ€™ve been suicidal for most of my life. I started going on drugs for depression and OCD recently and those helped for about a year, but the effects soon wore off. Recently Iâ€™ve become worried that Iâ€™m bi polar. 

I quit my stable job to pursue a creative career and have failed. I am behind on rent, owe multiple other creatives money for different services, and I donâ€™t know how I can make enough money in time. Iâ€™m also almost 30, I thought Iâ€™d be so much further along in my life by now. 

Iâ€™ve always worked hard and have kept my head down. As a result, it seems many people want to see me fail. I got cocky, I worked harder, made more money, I didnâ€™t rely on anyone for anything, and here I am. Alone and strapped for cash in an expensive city.

Iâ€™m ordering a suicide kit today with some of my leftover funds. Though Iâ€™m happy to talk if anyone wants to. Much love. - J
