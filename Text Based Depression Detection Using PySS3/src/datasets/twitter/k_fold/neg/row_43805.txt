Why are you still alive?Thinking about it, I don't really have a "valid" reason to not be dead.
I wish I could say I have friends and family who I don't want to hurt, or a dream what I want to do with my life in the future.
But no. 
All that is keeping me here is this damned survival instinct. 
The fear of what it's going to feel like to hang by the neck or slowly bleed out. 
I'm just dragging myself along through life, with no plans, no stable relationships.
I wish I could numb my fear of death.
