The clock is tickingIâ€™m 18 and iâ€™m becoming increasingly aware of the fact that I am a miserable, narcissistic, sociopathic autist who will most likely never do a single thing in his life worthwhile. I have embraced thoughts of suicide my entire life starting in grade 5 but it feels different this time. Before i didnt know why I wanted to die. Now i do. It is because i will do nothing except hurt people and let them down for my entire life. I have a calm, charming exterior but on the inside all I ever think about is myself. The incessant voice talking talking talking like a fucking squeaking rodent. Never ending. It will never end. I will make it end
