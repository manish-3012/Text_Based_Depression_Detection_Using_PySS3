Not in danger, just need to get this outI've always had suicide as a Plan B if Plan A, plan aa, plan aaa, etc didn't work. I'm just tired. I'm tired of doing it all, everyone depending on me then when I demand peace and quiet, I get people calling me selfish or "I'm aaaalways there for YOU! Why can't you be there for me??" Ugh please! I am drained. I'm tired of being held to ridiculous standards at work and home while everyone else skates by. Bad luck seems to follow me everywhere I go, no matter how positive I try to be. I finally caught up on my car payments and made future payment arrangements with my finance company and yet they sent a repo guy to my house today. (at least I wasn't home at the time.) Why be shady? Why are people allowed to get away with this shit. I have to make a very unpleasant call to those people tomorrow. I'm sick of fighting. Everyday is a fight with people. I just want peace. Thank you for listening.
