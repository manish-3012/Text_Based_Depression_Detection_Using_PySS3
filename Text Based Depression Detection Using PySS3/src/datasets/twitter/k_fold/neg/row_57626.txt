Feeling...nothingI'm trying so hard not to sound like a self pitying asshole..but I've been hurt so fucking badly by the people I trusted. the people I thought loved me. and they never did. ever. I have zero friends. none. to the point where I would basically be friends with q stranger I just need anyone. I no longer care if I'm endangering myself I just want someone to be a friend to me. like..I've allowed people to hurt me so many times. I've been trying to not give up..but...I'm starting to..finally give up
