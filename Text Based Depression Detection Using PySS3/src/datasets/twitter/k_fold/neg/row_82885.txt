What are some reasons to keep living?I don't see any reason to keep living. I know of things like staying alive to laugh again and have these things that make you happy briefly. I don't believe in an afterlife so if I can't miss those things, what is there to lose? Everything seems meaningless and I don't have many people or things that make me want to stay. 

I think about my life in this stage  right now as being 90% bad and 10% being mundane. The cons are outweighing the pros.
