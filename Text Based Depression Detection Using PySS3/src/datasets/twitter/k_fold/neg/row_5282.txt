all i want is to DIETo start iâ€™m 12. I have type 1 diabetes, skin cancer, and my respiratory system is failing. i recently switched schools which was the worst decision of my life. i have friends there but none that i like. i had good friends at my old school who really cared about me. my dad is a weed smoking asshole who doesnâ€™t spend time with his family so that he can smoke with his buddies. my sister is a heroine addict who had a baby and iâ€™m not even allowed to see my nephew. my brother stays in his room all day vaping. my grandma is the one who kept me alive all this time cause she really loves and has always been there. but now itâ€™s all too much and iâ€™m just gonna end it.
