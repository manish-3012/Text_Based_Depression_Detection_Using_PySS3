Not sure how much longer I can hold onI am 35 and have been depressed since I was a little kid, probably around 6 or so.   Never had a friend in my life and never accomplished anything.   When I was 28 met a desperate girl at a job and managed to marry her (first girl I even held hands with let alone talked to a bit), have a couple kids......I managed to break a smile once in awhile which was the first in my life but still depressed.  She decided she couldnt deal with my mental stuff anymore and left me 3 months ago.    Nothing makes me happy.....I have been drinking every single night since she left and it just helps me not cry so much every night.     I tell her she might need to take the kids full time for awhile so I can check myself into a hospital again but she just gets mad about it saying I am being selfish.   All I think about is how much I was I was dead anymore....Hoping a deer will jump in front of me on my way back from work or I just happen to lose conyrol and fly off a bridge.   She will have to take the kids but my biggest concern is my dogs.......I asked her once if I was gone if she would take care of them and she said no....     I may have to call rescue shelters and make arrangements even if I have to put money down just so they can have a chance of finding a new home without a risk of being put to sleep.... I am breaking down at work and may not go back now due to that today.....I am not going to last much longer......Things do not get better
