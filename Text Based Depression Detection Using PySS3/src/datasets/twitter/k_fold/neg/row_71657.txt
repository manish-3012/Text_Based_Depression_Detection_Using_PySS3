Shouldnâ€™t I just die?I am chronically ill, I also am in the risk zone for mortality with covid19 because of it.

My kids canâ€™t be in school with their friends because Iâ€™m high risk, my husband has to do far more work because of it. 

My husband has fallen out of love with me, he just stays with me because of the kids. He says itâ€™s not true but he says we need to â€œtalkâ€ but when we do he just stop unloads all the things he cannot stand about me and just makes me hate myself more.

I hate myself, like hate deeply, I hate myself so I canâ€™t bear to live with myself anymore. 

The more he tells me what is wrong with me the more I just want to die.

My kids donâ€™t like me as well. 
Sure it may be painful for them but they will move on in life and eventually forget about me. They are young enough. 

My husband would be so much happier with another woman. Someone that fits his idea woman, someone who is thin and athletic and happy all the time and big breasted and into what he is into. Someone that is high paced and active. He is an outdoors man and an extrovert, he has ADHD and is always on the go. He is also a Virgo so he is a perfectionist.

Iâ€™m a quiet introvert, I am a professional oil painter/artist. I like to take it easy and am chubby (not obese), I like to be home and snuggle and be creative, make music or grill out etc. and with my chronic illness I struggle with doing all the active things my husband wants in life. He looks at me as a weight weighing him down. 

The truth is I have never ever been good enough for anyone ever. My whole life, Iâ€™ve never been enough.
I canâ€™t keep living life being never ending.

So if my family doesnâ€™t want me and I have chronic pain, and covid19 might get me anyway, and I am just a burden to everyone, and my heartaches, and I am so alone, why carry on?
