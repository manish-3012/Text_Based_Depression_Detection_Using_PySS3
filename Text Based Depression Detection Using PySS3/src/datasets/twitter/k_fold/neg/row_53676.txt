last hoursyou've been here before and you understand and i've always been here. there are days of sunshine but not enough, always not enough. i've come to dread days like this one, and i'm always right dreading because it comes, it always comes, and i feel alone again and people don't understand why i'm like this why i'm difficult and they tell me to just not think about my problems. you know that doesn't mean anything when everything is dark and lonely and the dark is eating you up. i want to connect with someone, anyone, but the people i love do not understand me when i say i need help. they're almost always absent during the bleakest hours. i don't blame them. i hate myself too. i want to say goodbye but it might make me change my mind and if i did change my mind, the dark days would go on, go on, and i can't, anymore. i just can't. tonight. no regrets. the dead don't regret anything. we'll all die. that's how things are. i've sought all the help i could and nothing. we'll all die. different times but we will all. for me it's tonight. thank you so much for reading.
