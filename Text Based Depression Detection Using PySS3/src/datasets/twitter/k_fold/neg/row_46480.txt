I fucking hate everythingSo long story short, I was arrested last October for having smoked marijuana and having drug paraphernalia on me. Since then, my friends have slowly flaked off thinking I'm some sort of criminal or bad influence on their life.

I've completed a diversion program, I was never charged with anything in my life until then but I have a "clean record" now. Even though I'm done with all of the legal crap, I went back to weed because I was bored and nobody wanted to hang out with me, because I smoke weed... It's a fucking cycle.

I work at my college paper but I hardly talk to anyone unless I have to now. I think I am depressed and anxious at the same time. I hate it. I hate seeking help because I'm embarrassed about the problems I have brought upon myself. I've never considered suicide before but I'm really fucking close to thinking about it. I'm afraid to think about it.

I want out. I want a fresh start. I've stopped smoking weed for a week and I don't ever want to do it again, not because I don't enjoy it, but because people are associating me with the drug â€”Â as if that's my fucking identity. Everyone around me just seems to take themselves to seriously. I don't drink, I don't smoke anymore and I'm physically active again. I just don't seem to have the right mindset anymore.

I'm not even 20 and I'm talking as if my life is over. What the fuck do I do? I feel isolated and yet I'm afraid to talk to anyone. I'm being a fucking baby. I'm not the same.

Someone tell me why I should not just kill myself. Nobody other than my family members are ever happy to see me anymore, it seems like.

So what say you, random people of the internet? I think I know what I want: a better attitude, a better outlook on life, actual friends who know people have flaws and an overall better life (don't we all?).

Thank you for reading all of my jumbled thoughts.
