I donâ€™t want to be here anymoreI donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting. Iâ€™ll honestly probably delete this. But Iâ€™m losing it. I just canâ€™t function anymore. I donâ€™t have anyone in my life I can talk to about it. Iâ€™m just so lost and alone and I feel so trapped. Iâ€™ve been in and out of the hospital at least 5 times since the day after my birthday (sep 23). I just canâ€™t take it. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Itâ€™s not really that I want to be dead, itâ€™s more I just donâ€™t want to live this life.
