My friend is gone and I didnâ€™t even see it coming.A friend of mine took her life. She was strong, she was successful, she was beautiful. I never knew she was struggling.  We werenâ€™t best friends but, she made an impact on my life. She helped shape who I am, and I had no idea she was struggling. Iâ€™ve talked to people who were closer. Family. She hid the pain from everyone. 

I am begging and pleading to everyone who is here. To everyone who reads this...please talk to someone.  I would have done anything to save her. But, I didnâ€™t even know she was struggling.

I love you Crystal. I have to believe you knew that.
