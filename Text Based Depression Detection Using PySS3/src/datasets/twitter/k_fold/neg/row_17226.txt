fuck lifesome people are meant to live others are meant to die.  No matter how good of a person you are or you aren't doesn't matter.  This everyday pain and hurt that I face which so many of you have to deal with just isn't worth it.  I wish I could not have to deal with his anymore.  

The worst part is I did it to myself.  -
