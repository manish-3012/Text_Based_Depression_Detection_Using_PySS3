Not suicidal but regretfulI attempted suicide a month ago. I took pills threw them up then went to the hospital 5 hours later. I regret it so much. A lot of my family members are mad at me. I feel nauseous all the time. I have stomach issues and itâ€™s awful. Please donâ€™t do what I did you will regret it whether youâ€™re successful or not.
