Iâ€™ll be gone by morning, this is my last testament.Hi all,

Iâ€™m currently waiting for my roommates to go to bed. When they do i plan to split my wrists and call it a life.

Iâ€™m 22 and thatâ€™s been enough life for me. Iâ€™ve been bullied, picked on and ridiculed my whole life and Iâ€™m ready to be done with it. I had someone special in my life who helped that pain but Iâ€™m so worthless I ruined that too. Here I am over a year later still sulking over it like the pathetic wretch I am. 

To anyone who may read this, I hope in the future we will learn to be kinder to each other. Realize our words have meaning and use them for compassion instead of hate. Iâ€™ve given up hope for myself but i really do pray for humanity moving forward.

With all my heart,

Ethan.
