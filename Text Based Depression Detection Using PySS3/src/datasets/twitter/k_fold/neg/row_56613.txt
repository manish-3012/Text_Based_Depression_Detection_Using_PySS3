Sometimes I wonder why I try.I typically try to help others that go through a hard time. I am the first friend people call on when feeling down, or in a crisis. I am totally fine with this, it's what I'm currently going to school for. So why is it that whenever I need anyone they all go missing? *sigh* 
Life hasn't been extremely easy for me lately, (is it ever?) I support two children while working and attending university, but everything is losing its luster lately. Nothing is enjoyable, nothing is easy, and everything seems like it's too much. Don't get me wrong, I still take care of the children, drag my ass to work, and take care of the responsibilities, but nothing that I used to enjoy seems worth doing anymore. What's even harder is trying to act normal around co-workers and family, like nothing is wrong. Inside I feel like I'm falling apart and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Outside I try to smile and act like everything is fine. So I begin to wonder, if anything is worth doing at all. If I just decided to disappear, would things be easier for those around me? My children wouldn't have to worry about the things that they have gone through recently, (we've been homeless or staying with a friend for the last 2 years, I just recently got us into an apartment.) and if I left my children to my sister who is older and has a more financially stable life, maybe they would be better off. If I just slipped into the void, my parents wouldn't worry about their bipolar/schitzo daughter. Things would hurt at first for them, but they would heal and go back to normal. I'm not really eating, not really sleeping, and not really wanting to go on working so hard for nothing.
