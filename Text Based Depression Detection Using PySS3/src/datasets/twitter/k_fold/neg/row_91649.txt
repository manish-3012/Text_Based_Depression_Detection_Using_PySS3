Suicide hotlines should be outlawedI legit just had a vollenteer from the Crisis Text Line tell me if I can't afford antidepressants try asking a friend who has them to loan me some of their pills? Are you fucking kidding me?

I have no issurance or money and that's the advice you give me? What the hell is wrong with these people? 

Are they really just some assholes who only care about the volunteer hours so it looks good on a resume?
 
I seriously wish I could break that fucker's jaw for saying that.

I took screenshots and would post them here but this subreddit doesn't allow photos.
