Bad nightI took two gravol yesterday to knock myself out during a severe panic attack. It calmed me down and put me to sleep, but now I feel like I missed my medication and am in so much psychological pain now, cannot put it into words. I'm having suicidal thoughts and am tired of being hurt by people. I think my SSRIs have been disrupted by the gravol I took last night. Even though I took my meds today. I think maybe the two just don't go together and the gravol overrode it or something. My period is also due in a few days and PMS can be pretty hellish with depression and anxiety, I think they call it premenstrual exacerbation when your mental illness is aggravated by premenstrual symptoms. I'm just chilling on the kitchen floor up against the cabinets right now feeling like pure death inside. :( Help.
