I want to dieI have struggled with suicidal ideation for about 10 months but have not had any thoughts for a few months. I was stupid enough to think that they wouldn't come back. And now they are back, stronger than ever. I don't know what will happen if they get any worse. I don't think I could prevent them from taking over my life again. I don't know if I will end up finally ending my pitiful life. I have nothing left to live for, school is all online, my best friend moved away, my parents hate me, and I am not allowed to be in love with my girlfriend who is also moving away. Sorry about this rant, I just don't know what to do any more.
