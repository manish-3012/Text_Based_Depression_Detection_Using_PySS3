Worried about a strangerI dont know where else to post this. Iv been seeing this "girl" online for about a month now( i know some people dont consider that dating and thats fine but for sake of argument). But this last monday she reveled to me that she is a he. I being a straight male was not at all interested anymore. I relize this could be seen as hypocritical since this is purely online and it doesnt matter but it completely ruined it for me. Anyway when i went to breake it off he told me i was the only reason they have been holding on anymore and that im the only one they have. That if i go they would swallow a bottle of pills. I dont want them to do that obviously and when i tell them that they dont care. I suggest that they get help and they claim they cant due to finances. He from what he tells me has had it rough and isnt in a great situation.  I just dont know what to do. I dont want anyone to die do to my lack of feelings but i dont want to be stuck in a relashinship i dont want to be in. Advice?
