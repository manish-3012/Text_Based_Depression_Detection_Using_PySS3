I'm really suicidal, please help me :(I've had a history of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. But the worst thing that could have happened happened.

My girlfriend cheated on my, kinda, and then left me. She is my love and I've never been in love like that before. On the 20th we would have been dating for 7 months. We met threw a place online and we were texting for s few months before we met and instantly started dating and moved in together into her parents place. We were so happy with each other and everything was going great! Then after 4 months of living together her parents got separated so I had to move out. But we stayed together and loved each other the same. She has borderline personality disorder which makes her very impulsive, she has broken up with me before but only for a few hours and I was with her for those hours. But Now she told she cheated on me. This fucking killed me. Apparently she flirted with someone. I told her I can get past it if we stay together. After talking and stuff, she is very sorry and she showed that at the start. But after talking she wouldn't do it again but I'm not sure if she is still in love with me. She left me because she felt like she wouldn't be able to date me with this on her conscious. I told her I can forgive her and that I love her and wanna be with her. I asked after talking to her about all this if she wanted to get back together she said "not right now". I'm scared she won't get back with me. I planned my entire life with this girl and now I feel in limbo. If we don't get back together I'm going to kill myself. I already have a suicide note written out. She is the only reason I'm still alive and I can't lose her. I call myself an athiest but I was so upset I prayed to God hoping desperately that something will change.
