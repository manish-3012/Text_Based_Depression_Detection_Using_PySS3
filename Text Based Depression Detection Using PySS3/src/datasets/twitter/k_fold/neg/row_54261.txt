Suicide noteHi, I'm a short guy, pushover, no skills that are relevant to the job market, don't want a job because I'm an entitled loser. Life has been fucked lately and there isn't anything that will change that because i have schizophrenia and anxiety. I can't face people. They're taller than me and better than me. They all have gorgeous girlfriends, good jobs, and fulfilling lives. I feel like people, and women, are just watching me try to do things that society wants me to do and then fail. I have no freedom of thought just chronic anxiety and i want to hang myself. I'm tired of this. I have a lot of skills but no one really gives a shit. Women want me to read philosophy because that's what smart guys do and I'm not smart.  I have: quick wit, language acquisition, good drummer, fast reader, popular, a people person, polite, athletic, romantic, good listener, loyal person, read books in the past (wow!), good kisser, traveler, meditative (at least in the past). But let's just be honest for a minute. Some people are born in fucked situations. My parents and friends are pressuring and rushing me to find a fulfilling career that I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life. NONE. And if I got a job there will certainly be an office bully. Life's so pointless and shitty and I'm ready to hang myself. Look I'm not a fucking 6'4 tall person who knows C# and JavaScript. I have schizophrenia, autism, and I should have been held back in school because i have no social skills. I guess I'm a super privileged, obsessive braincel but whatever. Lemme hang myself with my bed sheet already. Why can't I just be myself in life.
