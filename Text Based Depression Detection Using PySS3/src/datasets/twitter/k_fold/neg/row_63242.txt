Actions have consequencesI have literally thrown my life away at the age of 22 by being an idiot. I am literally too stupid to live. I have no one to blame but myself. My parents tried to put me in a good position and bailed me out several times. But I still messed up big time. I donâ€™t plan on living much longer because I canâ€™t live with myself. I am rotten to the core.

You ever ask yourself â€œwho does thatâ€ when you hear about an idiot. That idiot is me 

Donâ€™t be like me kids. If your making bad decisions stop before you end up like me.
