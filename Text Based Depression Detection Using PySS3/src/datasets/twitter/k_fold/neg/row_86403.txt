Iâ€™m fucking tired.Itâ€™s 3:10 in the morning. Iâ€™m in bed crying as usual. For weeks Iâ€™ve been seeing a psychiatrist and he prescribed meds. They donâ€™t work. I feel like I canâ€™t even be completely honest because I donâ€™t want to be committed. The truth is I hate life and I wish it would end. I self harmed after years of not doing it. I feel ashamed. My dad has been dead for years and Iâ€™m still mad at him. But what if he just abandoned me because he knew I wasnâ€™t anybody? What if he knew the whole time that I was worthless? I really wish my mom wouldâ€™ve gotten that abortion. Somebody else wouldâ€™ve been more deserving of these 25 years that I didnâ€™t fucking ask for.
