I don't want to die, but I feel like I have to at this point ?I have an unexplained chronic pain condition that I'm trying to figure out but I've spent so many years in horrible pain and I've lost so much that i feel like it's too late, I've run out of time and there is no fixing my problem. I dont really feel all that depressed, I'm 100% lucid and feel completely logical/in my right mind I just feel I've reached the end of what I'm willing to tolerate. I dont want to die, but I dont want to live like this, I'm not sure what else to do honestly.
