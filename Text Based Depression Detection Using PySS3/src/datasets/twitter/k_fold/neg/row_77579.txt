Why me..I'm just going to lay it all out here. I'm 15 and I weigh (last time I checked) 330 lbs. I've had 3 ankle breaks and 2 sprains, in which all required me to be in a wheel chair. I don't want to live anymore. I feel like a whale at school and I think my weight affects my friendships. I'm the only black girl at a mostly white school. I hate it, I feel so alone. The only reason I haven't killed myself is the thought of my parents crying and thinking that one day maybe someone will love me for who I am and not what I look like (which I highly doubt because what I just wrote is complete bullshit.) You may be wondering why I haven't done anything about it, I don't know myself. I have absolutely no motivation to work out. I'd rather just go home, finish homework, play on my laptop, and sleep. The worst is I think I have anxiety. I've talked to my mom about it and she says to just pray about it. I've tried it just doesn't do anything..  I just want to die or go away.
