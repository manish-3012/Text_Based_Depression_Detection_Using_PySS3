Suicide is affecting me, not youWhy are people selfish about me wanting to die? When I tell my mum she says that I'm joking, or that she would be alone. You have my sister. But did you ever really care to find me help so I would feel alive? OR just so you could feel like a good mother? Did you ever think that in my head I am suffering? That maybe I am cutting to make my arm numb so I can cut an arterie? Or that I want to starve myself to death? No. I will kill myself one day and that is the only plan for my future.
