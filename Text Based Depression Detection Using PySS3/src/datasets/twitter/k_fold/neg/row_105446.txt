Yes, I know people will be sadBut they would also be sad if I died in a car crash, if I died of cancer, if I died when a piano fell on me. Anything can happen right, so whatâ€™s to say I wonâ€™t die tomorrow or next week anyway? If I kill myself, my family and friends are going to have to deal with my death the same way they would if I died from anything else.

I know people are going to call me selfish. But Iâ€™ve spent hours of my days in therapy, Iâ€™ve been on over thirty medications, Iâ€™ve tried supplements, and exercise, and so many other things. I still exist as a sad shell of a person, and the only thing I can honestly say I look forward to is death.
