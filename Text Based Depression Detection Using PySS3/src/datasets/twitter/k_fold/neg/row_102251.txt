I'm freaking losing it. 16 and I might just go of a stress related heart attack if I don't end it myself immediately I'm shaking so hard. I feel like I need to punch something hard but every time I hit the wall I only feel worse. I've been staring at my ceiling for the past hour trying not to strangle myself. I feel like I'm gonna throw up. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SOMEONE HELP ME. my only real friend moves away tomorrow. Once she's gone there's literally nothing worth living for. I can't say goodbye to her tomorrow. I can't keep going till tomorrow.
