A horrible end to my 19th birthdaySo. 19th birthday, spent the weekend with friends, drinking etc. Come home around 8pm, with friends. After they part ways, I go talk to my mum and boyfriend (both of whom I try and respect as much as possible) because she called me up, and basically made me emotional. 

I resorted to my room, and start crying in bed because I feel like I'm useless, not helping, and only making my (mother + boyfriend) economic situation only worse. I feel as if I don't have any reason to live, no goals, not very good looking, not a lot of money, no relationships. Not sure what to do
