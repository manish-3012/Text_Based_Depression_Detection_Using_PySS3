Just donâ€™t know anymoreFeeling my life drastically go down the drain as Iâ€™m starting to fail school and get into drugs, dreading waking up everyday from this horrible society and the thought of never being able to pass school and only seeing black and darkness for the future, is great. Literally being ok now with killing yourself then being scared of dying. Realizing how lonely you are and how you donâ€™t talk to anyone. Realizing how your fucked up your life permanently and wonâ€™t probably live to 30. Agreeing with myself to just kill myself whenever my dad dies, considering my dads the only human being to love me in this earth. Great.
