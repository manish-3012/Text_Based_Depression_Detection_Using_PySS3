Thank you all...Today is the day... i thought i was getting better but this morning I burst into tears and i knew... im so sorry. Ive been praying every night that i dont wake up. Tonight my prayers will hopefully be answered. Its time for bed. Finally. Goodnight you guys. Thank you for trying. im sorry it wasnt enough.  I tried.
