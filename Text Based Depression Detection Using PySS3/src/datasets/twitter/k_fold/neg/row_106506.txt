ParalysisI am in a crisis situation at the moment that is really serious. I am being threatened with an accusation of misconduct which may get my degree revoked. I need to get my shit together and go through my records so that I can defend myself but I am panicking and experiencing a mental paralysis. I have developed severe anxiety which is getting in the way of me dealing with the situation. I have been through a lot in the last year and I feel totally out of mental resources to deal with this. I have tried talking to people but I can't get over the block. I have gotten pills from the doctor but they are not helping. Any support would be really appreciated. I can't stop thinking about killing myself, it seems like the only way to escape the feeling of panic.
