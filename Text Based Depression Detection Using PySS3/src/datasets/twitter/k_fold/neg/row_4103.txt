i dont know how not to want to kill myselflife is bullshit, i'm tired all the time, i don't wanna do anything, i have no ambition. every time i cut myself i just wish i could hit a vein and be done with it all. either ill kill myself or somehow get out of this but i cannot possibly think of a way to enjoy life
