I think im going insaneI really don't know what to do anymore, I feel like I'm going crazy. I know the feelings I feel have a lot to do with drug use but that the only thing that makes me happy. Like I'm an emotional wreck everyday I want to kill myself but I know that I don't want to hurt my family that actually care about if I did. Like it's so shitty to say that it makes me feel very bad about myself. Overall it's my dad who honestly bully's me everyday and the fact that I can't get a job I have no way to get away and create a happy life for myself. I can only wonder what would be the reaction from my piece of shit dad if I did kill myself. He probably won't care. Nobody ever takes that seriously when I have said before. Until it actually happens right...? I bet there wouldn't a single fucking tear to come out of his eyes. I try not to base my life and where I need to go with it on a piece of shit father. I want any parent who's reading this to take this seriously. You don't know what your child is going through until you ask them.
