just finished writing my last words for when my time eventually comes.Iâ€™ve been dealing with these thoughts for over 3 years.  It has gotten to a point where I donâ€™t even feel happiness or sadness anymore. I havenâ€™t told anybody that I know due to my deep rooted trust issues, fear of telling secrets, and fear of being a burden on others. I definitely canâ€™t tell my parents, and im not even sure if I can tell my friends. I want to be able to confide in someone close to me but I honestly think itâ€™s just not possible. My demons have my mind so cloudy right now and i honestly want to let them win at this point. Iâ€™m so confused, empty, and lonely right now, and even though i have a few good people in my life i donâ€™t think that there is anybody I can truly lean on or give me a shoulder to cry on. At the end of the day, I donâ€™t think that i will commit soon (as Iâ€™m still young), but the thought is and always will be in my mind and i feel like one day these thoughts will end up consuming me.
