Iâ€™m so mad at myself 17/FSo I cut again. Last night and just now. Not super deep, just enough so itâ€™ll heal with no scars. Life has been going so well but Iâ€™ve been so self conscious and my self esteem is so low that cutting just gives me that euphoria and I donâ€™t worry about any of that. I donâ€™t wanna tell anyone I know because I feel like Iâ€™m just annoying them and being a total burden, they also think I havenâ€™t cut in months and I havenâ€™t until last night. It just makes me feel so much better and the euphoria after is so nice itâ€™s hard to stop.
