I'm suicidal.I'm so depressed. I act okay in front of everyone but I'm not fucking fine. I'm an asshole. I'm manipulative. I ruin everything. I wish I was fucking dead. I keep trying to find out how I can die but I can't fucking find anything. I can't find dosages or anything. I just want to feel loved. And cared about. I feel so lost. I feel so alone. I've already fallen back into self harm and anorexia. I feel so. empty. Please help me. I can't be hospitalized again because a previous hospitalization traumatized me.
