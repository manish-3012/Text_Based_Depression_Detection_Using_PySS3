One month from today I'll be deadIt will be my 20th birthday. It's the perfect timing really. One week before that it will be parents weekend at my college and I'll get to say goodbye to my family one last time. My roommate  has an away soccer game so there will be no one to stop me. I hung up the wall hook I'll hang myself from and have been hanging my belt on it everyday thinking about how it will look around my neck. This has been 4 years in the making as I've been depressed since I was 16 and always joked that if I wasn't happy by the age of 20 I'd just end it. Well I'm here and I'm as miserable as ever. So this is the end. Just wanted to leave something here so it won't seem like a total surprise when I go through with it.
