Iâ€™m scared that if I kill myself my friend will tooSo I talk *a lot* with a friend of mine, like everyday. She knows almost everything about me. About a month ago I started to feel very suicidal (Iâ€™ve been for a while but it was just far worst) and talked to her about it or was joking about it and she tried to help or told me not to, was really nice. But recently I started again and she told me to do it and that if she canâ€™t stop me why not help me and stuff. To be honest I didnâ€™t really care at this point even tho I needed help more than pushing me to do it. But this morning I told her I didnâ€™t do it and she said something like well wha if we both did it at the same time and I knew or thought that she was joking but then it went very weird like going into details about how we were gonna do it and shit and she said that at first she was joking but she didnâ€™t do anything with her life so why not die anyways ? idk it was weird and now we have the whole plan and idk if sheâ€™s serious and I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t want her to die. Iâ€™m scared that i was pushing her into wanting to do that or what idk. That post probably is very weird but just help me save her no need to care about me
