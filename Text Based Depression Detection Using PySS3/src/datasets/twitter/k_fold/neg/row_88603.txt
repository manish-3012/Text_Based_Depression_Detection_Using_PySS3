Im going to kill myself tomorrowThis is a new account (for obvious reasons).All my life I've been fighting anxiety and I don't talk to people properly(socially awkward one would say).And because of this and other reasons I haven't been doing well academic wise either.Im also addicted to weed and cigarette and I'm ashamed that I haven't achieved anything.I just feel like life would be better off without me..
