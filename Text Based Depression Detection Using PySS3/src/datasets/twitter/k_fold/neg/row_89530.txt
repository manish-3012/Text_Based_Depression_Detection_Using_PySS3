I'm surprised I'm still here. Hopefully I won't be. I have a plan, but it's not time-dependent at all, so it kinda just depends on me deciding it's time.I have to be sure I'm not gonna psych myself out, though. I've been sorta-planning for months. 

It's fucked up because I know everyone's gonna be shocked. I'm really good at putting on a normal/happy face for show.
