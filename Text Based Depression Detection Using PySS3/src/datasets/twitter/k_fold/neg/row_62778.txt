Where would someone go if they wanted to kill themselves?Okay because of the oncoming investigation I figure this was a stupid idea to post with police and what not. I found her in a secluded place that she likes. She grazed her head with a gun I didn't know she had. We called the cops and she left with her, still somewhat coherent. I cried a lot but thank you guys for simply replying. I'll probably need this sub in the future for helping me help my mom. Thank you so much even though it hurts I'm still happy because she is alive and I think she will be (physically) fine.
