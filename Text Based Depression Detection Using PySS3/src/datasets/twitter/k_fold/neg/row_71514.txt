Not depressed or anything, donâ€™t need help, just fed up.Now I know your answers beforehand. â€œYouâ€™re still young.â€ â€œGo seek help.â€ â€œItâ€™s not worth it.â€ â€œIve attempted suicide before and I regret it.â€ Etc. Well that wonâ€™t work because I have no depression, yes Iâ€™m ugly and barely have any friends but I have successfully worked with that and been depression free for more than a year but, several disasters are happening with my life and no ones helping enough, seeking a psychiatrist wonâ€™t solve these problems would it. I wanna kill myself cause Iâ€™m fed up, I canâ€™t be bothered anymore, life sucks we all know that, but it sucks more when everyone arounds you only adds salt on your wounds whenever you have a problem. Shit, my dad would blame me if something he ordered in the mail didnâ€™t get on time, imagine my own problems. Nah, Iâ€™m done all I need now is the balls to through myself outta the window.
