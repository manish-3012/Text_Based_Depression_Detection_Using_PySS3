It's becoming too much for me. Trigger WarningIf you were to look at me from the outside, you'd probably have no idea that I feel this way. I'm an okay student who is finally going to be graduating with a college degree after years of tears, a 3 year abusive relationship, being hospitalized for Bipolar Disorder twice and almost losing my father to major heart surgery. I should be happy right? Finally! After so many people were unsure of me. Now I'm looking into jobs within my field and I've put in what feels like hundreds of applications. I've gotten nowhere. My lease is up at the end of July and I have nothing. All of the people who are close to me are moving far away. I don't want to be here anymore either, but I'm not having any luck with trying to move forward. These past few days have also been rough for me PTSD wise. I've hardly been able to get a few hours of sleep in without feeling like my rapist is touching me again and hearing those awful things he used to say to me over and over. I'm so overwhelmed and I don't know how to cope. Please Help me.
