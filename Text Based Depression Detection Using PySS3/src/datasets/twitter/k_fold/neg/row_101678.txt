Hi, Iâ€™ve been here before, but now itâ€™s for a friendRecently, I met a trans girl online, and she seemed kinda fun, but then I saw posts about her feeling terrible because she took too many sleeping pills and I asked why, and she said that she was trying to kill her self. We talked back and forth and she told me she was in one of those camps where they try to â€œcureâ€ â€œimpuritiesâ€ like wanting to be the opposite gender (apparently they are still legal in some states in the US, which is where she lives) she told me that it was hell there, and she saw one of her best friends shoot her self in the head (I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™s still alive). She told me that she was going to try and kill herself everyday until she succeeds. Iâ€™m heartbroken that this even can happen to a person, but if she kills herself, Iâ€™m probably going to get suicidal thoughts again. Please help meâ€¦
