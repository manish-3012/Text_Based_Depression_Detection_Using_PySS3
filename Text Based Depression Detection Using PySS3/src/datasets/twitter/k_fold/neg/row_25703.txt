I don't know if I want to die or not..I feel really nothing anymore it's just numb. This is the most I've ever thought about suicide but I don't want to die I just want to be happy but I can't see that in my future. My days are numbered and the thoughts are getting worse it would be so easy just to die and have no more pain.
