I've had enoughI've had enough and I want to kill myself. My life is falling apart. I did awful my first semester and am now on academic probation with a 1.5 GPA I failed classes I need for my major and now I think I'm not good enough for what I want to do. I feel like I'm wasting my parents money and I feel awful about it. My long term girlfriend broke it off with me. I've gained an immense amount of weight. I have no idea what I want to do with my life anymore. I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this. My parents know about my depression and want to attempt suicide but don't know how bad I am currently. I can't tell my mom how bad I did this semester at college because she'll freak on me. I feel like I'm not good enough for my parents and I'm never going to live up to there expectations. I was supposed to do counseling for my depression but I never went and my parents don't know that either. It is so hard for me to reach out for help and I'm scared I am really messed up emotionally. I feel like I have a lot of problems and I should go to a therapist since my college does have one for free. But I have no idea how to reach out for help. It's so hard for me to reach out and tell someone. I have no idea what to do. I'm scared I feel like my life is becoming a dead end.
