Bucket list suggestions--- I'm insane 100% - I'm FREEI mean I don't do anything productive and I'll be without money soon.. And I see I'm hurting my family but I don't care much.. I act like an asshole to my friends and "friends" and people in general. I have only few people I'm good with.. I can go anywhere and just mock random people without reason.. I don't even know if that's negative.. Negative is that I'm here writing these type shit but I can't sleep even tho I took 8mg of klonopin...

I don't know.. I guess I still have passion.. I love cars, dogs and girls (in sexual way) but I don't have enough money to do stuff that I'll probably want even if I feel so free.. I finally got this feeling where I don't care what anyone thinks and that I can do..

Since I can't sleep I would like to take suggestions what would you do if you were me...
