Just another person feeling hopeless over current events.Reading the news right now, I feel that my chances of surviving this crisis are slim. I'm not even in a "vulnerable" population when it comes to the disease. The problem is finances and total lack of a support system/safety net. I live paycheck to paycheck, and I have no one I can call on for financial support. I don't even have emotional support, quite frankly. I mostly have friends who use me and leave me feeling a sense of dread when the phone buzzes. Usually, they're the ones asking me for emotional support, and I keep giving it to them. I think what they're doing is stupid, I think they're being obnoxious, but I try to keep being nice/supportive like I feel I should be. Yet when it finally comes down to me needing them to support me, forget it. Facing this crisis has made me realize how alone I really am.

I've been sick for the past week. My internship is closed, only allowing my remote participation. My job is refusing to close and won't return my e-mails re: working from home. Once I'm declared better/fit for work, I will have the choice: risk an illness I can't pay for/likely can't get treated/that could result in my death (or my roommate's if I spread it to him, and he is in a vulnerable population) or call it quits, leaving me with no money to pay my rent or buy food. 

I came out of financial abuse and domestic violence in 2017, and I have no savings to fall back on during this time. The job I found in the wake of that awful experience has left me wishing there was a hell so my soul would one day see everyone in management burn in the pit. As it stands, I'm already so angry with that place that it takes an exhausting level of mental/emotional energy not to lose it or go into panic attacks from how much it hurts not to lose it on them when I feel there's no hell cruel enough for what management at that place deserves after leaving the office open with no financial support to employees through every national disaster since they opened and now this. They're not some struggling Mom and Pop that can't afford to close; they're just greedy. They look for and exploit as many legal loopholes as they can to cheat us with insurance prices and treat us like garbage. I keep thinking I know how depraved they are, and they still keep sinking in my estimation. 

And I can't ask my roommate/landlord what his plan is if I can't pay rent because he just had a heart attack and is completely tuning this all out. I feel bad for even wanting to have this conversation with him, but I am struggling with having to "wait and see" whether I'll soon be better off dead than alive. 

Ever since the domestic violence situation ended in 2017, leaving me with no financial support in the world (my only family was physically/sexually/emotionally abusive, and I cut ties years ago), I've felt like it was only a matter of time before my vain attempts to make a living would fall through and I'd be homeless or dead. Everyone else has someone they could turn to in the worst case scenario of losing a job or what-have-you, OR they have a savings account with money in it. I don't. At most, I'm only ever able to put away a bit of one-time emergency savings, which I tend to need within 1-2 months of putting it away. 

I strongly suspect that if I succumb to the illness or to starvation or otherwise lose everything, I won't be mourned by that many people. A few people will care, a little bit, but they'll get over it relatively quickly. No one knows how hard it is to get by with no family, no friends who really have your back, and no concrete idea why you're even still here on this Earth. The truth is, no one's worried about me. At least not anyone who can help. 

All the articles say, "Oh, if you think no one cares, you're wrong uWu." Except I'm not wrong. Truly, no one cares.

I keep asking anyone I can, PLEASE, what can I do? What would you do? What the fuck is someone even supposed to do in a situation where leaving the house is the worst you can do for yourself, yet I will lose my home/car/everything else if I don't continue to work. I've been doing alright with managing suicidal thoughts for a while, but now it feels like most likely, I'm going to die no matter what. 

I wanted to live to see the day when I would truly there was something to live for. I wanted to find love eventually. I wanted to fully recover from trauma and see what it's like to not be at war with myself. I wanted to realize my career goals I was working toward. I was so close to things turnign around, and now it looks like I'll never have the chance. 

I mean, if even the Republicans are talking about backing UBI at this point, then surely help must be coming. We just don't know. 

I know I'm strong/capable. I have survived so many deadly things in my life that honest to God for it to come down to, "Well, she couldn't pay her rent, so things fell apart," would be really, really sad. Starvation and all the things that happen to homeless people are both terrible ways to go, yet I feel that may be what's coming to me now. It seems the entire world is going to collapse. The economy will be ruined. I'm scared my therapist who sees me pro bono due to my income won't be able to anymore because she'll need the money from someone who can actually pay her. And people are saying this could last for more than a year...that there's no end in sight, and we're just going to suffer until it's over. I am so scared and so, so angry that no one fucking cares, and it's really come down to me possibly losing everything over something that was completely out of my control when I've done more than can be reasonably asked of a person to save myself over the past while. Fuck this system. Fuck this world for that matter. 

(Not going to go do something - not at that point quite yet. Just hurting a lot).
