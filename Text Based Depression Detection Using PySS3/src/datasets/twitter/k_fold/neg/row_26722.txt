Feeling suicidal for a very long time now. My coping mechanisms dont best reality anymore and i feel so guilty because of what happened todayI don't want to die feeling guilty. I planned to off myself on the 28th and I still want to. I've written a lot on Reddit over the past few days about everything and yeah. Idk Thursday it is. Anyway I ended up essentially telling a real close friend about my feelings and so idk I feel SO SHIT about it like honestly imagine if I picked Tuesday anyway it's whatever I just would like some advice about how to pass peacefully as possible. My life hasn't been so great and I want it to end in the quietest way possible and without all my thoughts. I need to not feel guilty. I've been telling people I've been thinking of moving away so I can disappear or something which sounds far fetched but I know how to die and go missing.

How to I not feel guilty and get her to think I'm not dying and literally nothing is her fault she's an angel.
