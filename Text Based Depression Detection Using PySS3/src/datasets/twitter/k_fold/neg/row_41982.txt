How can I help my girlfriend?My girlfriend has been cutting herself for some time now and just recently said that â€œpeople would be happier if I wasnâ€™t here.â€ Thatâ€™s obviously EXTREMELY concerning to me. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to her, tell her how happy she makes me, and when weâ€™re together in person we have an amazing time. Whenever she is alone is when she starts cutting.

Iâ€™ve asked her to talk to a professional, and she claims she has and it didnâ€™t help (weâ€™ve only been dating a short time now, so Iâ€™m not sure if this is true or not). I really need advice on how to help her. 

Just some insight, I personally have no idea what she could be upset about. She has money, is a college athlete, a loving family, pets to keep her company, great friends, devoted Christian. I canâ€™t think of anything that she would be upset about enough to harm herself.

Please help me out guys and give some advice!
