Transgender Woman, thinking about suicide at least once a dayIs there any place here on reddit where I can get help? I can't see my therapist atm because I can't afford to see her and my parents won't help me pay for it because she's encouraging me to transition.

I don't have a plan but I do volunteer as a paramedic so it's very possible for me to just improvise it basically whenever. It's seeming more and more attractive and I'm scared of what I'll do once I don't see any other way (So far drowning it out with memes and shitty youtube videos works but that isn't a long-term solution)
