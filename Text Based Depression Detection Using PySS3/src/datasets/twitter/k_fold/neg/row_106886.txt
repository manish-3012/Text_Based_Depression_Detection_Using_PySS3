I Have Surrendered My Life To The UniverseI have surrendered my life to the universe. I am not going to live my life without my wife. I love her so much. Either we are going to be together, or I am going to end my life. I am at peace with either outcome. The universe gets to decide my fate now. I think I have a lot more positivity and joy to spread in the world, but thatâ€™s not my call anymore. Itâ€™s in the universeâ€™s hands now, and Iâ€™m ok with that.

Only a few days left. The sense of peace is surreal and beautiful. I am ready to go.
