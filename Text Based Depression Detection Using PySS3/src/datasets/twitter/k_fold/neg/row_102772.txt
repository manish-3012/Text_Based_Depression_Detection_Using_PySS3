I must be punishedDoes anyone else feel like they are not allowed to be alive and happy without being deprived of something or punished in someway? I feel like I shouldnâ€™t let myself be happy and punishment-free when others are suffering in the world. I need to starve myself or always sleep in a horribly uncomfortable place or SOMETHING that will make me suffer. I shouldnâ€™t be allowed to be happy. I need to suffer.
