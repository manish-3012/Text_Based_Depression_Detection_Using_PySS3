My soul hurts so muchI'm at my lowest point of my depression. Suicidal thoughts are on my mind all the time and I keep searching for ways to kill myself but I can't take any action about it. Currently, I'm experiencing the worst feeling I have ever dealt with and it isn't just mentally pain anymore no, it starting to affect me physically too
I'm tried of living like this, I don't want to be alive anymore. I hope I'll snap and kill myself soon so I can finally be free from depression, anxiety and trauma
I know I'm better off dead but I still can't kill myself because I'm nothing but a coward
