Suicide is the best thing ever, we can escape anytime!I just hate life. It's the worst thing ever. I never choose to be born. I hate those people who have good life and they give us advices. It's just like Einstein telling a man with 75 IQ to keep pursuing maths and physics. Some people are destined to be losers and some are destined to be rich. 1000 billionaires cantrol the world and wealth. We are just slaves of 1 percent. We were born with fucked up genetics of our ancestors. Life has no value. Happiness is temporary due to dopmaine. Dopmaine is happiness. Suicide is the greatest gift ever. We can escape anything. After death, no regrets no pain. Suicide is beautiful. Suicide will solve everything. People with low IQ, ugly looks should commit suicide. I have low IQ as well I am ugly. Life is useless. Life is shit. I don't want to improve. I can't improve. I am fixed by my genetic caps. I was born with fucked up intelligence and looks. I have no personality nor self-respect. I make same mistake millions of times. Some people are just born losers, can't improve.
