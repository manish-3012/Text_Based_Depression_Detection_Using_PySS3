Exams make me want to dieI'm 16, f, and living in England. I'm taking my gcses (need to pass to get into the last bit of school before uni) in 3 weeks and I started revising 3 weeks ago but all I've managed to get through is half of my English. I still need to do biology, media and maths. I genuinely can't see how I'm meant to do this. I don't understand how I can possibly pass. I'm struggling with the idea of going no where in life and all that existential crap that comes with exams and depression. I just feel so hopeless and scared and overwhelmed. 
Just needed to vent but feel free to reply or join in with the rant.
GCSEs are hard.
