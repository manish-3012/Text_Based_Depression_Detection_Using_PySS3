I need some help. Please give me some reasons to live.I've struggled with severe depression for ages. I have a shit load of anxiety and I hate everything about myself and my life. I know I should be happy because I have been given so many good things, but I'm very not happy. I want to die so badly and I've been considering it for months now and every time I think about it I think about what a relief it would be to not have to deal with anything anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I love my little sister and it would destroy her if I did that. It's such a selfish thing to want to kill yourself, but I really really just want everything to go away. Everyone says "It will get better eventually, just suck it up". Yeah well it's been  10 fucking months and nothing is better. Please give me some hope reddit. I'm at the end of my rope and I need something to keep me going. 

Edit:Just also wanted to mention I've been receiving therapy for 9 months and have gone through several depression medications and yet I feel like I have no one to talk to. I hate sounding so pathetic, but I need some fucking help.

Edit 2: Thank you guys for replying. I think most of all I just needed to talk to someone to feel like I was not alone.
