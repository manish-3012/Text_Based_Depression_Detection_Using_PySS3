Scared at how ok I am with doing itSo I watched a show tonight that the main character killed himself, most of the times I watch things like this and it makes me upset, and see why it's a bad idea, however tonight I felt differently. I was thinking about how much pain I feel almost every day, and how I wouldn't feel bad about how upset it would make my family if I did do it but how I actually want them to feel pain, I want them to see how much pain they have put me through.
I know this is probably really messed up, but sometimes I just feel no one knows what I'm going through inside my head and maybe if I could share the pain or make someone feel just as bad it would make me feel better.
