IÂ´m ashamed of existingEvery year it gets worse, I used to just feel bad about the past or how I acted in a certain situation. There were aspects of me I disliked but I found ways to make it bearable, gave myself reasons to keep going, but I canÂ´t take it anymore. IÂ´ve reached the point where being "me" is painfull.
