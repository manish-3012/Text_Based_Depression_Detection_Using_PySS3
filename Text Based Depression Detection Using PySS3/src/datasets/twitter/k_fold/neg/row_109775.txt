Loneliness Is Torturing Me.I hate venting in public but seems that there's no other way. I'm a 19-year-old female.

I have been alone almost all my life and I'm so tired of it. I also remember being suicidal since I was around 7. As I get older I get more suicidal. I find myself thinking all the time everyday that I want to die and thinking of ways I should kill myself but I'm a coward so I'm too scared to do it. I go to sleep everyday hoping I will never wake up again but it sadly happens. I don't see any point of me being alive. I used to think that I should be alive to make my dream come true but I know that dream I have doesn't even make any sense. I'm a huge mess with too many problems and my life feels like nothing but torture and I can't even cry as I lost that ability years ago. I live with my mum who makes my life much harder than it already is.

I have always wished I had a big brother that I feel like crying all the time cause I don't have one. I have been trying to find that special big brother online for many years but I always lose them after getting too attached to them which made me sure whenever I make a new friend that I will lose them. I still can't get over the loss of an online big brother who hasn't been replying to any message I send since October 2014. What makes it harder is that I know it's my fault. He is so tired of me for being really codependent on him during the time we were friends. 

I feel totally alone in this world. I don't have a single person who I consider my friend or anyone  who is close to me. It really scares me how I'm stuck alone with the person I hate the most (myself). I don't even get the chance to self-harm anymore cause if my mum finds out she will call me stupid. I wish I could just lose control and kill myself. I'm so weak and pitiful.
