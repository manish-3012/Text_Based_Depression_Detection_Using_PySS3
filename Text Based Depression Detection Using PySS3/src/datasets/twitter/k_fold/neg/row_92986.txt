I am a useless piece of shit.I head off to college in fall of 2017, and I have nothing to offer the world. As an artist and writer, everything I love is useless--and so I've come to the crossroads of being successful but hating my life, or being dirt poor and starving on the streets because I tried to live the life I love.

Quite honestly, I'm seriously considering suicide once I finish my senior year. My family is middle class but can't afford the colleges I would want to go to, and I'm too mediocre to get any sort of scholarship. I used to be the top member of my class, involved in a bunch of activities, and on my way to having a successful writing career. Now I'm not even in the top ten percent, involved in only one thing, and haven't written in two years. I am worthless, and I am a mediocre piece of trash who has no road to happiness in life. I can either be starving and broke doing what I enjoy, and wondering about what could have been if I chose success instead of happiness, or I can be successful but cry myself to sleep every night because I'll wonder what would have happened if I chose happiness instead of success.

I'm seriously considering killing myself after the end of senior year. It would save my parents the money and me the trouble of a life doomed to misery and failure.
