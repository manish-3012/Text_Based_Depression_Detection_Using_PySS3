What do i do now?My whole life ever since i was little i dedicated my life to being a professional football player. In HS I made a name for myself and got full-ride offers from most PAC-12 schools, I accepted at WSU cause it was a dream of mine. My senior year of HS i got arrested and lost all my offers. I ended up walking on and grinding my way back to a scholarship. in college lead my team to a bowl game victory and was told by everyone around me that i was destined for the league. Then three close freinds of mine from back home all committed suicide within weeks of eachother, i was broken. I couldnt take any time off from being a student-athlete to go to funerals or morn. I had just started my final season in college and i was a dark cloud.  I tried to kill myself in hotel room before we played Minnesota but my coach caught me. When we got back from Minnesota they took me to hospital and committed me. I lied and told the doc's whatever i could so i could get out of there. When i got home i tried agian but realized i couldnt. then came the despair. waking up every morning sad that your still alive, wanting to kill yourself with everything around you but you just cant. the constant cycle of depression. to pathetic to even kill myself. After awhile i got better and got invited to training camp with a NFL team. DIdnt make it, then had a tryout for CFL team, didnt make it. Now at the age of 25 I have no job a sham of an education and no motivation I dont know what to do. I always thought i would kill myself before i got to this point in my life but idk anything anymore. All i do know is im a failure and I would like nothing more then to disappear like i was never even here.
