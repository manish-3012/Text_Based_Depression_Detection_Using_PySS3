I will write a note todayI don't know if I will ever use it. Just in case...

My pain is so deep. I get blamed for so many things I never  did and the good things I did are all suddenly forgotten.

They remember stuff wrong. They don't remember stuff at all. They are hypocrites. But I guess, the new people are just more interesting and better for some reason even tho I was there all the time, it's basically worth nothing.

There is nobody you can trust. They all lie. They all leave. They simply don't care.

I'm never good enough. Not for any single soul. I'm just too sensitive and never care for myself. I'm sorry. I really wished I would just not care.

I'm forgotten. I was never there but now, everything just completely disappeared in front of me.
