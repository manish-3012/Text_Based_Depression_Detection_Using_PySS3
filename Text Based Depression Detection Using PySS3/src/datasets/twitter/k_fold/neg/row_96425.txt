I'm not youngI see a lot if posts about young people wanting to die, but I am depressed but in my 50s.  I've tried it before a few times in my life. So called friends abandoned me after the attempts.   My main thing is financial. I also drink.  Am facing homelessness.  No family no friends, no kids, no husband.  Just a dog.  (Dog can stay with my boyfriend).
