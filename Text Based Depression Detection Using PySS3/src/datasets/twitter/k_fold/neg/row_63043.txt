I donâ€™t wanna live in a never ending nightmare anymore. I just want to kill myself. (UPDATE)Iâ€™ve really taken some time to consider what I said.

I always know it can get better, and after talking to a lot of friends and my family, Iâ€™m okay for now.
Thank you to the people who helped me out, I really canâ€™t thank you enough. ðŸ’œ
