I fantasize of that dayI would write a letter. Tell my family I'm going on a short vacation with my friend. Leave it somewhere they can find it, along with the very few physical things I love.

I'd catch a plane and visit my online friend - we've chatted for the past 10 years. I'd have a letter for him too, but I'd want to deliver it personally.

Then I'd catch another plane into a very isolated, small Canadian town. I was there last year. The temperatures are very low. 

I'd take my antidepressants and I'd walk out. In the night. The cold would kill me after a few hours. The beauty, that I have already seen, would be everything I want to see when I leave.

I think of all this, and I feel happy. It's not a plan for now - I'm waiting for my mom to go, first. I realized I can't do it while she's still alive. I've accepted to live as whatever I will be in the next few years. I don't have any ambitions - the bare minimum is fine. 

But I dream of it when it gets too hard. Somehow, it feels like the only time in my life I would actually feel happy and in control.
