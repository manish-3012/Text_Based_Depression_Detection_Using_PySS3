Donâ€™t give upIf you think no one cares, youâ€™re wrong. Your mom will walk into your room and scream and cry and try to wake you up. Your dad will run in and hold your moms hand as  they cry. Your siblings will be at school crying in the bathrooms because something reminded them of you. When your principal announces it to the school, your friends will all break out in tears. That one kid that bullied you will run out and scream, unable to cry. Your boyfriend/girlfriend will cry for weeks, unable to eat, sleep, or even shower. After your funeral, your family will sit in the living room in complete silence, unable to say a word. Whether you know it or not, people care about you, people you donâ€™t expect.
