Girlfriend needs space...i recentky had an attempt and im not scared to do it now.Girlfriend left me. Said she didnt think id change. That it was us that was the problem. I didnt want to lose her. Ive already been depressed. Ive had a rough life. But now im completely alone. I want her back. But i dont know if she will. I guess my question is,how can i change. She said im a miserable person. What can i do? What can i say? If i dont get her back then im gonna leave this world. She told me she still cared. But i dont. I attemoted a few weeks ago. I know its painless. Im not scared anymore.
