No wordsI wanna die but I haven't thought of how yet. I was driving a couple nights ago and I just thought of all the crazy shit i could do "completely sober" before dying so the paper would have something cool to write. I don't wanna hurt anybody and the anxiety I feel from everything I do makes me honestly wanna crush my own head. I feel empty one moment and fine the second there's eyes on me. I don't know if I actually genuinely feel depressed or if I'm playing some big mindgame with myself for sympathy and too hide my toxicity. I want attention when I'm alone but when its given i wanna dig a hole to suffocate in. Its weird bouncing from "the whole world fucking hates me and wants me dead" and "your thoughts are not correct and you're overthinking it. its like there's two brains in me, one is a psychopathic depressive and the other is my own reality. I don't know how to talk to anyone about this without feeling like shit or not getting to the point. I wanna die, but its weird thinking about telling people because what do i expect them to do? believe me?  I have heard and repeated every cliche platitude and done all the "correct" thinking and I still fall into the spirals. I don't know what to do. I feel trapped and too exposed, I feel like the most evil person to the biggest victim ever. I dont know what i want cause i dont know if this is for me or if its to get help but i just dont know where to begin. I dont have insurance to cover anything and i still have to live with my parents. I just feel like no one will get it. and ik its isolating and that some people can sympathize and others objectively might have a "worse" scenario, but jesus fucking christ its like my brain is being ripped apart.
