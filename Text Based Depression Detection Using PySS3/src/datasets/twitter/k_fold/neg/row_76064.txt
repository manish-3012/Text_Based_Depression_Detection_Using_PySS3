I've been thinking...So recently I've been thinking about suicide, the context is I have no mental illness (at least diagnosed) and I have noticed that, over time I have lost myself, subtle changes but there, in the corner of my eye, creeping in. I remember I used to be the cutest little guy you've ever seen, compassionate, wiser than most kids my age, loving my family, but then my family got hit with heroin/alcohol addictions, blow after blow after blow and it was the worst years if my life, but hey! Everyone moved on, it's all ok now, right? Well I want it to be but a six year old can only take so much before they break. I'm 13 now and everyone seems ok except me, so back to the beginning, I had noticed that over those trying times I went from that amazing Charasmatic kid to the balls to the walls idiot. This year at school I finally solidified a friend group but I feel ashamed on the inside that I've put up a bubble around myself and it's surrounded with traps don't step to close to the door or it will hit you on the ass, and nobody has ever made it that far because it's always hilarious jokes with me but I have a hard time trying to put it into an analogy because I've spent so long hiding it it's become deep, only shown is bits and pieces through the cracks, and now I've pushed away my closest friend because I'm jealous of their vulnerability, (this is all from them) their dad is an alcoholic that sometimes beats them just cause of that being the norm, like they use headlocks instead of hugs and their mother and brother verbally abuse them. But the thing about that tangent is that they have so many friends to talk to and voice about and I was so jealous about them not having a shell that I pushed them away. All of this leads up to me thinking that the whole world would be better off without my presence and hatred for the open. I haven't even cried hard in at least 2 years, my mother is the only one who I let past my traps but I'm afraid that once she reaches for that doorknob she's gonna get launched away and I'm gonna be all alone again, sad boy with nobody looking deep enough because he doesn't let them.

Thank you for hearing me out, all I want is to go back to who I was and reclaim what life was stolen from me 

Sorry it's so long
