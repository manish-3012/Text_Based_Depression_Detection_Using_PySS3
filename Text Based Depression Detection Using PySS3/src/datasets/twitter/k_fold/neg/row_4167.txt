I'm sick of it.People pretend they give a shit in the real world. Suicide is the biggest killer of 19-50 year old's and that statistic is about to be satisfied. My life is lonely and worthless. No one really gives a shit when I tell them how I feel and friends have left me and avoided me because of how I feel. No one understands and they think they're helping by saying "I'm sorry" and "I hope it gets better" yet they then never converse with me henceforth. At least I have a very small amount of friends left (Not an awful lot of people would give a shit about a plane of existence without me) which I somehow turned away by being nice to. Truth is, it doesn't get better. There are so many good people in this world and I can at least take solace in the fact that I was one when I leave it. Sorry.
