How to support a friend after an unsuccessful suicide attempt?I'm not sure of this is the best place to post this and please let me know if it's not and I'll delete it.

A good friend of mine attempted suicide earlier this week but luckily was unsuccessful. 

This isn't something I have encountered before and I am unsure what support she needs and what I can provide. 

Does anyone have any advice or research that they could share with me? 

Is there any support that you wish you had received but hadn't? 

Thank you
