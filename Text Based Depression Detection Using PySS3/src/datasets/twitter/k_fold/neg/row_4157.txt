A thoughtIâ€™m a quarter through my life, give or take. If I was meant to be happy, I have at best half of the next quarter to become happy (whatever that means.) if Iâ€™ve had no idea from day one what that is, what realistically are the odds that Iâ€™ll find it in the most stressful portion for most? Most people by know know what or who makes them happy. I thought I did but she had better plans. Now I stalk my momâ€™s Facebook to see what posts sheâ€™s been liking even though w be been split for a year. 

It all just feels hopeless. If it wouldnâ€™t fuck over a ton of people, a head dive off my balcony sounds wonderful.
