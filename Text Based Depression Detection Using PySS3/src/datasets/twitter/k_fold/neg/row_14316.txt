All I want is to be recognized as the child I am.Just because I've lived 23 years doesn't mean I'm automatically an adult. The word "adult" is a social construct anyway that is defined by what our lawmakers feel. Why can't I just be a kid? This breaks my heart and makes me wish I was dead every single day. I love the dynamic between adults and kids, and wish so badly to be on the kid end of that. Is trans-age a real thing? Because that's literally how I feel. I feel that everything about my adult body is wrong, and I would give just about anything to revert back to my prepubescent, childlike frame. 

I'm just a little girl who needs help and love, but nobody sees that. All they see is an adult woman who should be able to take care of herselfâ€“which couldn't be further from the truth.
