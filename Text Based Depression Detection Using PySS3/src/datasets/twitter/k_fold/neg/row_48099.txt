suicidal for the first time in a whilei feel guilty for feeling this way. i feel like i canâ€™t talk to anyone about it. people who ive talked to abt suicide in the past say they donâ€™t want to encourage or entertain these thoughts so they donâ€™t really pay attention to my suicidal tendencies anymore. 

i mean it now, though. i donâ€™t think id ever kill myself. not over holiday break. 

but i feel so alone.

i donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about this. i donâ€™t want to upset my family or my boyfriend or my â€œfriendsâ€. Iâ€™m sure they donâ€™t even like me anymore.

I feel so empty. I just want to be heard.
