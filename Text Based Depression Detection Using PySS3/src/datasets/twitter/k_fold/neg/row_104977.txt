I don't want to live until 30Next Tuesday, on the 23rd I will be 26. I have failed at life, and feel like a lazy waste using up space. I went to college and majored in history just because it was the easiest thing to do. Never really had any drive for anything, just figured it would be the easiest route to take so I could at least get a degree and have plenty of time for video games!

Nothing makes me truly happy. I can never been an adult and have a career and family. I don't think I really want to. Since I graduated four years ago I did not work for one year, worked for one at a K-Mart, and have worked for two as a paraeducator. Basically an aide in a classroom who stands around doing nothing and only occasionally helps. I did want to used to be a teacher, but I can't find the motivation anymore.

It's helpless. Kids will never listen to me. I was enrolled in a master's program but dropped out two years in a row. I'm not motivated to do anything in my life, I just want it to be over. Before I turn 30 I just want to acquire some fentanyl (not sure how to spell it) or anything else that will make me go out peacefully. I want to be in the woods while I do it and look at a sunset, and that will be it.

I've been wanting to do this for a long time, since high school. I never felt like I was right for life. And now I just can't make it as an adult. For three years the amount of money I earned was $10K, $11K, and now $15K. That's a failure of an adult. I just toss responsibilities away. The only things I've been living for my whole life are Star Wars and video games, neither of which make me happy and even mean anything.

Every time I get into a vehicle I hope someone hits me. I just want to be gone. I really see no point to anything.
