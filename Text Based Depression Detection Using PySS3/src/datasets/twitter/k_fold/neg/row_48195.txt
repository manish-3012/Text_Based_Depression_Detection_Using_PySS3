I don't want to leave my parents but I'm sick of being aliveI'm so fucking tired, I just want to end it all. But my parents gave me such an amazing childhood, I can't just go. That would be betrayal. I go on for them. I suffer for them every day. I don't know how much longer I can take it. Even those stupid pills aren't working like they're supposed to. I'm an only child and our apartment is small so my parents have me on-watch 24/7 so I can't even fucking cut myself without them seeing me attempt to do it and stopping me. I just hope I get hit my a truck or get in some accident that won't be my fault, so it can finally suddenly be over.
