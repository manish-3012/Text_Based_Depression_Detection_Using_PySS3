Before I died I need to tell my storyThis is my life, It's a long sad story but one I must tell to someone. I was born a middle kid into a middle class family. My parents we're my first abusers. My Dad was an alcoholic. He beat me and my brother. Some nights were good and he just listen to music. My mom was not much better. She was abuse by my dad but she abuse him emotionally and financially. They were bad for each other.  

Around the third grade I was diagnosed with autism. The testing was very traumatic. This was when I first experience gender dysphoria. In the waiting room the only VHS that worked was Alice in Wonderland. I wanted to be Alice. She could handle her new world and I couldn't handle mine. 

My parent just filled me with pills from than till high school. The pill made me slow and fat. It was easier to dope me up than to be a parent. This lead to me getting up to 400 LBS and I develop boob. (I'm a guy) I've spent my whole adult life trying to get fit because of this. It's one of my biggest failures. 

At 17 I was raped. My friends got me drunk and payed a girl to have sex with me. It happen at a party. I've only told my therapist. I still can't talk about. There's no proof left too, so one one would believe me. 

Collage was a failure to. I didn't know I had BPD and depression. I still didn't talk about being rape. I let it build up inside me. I than met my Ex. She was great at first than became emotionally,verbally, and sexually abusive. I hide her from friends and family. 

I spend the next three years in deep denial. This come out in a phone sex and cam girl addiction. It'd been a year and I can't stop. I've spend $10,000.  There's no coming back from all this. I'm stuck at a dead end job. My life is forfeit. There's no coming back from all this.
