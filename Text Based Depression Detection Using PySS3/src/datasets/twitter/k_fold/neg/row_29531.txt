I almost died but doctors said it was a miracle I livedI took a bunch of xanax pills and went out of home and that's it. Next morning woke up in a hospital and they said I had an overdose by mixing benzos and heroin. A friend of mine and me arrived at the same time since we both passed out but he didn't make it, he passed next to me when i was unconscious. More than 2 of the doctors who treated me told me they thought i was gonna die but for some reason my body made it through and they say it was a miracle. woow
