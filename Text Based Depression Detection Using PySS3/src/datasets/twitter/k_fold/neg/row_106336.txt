I'm leaving.I will be leaving this sub in 4 days. 2020 is make it or break it for me. I'm going to make a huge effort to turn it around this year, no drinking, no negativity. Back to the doctors. This sub is good if you are down there, but sometimes I'm scrolling through reddit and laugh at a video or something and I come across a post from this sub and the smile is instantly wiped from my face because I relate so much. So I'm trying this new approach. I wish you all the best guys and gal's.
