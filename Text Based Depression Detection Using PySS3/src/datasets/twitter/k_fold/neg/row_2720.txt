I think I've made up my mindLife is too painful. Just surviving through each day is getting so difficult. I'm tired of everything but most importantly feeling so alone in this world no matter how hard I try. I know that nothing will change at this point. It's only a matter of time. Nothing or any importance or worth will be lost. I'll finally be free of these demons.
