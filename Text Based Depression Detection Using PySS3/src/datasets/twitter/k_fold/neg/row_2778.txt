I lost everything, and have nothing to look forward toLast month, my girlfriend of 3 1/2 years broke up with me. I understand why. I was an asshole a lot of the time, and she wanted something different. She was my everything, and I thought I was hers, but I guess not. I truly do want her to be happy, but thinking about it, I highly doubt she thinks that means me. Im only 19, and I'm sure I'd at some point I'd find someone "better", but all I want is her. I've tried to get better and be better in hopes of being a bit happier and maybe getting back together with her (exercising, getting a job, making new friends, therapy, etc) but each thing that goes "well" in my life makes me feel more and more like shit. I wake up depressed and force myself to put on smile and talk normally to people in my class, but it's getting increasingly difficult. All I want to do is talk to Audrey. Just tell her about my day, and ask about hers, but she doesn't even want to talk to me anymore. I'm terrified of the thought of ending my own life because I know it'll hurt my mom and quite possibly put my dad in the hospital, but honestly, when I think about death, or put a knife up to my throat, it's the only time I feel calm. I know it's selfish, but I just can't continue on like this. I've written letters to the few people in my life that mean something to me and plan to jump off a cliff she and I loved going to tomorrow. Thanks for reading this. I guess this is some sort of last ditch effort at finding a reason to live.
