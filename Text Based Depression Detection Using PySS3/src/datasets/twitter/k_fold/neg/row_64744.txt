How do I live with myself when I hurt the person I loved the mostTitle. I made a huge mistake and now the love of my life is contemplating leaving. I broke her, I hurt her, and i feel she will never forgive me. I feel ashamed. I feel like I'm worthless. I feel like I just hurt everybody close to me. I feel like I dont deserve this life because of that. How do I live with myself knowing I broke the purest heart I've ever seen.
