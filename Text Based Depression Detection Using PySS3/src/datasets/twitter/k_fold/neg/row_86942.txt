Should I stay or go?Iâ€™m sitting on the couch trying to make a decision. My life here has become unbearable. No one wants me around, and I will soon be unemployed. I would rather live homeless out of my car with my dogs than stay with a family who doesnâ€™t want me. Iâ€™ve been calling and texting my support network for the past hour and no one has answered. 

I donâ€™t want to die and this is my only other option. 

I have a packed bag and a full tank of gas. My dogs are eager to get going. 

Should I leave?
