Is being too lazy a valid reason for suicide?I have no plan on going to college (I've gone to one abroad, but I didn't study at all and soon I dropped out) or doing a trade, I have no energy except for going to work and coming home to lay in bed all day and watching shows on my laptop. I have no ambitions, no desire to do any hobbies - basically I hate learning anything, I find reading boring, listening to educational talks boring, doing complex shit boring and too hard. Everything is just fucking boring or requires effort.

I think I'm pampered and I keep whining about my "problems" on the Internet, because I can't be bothered to move my arse to fix anything. 

Before you ask - no, I don't want to make video games (programming is stupid and boring anyway) and no, I don't like anything in particular (I used to like video games, but now I'm too lazy to play them. I buy one every once in a while, but it doesn't take long for me to get bored.)

I'm just a nobody. I have nothing to work towards, I'm dumb to grasp basic concepts like taxes (and have no desire to learn about it.) or my laws. I don't even fucking know who my politicians are.

And yes, I'm writing this out of attention, since I'm powerless to do something about it.
