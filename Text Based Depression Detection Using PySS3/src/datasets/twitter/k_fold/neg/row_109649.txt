Need advice on how to work up the nerve to kill myself.Well, as the title says, I need some advice on how to overcome this wall of fear that's in the way of me pulling the trigger (metaphorically speaking since I don't have a gun)

Anyone have any suggestions? I have a plan that I'm sure will work, I just need to get through this mental block and actually do it.
