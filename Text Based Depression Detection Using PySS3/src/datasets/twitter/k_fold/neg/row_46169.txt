Why should I continue?I was first diagnosed with depression when I was 13.   I was put on medication.  For the rest of my life, on and off, I've been in talk therapy, in and out of inpatient programs and outpatient programs, CBT and DBT, on more medications than I can name, and diagnosed with a handful of acronyms.  I've been hospitalized 5 times.  

I've achieved some things.  I graduated from college, eventually.  I'm licensed in some sports, I've traveled overseas, moved across the country doing this and that.  I'll keep it together for about six months to a year, but then another mental break will hit and I'll lose my shit and go back in therapy or make another radical career change or move.  

What makes it different this time?  I lost everything again.  My family hasn't talked to me in over a year, I have only my friends.  I'm unemployed and, for the first time, applying to social programs.  I got a job offer but turned it down after I had another breakdown and starting cutting myself again.  I can't be employed right now.  

I just don't see the point.  Even if I get myself back on track *again,* I will never be rid of this.  I'm stuck with this disease forever and it will NEVER go away.  I'll have a few good  months, maybe a pretty okay year, but it will ALWAYS come back and I'll lose EVERYTHING all over again and I'm just sick of the cycle.  There's no way of breaking it and I just don't see the point. 

If there was a light at the end of the tunnel, it would be different.  But there's not.  There's nothing.  There is no end to this, ever.  

They tell me I have to learn to live with my illness.

Why?

Why can't I chose just not to live at all?
