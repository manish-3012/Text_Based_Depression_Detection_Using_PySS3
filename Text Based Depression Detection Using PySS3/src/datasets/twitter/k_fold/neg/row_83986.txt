I have actually had the worst 2 weeks of my life and I am not sure any normal person would not want to die.My troubles all began 2 weeks ago with my grandmother admitted to a hospital in Florida for a brain injury from a fall. My mother flew down to be with her in hospital, meanwhile I find out my ex-fiance and still close friend committed suicide, a day later my aunt stabbs herself in my parents house while my mom is away and blames my father for it and he is taken into the police station and questioned. My former friend then takes it upon herself after seeing all the sympathy I am getting on my facebook wall to get me fired from the job I have worked in for 8 years... to which yesterday she was successful. I file a police complaint for harassment against her to which the officer stated that it looked like criminal harassment, upon him giving it to a detective he determined no its not harassment. Since the police called her she has been non stop harassing me and mocking the fact that she got me fired from my job. I have since had to leave my semester at university with 3 weeks left because lets face it for the last week I haven't left bed except to go to a police station.

Now on top of the stress of my friend killing themselves, my aunt stabbing herself, my nana having brain surgery and losing my job all in a week and a half I am wondering why I shouldnt die.

I have nothing left. Honestly. This is not a throw away account i am 100% real here.

I can't afford to pay my rent now, I have no food, like my life is fucked. Only people who may be sad over my departure: a few friends, maybe some cousins. People who will get over it quick.

Honestly I need reasons why I should live... my life seems to not have any at the moment.
