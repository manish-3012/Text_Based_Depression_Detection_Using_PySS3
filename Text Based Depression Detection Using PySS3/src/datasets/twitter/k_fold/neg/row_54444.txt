Only want to tell people about my suicidal life, but I'm afriadFirst to say: I am not suicidal right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a male in early 20'. I first tried to kill myself when I was around 10/11 y/o. I grew up without a father and I would say that is my reason for being suicidal, I also propably have some kind of lighter version of bipolar syndrom. I can go from happy to suicidal on like a second. Often I am depressed/suicidal for a few weeks to 6 months. Then I am happy for a few week to a few months, and then it starts over. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I have been "happy" for around 4 weeks after coming out a 6 month depression. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think that the suicidal parts of my life, all the dark places I have been too, the fucked up thoughts etc are very interesting. I sometimes when I am happy, want to experience it again. Right now is like that, I am completely  fascinated about suicide and how someone can want to kill him or herself, i have been trying and went through this more than I can count for over 10 years now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have told my suicidal life to 3 people in my life, one is my  therapist. One of them have moved away far away. So there is one friend in my life that knows this about me. No one in my family knows about it. Btw I hate my family. I should not even be a live, I should never have been born, life would have been much better then. My mom got togheter with a real playboy late in life, after been togheter with him for a few years (he cheated at least 10 times and had kids prior to me.) He left my mom, a few months later they ran into each other downtown, my mom through herself over him and wanted to fuck, they fucked, she got pregnant.) I hate my mom so much for this that I sometimes want to kill myself only to make her sad, to make her bad decision useless. (Started to cry now) Growing up without a father was fucking awful. My mom still loves my "father." She have not fucked or been with a male since that day over 20 years ago. She is what one would call an Alpha widow. I have been growing up with an immense anger my entire life, and I still have an immense anger. Sometimes I feel so much anger that I do not know what to do, sometimes I speed my car or bike until the car/bike does not go faster. Sometimes I take a knife and cut myself. Now when I talk about it, I feel so much anger that I just want to jump out of the balcony. But I wont cuz I am not suicidal right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never rebelled or had a really big fight with my mom like most teenager do, I have never really expressed my anger against her, or how mad and disappointed I am on her for the decistion she did with my father.  I have moved pretty far away from her, which make me feel better, I often wish that she could die, I honestly do, done for many years. But my mom still calls me a few times a week, she misses me, she is now living alone. I never call her. I fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking hate her. 

I joined the military as soon as I could and joined an more elite unit, for a long part of my life I have dream of going to combat and die in combat, this I suppose is to make my mom sad. To get revenge on her.

&amp;#x200B;

When I am suicidal I feel like I am alive, I see life very differently than most people, I am willing to risk much more than most people. I am having a more profound life view and experience thanks to the suicidal mind. Sometimes, like right now, I almost get euphoric about it, like I want to be suicidal right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I want most in my life is to have a girlfriend or tell a male friend my entire story, I want it so fucking bad. But I am so scared for it. The first person I told it about, a chick, we got really close, she was however a friend, even though I wanted to be togheter with her, I was younger and dumber. She told me a lot, she was however suicidal too. But today we live far apart and it ended in a bang. But it was so great to have someone to talk to about it, who could understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

The second one was my therapist and the third a male friend, we are great friends but he does not understand.

I have a male cousin I could tell everything to. But I am afraid and he would not understand. One must have been suicidal to understand it, every girl I have dated I have never told anything about, I want it so bad, but I am so afraid that it will backfire or be used against me. Sometimes I have started to tell them about me not having a father, often they lose interest, hence I am so afraid of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I live far away from my family and my very few friends, but i only have 3 close friends, 2 are cousins. I have good work colleagues, but the town is super smal. There are no place to go to meet women etc, on Tinder there are 2 girls in the age 18-24. I feel very lonel, I have always felt lonely, like no one understand me. I just want to have a real friend or girlfriend to talk to, who you actually can tell your true self too. But In my experience, that is to much to ask for. In todays society everyone have so much to choose from, e.g. women on Tinder. 

I will propably be alone and kidsless when I die. 

Many times I really feel that life is pointless. The only true purpose I can see with life is to raise children. Some people have high goals etc. I have that too, but often I feel that they are really pointless, that everything is pointless. That the only thing that matters are relationship with other people. But today every single fucker in my age are on there phone instead of talking to each other. Especially women are on their phone all the time. Hence it makes getting to know people really hard. 

I have decided to not kill myself until I am 25y/o. I have not achieved certain things I will probably kill myself then. But honestly I might die before that, who knows and who cares. I will be lonely anyway, i have been fooled and fucked by life, by my mom, I have raised myself into a man. I realized that my mom was fucked up and though we shit and a skewed life view. I am still very affected by how she raised be, it takes time to reprogram this, but I have made huge progress. 

But I am still fucked for life, I am so tired in life on people always letting you down, every one have let me down. It is especially true when you feel like shit and is suicidal. I try to have no expectation on people. But it is hard, one cannot have a close relationship without expectations.

I just want a girlfriend or a male friend that I can talk to about this, that doesn't skew me over. But i am so afraid,

  I am lonely, lo and behold
