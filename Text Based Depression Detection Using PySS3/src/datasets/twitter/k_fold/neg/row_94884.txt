The only time I feel at peace is when I am thinking about suicideI know that sounds dramatic, but it's true. I feel like there's just a constant black cloud, a constant feeling of stress and anxiety about everything. A constant feeling of self-loathing and disregard. I hate who I am as a person, and so does everyone else, it seems, despite my best efforts. I wish I was someone else, in a different life. Constantly thinking of who I pissed off and how I fucked up. The world's gone to shit, and I have no place in it. It's like my mind is a tornado of black thoughts, black ideas, I have a lot of things I in theory enjoy doing and I can't even bring myself to do them, I have no desire, no motivation. I don't want to DO anything, I just want to lay in bed. The entire year of 2020 has been a shit show on top of the usual and I don't know why I'm bothering to put up a charade any more.

The only time the knots in my chest let up is when I'm thinking of my death, and the freedom from the world. It's the only time I feel calm, that I feel that black weight lift, that I can allow myself to relax, the only time the sick feeling in my stomach goes away - Thinking of finally being free is the only time I'm not angry or self loathing. It's the one self-serving thing I think I can give myself that I actually deserve.
