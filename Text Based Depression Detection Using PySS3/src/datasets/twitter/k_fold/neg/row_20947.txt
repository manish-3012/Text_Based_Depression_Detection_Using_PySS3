Give me a reason to liveI feel like today is the day. I need a reason not to do it. I don't want to live anymore life just isn't worth it anymore. And don't tell me my family will be sad maybe they will but I need a purpose and a reason to live and someone to tell me that it can get better becuase I'm not having much hope that it will get better.
