Does it ever go away? Will it stop?I've been dealing with this for years. It's like it will never end. Shit tier insurance. nobody gets it or knows what to say when I do tell them. Don't blame them. Just don't want this anymore and I never did. They say it's the most selfish thing you can ever do because of the people around you but what about me god damnit. What if I'm over this. waiting around hoping it goes away and gets better is untrue because it doesn't. no talent and at the bottom of the ladder. too weird, cant converse with others.
