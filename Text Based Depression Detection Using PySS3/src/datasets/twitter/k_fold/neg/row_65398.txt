things havenâ€™t got betteriâ€™m 15, iâ€™m struggling to keep up with school work, trapped in a toxic household for god knows how much longer, and honestly not seeing the point in being here anymore. Two months ago i took an overdose of my mumâ€™s prescribed tablets, in an attempt to take my life. It failed (obviously) and i ended up on a drip for three days and still alive. I canâ€™t have therapy at the moment because phone therapy doesnâ€™t work for me and well thereâ€™s a global pandemic preventing me from seeing my therapist. i have been trying to forget it happened and it worked for around a month but now i am getting nightmares, flashbacks and i keep convincing myself i can hear my parents crying. i honestly just donâ€™t want to be here anymore but thereâ€™s not anything i can do :/
