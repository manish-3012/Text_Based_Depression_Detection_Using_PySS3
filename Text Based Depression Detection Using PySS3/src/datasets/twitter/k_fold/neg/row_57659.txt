I'm so desperate for meaningful connections that every time I start to get to know someone my hopes skyrocket up just to get crushedTired of making new acquaintances only for them to never ever contact me. And tired of becoming friends with women and thinking they might be giving me signals only to find out that they're not. I'm just going to kill myself. I cant keep torturing myself like this.
