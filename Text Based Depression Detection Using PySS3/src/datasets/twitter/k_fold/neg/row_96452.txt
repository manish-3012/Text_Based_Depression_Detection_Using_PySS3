People say it gets better, but it doesn't.My life has been sheer hell for close to a decade now. I have been in a constant state of pain and terror and depression for almost half my life. People always used to say "don't kill yourself it will get better!" But it doesn't. I have sort of stopped talking to people about my suffering because it feels like they will either just lie to me or don't know what they are talking about. 

I have been walking up and down a local bridge near me considering climbing off and jumping off.
