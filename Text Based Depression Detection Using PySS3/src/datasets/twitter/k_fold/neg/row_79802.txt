Want to kill myself, but feel trapped.I hate myself. I feel like I've got to a point where everyone I meet hates me too. I think I've ruined my husbands life, as he doesn't see his friends anymore. I have a job I despise and where I don't think I get along with anyone really. I have a child who I love dearly, my child is happy, lovely and bright. They are literally my reason for living.  

I want to kill myself, but I'm scared about what will happen to my child who is only a toddler. Apparently, studies say children whose mothers (even more so than fathers) take their own lives, have a higher risk if mental health problems and suicidal behaviours themselves. I don't want to do that to my child, but I don't want to live this life anymore. 

Can you really stay alive in a hollow existence for your family only?
