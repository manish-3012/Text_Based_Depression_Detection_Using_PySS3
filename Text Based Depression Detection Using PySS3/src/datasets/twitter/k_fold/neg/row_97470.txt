Can't sleep at night. Brain torturing me.I broke up with my first girlfriend around two months ago. She had become exceedingly distant and cold (most likely due to me becoming clingy and weepy) and I couldn't take it anymore so I ended it. Bad move. I've not been able to cope. I've not been able to sleep at night. I keep thinking about how badly I want her back. I end up distracting myself from the intrusive thoughts with games, TV, or whatever. This goes on until I'm too exhausted to think anything and eventually fall asleep. I couldn't take it so I went and begged her to take me back. She didn't want to but I kept bugging her because I just don't know what to do. She's already dated two guys (that I know of) since the breakup and I think she's still seeing the second guy. And just thinking about her with some other guy makes me want to kill myself.

I'm pretty sure I have mental issues. Social anxiety disorder and depression. My life has been a living hell even before this breakup. I'm scared of everything. I wrote about it [here](http://flipguy0.tumblr.com/post/24962760288/i-am-a-mental-case-maybe), [here](http://flipguy0.tumblr.com/post/24962854275/more-on-my-being-a-mental-case), and [here](http://flipguy0.tumblr.com/post/24962974435/my-social-anxiety-disorder-sucks).

She wasn't even all that great to me but I miss her so badly and I feel like her taking me back is the only way that I'll stop feeling as bad as I do. They say that time heals all wounds but I'm not getting any better. I feel like I just keep getting worse. I think [I've hit rock bottom](http://flipguy0.tumblr.com/post/24963111205/helpless).

I know that dealing with my mental issues is the way to go but I'm so fucked up that even going about doing that is hard for me. Just calling to schedule appointments with psychiatrists terrifies me. And this wouldn't be a quick solution, I don't think. I'm afraid that one of these nights the pain is just going to be unbearable and I'm just going to go ahead and kill myself.
