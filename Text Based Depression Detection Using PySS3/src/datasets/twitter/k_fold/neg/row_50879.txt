Never had those thoughts before...I'm probably a standard case... this is my full story: https://www.reddit.com/r/sad/comments/3bfosm/when_youre_going_to_attend_a_bachelor_party_make/

TL,DR: I've had that girl, she dumped me, I waited 3 years, we came back together, I gave my best, we were living a fairy-tale, I broke my leg, she fell for another guy, she dumped me. 

Yesterday I thought I was getting better, but as I was trying to fall asleep it hit me again, managed to pass out but in the morning I felt just empty. Today she told me it wasn't as good between us after all, that she wasn't as happy as she seemed... I started thinking about everyone I hurt in my life. I didn't even realize how much of a dick I am, how I disrespect other people's emotions. I think about not being able to hold her in my arms ever again nd a year of rehab that's awaiting me (I broke my ankle pretty bad). I do not see why to continue living. What scares me is that is not just a thought I can dismiss, it actually makes sense to me. I do not want to be a martyr, I do not want to suffer like I did all that time without her, I don't have strength to focus on myself now. I would gladly trade my whole leg for going back in time a few months. I fantasize about falling asleep, not dreaming and never waking up. I feel like the only thing keeping me alive is the hope that one day she will love me, but I'm not sure I even believe it anymore.
