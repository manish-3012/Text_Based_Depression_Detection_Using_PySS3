Feeling like shit...I fucked up my first semester of college. Skimming a 2.7 at the end of my first semester after spending all the money I made at my summer job, having fun (not partying, just making friends and hanging out), being in the marching band, and having a girlfriend. I didn't study enough, didn't try hard enough, and I have to retake an economics class and drop a class for my minor. If I screw this coming semester up, I will lose any scholarships I have, go to community college, and live at home again.

My father punched me repeatedly after finding out my grades, taunting me over my reasons for being less than satisfactory, and then we both walked away from each other crying. I hate myself, none of my friends who are home want to hang out with me, my girlfriend is 600 miles away, my computer is busted and I have no car. I am literally a prisoner in my family's house. I cannot see myself redeeming all I have done wrong in the Spring, and I am having awful thoughts. Like how he could save money if I were to disappear or run away.

I come from a family of doctors, engineers, musicians, and many self-made men thriving with ambition. I seem to have none for school, and have interests only in people and my music hobby, which I doubt will ever get me anywhere. Hell, the girl I went to highschool makes money off of her awful Christian rock covers. I can barely give mine away for free.

I am at a loss for what to do with myself or my life for the next three weeks I am home without a computer or friends. And the awful thoughts of disappearing keep on running through my head.
