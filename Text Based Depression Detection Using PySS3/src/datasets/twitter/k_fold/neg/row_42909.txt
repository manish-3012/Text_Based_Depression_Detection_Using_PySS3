I'm sure this has been said before,but I do not contribute to society. I cannot think of a single thing I am good at or a way in which I better someone else's life. I can thing of ways I'm a detriment though. To society, to loved one's etc. I am a drain on everyone's emotional energy and literal resources. So the argument that any of this matters to anyone else if basically null.
And now to the clincher*: My life would be better without my life. I am not happy. There may be people who make me happy, but I am so miserable to be around that I cause the very people I love to be unhappy. What a terrible, parasitic existence. I cannot see why anyone like me should live. I want to just let everyone who knows me believe I was in an auto accident that was out of my control so they wont know, but I want out.

*I know why I'm typing all of this. The fact that I won't kill myself is because I am a coward. The only thing keeping me from it is a personal flaw, but the reason I wish I could is the lack of any part of my personality that isn't a flaw. I wish I could muster the courage to do it. I'm in a burning building that is progressively getting hotter and I am too afraid to jump out the window.
