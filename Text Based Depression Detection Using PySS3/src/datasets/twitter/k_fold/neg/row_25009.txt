Been to the psych ward twice, and I can certainly say that it has made me crazierYour having suicidal thoughts? Well letâ€™s just throw you in an isolated box without your consent and if you donâ€™t like it we will forcefully inject you with a sedative. Btw you wonâ€™t have anything to do here but eat,sleep, and watch shitty network television. We will also watch you get undressed and shower because youâ€™re a danger to yourself because sane people never have suicidal or negative thoughts. 

Then once youâ€™re zombified from our poison we call medicine, weâ€™ll release you back into the shit world youâ€™ve known for so long, also hereâ€™s a multi thousand dollar bill on top of that.

Fuck hospitals they donâ€™t care about anyone itâ€™s all a scam to get as much money from you as possible
