My birthday is coming up in a few days...But I feel that's more of a social burden to myself and to people involved with me rather than a momentous positive occasion. I've made a series of bad decisions leading up to today including but not limited to pushing away my significant other, quitting stable work, and cutting through my savings like a hot knife on butter. I feel continually worthless, a drain on my family, and a burdensome emotional responsibility for my girlfriend and circle of friends. I can't talk to any of them about this for fear of increasing their own anxieties and worsening their own lives; after all, a lot of them have issues of their own. I've lied to all of them about different things in the effort to keep them from worrying about me, but I think this time I've messed up so bad it's just better for them to all move on rather than keep carrying me about.

I've been thinking of ending my supposed struggle on my birthday itself, without telling anyone I know, since the beginning of February. I don't know how I can pick myself up, and I'm afraid of when the day comes, I will still be afraid whether or not I choose to live or die.
