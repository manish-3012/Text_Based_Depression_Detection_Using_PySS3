I can't live with myself. I deserve to die.I have a thing for feet. When I was younger I manipulated my younger step sister so I could touch her feet. Years later seeing the aftermath of my actions is soul crushing. Seeing how she fears me and avoids me now. I deeply regret what I did but I know I can't escape it no matter what. I want to fucking kill myself to end this feeling of being nothing but a creep.
