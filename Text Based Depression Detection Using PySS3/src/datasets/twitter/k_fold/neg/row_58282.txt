I'm feeling suicidal again and I'm terrifiedI feel lost again. For a few months I was in an amazing headspace and it just hit me like a truck. 
I can feel each dark thought creeping back into place. The ones that say to end my life. I'm twrrified by how easily they came back. By how strong they are. I honestly dont think i have the strength to fight it anymore. 

I've lost my routine and the things in life that remind me what I'm living for with all this pandemic stuff going on. 

I've tried to stay positive and smile but its slipping. I don't enjoy anything anymore and all I want to do is sleep. When I'm awake the thoughts are constant, and becoming more appealing. 


I honestly think I'm going to take my life, soon. 

Is there anyone out there?
