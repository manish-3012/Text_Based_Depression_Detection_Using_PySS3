Why should I be alive if the only thing I do is bring sadness to my family?I'm Brazilian and I've failed the only exam for a public college we have during the year , i'm also the only person in the family who is a failure as my sisters are all really smart and seem to have a great future in front of them and lately the only thing I've been doing for the world is bringing unhappiness to my family...
Why should i be alive if i'm a walking disappointment to everyone?
