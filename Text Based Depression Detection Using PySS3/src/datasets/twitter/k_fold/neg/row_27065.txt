Iâ€™ve never felt this hopeless beforeI donâ€™t know who to talk to. I have a bunch of friends and family who love me, but I just canâ€™t bring myself to talk to them. My girlfriend just blocked me out of her life. I know thatâ€™s such a cliche thing to feel sad about, but when Iâ€™m with her she distracts me from how I feel about myself. We werenâ€™t perfect, but she really was the only person I felt comfortable talking to about how I felt. I really donâ€™t want to try anymore, it would be so much easier if it all just ended
