Been wanting to die please read it u feel the sameHi Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for a while but I decided that the least I can do is care about my body my mind enough to make it happy.yea maybe not being with someone I really want to feels like the end but surely I know it isnâ€™t. Letting go of pain is hard but I realized I survived a whole year without killing myself and coming out of one of the hardest years of my life I can definitely say Iearned a lot. I hurt a lot but truth is thatâ€™s the only real way we can learn life lessons is through pain. Itâ€™s that pain that hurts so bad itâ€™s something u have to pay attention to a lesson indeed. In the end we all just need food water and somebody nice to look at fun to be around and great in bed all these people and all these job opportunities that canâ€™t be hard. I know thereâ€™s road blocks but gotta MAKE THE MOST OUT OF YOUR LIFE Iâ€™ll b 29 this year and itâ€™s hitting me that I need to get married and have kids soon itâ€™s a lot but for the most part Iâ€™m alive and thriving broke and all folks find one thing that makes u even a little happy and stick with it even if itâ€™s toxic whatever u do DONT give up one day you will out grow your circumstances and move on thats life
