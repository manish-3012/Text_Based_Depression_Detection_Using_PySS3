I heard the phrase "Suicide is Contagious" a few times growing upI never really got it because I was never so close with someone who committed suicide before. I'd known many, but none so close as my best friend.

The only reason I haven't already done it is because my partner and other best friend are both already furious with him for doing it in the first place, and I don't want her to hate him any worse. They think he should have stayed for me, and that "his timing was bad" (a week before my birthday), as if any timing would be better. 

I don't blame him at all. Depression is a bitch so I doubt he even remembered, anyway. And Christ, he was in so much pain, I just wish I could have helped him more than I did.

But I miss him so much. I just want to be with him. More than anything, I want to hold him and tell him I'm sorry. What the fuck am I even still doing here?
