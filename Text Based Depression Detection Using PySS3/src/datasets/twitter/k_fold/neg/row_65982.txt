Upon this stoneNow here I sit upon this rock
Listening to the creek that I once walked
For stuck at home I could no longer resist
I told my parents of my goals for bliss

How did this happen one might say
Youâ€™re life has been beautiful every day
Beauty is from oneâ€™s perspective 
And we are not the same

On days like this I am inclined
To take something dear of mine
Dear to others that is debatable 
For none have shown their graces attainable

I pushed it far today at last
My life has crumbled for the last 
I can no longer attempt to rebuild
For I am broken, and I am revealed

I found an owl next to my stone
He was lifeless, and cold
You did not want this fate now did you
Would you like to trade, me for you

Thereâ€™s no response as expected 
But he has suffered in how I wished 
Now away I am from those at home
Here I sit waiting

Upon this stone.
