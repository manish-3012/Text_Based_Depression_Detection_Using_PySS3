What is the point of my life?All my life I grew up with abuse from my mom,dad and a few times by my older brother. It was mostly physical abuse when I was younger. It shattered my self confidence to zero. Still my mom and dad often verbally abuse me. As a 17 year old, I have no privacy at all let alone my own room. My OCD has gotten pretty bad and I am not even allowed to take therapy or medical help because "I'm completely fine" and my cousin with loving parents who has the same fucking shit gets all the love and help. Even my own mom is worried about him. In school I was bullied because of being antisocial. My dad starts screaming at my mom as the silliest thing. I just can't take this anymore. I live in a country where people are raped, murdered everyday and getting a job is super hard. So I cant move out of this place any soon. Wtf should I even live for? In short, yeah I'm feeling suicidal as hell.
