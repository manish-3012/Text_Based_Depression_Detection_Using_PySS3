I am not supposed to be hereI cannot take it anymore and I don't see things getting any better. Let's look at the facts: I was born in a shitty environment, with a borderline mother who treated me like shit since birth. A father who is loving but not attentive and when I told him that I'd be relieved if something happened to me and things just ended he responded 'don't be silly'. Don't know if he cannot grasp what being suicidal feels like or he truly does not care. I feel like there is not one single soul who really loves me or prioritizes me as a friend or partner. None I can really trust or that wants to hang out with me. The only thing I can do well is being good in academia, but that is now causing me more anxiety, depression and apathy than ever. I don't even know where to go next in life when I finish this. There is no hope for my future. I keep running into bad people: narcissists, selfish and dismissive people. My family is tore apart and half of them hates me because I got away from my abusive mother. 

Sometimes I just wish it all ended. I don't look when crossing the street. I chain smoke myself hoping it is to death. I only keep going because I know my family would hate me even more if I didn't finish my degree, but what is the point? Nothing brings me happiness anymore, nothing is interesting or exciting. I feel nothing and when I do feel it is only pain and disappointment with my social circles. I must have been born by mistake. What am I even doing here..
