DeathI have no options left. I cant do this. I was such a lucky kid, my mom bought me a car before my 16th birthday in order for me to start driving it, then I totaled it. Then I got deep into drugs and depression and went to a mental hospital. When I came out, I went to my dads house for a week and then came back home to my moms and she had gotten me another car, and had already installed my subwoofer and bought me a brand new stereo and installed it so right when I got home I could drive around in it. Then, I got 2 speeding tickets. But nooooo that wouldn't stop me from speeding, I started selling drugs and was smoking at least 4gs a day for months. Then one night I'm out driving and I'm looking at my phone trying to make a drug deal, then I see sirens and I get pulled over for speeding. I'm 17 and I had a bong, 12gs of weed, 2 juuls, 8 pods, a scale, and lighters. I only got a "ticket" but now I am going to have 2 speeding tickets and a misdemeanor on my record forever and I wont be able to drive until im 19, effectively ruining my teenage years. Honestly going to kill myself seeing as my moms already lost over $40,000 over me. I cant do this shit anymore. I just fucking ruin their lives and my own with my shitty decisions and there's no point anymore. Goodbye beautiful world. Fuck everything.
