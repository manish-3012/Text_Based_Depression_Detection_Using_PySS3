I told my parents I want to dieI suffer from depression since I was a teenager and today, after two years of feeling okay, I had a serious breakdown. 
I repeatedly told my parents that I don't want to live and that I always wanted to commit suicide.. but they didn't say anything. I don't think they took me seriously. They thought I was just going crazy and told me I'm this nervous because of the exams. I dont know why im feeling like this again, I literally felt like I was back in the past and it scared me. I'm a lonely person, I don't have any friends to go out with and I really would like to hang out with someone. I see everyone on Instagram posting about having a drink and going out and I'm at home crying and yelling I want to die at 23
