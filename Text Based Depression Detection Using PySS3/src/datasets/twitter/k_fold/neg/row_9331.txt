Telling someone not to kill themselves seems as useful as telling a serial killer not to kill you. :DAlso, stop telling people "Think about your family". 

Think about what it's doing to me to continue being here. Think about how it is to feel trapped almost everywhere you go. Yeah, to suffer through that constantly? No.
