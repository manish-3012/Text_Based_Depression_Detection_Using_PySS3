My friend tried to kill himself. Details below.Alright I'm in alternative school for marijuana and I'm 15, my friend got caught with synthetic K2 and was supposed to be sent to alternative with me. Now he was molested at the age of about 6 and has been the main cause for most of his depression, which I think initially led him to smoking (we all have our reasons) but instead of coming to alternative school his parents sent him to a local drug rehab and mental health facility. A few days ago he tried to kill himself by hanging himself with his bedsheets. Luckily he was stopped but now he is going to stay there for the rest of school most likely. He has no contact with anyone outside. I was just wondering if there is anything I can do while he is in or after he gets out to help? Thanks.

EDIT: just found out he gets out tomorrow.
