The ParasiteWhy is it that everything i'm attached to crashes and goes up in flames. I some how managed not only to drive my mom to the brink of suicide but get my dad to lose all faith in me as well. All I am is a parasite I will attach onto you and take everything you have before taking everything you gave me and ruining it. I am the BIGGEST piece of shit on the planet. There is nothing I am good at. Now here I am being a winy bitch for the entire internet to see. Why can't I just be normal. Why do I have to ruin everything. Why can't I have a skill in something that isn't pointless. Why do I have to suck at everything. Why can't I just be a fucking normal human? Being alive sucks and cannot be worth it.
