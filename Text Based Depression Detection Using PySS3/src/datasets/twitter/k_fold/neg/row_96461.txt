Signed a DNR form, burned and threw out most of my things.Today I had an epiphany threw out all of my notes, 130+scientific &amp; mathematical books, and 90% of my personal belongings. The meds donâ€™t help, the â€œtherapyâ€ is patronizing.

Onward, I ask myself why I ever chose the field of science. I thought it was about giving. I thought it was about trying to find a team to discuss real problems on a level that each member was infinitely obsessed and driven. Academia is worried about their tenure. Principal investigators wonâ€™t hire, trying to get rich off fluorescing fish to guide them in the dark. Iâ€™m in $200,000 loan debt and I still live with my parents in a bad neighborhood. All is well. They donâ€™t believe in depression and what facilitates anxiety.

I have nothing to live for now. I know the texture of rejection of too many things so intimately. Death do us part has been an attractive choice. No one ever tells you that you can work hard and be worth nothing in the end. I missed that seminar. My mentor is dead from cancer. I lived for and through himâ€”he helped to implement resilience. I barely saw him, yet he knew the real me. I regret not pushing for reasons to see him more.

Canâ€™t get a job, which means no life companionship either. Wait, wait it gets better! Even still, I couldnâ€™t even â€˜pretendâ€™ to be with someone who I donâ€™t care about, because depressed people certainly cannot have relationships nor do they deserve to apparently. I have to wait until Iâ€™m cured of major depression to pursue any such things. Fact is, this hideous mental leprosy is largely aphysical, yet, it affects mass outside of the body. Iâ€™ve never cried so much until today at how profoundly real this is.

This world has problems, and I wanted give something truly good that the last person who believed in me said I could do. I donâ€™t care about â€˜what he would want me to do.â€™ I donâ€™t care about the illusion of my own happiness, to hell with its broken statuary in eggshell-white, blinding delusion. Itâ€™s all rhetoric. 

Iâ€™ve lived half of my life. Iâ€™m 22 and havenâ€™t done a thing. It seems like yesterday that I was 5, pondering the complexity of ant patterns. I was supposed to create something by now, but Iâ€™ve watched Zuckerberg and pals live out his â€˜dream.â€™ So ghost the torturer oâ€™creative thinking. The brute contingency to be ostracized, trying to design new, truly innovative works and technology...the abuse as a child for this very same reason. That if I canâ€™t giveâ€”then I donâ€™t deserve the likes of ever knowing the works of people like Newton to Darwin. I was that beloved book. Obscure, with a vision if only Iâ€™d get the chance. A fair shot at something or a friend who intuitively knew. I have no friends. The oneâ€™s I thought I had just tell me, â€œI donâ€™t know what to say.â€ I really f*cking hate that line.

So then, I watched my Principia burnâ€”its charred flesh, the hickory-smoked reminder, the gaseous taste of a poignant, failed, ironic evolutionary splendor. Iâ€™d never expect anyone to understand me, but Iâ€™ll leave what little I can afford to. Iâ€™m going out for a long walk; my socks soaked with near insanity. Squishing sounds dispelling the myth that anything had meaning, regardless of footprints to prove that Iâ€™d been there too. The kicker? My birth was an accident. Iâ€™m alive because I am, not because someone planned for my existence with good intention.
