Loving family, but no hopeI wish my family didn't care about me, it would make it so much easier to end it right now. Everyday I live through is unenjoyable, but the knowing that if I give up it would devastate my family is the only thing keeping me going at this point. I just wish I could unalive myself without anyone noticing.
