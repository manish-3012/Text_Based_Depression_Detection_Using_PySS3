It doesn't seem abnormal to hurt myself.When it gets bad I know I can reset by concussing myself.  Intellectually I know this is very bad for my brain but if I'm stupider then I can't be as aware of the sadness.  There's no hope of recovery from this one so fuck it.  

I can't watch tv or read half the posts on the front page because it reminds me of what I'm not capable of.  I made the mistake of watching tv just now and I put my head through the drywall.   I have to make it another year.  How do I make it a whole year?  Best case scenario I go idiot with brain damage and no one has to be sad anymore! :)  or just pull the trigger now. Or follow through and disappear first.  No one should know I'm gone.  How do I make it another year?
