it's so hard to watch yourself spiral out of control and know you're powerless to stop it by yourselfgetting worse and worse, hurting myself more and more, thinking about killing myself all the time, can't even get out of bed, missed all of my classes except one, which i left 15 minutes in because of a panic attack. now i have two job interviews and school shit to make up and i can barely muster the energy to talk without smoking pot first. i truly hate myself. crisis appointment with my therapist tomorrow. let's see if i'm sent to some godawful hospital and my entire life is fucked yet again.
