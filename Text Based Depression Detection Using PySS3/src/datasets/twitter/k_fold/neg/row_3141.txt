i feel like im fake and i dont belong anywhereim not done with life enough to be suicidal, not sad enough to be depressed and too good looking and nice to be at the rock bottom of life. so i changed that. i became the asshole and people still denied me. im not even sure myself if im depressed and suicidal or if i just made it up to blame my failure of a life on a mental disease. i hate myself. life would've been so much easier if i just opened up to someone. i dont care if that person was a shitty one, at least that'd give me reason and courage to end my life. it sucks being suicidal but faking getting help for it is worse. i cant let anyone else in my mental space because its too fucked up for other people to be dealing with and i cant refuse help or ill be the 'suicidal for attention' kid. it sucks. it sucks having to act out social norms every single day. i dont want to die cause im a pussy and im scared of the pain, but i really, REALLY want to stop existing. ill probably never be able to make a true 'friend' since i dont let anyone in my mental space, not even my parents. i have things i want to do, but ill never be able to achieve them anyways. maybe im just in my emo phase though, since i am 17

i dont want help nor do i deserve it, because all ill be able to do is hear it. ill never be able to get motivated or change my life over it.
