I really don't want to live anymore.It just hurts too much. Everyday I'm alive just makes me feel worse. I've gone from "I don't want to live" to "I want to die" and for all intents and purposes, I am dead. My body looks alive but the inside is just an empty darkness.

It would be such a sweet relief. No more pain, no more tears, no more life. I've written a note, figured out how to do it and I'm just waiting for the right moment now. No one will reach out to me, no one will ask me how I am and no one will convince me that I'm not doing myself favor by ending it. I'm sure some people will miss me but I don't care. I won't miss them.
