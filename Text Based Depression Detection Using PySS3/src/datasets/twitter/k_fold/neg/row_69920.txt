I've been in a weird place for years and think I need help.I don't think I can find the words for this, but I'll give it a go. Opening up is hard.

&amp;nbsp;

Some obligatory context: I'm a 21 year old male living in Finland, or 22? I don't even know, I recently told a girl at a bar that I was 19 for some reason. I can't keep up with getting older. I've read a lot of posts in here. For some reason I don't see myself fitting in most of them.

&amp;nbsp;

I consider myself fairly attractive, I enjoy talking and being with women. I come from a poor family and managed to get in to a University in Finland and the tests for getting in can be quite challenging for many. I don't see myself as a failure, in fact I am very proud of myself. I have lots of friends, I absolutely love my best friend and I am the luckiest man alive to have met him. I love myself, I love being myself.. I enjoy the smallest things in life and love to sing and dance, going to concerts. I am happy every day, even in work after school and I work at McDonald's.


&amp;nbsp;

So here's the kicker... I pay a lot of money to enjoy myself, and I don't have a problem with that.. but for example every time I go to a concert I forget all about it the next day, I can't remember anything, not the feeling, can't even recall what songs they played. Happens with everything and im left in my bed wondering is that it?

Really doesn't help my case that a few years ago, my world somehow completely shifted. I never thought about killing myself before, but now when I think about it.. It feels like I've known for years that I want to do it. And I really do. I don't understand why it's such a taboo, a disease one might call it. Honestly the only reason I haven't done it is because people close to me have "made" me promise to live for them if I can't live for myself.

I used to think that my world will shift again when I have my own family, holy shit what if it doesn't? I left my last girlfriend because I can't make a commitment to staying alive. We still see each other often because I can't let go. I wish she could just move on on her own...

This past week, this day has been my lowest point. I just can't stop crying.
