I can't get over her.Me and this girl dated for about 3 years before we broke up. She wanted to just stay friends but i felt like she was using me and separated myself from her. I cut off all interactions with her. Its been about 7 months since we broke up and i still feel like shit off and on. I look back and see things I could've done differently. I keep seeing pictures on facebook of her with her new boyfriend. He took her to prom.. We used to talk about going to it together and how it would be the best night of our lives. It makes me sad, but she has clearly moved on and doesn't care anymore. I want to stop caring. I hate her, but at the same time I miss her. I don't want to feel this way anymore and I want to die. I've tried to kill myself many times already but have had no luck (i've either chickened out, or gotten caught). I can't stand this anymore, i can't stand living anymore. I have one person to talk to about it, but i feel like they would just think i'm stupid since it's been so long. So I just keep hiding it, making fun of her and pretending like i don't care. On top of that i've been having a lot of health issues (but i don't want to get into that). I go to school everyday pretending to be happy, always joking around with people,  laughing and pretending like i'm happy.. but inside, i'm worse than i've ever been. I hurt myself, and but I make sure to do it above the sleeve, or on my hip so no one can see it. I destroyed the top of my arm today.. I almost bled out. I am so close to finally killing myself, and yet still so far
