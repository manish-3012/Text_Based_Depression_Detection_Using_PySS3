I just don't want to wake up anymore.I just had to stop taking my meds because it made me lose 10 pounds in 4 days. And I'm sad because it was the first med that I was ever able to say I was able to think straight. And now every hour I haven't taken it I feel myself going back to where I was before the meds.

Everyone says I'm just looking for a magic pill that would make me happy and that's not what I need.
 But here was my thought process today: i woke up and I told the clinic I'm worried about how much weight I was losing. They told me to not take it and they will be sending Prozac to my pharmacy. Great. I called my last psychiatric clinic and asked them to send me the outstanding bill. Something I was afraid of doing for a while. I was only on this med for a couple days and I felt the therapeutic effects. Lunch time came and I ate when I would usually only eat one meal. And then from there it went downhill. My mood dropped immensely every hour. The first hour I was angry and now I'm just sad and feeling like a failure even though in the past few days I've done so much to try to help myself but the people around me are saying I'm not doing anything. I even said I have an interview for a job where I'll be making more money and it was ignored and I'm just told you're going to keep being depressed if you keep doing this or that. I'm trying I really am. 

I don't think I could ever kill myself but I just wish I could fall asleep and never wake up again. And it makes it so hard for me to make future plans because I just don't see myself living that long.

I'm so lost. I thought I was doing good and now I'm back to how I was.
