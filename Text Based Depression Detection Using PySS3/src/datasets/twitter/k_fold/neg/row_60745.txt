God if i was living for myself i would've offed myself long agoGodn everything i want in life seems entirely out of my grasp, and they're nkt even entirely unreasonable things. But hey, this world isnt going to fix itself. Climate change, shitty politics and authoritarianism will keep going, and if im not here to try and fix it, no one else will. God that sounds arrogant, hut hey at this point its all i have.
