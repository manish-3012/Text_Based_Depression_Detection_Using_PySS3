It's getting harder to even tryI don't really feel anything other than stress, anger, or anxiety at this point. My mom and I have been fighting almost every day and it's draining.
She's a complete narcissist and that it's hard for her to love me and it's hard to deal with because I still want her to love me but then she treats me like shit. Sometimes I think about if I committed just to get back at her and make her life hell. Not really anyone I can talk to with my problems and I don't have enough time to see a therapist. I'm trying to manage school and hw but it's getting harder to pay attention or care. I'm beginning to not even see the point of trying to go on. Sorry that this is just me complaining I just don't know how to even continue because I just don't enjoy anything anymore and it feels like everything would be easier if I would just off it
