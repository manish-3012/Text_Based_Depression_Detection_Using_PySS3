Holy fucking shit I hate myselfI always try to get drunk because I think it will make my thoughts more erratic and random, but really it just isolates the thoughts of self-loathing. I probably do this sub-consciously because if I focus on the reasons that I hate myself I will be more likely to kill myself focusing on only the negative things about me. (Obviously) I am going to ignore the â€œpositiveâ€ things about me and only focus on the things that make me want to remove myself from this world. I say â€œthis worldâ€, but really we only get one life. I donâ€™t want to start over, because there is no starting over. We get what we get, but I think that Iâ€™m too weak and pathetic a person to improve for the better. 5â€™11â€ (and a half that I sometimes round to 6â€™ to make myself feel better) and sometimes 160 pounds. I fluctuate between 155-160 but usually Iâ€™m below. Thatâ€™s skinny as fucking shit. Basically skin and bone. I look at my wrists and I fucking recoil in disgust because I can see my individual wrist bones. Along with that, I am either extremely shy or donâ€™t like people. Either way, I wish that I would interact with others more. What I â€œwantâ€ and what I â€œwish I wantedâ€ are two different things. This is an incoherent mess, because (what I think is) luckily, Iâ€™m drunk. But when Iâ€™m drunk, I just spill my mindâ€™s thoughts. This is kind of good, but kind of bad. I canâ€™t talk like this while sober. Thisâ€™ll be the end of this post because I have to piss. If someone tells me Iâ€™m not that bad, I wonâ€™t believe them. If someone tells me Iâ€™m a good guy, I wonâ€™t believe them. Just ignore me, because this post isnâ€™t inherently suicidal. Yeah, I am suicidal, but this post isnâ€™t saying that Iâ€™ll shoot myself in the head or choke for a couple minutes by hanging myself. If I banged myself, I would make sure that it snapped my neck instantly. Iâ€™m a (former state, wow, Iâ€™ve fallen pretty far) swimmer, so I know how scary the feeling of suffocating is. If I am going to kill myself, Iâ€™ll make it instant. Either jumping off a cliff, shooting my self, or having enough height while hanging myself to instantly snap my neck. Thatâ€™s my (slightly or not, idk) drunk post. Respond if you want, I donâ€™t care (I only say that to reinforce the â€œIâ€™m a tough 17 year oldâ€ ego that Iâ€™ve adopted). Peace out, I probably wonâ€™t kill my self tonight, so maybe this post will be deleted. If youâ€™re reading this, you should probably better invest your time with someone who has a rope around their neck, or a gun pointed to their head right now. May the world have peace, Patrick H. (I want to fucking scream but I canâ€™t or Iâ€™ll be hospitalized :) ((ironic smiley face))
