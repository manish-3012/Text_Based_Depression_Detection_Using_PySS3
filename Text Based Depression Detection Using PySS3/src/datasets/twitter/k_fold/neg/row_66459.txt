I want to die stillI still feel unloved and like shit. No one should try to even be near me. I want everyone to go away ad leave me alone. I dont want them to try any more. You can't do anything about it. You say youre there for me but that only lasts a while. Dont deal with me, you cant handle me, i cant handle me. I hate it. I dont want to be like this but I dont want to live. I wish no one cared about me so I can just die in piece. Stop caring, please. Seeing you leave in defeat only makes me feel worse. Its a double edged sword. Just stop caring. Id rather be left alone than know Im disappointing someone
