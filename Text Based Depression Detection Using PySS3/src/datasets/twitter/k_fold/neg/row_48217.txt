I'm tired and afraid of having to push through life when I know ill kill myself eventually. Now's as good a time as any.I've been an underachiever for most of my life and I've come to regret it more and more deeply throughout the years. Everyone around me has always believed in my potential and my capability, my teachers, my friends, and my family. But really im useless. From the age of nine until the age im at right now which is 25, ive been addicted to computer games. I live in a country where the youth graduate college at 21. Now two of my siblings are doctors and one is a lawyer. Meanwhile I've been in 5 different colleges, caused a car accident, got drunk enough to wake up in an I.C.U. and am still living purely on my parents' purses and good will. Throughout all of this, the most effort I've ever put into are two relationships. One that lasted two years in which the girl left me because she frankly didnt think I'd amount to much. The other one is with Marie. I love Marie more than anything. And I like to think she loves me too just as much. And everything is so much brighter with her.  But Marie has her issues too. And sometimes she hurts me. She bites and hits me hard and she eggs me on to hit her too. I don't. Somehow after all of that she cries. And its my fault. Sometimes the crazy becomes too much that on impulse we break up. But we always get  back together within the week. It happened again recently. Now she tells me that we should stay broken up. She tells me that I deserve someone better. And then she tells me she doesnt forgive me for leaving her. And no matter what I say I can't get her to change her mind. Now I'm awfully depressed. And i just think that im so weak. I've wasted so many opportunities in my life and I've disappointed everyone I know. Now it all just feels like shit. And I want to die. Im tired. Im afraid. I just want to die now.
