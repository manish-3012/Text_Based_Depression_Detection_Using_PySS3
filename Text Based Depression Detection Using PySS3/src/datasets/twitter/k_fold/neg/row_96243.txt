I can't find the courage to pull the trigger, but I want to fucking die...Everyday when i go to sleep i hope not to wake up the next morning. I have nothing. No friends, no family, not a single person who loves me. I am 20 and have no education, qualifications, no job and no foreseeable future. I have no talents or Passions. I'm going to end up homeless soon. I don't find joy in anything. I don't find relief in anything. I have no purpose in this world, i don't make anything or anyone better. And yet i'm too much of a coward to just end my pittyful existence...
