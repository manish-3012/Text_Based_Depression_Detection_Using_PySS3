I can't do it anymore, I'm gone.I really can't take the numbness and the pain that comes shooting back through my heart. 

i am a 20 year old male from southern California, and i have been heavily depressed for a year now. The depression really hit me bad last January, when my first girl i was madly in love with dumped me. She and I dated for 4 months, we cuddled so much and I truly felt loved, until she told me she couldn't do it anymore because she was ''busy with school''. It hurt me really bad and I blew up at her. a few months ago last january, I looked on her facebook and found out she has had a boyfriend a week after she dumped me, so its been a year and a half now. The most crushing thing to me is she lied to me, and the thing that hurts the most is she is in a happy relationship and she didn't even ever care about me. 

I fucking hate my life and my self. I have no personal loving relationship with my self. I look in the mirror and don't want to know who the fuck im looking back at. I spend my days online browsing the web. I have tried to find online girlfriends to fill the void, and they always dump me for another guy as well. I don't know whats wrong with me and why im not deserving of love.

My mom never hugged me or told me she loved me much, but she did help do my home work and cook for us which was always great. I have a so-so relationship with my parents, everything is on the surface level, a friendship type thing. I keep my feelings deep inside and i have been very isolated for about a year now, I don't have the energy or will to live anymore, i sleep most of the day and stay up at night. 

I have gained lots of weight since my first love dumped me, I feel like a low life, scum bag, fat piece of crap. Other then my parents, I don't have a deep connection with anyone, I have one friend but he is busy with his life dating girls and going to college. I don't know whats wrong with me but I feel like im a waste of space and my mom constantly tells me to do something with my life and get a job.  

I feel like I never was useful to any one, I have never felt like i was admired or loved, I always felt like an old back pack some one threw away behind the school. I have social anxiety and a pretty bad porn addiction, which lowers my self esteem to nothingness and i get jealous how other people have sex and im still a virgin.

Im sick of the self hate, the suicidal feelings and thoughts, im sick of feeling like a burden and unwanted in this damn world, Isolated, empty, shell of a human being I am. Please help me....
