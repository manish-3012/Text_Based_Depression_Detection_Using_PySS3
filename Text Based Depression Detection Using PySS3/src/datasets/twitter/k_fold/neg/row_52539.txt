Can't even kill myself right.Hi.  I'm not using a throwaway because nobody knows me on reddit so it doesn't really matter. I just need to get this off my chest because nobody has asked. I'm sorry. 

Two nights ago I attempted to kill myself by overdosing on my antidepressants. I took 21 of them. I failed. When my friends found out, they all called and said "I care" and "I love you so much" but no one spoke to me at school today.  Even my "best friends" saw me and barely said two words. They made plans tonight and are posting pictures and just left me out completely.  

I'm just not doing well. I guess part of me is glad I'm still here. The bigger part of me wishes I wouldn't have failed. I feel bad because no one cares that I'm here. I'm alone completely. I don't really have anything holding me here. I don't know. I kind of just wish that I would've died. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm just not doing so great.
