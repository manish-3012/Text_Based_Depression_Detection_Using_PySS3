It feels like it shouldn't matter if I die because I don't feel real to begin with, but my rational mind knows that's false.I have no sense of self without a distinct distraction or personal interaction. I've been home alone for hours and my ability to distract myself is fading. I've been in treatment for depression/bipolar for a decade with a side of severe anxiety and probably depersonalization but that one's not diagnosed. I just read a lot and have the trauma background to cause it.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I can't kill myself. I'm too afraid of failing and also of how it would impact the people who care about me, especially my neices and nephews, since we share genes and my plethora of issues are not all situational.
