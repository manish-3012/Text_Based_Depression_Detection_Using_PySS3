Everybody here can chat using new chat feature in redditHello everyone. Reddit's new design contains a new Chat feature which can be used to chat with people like a chat room. So people here can use it to chat with random people. What you have to do is to just add the people with whom you want to chat. I think someone should make a chat community with that.
