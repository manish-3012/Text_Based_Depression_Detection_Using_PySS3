Born a loser, soon to die one22, no job, no friends, bullied for 5 years in school no motivation, no love, little care about me, my hard work means nothing.

I turn to games like Clash Royale, Clash of Clans and Fifa among others to help forget about my depression. But I'm playing for hours with a lot of losses and the more I lose, the more I want to cut myself. Just last week, I said to them it's rigged, but Supercell denied that their games are rigged. Then, few days later, for just saying something out of anger to them, they banned me. It reminded me what a loser I am, without anything, or anyone, so now since even games go against me, think it's time to cut myself open.

My hard work mean nothing at all, no matter what I do.
