I don't want to turn 22I turn 22 in a few days and I'm dreading it. I had planned for a few months to be gone by now, but now I'm probably going to wake up on my birthday, just like every other day I wake up and hate myself. 

I hate being alive, and I wish people would stop caring about me so I could kill myself and no one I leave behind would be upset at me.
