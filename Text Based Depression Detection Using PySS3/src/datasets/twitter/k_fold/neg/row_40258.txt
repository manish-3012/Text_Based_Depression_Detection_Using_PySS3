My friend moved out of state, he's admitted suicidal thoughts. How can I help him?My buddy for 30 years recently lost everything. We've lived in the same New Jersey town since kindergarten. He's just recently moved to Rhode Island and is in a very, very dark place. Does anyone here know any resources in that area that I can get him in contact with?
