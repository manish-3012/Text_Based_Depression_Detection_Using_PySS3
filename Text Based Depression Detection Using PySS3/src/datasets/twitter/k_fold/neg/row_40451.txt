All aloneGranted, I'm really drunk right now, I was on a good streak but it hit me out of nowhere, no matter how many friends I have, I'm always alone. I nearly died once, but now it feels like it's final. It hit me out of nowhere, I have a great life ahead but I won't make it to it. I don't trust anyone to be there. I find a sick peace in knowing that I won't suffer anymore, but no one will care that I'm gone.
