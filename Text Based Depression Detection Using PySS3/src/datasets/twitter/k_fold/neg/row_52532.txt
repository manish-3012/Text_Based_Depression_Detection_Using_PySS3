There's no hope for me.I made such a huge mistake quitting my job. I fucking hated retail but at least I was comfortably numb and knew what I was doing. I should've just kept coasting along until I finally had the balls to kill myself. Now I don't know what to do. I'm fucked. I don't want to go to college because there's nothing i'm interested in studying. I'm not qualified enough for any cool jobs. I can't even be a dog walker bc that's embarrassing or a fucking uber driver because i'm too scared to drive. I have no work ethic so I refuse to do a job I hate even if it pays. I live in LA but I didn't win the genetic lottery so I won't find a man to just take care of me my whole life and I can't sail through life using my looks. I live in a boring town surrounded by boring people with boring jobs and lives. Yeah yeah woe is me I know people have it worse. I'm just so fucking bitter and upset that god put me in this shitty boring ass situation with no way out. I'm fucking over it. I need to end it already, there's nothing left in this stupid ass world for me.
