I'm really better off goneYesterday my friends all turned against me by making fun of me, ignoring me and physically pushing me off the lunch table. A girl that I've known since freshman year came to my lunch period and kept teasing me and hitting me. Her boyfriend tried to stop her but she also hit him. After school I was like you know what screw those guys, at least I still have this girl that I have feelings for. We spoke on videochat and she told me that she found a love interest. Now I just want to die because I have no one anymore.
