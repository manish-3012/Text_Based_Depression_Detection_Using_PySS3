I hate myself and I want to dieI hate myself. I am so weak and useless and stupid and worthless and I can't do anything right. I am a burden on my coworkers and family.

I truly believe that people only interact with me in a friendly manner because THEY are decent human beings, not because they actually want anything to do with me. I feel like I'm just annoying everyone by trying to initiate any sort of interaction. I certainly wouldn't want to be my friend. 

If anyone is sad about my death, it's just because death makes people sad. It's not because I have any intrinsic appeal or value as a human being. 

I have been hoping to be hit by a bus or otherwise killed in some sort of freak accident so that no one would have to deal with the burden of thinking my death was their fault, but honestly... I don't know how much longer I can hold out. I really don't. I feel so guilty for being a burden on people, so I'd rather give them a break and also just be able to be at peace. I want to leave this world. 

Or maybe I just really want a hug and reassurance that it will all be ok, but I'm afraid to reach out to anyone because no one actually cares. Please help me
