Iâ€™m starting to have the thoughtsIâ€™m happy all day and then the second I lay my head on my pillow all the pain Iâ€™m covering up comes up and I feel like ending it all and I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so alone because of all the shit going on I didnâ€™t ask to be a worthless pos with no personality and be attracted to the same sex half the time I hate myself so much and have resorted to hitting my head to drown out the thoughts of everything.

Tonight I started to wonder where my dad keeps his gun. Or what the combo to the safe is. In case I need to use it.
