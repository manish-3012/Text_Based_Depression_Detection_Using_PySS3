Can anyone relateTo finding someone you love who actually loves you back. Falling for them, and it goes fine for a while, a few months even, but then your depression and anxiety takes a hold of you and you just feel like youâ€™re suffocating everyday. You know that you canâ€™t make someone else happy when youâ€™re so miserable. You canâ€™t stop thinking about how youâ€™re not good enough, nothing you ever do is good enough, and they deserve someone better. You hate yourself. So you end things with them. Then youâ€™re completely alone again and have no one that makes you want to be alive or try anymore.
