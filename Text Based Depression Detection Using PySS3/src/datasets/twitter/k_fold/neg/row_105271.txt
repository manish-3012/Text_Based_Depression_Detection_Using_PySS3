Donâ€™t want to do it anymoreEach day for years now Iâ€™ve waited to die. Itâ€™s what I feel like Iâ€™m doing constantly. Waiting to die. The only thing that has stopped me is the pain it would cause my parents. Iâ€™d say I have about 20-30 years till theyâ€™ll be gone. Am I to wait to die for that long? How can I keep on this way? I try to tell myself not to care, that my pain is bigger and I deserve to end it and theyâ€™ll just have to go through the pain because I donâ€™t know if I have the strength.
