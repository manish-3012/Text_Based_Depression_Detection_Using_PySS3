Love my momLast night I started having a panic attack (wow whatâ€™s new) and typically when this happens I get my mom to just sit and hold me for a bit until I cool down, but last night she came in and just started yelling at me, telling me to â€œcut the bullshitâ€ which made it 10x worse. She kept saying â€œstop doing this to yourself, youâ€™re 18 now itâ€™s not poor poor pitiful you anymoreâ€. We started arguing because I told her why I was breaking down; I donâ€™t feel any emotional support from her, ever. She was outraged by that. I canâ€™t remember much of last night because it was all me crying and her screaming and me begging for help and at some point I grabbed a bottle of pills in my room and told her to get me a drink if she didnâ€™t want to support me. She started counting down from 3 (gotta love that southern mom bs) and I just kept screaming thatâ€™s not gonna work. I threw the pills and I kept trying to leave my room but she blocked the door and wouldnâ€™t let me leave. It took a good few shoves for me to finally get out and I just ran outside and headed for main street. My cousin ended up seeing me walking and drove me up to my aunts for the night. Call my mom while Iâ€™m up there to tell her Iâ€™m safe and she starts screaming at me to get my ass home and that she has cops out looking for me and that Iâ€™m a runaway (even though Iâ€™m 18 now?). I told her I was going to try and get home but I canâ€™t drive, and she was about to send cops up to get me but my uncle said she canâ€™t  and wonâ€™t do that. I ended up just going to sleep up there and I got back home at about 7am. Laid back down until 11 and I heard my mom talking in the back of the house. She was on the phone with my aunt talking shit about me and about how I tried to kill my self last night. As if that is going to make me feel better. She proceeded to start saying â€œwell she didnâ€™t take all those pills because sheâ€™s standing right here in front of me. What the hell do you want, you get those pills picked up?â€. She then started saying shit like â€œyou need to stop thinking about yourself and think about how everyone else feelsâ€ and I told her Iâ€™ve been thinking about how everyone else feels my entire life, which is why Iâ€™m the way I am now. I never thought about myself and now I am and sheâ€™s furious about it. Iâ€™m so tired of this. If I kill myself, it is HER fault for not being there for me. I canâ€™t just â€œget toughâ€ like she wants me to, i need HELP
