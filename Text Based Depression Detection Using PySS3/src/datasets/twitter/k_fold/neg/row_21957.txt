Is it ok for me to use future relaxation as a push?Iâ€™m on winter break after a college semester and Iâ€™m not really doing anything. Iâ€™m acting very depressed (almost always thinking about negative things) so I thought of using things thatâ€™ll happen very soon that look forward to as a reason for me to be a little productive. These things include catching up on a tv series, having psilocybin and mdma sessions (I am practicing harm reduction and it helps immensely, I donâ€™t need any advice thx), and other small things to make myself comfortable. I figure sitting around and being happy (just in the moment) is better than sitting around and being crippled by suicidal thoughts without the energy to do anything about it. Iâ€™m asking if itâ€™s ok because I feel guilty that Iâ€™m not being super productive.

This of course applies outside of my little example at this current time.
