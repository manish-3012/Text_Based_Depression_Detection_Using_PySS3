Nothing would change if I never existed/I ceased to existI canâ€™t think of a single thing that would change if I suddenly died. No one would notice or care. The world only values me for my body and what I can give people in that way, nothing else. Iâ€™m more worthless now than I thought I ever was. If I died, all the people that â€œfind me attractiveâ€ or â€œwant to sleep with meâ€ would bugger off and find someone infinitely better. My worth on this earth is zilch and I donâ€™t care what anyone says. No one gives a shit about me, no one would care if I died, and no one would miss me. I donâ€™t even cry over this shit anymore, Im just mad at myself for still being alive.

Iâ€™m beyond disappointed in myself that I thought having purely physical relationships would help the pain of being unloved. It just made it worse. I hate my body more than I ever have. I canâ€™t stand to look at myself in the mirror. I cry over the fact that I canâ€™t stomach my own reflection. Having any sort of physical interactions has devastated my self esteem. I regret it. I thought I could push my problems away by being with people and I was wrong.

I hate myself so damn much and I wish I didnâ€™t exist anymore. Nothing I do will help me feel happy. This is what life is; a miserable downward spiral, with no hopes or dreams. I donâ€™t want it anymore. Iâ€™m so sick to my stomach and I hate myself.
