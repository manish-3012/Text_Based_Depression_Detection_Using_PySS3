what's the point anymoreI relapsed tonight. Self-harm. Ruined 4 years of being clean, and now I'm staring at the belt, so ready to end it all, but scared of the nothingness of death. I'm home alone. no one will even be around until probably 5pm tomorrow. it's 3:06am currently. I just wish I had the guts to just kick the damn stool away...
