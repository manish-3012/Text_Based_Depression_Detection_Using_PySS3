My father shows me, day by day..That his and my mother's lives would be much easier without me.

My sister sort of made passive aggressive remarks about how I fucked up their possibility of ever having normal lives. 

Their lives would certainly be much happier without me.

I suppose, so would the other people's lives. 

And yet, I scheduled an appointment with my psychiatrist on Monday AGAIN and I feel like at this rate I'm almost being selfish by trying. I can't help myself, I can't help anyone.
