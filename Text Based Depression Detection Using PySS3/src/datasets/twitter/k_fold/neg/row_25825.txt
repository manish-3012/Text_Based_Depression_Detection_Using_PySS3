Alcoholic instead of suicide ðŸ¤·I got a job, i hook-up with people when i have my rare freetime, im talking to multiple people in like a romantic sense. Why am i not happy? I get hit on but instead of upping my self esteem it just makes me feel like shit. The only thing that fills this void anymore is alcohol so thats almost all ive been drinking. My buddies are visiting me from states away soon and I should be excited but we're all just gonna do drugs and then they're gonna leave and I'mma be alone again. Really not liking this whole bachelor thing. Really not liking anything anymore.
