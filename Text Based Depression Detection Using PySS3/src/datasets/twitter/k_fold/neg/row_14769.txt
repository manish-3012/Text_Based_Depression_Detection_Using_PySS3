Increased suicidal ideation latelyTo start off with, let me explain why it's not as bad as the title initially sounds. I've had depression for probably over a decade now, so suicidal ideation is nothing new for me. However, I've had a lot of changes in my life recently, including moving back in with my mom so I can go back to college to get another degree after realizing my first degree was useless and going from full time work to jobless/seeking part time work again. I was also living in a marijuana legal state before but don't anymore, and recently quit seeing my therapist because I realized he was no longer helping me. Over the last few months, I went from thinking about killing myself every once in awhile to almost every day. Now, I've had depression long enough to know that giving in to those thoughts is a bad idea, but the frequency of it is starting to worry me, and I can feel myself falling back into the black hole of deep depression despite my medicines. I'm trying to be optimistic about the future, but it's hard to feel that way when a part of my brain seems dedicated to just giving up, no matter how the rest of me feels about it.
