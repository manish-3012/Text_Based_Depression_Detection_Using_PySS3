School and social life suckI'm  17 years old and in high school /gymnasium. I have little to no real friends I actually meet in person and those few I actually ever get to see I only see once a month at a small convention. Asides from them the only friends I have are people I know online, but have never actually seen up until now. I am diagnosed with Asperger's (apparently makes you "incompatible" for social interactions) and ADHD (can't really concentrate on something without some kind of meds and lately those have seemingly stopped working or at least I think they at least don't work as well anymore because my focus problem doesn't seem to be getting better after I take them). I'm one year away from graduation but I'm really thinking about just redoing the last year of school cuz my grades have consistently been sucking for literally all but two subjects in school and those they've actually started to slack in aswell. I can't really make actual friends and I've been a cutter before (1 1/2years ago) but I've stopped because I thought things were getting better. However due to the return of my sister which keeps being an arse me and my lacking social s and bad grades I've recently started to think about cutting myself again because I actually feel that I actually felt better in the time I did it. During really bad nights or after a day that's gone even the slightest bit worse than the average (which for me really isn't a good day compared to normal people's lives) I've also been starting to think about suicide aswell, and those thoughts have started amassing themselves inside my head.
