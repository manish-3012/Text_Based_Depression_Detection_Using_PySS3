TW Suicide/Self harmFucking doctors are shit, been spiralling down very very quickly went from self harm on Wednesday and Friday to being awake all night thinking about how to kill myself. Psych is so busy that my appointments are 2 months apart. I told my doctor the way I feel I will be dead before my next appointment. All he said was I will write to psych and see you again in a weeks time. Is he not fucking listening to me, I could be dead by then, I told him this, made it very clear that the bottom is fast approaching and I can't stop what's coming by myself. He suggests coping strategies, well you can stick that, I'm way past coping.
