I'm honestly not even sure where to go from here or what to do anymoreI genuinely thought that I would've achieved inner peace by now. I cut off the people who made my life worse, made new, amazing friends and took the initiative to lose weight. Lost 55 pounds or something. I don't even remember or care at this point. I barely even eat anymore out of fear of just gaining it all back. Nothing I enjoy can ever fully make me satiated before my own intrusive thoughts come raining in and ruin it. I'm sickly and miserable all the time and still hate looking at my body in the mirror, so many imperfections. I don't really know what else to do, I genuinely thought I would've been happier just by losing some weight but I still hate myself. I don't really have anyone to talk about it with either. I'm not even looking for a response or attention anymore, I just needed to write my thoughts down somewhere.
