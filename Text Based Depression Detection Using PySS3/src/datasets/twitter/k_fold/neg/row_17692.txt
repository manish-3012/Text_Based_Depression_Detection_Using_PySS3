Spare motivation? Wish I could talk without feeling like a burdenRecently, I have thought about my lack of motivation to study for an upcoming graduate entrance exam. It didn't take long before I realized that I have been lacking the motivation to do much of anything for the past few months. I get by, sure, and I have a good life on paper. I don't know why I feel so crummy.

I graduated college a few weeks ago. The whole day was just a blur. I remember watching the commencement speech and thinking "I should be excited. Am I?" I know this is a milestone, but the whole thing just passed me by. I got great gifts and messages from friends and family, but I feel guilty that I didn't respond with enough appreciation. Feels like I am wearing a mask sometimes. 

Graduate exam is around the corner. I am working on it, and it feels like I am improving, but I can't sit down and focus. My mind wanders too much for an exam that requires intense focus. 

I want to talk to someone about it, but I feel like they won't know what to say. "Sorry to hear that," I guess. Who wants to get piled on with this shit anyway
