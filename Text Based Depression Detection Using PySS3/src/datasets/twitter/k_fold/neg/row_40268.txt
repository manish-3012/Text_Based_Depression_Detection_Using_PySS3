suicide hotlines suckI'm not sure where to post this but what the hell do I do when suicide hotlines dont work? I dont want to kill myself but I'm off my meds and the thought seems really really pleasant right now. I know I could go to the ER to be put in an inpatient thing and tbh I'm seriously considering but I don't have any money for that, and I feel like that would worry my girlfriend sick
I genuinely dont know how I'm supposed to handle this when every mental health professional or hotline I reach out to can do nothing for me
