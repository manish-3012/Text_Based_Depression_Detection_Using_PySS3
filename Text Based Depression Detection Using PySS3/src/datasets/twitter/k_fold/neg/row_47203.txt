I am fucked upIm a horrible mess of a person. I cant pay attention to anything for more than 15 seconds and I forget things really quickly. I have Fs as all my grades and 0s in every class. I havent seen my dad for a year and im not sure I want to. I have horrible anxiety that krrps me up at night and im short, ugly, and annoying. I sleep all day and night. My rooms disgusting and I cant even krep up with my chores in my house. I thought I was ADD but I went to the doctor and he prescribe sme with depression medication that doesnt help at all. On top of sll that ive got a lot of other shit fucked up in my head. Im only 14. It hurts my head to think thst life gets harder than this. The only thing keeping me alive is weed. The only place ive felt comftorable was the mental hospital I went to a few years back. I want to die. If I could think of a clean and easy way to do it I wouldve already.
