"oh you're still young, I'm sure you'll get a girl"(xpost because /r/offmychest were useless)

These insane fucks I swear to God. 

Statements like that will NEVER help the severe loneliness I feel without a significant other. It is a fact etched in stone that I will never, ever, EVER have a girl to call mine. I try my hardest to accept that fact and try and live life with it, but if I ever ask people for help (which is its own can of worms) then it all comes down to "you're just 16 you still have time" GUESS WHAT YOU STUPID FUCKS I KNOW MYSELF ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT NO SINGLE GIRL WILL EVER LIKE SOMEONE WHOS AS UGLY AND FAT AND MISERABLE AND LAZY AND STUPID AND UNLOVABLE AND TORTURED AS ME (and I don't blame them) SO SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT YOUR STUPID "HOPE" AND "FAITH".


If you want to help me, teach me to bear this fact in a healthier way.
