My mental state is physically painful and I don't know what to doI am diagnosed with bipolar 1. It's not really relevant, just saying that so you know I am trying to seek help already. Today I spent the entire day in bed and felt absolutely miserable. I felt completely exhausted and unable to move, but also extremely nervous and agitated and sad, and no matter what I tried nothing could make it go away at all. The emotions have been so awful it's been physically painful. I'm considering getting rid of all of my friends. Not because I hate them. I just don't think any of them care about me and I thibk I'm a burden. When I'm not there they're all much happier - this is something I've observed multiple times. They don't want me there. Nobody wants me or loves me. The only ones that talk to me with any frequency probably only do so because more important people are annoying them or not available to talk. My only purpose is as a 'venting machine' which gives out venting opportunities to others. Nobody cares about me beyond this capacity and my input of shitty jokes when they need someone extra for a game. I feel utterly worthless. I'm like an extra in everyone's lives, and I'm living in the world's shittiest movie. Nobody has even enquired about how I'm feeling, and I know nobody would care anyways. I'm so sick of feeling this way. Maybe I should just distance myself from my friends. They wouldn't even notice if I stopped talking for a few days. Maybe I should kill myself, so I don't have to live through this any longer.
