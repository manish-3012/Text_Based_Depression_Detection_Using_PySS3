I just want to dieI have been struggling all my life and I am just ready to give up. First it was my cousin sexually assaulting me and then my father. He never apologized but did say that he was feeding me and giving me clothing so that was the perk he could get it. He did this for 2 years. Now I have been able to escape and find my own place for 3 years now. I was barely making ends meet but I managed. I am very unattractive and no one loves me. My so called "friends" only talk to me when they need something. I am the nicest person I know but yet the worse happen to me.  I just lost my job a few hours ago and I failed my last college test. I have just tried and tried. If someone would like to kill me, please let me know. I'm Christian so I cannot do it because it is a sin. Although, I am starting to reconsider being a Christian as I have nothing but bad things happening to me for a person who's God is suppose to save them.
