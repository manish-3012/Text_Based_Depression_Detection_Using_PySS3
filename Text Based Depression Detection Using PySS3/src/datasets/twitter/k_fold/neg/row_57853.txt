Why must other people be the ones to decide whether I should be able to kill myself?Hi, I've already posted here once before, but nothing has really changed.

I may have got a job, and I volunteer, and I've got loads of very good friends, but I am still as suicidal as I was when I was born.

The thoughts have never abated. Medication and several types of therapy haven't done anything for me. I still have found no reason to carry on living that doesn't involve the selfish ideas of other people who want me to be around so they feel better about themselves. Every breath I have taken has been for them, but I am fed up of not giving into my one desire of ending it all.

Why must it be that what I am thinking is 'wrong' or 'despicable'. This is my life! My whole life! Are you suggesting that my very existence shouldn't have come about? Because that's what it sounds like. 

Why is it that my thought processes are somehow incorrect and should be corrected and managed? Why does everyone else have the right to say that their thoughts are somehow better than mine?

I am suicidal and always have been. Wake up and realise that maybe you aren't the ones with the semi-divine right to tell me that I am ill and that my very essence has to be changed in order to be palatable. I don't want to be 'cured' my longing to kill myself has been the only shred of security that has lasted my whole life! Why do you assume that I want to get rid of it?

(I know this is more of a rant than a cry for help, but I just needed to let it out)
