I don't want to kill myselfI don't know how to format this and this is my first time posting in my long time of lurking. I don't know what else to do. 

&amp;nbsp;


I'm 21 and am finishing up my junior year in college.  I have no idea what my plan is after graduation.  Honestly I feel like I'm not going to be good at anything.  Over spring break I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic attacks.  One of my best friends is studying abroad and my other best friend goes to school 6 hours away, so I tried to confide in another very close friend of mine.  

&amp;nbsp;



They didn't get that I have been severely struggling.  I'm so tired all the time that all I do is sleep.  My bones ache and I don't want to eat anymore because what's the point? I tried to talk to my friend, but they turned it around on themselves and said that I didn't care about anybody but myself and that I was being selfish and not a good friend. 

&amp;nbsp;



I'm starting to really believe them.  I am not a good person and I feel like everybody would have an easier time without having to deal with me constantly bringing them down.  I get scared because I don't want to kill myself, but I can't stop the thoughts from coming into my brain and it's starting to convince me.

i don't know what to do.  i feel like such a waste of space.  i don't know if my zoloft is working and im drinking every night to help me sleep.  i feel numb.  nobody will even care anyway.
