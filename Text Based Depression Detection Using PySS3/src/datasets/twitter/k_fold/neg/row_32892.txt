I just lost the girl i love.I lied, i lied to the girl i love, she's leaving me. I can't deal with this. I lied over stuff that happened in the past so she didn't have to know, she wouldnt have wanted to be with me otherwise. But i lied to her, i lied to her face. Trust was the biggest thing for her and i broke it. I dont know what im going to do without her. She won't talk to me about it and i feel so so shit about it. I'm genuinely contemplating this. I've spoken to my friends and they help me so much, but i dont know what to do. I can't move on, not from her.
