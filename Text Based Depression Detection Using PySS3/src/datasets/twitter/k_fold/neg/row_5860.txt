What help is left?I would like to make a suicide attempt to get help.  But I don't know what help is left for me.  I have tried it all - various meds, therapy, intensive outpatient therapy. I've been to the ER which is what got me into the outpatient therapy that worked for a while. But I couldn't stay in the program forever. 

Basically I don't know what going to the hospital or calling a hotline would do other than giving me a temporary fix. 

I just can't bear going over and over this again and again and having no permanent solutions. Depression is not temporary btw. I hate that fucking phrase.
