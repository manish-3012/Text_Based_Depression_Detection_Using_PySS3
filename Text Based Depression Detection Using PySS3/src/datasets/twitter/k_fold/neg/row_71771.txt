Living short termI dont know to how to explain it. Every day I tell myself dont worry you'll be gone and dead by next week/on Friday/tomorrow etc. I plan everything and pick the day, and then when it comes i push it one more day or one more week or whatever. But that just means I tell myself nothing matters and I care about nothing. I dont do my work, I dont take care of myself, I dont save any money. I'm so behind on school that I dont think its even possible to catch up and if it even was I dont think I'm capable of making myself do it. I have exams next week and i can guarantee I'll fail most if not all of them. I know exams are not the end of the world but it's just an example. I live with no purpose. It's a never ending cycle. Anyone else struggle with this?
