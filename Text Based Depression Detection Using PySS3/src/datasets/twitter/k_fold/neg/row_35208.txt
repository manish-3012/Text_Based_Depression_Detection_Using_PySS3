Every time things got dark I waited, and every time things eventually got better. But "better" is still embarrassing and shitty and pointless.I wish I had just ended it when things were bad enough that I could do it. Now what? I can't make myself live, I can't make myself die, I'm just rolling around in the dirt. This is unbearable.
