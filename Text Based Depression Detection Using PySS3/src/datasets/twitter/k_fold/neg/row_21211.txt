Please help me. I don't know what to do.I typed everything out &amp; then when I hit submit, everything got erased &amp; the page refreshed. So, quick summary. If you want to know more, ask.

In recovery for a little over a year from an eating disorder &amp; self harm. I was great for a while but I think I'm starting to relapse because I gained weight. Now I'm sitting here, crying my eyes out &amp; feeling disgusting. All I want to do is slit my wrists until I'm covered in blood &amp; then spend all day working out. 

I want to so bad. I have a razor sitting in front of me. I could so easily rip a blade out &amp; just do it.

kjdfkhsdfkhsdkfjskdjfsf. ugh.
