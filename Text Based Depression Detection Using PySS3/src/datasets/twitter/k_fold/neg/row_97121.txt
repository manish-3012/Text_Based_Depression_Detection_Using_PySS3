My best friend "broke up" with me because she wanted to be with my ex. Now half of my friends don't speak to me. She is still my flatmate.Around two month ago my bf and I broke up. After that I was totally out. I couldn't get any work done, I couldn't go out, be with friends, anything. I started to felt like I made a mistake that I couldn't take back. My best friend knew this. I told her I wanted him back that I wasn't feeling ok. I missed him.

2 weeks after that, my group of friends (including my ex and my best friend) went out for partying. At some point of the night, one of my friends (which has a girlfriend) started to try something with me. I reject him a thousand of times. Over and over. Even he tricked me and pulled me onto the boys bathroom in the club and I run out. I was very angry.

At the end of the night, I finally was totally wasted and accepted to have something with him. My mistake. He threaten me about not telling anything to his girlfriend or anyone. At the point he even said like "I will make you regret it". After that the situation just got worse.

The next days I discovered I was pregnant from my ex. I just couldn't eat, talk, see anybody. I was totally lost. I didn't know what to do. What to say. I was blocked.

A few days later. The "guy of the club" called me and told me we had to talk. He told me that he told his girlfriend that we hookup but he didn't tell her the hole story where he were trying so hard and I was avoiding him. And told me that the best way to overcome this for all of us is not talking about this to anyone ever because his girlfriend asked me to. And obviously they didn't want to see me more too.

After that, I got a little ""relief"" about that situation, and I wanted to talk with my ex, about how sorry I was (I made a big big mistake when we were together and I think is the main reason we broke up), that I missed him, and that I was pregnant.

I started a conversation, and after a "Hello" he told me he didn't want to talk to me or see me again (without me telling anything). I was totally socked about it, because I didn't know what this was happening, but I wanted to respect his decision.

And then is when all the crap just exploded.
That night, my best friend of 4 years (which also is my flat mate) kissed him. I don't know how but She made everything look like it was my fault. She didn't regret it and she told me that he was more important to her that I was.

What I know now is that she told my ex lies about our relationship and she blame me for everything. Also, she told me she didn't want to be my friend anymore and that I was a bad toxic person, that I tried to manipulate her but she didn't know how or why.

She was like my sister. That night, I wanted to kill myself. My heart was broken. Sometimes I wish I did kill myself, because now sometimes I feel like I am dead already since that day.

After that, she start telling my other friends that I was a very bad person, like a devil, and nobody should continue being my friend (or something like that I was told). They told me things that she was speaking about me. Most of them were lies, but I told nobody (except my mom) about this, because to be true I though nobody will believe me.

I know this because some of my friends noticed this lies and told me about it, because at that point none of them talked to me.
Also, she confessed when she was drunk to one of my friends that she felt horrible and guilty about what she did to me. That she only was confused because she wanted to have my ex for her, but she knew that will never happen if she were my friend, so the only solution was not being my friend anymore. But to do that without losing our friends and my ex she had to blame me somehow of all that. She asked for forgiveness to a friend of mine for this and ask him not to hate her.

On top of that, she stayed all last week sleeping in his apartment, with the excuse that she didn't want to be at home, but staying all day long in the apartment, just spending the night out with him. My friend feeling was that she wanted to have an opportunity with him.

I discover that this was her intentions like 4 days ago. I had like a panic attack when I discovered. 

I just felt so betrayed, lied, manipulated, and that all this wasn't fair. This last 4 days has been totally shit. I didn't wake up from bed, almost no food or anything. I can't sleep. I can't go out. I am complete lost. I don't know how to pass this state.

I feel very angry. I feel hate. And I feel so bad for feeling hate that makes everything worse. And my mind can't stop.

Only thinking about all this makes me cry non-stop. Breaks my heart over and over. I don't know where are even the pieces. I don't know how to continue anymore.

Plus all that situation, one of the best friends of "the guy of the club" told me that the guy only got involved with me because he wanted to pressure her girlfriend into being an open relationship or have threesomes, and that he saw an opportunity and took it. Thinking that somehow I will convince her gf to have a 3-some with me. ???. Yeah, WTF?!

I lost the fate in humanity. I don't know how to overcome all this. I lost my group of friends. My sister. My ex.

I don't want to live anymore. I can't trust anybody. I just cry. I cry a lot. I have mixed emotions of hate and love. All the time.

I sill in love my ex. I can't even hate my ex-best friend because I still love her too. But in the other hand, a little part of me want her to suffer what I am suffering right now.

I am totally desperate. I don't want to have those bad feelings about anybody. I just don't know what to do.

Did you ever have a similar situation? How did you get over it?
Some words of advice will be helpful.

PD1. I am not longer pregnant. I lost the baby due to the stress of all this after my best friend told me she didn't want to know from me again. Nobody knows that I was pregnant anyway.

PD2. I lost my job too.

PD3. I still live with her.

PD4. Is it my impression of am I totally screwed?
