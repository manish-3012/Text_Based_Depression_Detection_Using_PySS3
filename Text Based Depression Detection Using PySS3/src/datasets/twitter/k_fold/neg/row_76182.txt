Anyone Know Of Any Life Insurance Policies That Will Pay Out For Suicide?Already posted in /r/lifeinsurance, /r/insurance and /r/personalfinance. I just need factual info. Relevant links are appreciated: After the 2-3 year exclusionary period, are there any life insurance policies that will pay in-full for suicide, not just refund the premiums already paid-in? Thank you in advance.
