Living is exhausting &amp; too hard.Sleep is the only time when the pain and fear subsides. All I want is to go to sleep and never wake up. I don't want to live anymore. Things would be much easier for everyone, including myself, if I weren't here. However I'm terrified of how much it will hurt. And I don't want to cause my partner and my family grief. I don't know what to do. I am trying to get in contact with my psychiatrist but receiving no replies. I fear that this is how my life will be forever. I don't see things getting any better. I can't keep living like this.
