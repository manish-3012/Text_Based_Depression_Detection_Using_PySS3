I feel so alone.Me to my friends: Can I talk to someone Iâ€™m having a really hard time right now? 

My friends: ...

My friends when I kill myself: OMG HE WAS SUCH A GOOD GUY. I CARED ABOUT HIM SO MUCH. I WOULDâ€™VE DONE EVERYTHING I COULD TO HELP IF ONLY I KNEW. 

Everyoneâ€™s ignoring my cries for help. Maybe itâ€™s a sign.
