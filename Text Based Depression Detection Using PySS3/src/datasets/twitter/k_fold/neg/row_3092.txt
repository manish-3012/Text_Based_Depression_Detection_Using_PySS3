I don't want to do any of this any more.As I sit here..I realize how this may look but I've never felt more at peace than writing this now. 

When I reflect on my life I see so much pain. So much hurt and betrayal. Why would I want to continue on and live
in this world? What's the point? To get hurt more? 

Is this living life to the fullest? Watching people lie to each other 
and hurt each other? 

Constantly being the shoulder to lean on when I myself have no shoulder. I want to be able to depend 
on someone...Not a lover but a friend. Someone I can talk to who will listen without judgement. 

Some one who won't make 
it about themselves. Does that make me selfish? I guess so. I wish I could forget....everything. 

I wish I could start over. But you only get one shot, right? All I can think of is how much of an idiot I am. 
Sitting here writing this. No one's going to read this. No one cares.
I'm just being a baby right? I just need to grow up.

But I don't want to continue. I have no one. Why should I continue? I have no shoulders to lean on while I try to build myself back up.

I'm just something to be manipulated. Always have been. I'm just an outlet for people to take there issues out on. 

The one person I needed most doesn't need me. Doesn't care. Why should I waste my time?? I don't want to hurt anymore.

I'm so tired of hurting. I'm so tired of disappointment and pain. That's all this is. Everywhere I turn, nothing but disappointment and pain.

What's the point? I'm replaceable. I'm easily replaceable. There's billions of people out there. No one is really going to miss me. 

They'll find someone new to take their issues out on. And I can finally be left alone.
