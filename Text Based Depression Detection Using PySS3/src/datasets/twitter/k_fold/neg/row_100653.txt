I feel like Iâ€™ve completed my role in this world, and Iâ€™m ready to go.I can empathize a lot with Robin Williams. Often those who bring the most smiles to others tend to be the saddest. At some point in my life, I decided to be a light in the world. Iâ€™m a high functioning suicidal person. I always try to help others, compliment others, and be friendly. My kindness is genuine, and I never expect anything in return. Making others smile, or making others happy makes me feel happy. I feel like my role in this world is to make it just a little more pleasant for others. At the same time, Iâ€™m so ready to go. I donâ€™t want to be here any more. Iâ€™m great at my job, and generally well liked by others. But every night, I cry myself to sleep. Sometimes itâ€™s just light crying, but itâ€™s usually wailing sobs asking why Iâ€™m not dead yet. Every day I think of new ways to off myself and Iâ€™m getting closer and closer to achieving what I really want. Iâ€™m in that stage: the calm before the storm. I feel strangely at peace knowing that Iâ€™m going to meet my fate soon
