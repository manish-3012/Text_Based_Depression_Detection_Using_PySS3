I can feel the pain traveling down my arms into my palmsI think Iâ€™m a horrible person and I donâ€™t deserve all the good things I have.  I think Iâ€™m a waste of time and money and I donâ€™t belong in this life.  Of course thereâ€™s lots of things Iâ€™ll be sad to leave but I donâ€™t anticipate living past 30 if this pain never goes away.  Iâ€™ve been getting worse and it happened so suddenly that I donâ€™t know what to do and I donâ€™t see any way out.
