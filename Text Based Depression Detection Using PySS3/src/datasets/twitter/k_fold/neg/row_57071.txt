I'm doing it tomorrowI've got no reason to live anymore. Nothing to look forward to apart from the suffering the next day will bring. Nothing gets better and nothing will. I'm tired of hating myself and hating others. I want to be in control again.

I'm not leaving any notes. My thoughts will die with me.
