goodbyei've just written a note. i'm leaving tomorrow.

not sure why i'm posting this. i've been unhappy for a long time now, but just recently fucked it all up. i always told myself that if i ever fell off i'd do it. if i didn't get into uni, i'd do it. no chances of that happening now, so i'm out.

catch you guys on the flip side.
