I think about ending it all pretty often.I think about taking my life pretty often (every time I shower, sometimes when I have free time). These thoughts started popping into my head more often after someone informed me that one of the only 2-3 people I trust apparently doesn't care about me. I feel like I'm useless and a burden to others. So far I haven't really thought about how I'd take my life, I thought about what would change more. Even though I'm only 14 I feel like I already had enough of my life. Even though I don't have it too hard I want to stop living. I'm thinking of cutting contact to my online friends (my only friends). The only things keeping me from killing myself are my family and my online friends.
