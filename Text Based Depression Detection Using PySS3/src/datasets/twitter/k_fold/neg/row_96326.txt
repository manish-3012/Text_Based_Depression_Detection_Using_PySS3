I think I want to end myself (21 M)Been suffering from clinical depression for a few years. Mental health care wasn't a thing where I grew up, and it was only in the last couple of years that I started seeing counselors/psychologists (?). It worked for a while, but then some days is just more difficult than others. Tonight's one of those days. 


Life's been pretty average. Good friends, not too broke and so on. Unfortunately, there have been a few situations in my life that I wished had gone differently. Some of them are prolly my fault for how I approached them, but others just seemed out of my control. And on nights like these, these situations and memories just replay themselves over and over in my head, in a fucking spiral. I feel trapped.


I don't know what to do other than kill myself. I don't have anyone to talk to, at least not at the level I want to. Despite having good friends, I feel lonely. And that doesn't help the depression. Fuck everything.
