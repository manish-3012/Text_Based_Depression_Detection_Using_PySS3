Being gay is wrong.I know it's just warped self-hatred at this point, but I can't really see any arguments against that. "Being gay isn't a choice" and "Nobody gets hurt" are the most common ones, and they both suck, cause you can say the same for a bunch of other disgusting fetishes. The only part of me that doesn't believe that is my lust, and that only lasts for a few minutes a day, followed by twice as worse self-hatred.

I've tried to end it three times already, but I'm too incompetent to make it stick. Now I don't really have the energy to do it anymore. I don't have the energy to do anything else either. I just lie here all day doing nothing.

What's the point?

I have no aspirations or hopes for the future, but I can't just lie here forever. I think, when push inevitably comes to shove in a few months, when I run out of time and money, I'll opt for attempt number four. I just wish I had someone who can tell me exactly what to do, as if I was some kind of Sims character. I don't want to have to worry about purpose, and right, and wrong. I just want to be somewhere else. A fresh start where nobody knows me, and I can lie about what I am again. Why can't people just forget me?

Edit: I don't want to go the way of embracing it. I meant what I said about wanting to be able to lie again. A few people in my life know, and there's no way I can take that back. Thank you for any offers on helping me come to terms with it, though. They're kind.
