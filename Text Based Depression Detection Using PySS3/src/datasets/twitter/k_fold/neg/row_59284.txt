Too much of a wuss to kill myselfI wish I had the balls to pull the trigger or jump off a bridge but so far all Ive been able to do is make half assed attempts of swallowing some pills or trying to strangle myself with my phone cord. Anyone else experience this or am I just a little bitch? I constantly have dreams about killing myself and showing everyone that I could go through with it. I don't want to actually die I just want people to notice me for once, to just actually care and not just brush me under the rug. At least when I'm dead people will care about me. They wont forget me then.
