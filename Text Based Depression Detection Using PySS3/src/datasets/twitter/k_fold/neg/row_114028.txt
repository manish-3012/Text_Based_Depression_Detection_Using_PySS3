Starve myself to death.I'm very sorry if my post is a ramble, or else too short. My thought process is too scrambled at the moment to focus on anything. But even if nobody responds, I feel I may as well get this out. I hate myself. Other people hate me, and I may as well rid them of my burden. But I tried hanging, and I fucked that up. Wouldn't want anything messy to help others avoid cleanup duty, couldn't jump in front of a train or car so that I don't traumatise the driver.

So I may as well waste away. Maybe once it starts hurting I'll know if I'm really here or just stuck in some sick escapist fantasy, actually in the past.

If I am, I wake up. If I'm not, I get some rest. That'd be nice.

I don't want to die. I suppose that's the distinction. I want some rest. My life, every event, every conversation, I've seen it all before, it just feels like the past keeps turning back up. No matter how much progress I make, it just feels like a loop. I go into severe paranoid episodes that I'm stuck in timeloops, and this isn't helping. I feel this is a way to break the cycle.

I wake up to go to sleep. That's it. So figure I may as well take that to its logical extreme and live to die.

 Death is sort of the great sleep, isn't it?

Either I break free from the loops, or I break free from life altogether. Truth be told, either option is more appealing than the present.

If I fade away, maybe I'll eventually have some saccharine epiphany, and finally "be alive". Don't care. Anything but this.

Please.
