im so tiredim so tired so incredbly tired im so tired i dont even have the energy to kill myself yet alone self-harm

if when i die there is god or a creator i will be sure to try to kill them

there are the fools who'll try and stop me but i ive said before taking lives with causes me no bother

they have choosen not to listen so i will now prove my point 

once lockdown ends they will see their mistakes

i will show them all 

you said they wouldnt care that itll go over their heads i'll make it stick

They will remember me.
