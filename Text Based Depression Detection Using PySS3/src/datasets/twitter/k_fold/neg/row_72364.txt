My lifeâ€™s fine now, why the do I feel like this?When I (23f) was in my teens I was diagnosed with BPD I had a terrible relationship with my family, suffered from undiagnosed PTSD and hated myself and my body I had a lot of suicidal thoughts.  I understood why then tho I had all these reasons to be sad and upset. But now Iâ€™m older happier with my body, got a good job and I have a beautiful and supportive girlfriend, and a great group of chosen family but still .... I just donâ€™t want to go on. I feel even worse because I donâ€™t have any â€œreasonsâ€ like nothing is wrong but I just feel so miserable. And everyone being nice to me about it makes me feel even worse. I regrets not ending it all in high school so I didnâ€™t effect these peopleâ€™s lives. I have so many reasons to go on but nothing matters I feel like Iâ€™m sinking into a pile of gray sand and idk...  I have so much more to live for now and all I wanna do is stop everything. Just hoping someone else understands
