Today is impossible for me.I feel so fucking alone and worthless. Like thereâ€™s no value to my existence any more. Iâ€™m essentially jobless and so poor right now I can barely eat. Iv applied for so many jobs and nothing. I have an education, and I shouldnâ€™t be failing so much like this, but thatâ€™s all that has happened. Failure after failure. It hasnâ€™t gotten better in 4 years, despite being told it has to. I try to stay positive and think well about myself because I know, having studied psychology, that attitude changes things. And here I am. 25 and unable to support myself. I should be capable. Thereâ€™s really no excuse. But I fail. Iâ€™m slowly losing all my friends. I used to have so many. And now I feel like I have only one who loves and cares for me, but sheâ€™s living her own life in a different state, so itâ€™s hard for her to be there for me as much as I need right now. And I donâ€™t want to burden her. Or any of my other friends. I feel thatâ€™s why theyâ€™ve distanced themselves in the first place. Iâ€™m just too much for people. Iâ€™m too much for myself. I feel so fucking worthless. Iâ€™m so tired.
