Pondering the End.I have anxiety and Severe Depression. I have been on a self destructive path for 2 months now. Since my break up. We were of two different lives. We drank daily. She got offered a position Mon-Fri in which she didnt have to drink daily. I continued that tradition solo. Now I ruined it all. AA doesnt help because it doesnt rid my pain of her being gone. She was my everything. And since she left I made sure, not intentionally, that her and her family would never be back in my life. It was my only solution. Thanks to alcohol. 

Now, Ive sought help everywhere. I havent drank in a week. But she is going out Friday night with her friends. She will have no problem meeting anyone. Meanwhile, Im stuck in the dark pits of depression. I can hang on til Friday. Sure. But come Friday, i think a big bottle of booze and pills. This time I wont let anyone know where I am or what Im doing.

But she will find out, when my body is found. But if she comes on here. I want her to know that this isnt her fault. Its my fault. It's my fault I created this path for us. She is my soul mate. And I dont have the patience to find the proper help. I dont have the patience to better myself without her. And were both Mental Health Workers. Its fucked. 

But anyways. Ive never posted her but have found calm in reading others stories. 

Peace âœŒ
