Not everyone can live a good life.Unfortunately, everyone thinks that everyone's life can be better. This is such a shitty thing we do to people. We tell people it can get better even if the situation really is fucked up. Yeah, not everyone should commit suicide but for some people it is a logical decision given the circumstances. Life is really fucked up for some people.
