I donâ€™t want to be alive anymoreIâ€™m going to kill myself soon. I have no one. I moved far from my family. I lost my only friend almost a year ago because he couldnt deal with how clingy and selfish I am. Iâ€™m bad at my job and canâ€™t get a new one. Debt and bills are piling up all around me. Iâ€™m trapped and alone and I canâ€™t. anymore. Itâ€™s too hard 

I just cry and cry and my chest hurts and I want to reach out to someone but I donâ€™t have anyone anymore. I donâ€™t even hurt myself anymore. It doesnâ€™t help. My chest feels like itâ€™s being crushed 24/7 and nothing relieves it

Iâ€™m just done
