Tried to sign up for online therapy and was told Iâ€™m too high risk.I filled out the questionnaire for BetterHelp , the online therapy website , and it said Iâ€™m too high risk basically, just gave me info for a fucking crisis contact and shit. 
cool. I donâ€™t want to go to a goddamn hospital , I donâ€™t want to be jacked up on medicine 
I just wanna be gone.
