I may go this weekendI finished my PhD and was offered a place to stay on in the lab. At first I accepted but I changed my mind and handed in my notice because I no longer wanted to work with my supervisor. When I did my supervisor completely lost it with me as she thinks the project will not get published now. She threatened to accuse me of falsifying data and have my PhD revoked. I havn't falsified anything but my records are not very good and I'm afraid she will use that to carry out the threat. My girlfriend works in the same field and I don't know if she would support me through that, it would be incredibly embarrassing for her. She was already angry at me for leaving before publishing a paper. I have a meeting on Friday where they will go through all of my records and I don't know what will happen. If it goes badly and she wants to make a complaint to the university, I think I will kill myself. I just don't know how I could make it through that.
