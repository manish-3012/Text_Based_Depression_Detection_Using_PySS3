Can't handle everyday stressorsI want to die.  I can't handle life.  No trauma, no serious problem, just everyday life.

I'm a freshman in college, but it was like this in high school too.  I'm overwhelmed by the amount of work.  This weekend/coming week is particularly bad, but it's a recurring situation.  And if I can't handle a couple of essays every now and then, how am I supposed to survive in the real world, with a job?  I'm so anxious, which just makes it harder to do anything.

I'm very much aware of how pathetic this sounds.  I'm not even going to leave a note because everyone would think I was stupid.  Life is just beyond me.  I can't do it.  I'm so tired of trying.  I'm done, I give up.
