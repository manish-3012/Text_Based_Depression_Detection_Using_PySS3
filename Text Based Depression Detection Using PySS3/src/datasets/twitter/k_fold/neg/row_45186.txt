Feeling like the end is coming and there are no other optionsDoes anyone ever feel like they are slowly being swamped and are completely unable to carry on for no real reason? Life, the universe and everything just seems too much. Suicide seems like the only option, but more importantly it seems like the only thing that I can really control, it's something no-one can take away from me. On one hand I feel crushingly guilty for even contemplating, let alone planning such a thing, I know how badly it will effect people around me who love and care for me. On the other hand I feel a tugging, nagging pang telling me it's my choice, no-one elses, and it's the only choice I have when there are no other options to take.

I feel like I'm being backed into the corner and increasingly it feels like the only option. There is one person in my life who is making it worth living at the moment. She's keeping me going through the rough times but other than that... I'm finding it very hard to function as a normal human being.
