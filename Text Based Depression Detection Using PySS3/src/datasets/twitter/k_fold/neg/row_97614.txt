If I feel empty when I really have everything, what is there to look forward to?I've always thought I was meant for something. Not destiny, really, I stopped believing in religion in the 3rd grade... But I always just felt able, and ready to do something and be someone. 

I go to a top 25 school. Have plenty of girls. Supportive family. Decent enough looking. I'm young. And I want to kill myself. 

Been battling depression for 7 years (19 now) and I don't see much improvement in sight. Got addicted to the only thing that worked (adderall) and so here I am. 

Just feel sort of empty. Not sad. After all, I have everything. Nothing to be sad about. I just don't want to give this to my children. I don't want to pretend anymore that I'll ever be happy. I've never been content. Feel like I might as well find it in death.
