I finally got my dream job. But my anxiety is making it true hell.I'm finally a nurse! But the dream job quickly became tiring because of anxiety. It's a temporary job, and... Life before it was hell (2 years since I graduated - only got a job now) and it's gonna be over soon. 

I can't go back to nothingness again. I can't take that anymore... But... Working is being extremely anxiety inducing, because of all the people, and the vulnerabilities that years of isolation ended up exposing in me.

I'm already seeing this job ending... And I don't know, man... I have other means, but it certainly is fun to feel the storms outside the unit, by putting my hand off the 9th floor window and looking down.

But... I was always scared of heights... What happened to that?  

^Jumping ^is ^a ^terrible ^way ^to ^go. ^I ^wouldn't ^do ^that. ^But ^I ^don't ^understand ^why ^the ^extreme ^fear ^became... ^Excitement...
