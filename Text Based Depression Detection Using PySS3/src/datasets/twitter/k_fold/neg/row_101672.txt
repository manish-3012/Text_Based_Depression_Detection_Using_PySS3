i am going to kill myselfiâ€™ve been thinking about it for so long. i have a few ways i might do it. iâ€™m not planning when i do it, i just known that iâ€™m going to soon. every day I have a breaking point where everything is just too much, and it just keeps adding and adding. I almost killed myself the other night. i was driving and i just felt like driving into a lake or off a bridge. i kind of wish that i had.
