Just some thoughtsI feel like an empty person right now and this usually happens from time to time. Itâ€™s just that this time I feel even worse. I work a shitty job and have parents that in all honesty donâ€™t get what I go through. Iâ€™m depressed, they donâ€™t get it, Iâ€™m gay, they donâ€™t get it. Itâ€™s tiring, it makes me feel like Iâ€™m not gonna do anything in my life. Itâ€™s today that I again feel like Iâ€™d be better off dead. I wouldnâ€™t be the person I am. I generally dislike myself, I push people away and I try my best to not do it but Iâ€™ve already fucked my life up. I donâ€™t know what to do.
