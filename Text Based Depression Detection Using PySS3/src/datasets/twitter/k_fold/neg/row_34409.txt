Convince me that it isnâ€™t a good idea to shoot myself in the head.Yesterday, I opened my dadâ€™s gun safe with a pen and i found 2 loaded glocks. I put a note in the safe that i had opened it and it would be the best idea to find a gun safe with better security. I held the gun and my heart was racing at a million miles per hour. 

I put the gun back into the safe and locked it. Now thinking, I really want to use it to end my life.

I have been struggling for such a long time. It is too much to explain in text. Long story short: I suffer with severe physical and emotional pain every single day.

The only thing stopping me from using the gun is the off chance that I might still live and be crippled for life. Or the chance that I shoot myself in the temple and it hurts really badly and I donâ€™t die right away.

What are the odds that I might survive in a situation like this? I would much rather stick a ton of fentanyl patches onto my chest for a more peaceful death, but I wonâ€™t have the option to do that for another 3 years.

Thank you in advance. I am not in immediate danger right now, just really curious since it is my second choice if I were to off myself.
