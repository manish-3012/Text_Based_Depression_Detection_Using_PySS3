Sometimes I wonder why I'm still alive.I've been dealing with depression for the better part of 2 years and it's getting worse each day, sometime is just find myself wishing to not be able to feel anything or just die. I even felt like walking up to the roof and jumping and at one point I even attempted to act on it. My life is pretty good socially, I have friends, I'm a bit on the chubby side but it doesn't really bother me. I'm attractive for some reason. But I just want to die, I honestly want nothing more than to kill myself.
