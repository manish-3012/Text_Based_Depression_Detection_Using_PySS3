Feeling so usedI just had sex with a guy I had feelings for only to find out I was just a â€œgood timeâ€ for him. Iâ€™m at home crying. I just feel so hurt. I wish people could see me for who I am and not just for my body. I have a soul. Iâ€™m deep. Iâ€™m not just a wet hole. I feel so disappointed. In myself, in my judgment, and in this person. Why?! Why?! Iâ€™m such a beautiful person on the inside. I just donâ€™t see the point in trying anymore. This keeps happening again and again. Iâ€™m so tired of this. I drank a bunch of wine and took a Klonopin.  Hopefully this will numb me out enough. If I had more Iâ€™d just take them all. Who wants to be a wet hole over and over again? Iâ€™d rather never feel anything again. Iâ€™d rather not exist.
