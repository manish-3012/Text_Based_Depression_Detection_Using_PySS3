Does anyone want to talk?I'm not in such a hot mood tonight. I relapsed today and self harmed for the first time in 2016, when I couldn't handle all my anxiety and depressed thoughts anymore. It definitely didn't make me feel any better.

Honestly I don't really feel the need to vent about all my glorious problems, because I know in the end it will probably only make me feel worse. There's nothing I can do. I can't even end it because I don't have the means to.

I'd really like a distraction from everything I'm feeling right now. Does anyone want to chat? About anything.

I'm really into music, I'm passionate about singing and always have been. My tastes are a little all over the place. Lately I've been listening to mostly softer alternative stuff that fits the Fall vibe. I also play piano and the ukulele, both self taught.

Like anyone else these days, I love video games. Some of my fave are tlou, bioshock, twd, fable and fallout. The only game I play absolutely every day is acnl though. 

I'm also a big nerd. I love Harry Potter more than life, reading the series over and over again has really gotten me through some tough times. I like to write, but I haven't been inspired at all lately. 

I'd love to hear about anyone's day, week, even months - good things that have happened, funny stories. Opinions on music, books and games. I don't know. I just feel really lonely tonight and I don't want to keep overthinking everything. Thanks for reading.
