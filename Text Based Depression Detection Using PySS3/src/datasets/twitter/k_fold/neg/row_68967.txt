Just ventingI don't expect a response, but I just wanted to get my feelings out. 

I tried to commit suicide about a year ago. I hear people talk about feelings of gratitude after they survive, but I just feel dead inside. I don't feel grateful. I feel more hopeless than ever. The whole year has just kind of gone by. I don't speak to people. I rarely call my family and I haven't been anywhere other than work for longer than I can remember. I can't do another 50 years of this. If I had been successful the first time, at least my family would be a year into mourning and have moved on by now. I don't know what to do, tbh. I pray everyday that something will happen to me. I'm nearly done. I'm not even supposed to be alive. Why am I still here? I fucking hate it.
