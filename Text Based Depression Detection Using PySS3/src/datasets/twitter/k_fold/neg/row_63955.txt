My takeYou need to get her away from her family. They'll just make things worse. We make mistakes as humans all the time. Our fail safe as humans is to take lessons to avoid a repeat of such mistakes. She needs someone around her 24/7. Just keep telling her you'll stand by her no matter what. Do things to take her mind off her issues as much as possible. Don't let her out of your sight. She might have to confront those issues with you by her side. Don't judge her no matter what she does or says. That should help. Suicidal feelings are like fire. They go out when there's no fuel to feed them keep her away from judgmental people and exploitative people too. You'll need tons of patience too. Good luck
