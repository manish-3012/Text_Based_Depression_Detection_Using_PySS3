never really knowi guess i'm only writing this on reddit because i know someone will read it. i've been messed up for a long time now and i had another intake at another psychology center again this morning. the only thing i took away from it was that i am a "moderate to high risk" for suicide. i want to die i just never have the gumption to go through with it but i'm starting to feel the drive finally. i don't want all of the "you have people who love you" or "think about what your future holds" i just want to tell it to someone. i guess it's like my favorite drummer when i was little and still enjoyed doing things like that. he ended up killing himself and everyone was upset but his best friend said that he never wanted to get that phone call but he knew that it would come. it was just a matter of when. i'm starting to get closer to that "when". i guess if you read this thanks for wasting a bit of your day to hear out some sad depressed piece.
