"You can't force people to like you" well they aren't going to otherwise.Had a bad day. Ignored by my crush. Snapped at by people. What the fuck, man. I feel like if I'm any less than perfect than I am just fucking dirt. Really sucks I've been trying for a fourth of a century and I still can't get it right. I am literally the least important component of anybodys life and that's all ill ever be. I can't wait until I don't have to hurt them anymore.
