i just hurt everyone around meall i do anymore is hurt people. people should be around people who make them happy, but i just bring everyone down. i'm so bad with people that the only friends i have live a thousand miles away (literally, i've measured and they're all around a thousand miles off in different directions), and even those relationships are crumbling because i just can't maintain them any more, i keep pushing people away and then hate myself for it which causes me to isolate myself more, fuck why can't i just man up and go off into the woods and get it over with god damn it god fucking damn it why couldn't i have been anyone but me, i have the whole world going for me but i do jack fuck, id rather have faced hardships my whole life like other people have to, i don't deserve any of this, they do, and i've just come out of it with no drive, no goals, no interests, no character, no anything except broken relationships because out of all the monkeys that have taken over this world i was born in one of the best positions possible with one of the worst brains possible for life, i just can't handle life, i haven't done anything any suffering any hardships and hard work nothing, i'm  just useless and i don't want to change that, i know everyone reading this is already jumping to try to say i should change my uselessness or my attitude or do this or do that but i don't want to do any of that so don't waste your breath, i just want to stop existing. fuck.

edit: and if you're gonna say something like "it's a temporary solution", fuck yourself. see, now you know i'm an asshole, and only a piece of shit would try to defend someone like me. and now that i've labelled you all as shit, why bother. sorry for wasting your time.
