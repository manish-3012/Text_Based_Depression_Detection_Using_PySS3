I'm sorry for being myself.I'm sorry for being myself, human piece of trash. I just make mistakes, I'm egoistic and I can't live with myself no more. I'm done being useless and hurting closest people in my life. I'm dissapointment that shouldn't be in this world. I can't go on anymore. I just can't. Recently I even forgot how it is to be trully happy, to be happy with your own life. There is no hope. NO HOPE. No hope for a better life. No hope for being happy. No hope to make my dreams come true. No hope to even find someone in my love. There is no point in living. I shouldn't have been born. If I die right now, who will even care about it...
