I don't wanna exist.Ive been struggling for awhile Ive come to realize that maybe i was born into the wrong sort of family, my brother, sister &amp; even my parents are all normal but when i look at myself in the mirror I'm weird, I'm not normal. I have no amount of relationships with my parents, i barely get along with my mom. My sister can't stand me &amp; my brother growing up would never spend time with me he never invited me to events with him like he did with my sister. For all of my life i felt like Ive been walking this world alone. In truthfully most of us are alone aside from the occasional random person who comments on our post. I feel like no one, not myself and being myself is something that's unacceptable in my household. I don't have friends, family honestly whats the point anymore. I dropped out of high school because of bullying, i never got my ged, my parents never taught me how to drive, my mom gave up on homeschooling me. Ive accepted dying after the 4th maybe 5th attempt of ending my life. Ive accepted i don't have future &amp; that ending my life is most likely the best possible way of getting out. At least the random reddit users out there who read my post will know. I once told my mom that i was raped her response made me realize alot about growing up with her not the normal motherly response most kids would get more like the annoyance and not caring is what i got. I told her i couldn't have kids on my 22nd birthday and instead of trying to cheer me up she gave me the same amount of enthusiasm she gave me before. My life is right of now on a count down timer and there isn't much time left. So thank you for whoever comments to this post i can't promise or tell you if I'll ever read what you say, But thank you for caring to a random stranger on the internet.
