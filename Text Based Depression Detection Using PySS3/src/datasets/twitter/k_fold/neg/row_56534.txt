Choosing a dateSince I am now 110% sure I have no future, Iâ€™m in the process of choosing when to take my own life. I have a rough ballpark estimate of when would be the ideal time but thereâ€™s a lot of work to do before I go. Iâ€™ve already made up my mind about my method and will determine a location soon. It will probably be difficult to quit my job without raising any questions but itâ€™s best that thereâ€™s time for them to hire a replacement. Somehow everything feels lighter since Iâ€™ve come to this conclusion. Not sure why Iâ€™m writing any of this. Just putting my thoughts down I guess.
