I Need HelpAbout a month ago my brother killed himself, he was only 6 years older than me. I just don't want to live anymore. Even though people say that they care about my life, I feel that they are fake, untrue and sympathetic. The girl that I like barely even notices me. I am away from my family and am just losing the will to do anything, including breath. I feel like there is nothing that can make me happy. 

What I really need is somethingto help me cope and make me relax. I have been going to counseling but it doesn't do anything for me. Please, any other suggestions would help immensely.
