I plan to kill myslef when I'm forced to get a jobIt's a tiny thing, but I don't care. My whole life has been a "Go to school, then go home and play games and do nothing 'till you fall asleep" for 18 years. I've never had any adversity, I've run away from every problem and I'm an absolute lazy piece of shit. Out of the 161437 hours that I've been alive, I've probably been less than 100 hours outside willingly. Eventually, I'll have to get a job I hate because I'm too lazy and unmotivated to learn anything useful. School is out of the question, I just go there but I don't really give a shit. If I go to college I might do it there, if I can. Is that weird? Like I just want to do whatever I want forever. I don't care how immature it is, everyone must think like this, right? I've never had memorable experiences nor extreme discomfort or stress (except for this next high school year maybe since it's the year with finals), I've just floated through life as if I didn't even exist. I sometimes feel like blaming my parents, but I can't, they've done nothing wrong, they're only human too I guess. Nowadays I just try to distract myself from this impeding "doom". I don't feel like doing any of my hobbies anymore. Most posts here are people saying that their jobs are destroying their lives and stuff which I find admirable, I can't even imagine myself being in their place. Although it does kind of disappoint me that something as little as this depresses me so much. I know nobody can help me, I just want my feelings to be validated here I guess (and yes, I'm too lazy and scared to go to a therapist so no).
