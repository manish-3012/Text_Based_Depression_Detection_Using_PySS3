I'm ready to end it allI'm so close to just ending it all.  I live super close to an 18 meter tall cliff and I'm ready to just jump off of it and crack my fucking head open like a nut.  I'm so scared of myself, and so scared that I'll follow through with it all. I've been thinking about this for months on end, and more than a few times I've stood, with the wind howling in my face, over the top of the cliff.  It's gotten to the point that I'm ready to just jump; to just fall into the air and hit the wet, cold rocks bellow.
