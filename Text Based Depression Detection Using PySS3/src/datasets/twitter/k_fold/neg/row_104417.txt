No options leftThis post would be the length of a book if I wrote what I've been through in my life. I'm not special in that of course. My question is honestly, what do you do when you have no one and no where to turn.

It's like the epidemic of prisoners who re-offend because they have no way to function in society after being incarcerated for years. I cant and wont exhaust you with the history of my life because, just like everyone, it is a lot. 

I have fines that I literally can not pay. I can barely afford my car to get to work to pay the car i drive to get there, my rent is insane, I have no health insurance, I have been hospitalized for serious conditions 3 times in the last week and I have not one single person to turn to that will be there for me. 

I am intelligent and passionate. I want so many things for my life but if I could just end it all right now I'd do it in a heartbeat.
