Update to previous post DeniedSo last Saturday was a perfect cocktail for disaster. Alcohol, rejection, not having taken my meds in several months. A woman I had been dating was just leading me on for 2 months and waited until game night concluded and everyone went home to tell me there was no spark. We parted ways, I was respectful but hurt and watched as she left. I dont know the timeline after that.....but at some point I had a meltdown and went into a very dark place. I remember bits and pieces about posting to reddit for help, i vaguely remember calling 9-1-1. I recall my chest hurting like i was being stabbed in the heart and I struggled to breath all while I was tears like never before. Only once prior in my life had I cried like this. I remember the first responders showing up and I had tried telling them I am a Veteran, where to find my ID's and that I had several firearms in the house (for their safety to know about). I was taken to the nearest ER and held until I was stable then Monday morning transferred to the local VA hospital 20 minutes away. I was placed into inpatient care for Mental Health where I remained for a day and a half. I spoke with many social workers and docs along the way. My meds had been refilled, follow-up appointments made. 

Something I dont remember at all is wanting to hurt myself or anyone else. But during my stay on the hospital was informed I either answered yes to wanting to hurt someone or made the statement I wanted to hurt someone. I have since went back and read my drunk and depressed post and still do no recall typing any of that out. But because of this, my firearms were taken in police custody. When I stopped by the station today to reclaim them, the police pointed out the firearms were circled around me in the living room where first responders had found me. At that moment, I asked if the police would kindly retain them for another day or two until I have confirmation from the docs that I can get them back. The police had no issue with my request. At this time I also thanked my local police for taking care of my dogs until I was able to get a hold of a friend to take care of my two dogs. It was a battle at the hospital to get access to my phone over the past 3 days.

I have much work ahead....to work on myself and become a better person, a more stable person. I have one person in the area I call a friend and need to grow my circle of friends. I am sorry for anything offensive I have said/posted and thank you to those who gave kind words/advice....you may be the reason I called 9-1-1 and sought help
