Why does my brain do thisI hear storyâ€™s about how people just sleep off the day and I get it I have waisted my fair share of time but more recently I have found myself staying up for longer and longer amounts of time (even though people say it can help how I feel it hasnâ€™t done anything to help) since I have had multiple reoccurring nightmares and for some odd reason my brain thinks that right before I go to bed to remind me both the basic depressed/suicidal thoughts and that the nightmares could come back and happen again or even be worse.
 Last night was one of the worst nights of my life (well for me dealing with sleep) the whole nightmare thing happened again after my troubles of actually falling asleep and trying to ignore all of the thoughts that where in my head at that moment (I finally fell asleep probably around 10:30 or 11) and I woke up around 1 and I couldnâ€™t get back to bed but the nightmare I had that night was basically sleep paralysis but where it just never ended and it felt like hours if not days of not being able to do anything but see I couldnâ€™t even breath and the thing is that it felt so real.
Iâ€™m not to sure if this is the right place to put this but anyway thanks for reading this far and I hope anyone who reads this knows that i truly care and that if you want/need to talk that you can always talk to me.
