So many before meSo many before me committed suicide much younger than I am now. They have gained even less experience in life than I have now, and I have had enough of this life. They had conviction enough to end it, why should I not have even greater conviction after suffering for so long? Why should I suffer any longer? I wanted to die young, but I couldn't bring myself to it. Now I have every reason to do it. My younger self could never imagine how bad I would be feeling today. The constant broken heart feeling, my heart sinking into my chest everyday without fail, total separation of humanity. I've had my fair share of this pathetic life. I have nothing to complain about when it comes to ending my life as others before me have experienced even less and have ended their own lives.
