Too many thoughtsI'm not sure if completely "qualify" to be posting here, but it seems like the best place to go.

I've been having too many bad thoughts lately. I've been having a hard time for a couple years but it hasn't started to really break me down until somewhat recently. I'm 18, finishing high school and hopefully going to college soon. I'm trying my hardest to go away for college because living in my house is a nightmare. And I know it's not just me. Both of my older sisters were on antidepressants or anti anxiety medication before they moved out. I'm afraid that I might be stuck here and I'll never be able to go anywhere in my life. I can't keep myself together mentally for much longer and I don't want things to get to the point I can't fix anything. Really I just need someone to talk to. Any help would be absolutely appreciated.
