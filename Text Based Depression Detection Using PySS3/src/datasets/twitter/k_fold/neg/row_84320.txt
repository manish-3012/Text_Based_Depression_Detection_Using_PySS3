The 'process'I am too systematic for my own good. Can someone please explain to me what will happen if/when I kill myself, down to the small legal minutia? Basically, I'm looking for the 'if you're gonna do it, you might as well do XYZ' guide to not making everyone else's life more complicated guide. By giving your two cents, you are not...I'll be clear...YOU ARE NOT ENCOURAGING me to kill myself. The more I learn about the legal intricacies involved in the lives of others after someone commits suicide, the less inclined I am to kill myself. So...if anything, consider your contribution a point against killing myself. I really just want to know, if and when I die, however it happens, be it by my own hand or some random accident, what will happen next? And I mean play-by-play, detail-by-detail, here. Let's say I do kill myself, by...I dunno, let's say jumping off of a cliff, or shooting myself in the head in some random unpopulated place. Who can I expect to find me? Who will report it? To whom will they report it? Who will show up at the scene? What will they do... will they collect evidence, take photos, etc. Who will be called in, if anyone, to identify me...or what is left of me...or confirm my identity? What kind of legal shit will my loved ones potentially have to go through? Can I leave something to my therapist in my will, or will that cause legal trouble for her/him? What if I want to leave something to a past therapist as well? How much time must pass before I can leave something to him/her? I am a detail, sciency person. Please...someone, if you know anything about the details, please help me out. It just might be enough to stop me.
