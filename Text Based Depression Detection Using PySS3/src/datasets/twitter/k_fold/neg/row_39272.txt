the only way to end the pain is to end everythingwack title but it's how I feel. I have alienated myself. My best friend has finally realized that I am a lost cause and has moved on. My family deserves better. I don't contribute anything to anyone. I have a bottle of lorazepam I'm going to take. I know what four pills can do to me so a handful will definitely take me out. I can't fight anymore. I'm giving up.
