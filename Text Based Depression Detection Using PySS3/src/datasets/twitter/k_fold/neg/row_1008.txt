i dont want tips on how to get women you fucking dongI already know that I'll never ever, not in a 100 lives, not in a million years, not even after will a girl ever like me. And it seems like I'm the only one who believes that. Like I'm crazy? I mean I guess I am, but this is just fact. Straight up fact. I cannot and will not be loved. I wasn't meant to be loved, I wasn't to have companionship, I wasn't meant to be appreciated. So \*\*\*STOP\*\*\* giving me advice on how I should get women because guess what I've tried literally everything I could to better myself and my life both for myself and some hypothetical future partner. But it did absolutely fuck all. 

I was given this life by whatever greater being exists just to suffer. I'm ashamed and tired of being so hurt. In so much agonizing pain. 

I started out thinking I'd write this with some sense of nihilistic wit, but the tears are finally welling up again. I cant live this life. I cant stand so much pain and torture. I'm sorry, but this is too much, and to even think that this is all it'll ever be is more than enough reason for me to shoot myself right now. So that's what I'm gonna do. Fuck.
