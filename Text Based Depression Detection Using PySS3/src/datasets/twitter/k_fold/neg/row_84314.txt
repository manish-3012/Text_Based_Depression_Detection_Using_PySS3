TonightEarlier today I said I explained I wanted a slow death. Putting it out made me think more and more, and... Yeah. I am a coward. I wanted to avoid both living and dying. That's... stupid. I am suffering even more because of that. So it makes more sense to simply just do it. Perhaps tonight. Definetely tonight. Tonight.
