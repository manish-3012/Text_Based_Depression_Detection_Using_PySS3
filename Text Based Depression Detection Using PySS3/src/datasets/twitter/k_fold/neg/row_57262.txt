I keep deterioratingI can barely do basic functions anymore. I fall asleep without brushing my teeth, I'm starving but I have no will to eat. I can't go to sleep without being completely and utterly exhausted. Doing things that are supposed to make me happy only serve to stress me out. My mind and my body are diseased, my brain is full of cotton and bugs. I can't keep going. I was going to wait until I can buy a shotgun but I might just say fuck it and cut my body up until I bleed out. But I have nowhere deserted to go, I can't drive. I don't want my dad or anyone else to find me before I can die. It hurts so fucking much. I'm so so sick, therapy doesn't work and medicine only numbs me. I wash my body over and over but I will never be clean, everything scares me and I can't keep relationships. My mom is dead and the images of her dying haunt me every day. I'm always dissociated. I haven't been okay since I was little. I'm. So. Fucking. Tired.
