Suicide hotline hung-up on me.After spilling my guts about how sexual abused turned into  PTSD and depersonalization/derealization disorder and how that has ruined my life and how I turned into an alcoholic. Me and her talked for a while then all of a sudden she put me on hold and when she came back she said "sorry I should be more professional" and then hung up and then I heard the phone buzz (when someone hangs up on you).

We spent like an hour on the phone together so I'm guessing her quota was up and that she was forced to go to the next "customer".

Like wow.

Excuse me while I drink myself to death.

You know what I get it the world doesn't revolve around me people need help more than me but you know what I'd rather someone say "Hey our hour is done if you need help call the suicide hotline again, i need to go, best of luck" instead of some fucking bullshit.
