Life stalls out at 30.I'm about to hit 25 and none of the hobbies or communities I actually give a shit about have a place for old men. Once you cross that manchild barrier, you're just that old fuck that nobody really wants around.

I've wasted my youth, and youth is the only part of life that matters. Once you're old nothing fucking matters. Your body and mind start to go downhill, you feel dirty for indulging in childish hobbies, you look at the other people in your position and realize how pathetic all of us are. Even if you try and improve your life, what's the fucking point? You're a laughable excuse of a person that couldn't do it right the first time.

If you don't get your shit together by 25, 26 at the very latest, there's no point in living your waste of a life.
