Hey everyone, I want to die but can't.I've been wanting to die for a very long time, but don't have the resolve to do it. I've purposely ruined everything in my life because of BPD, but yet I still want to stay around. I have no idea why I would want to stay around but I do.

I don't have a future, but I'm hopefully for one.

I keep trying to kill myself, but my body doesn't let me die. I've broken myself down by starving myself, making myself sick, bedridden and many other things, but my will to live is still there. It's crazy that I'm still here with everything I've done to myself.

I think it's because I'm scared of what's coming next. Do I restart this life because I killed myself, do I go to hell or nothing at all? No one has the answer, but I don't thing it would matter even if I did. I do know that I want to die before the end of this year and even gotten a pretty peacefully way of going.

Sorry for the rambling on, I just wanted to get it out there.
