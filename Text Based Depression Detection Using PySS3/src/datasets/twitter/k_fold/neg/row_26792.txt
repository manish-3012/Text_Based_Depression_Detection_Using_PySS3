I JUST WANT TO FUCKING GIVE UPI don't know how much longer I can hold on, I've planned for the 17th of March to end my life. I'm trying my best to hold on, to fight, to stay positive. Do you know what it's like to get angry, upset, frustrated over the fact you're still breathing &amp; alive?
I'm so sick of feeling depressed and anxious all the time, panic attacks for no fucking reason. I'm sick of always thinking of ways to die and when to do it. I'm sick of everything that caused my depression and anxiety and past experiences. I'm sick of the pain.
I am fucking trying my hardest please know that.... I really am trying :'( I don't know if you would cal this a cry for help or what?
The sad part is I see my counselor on the 16th and I'm still contemplating whether I should tell her or not. If I tell her I risk EVERYTHING! I don't want to be assessed or admitted in to hospital fuck that. I'm not getting anywhere, I'm a complete failure, biggest fuck up ever.  I just tell myself I need to do this and get it over with and stop thinking about it and actually going through with it and getting this bullshit over and done with. Fuck it,. :'( Anybody out there even care I still exist? (17 year old)
