Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to kill myselfIâ€™m only 17 and I feel like life is too heavy.
Life to me is dull, repetitive and too painful. When I was younger I used to literally slam my head against the wall(a form of self harm you could say) but now I donâ€™t even have the effort to do that.
I feel like Iâ€™m not even a person but a ghost or a husk of the person I once was. Truth is I hate how the world is, the way itâ€™s structured, how people are scared of expressing there feelings because of the risk of persecution - weâ€™re forced to put on a mask of positivity to hide the true anguished face of our being. 
I do believe in God however so Iâ€™m not scared of death even if that means going to hell but I feel like death is the only option. Those brief feelings of â€œhappinessâ€ to me are fake and emptiness is my natural state with violent waves of hate. I would like help but I donâ€™t think all the help in the world is going to save me. I wished the fakeness was real. 
One day the urge will become too strong and it will overcome me - just wanted to put this out there before it does.
