For the past two years I've been in a downward spiral.Within the last two years, I dropped out of High School, eventually got my GED, and got into a state college on Pell Grants, but I've gone and fucked that up. 
Today, I am realizing that I'm not going to make anything out of myself. I've been looking for a job during these two years, I temporarily had a job at a 7/11, but I was fired for "Not fitting in." 
That's what my life has become.. Not fitting in. 
I've been thinking about just jumping off of a building and ending it. I even know where I want to jump. I just don't want to leave my mother alone, so I've held off long enough. 
I've lost all hope, and I don't know what to do.
Help me.
