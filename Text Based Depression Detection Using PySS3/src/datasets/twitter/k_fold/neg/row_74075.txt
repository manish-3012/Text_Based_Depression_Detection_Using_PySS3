Im scared to keep living but scared to take my lifeI donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing. Made an alt account to post this. I have practically no friends i'm antisocial and have trouble talking to people. I moved a year ago (I am not adult will not be added specifics for age or grade.) and got bullied for a year then got pulled out so now Itâ€™s my second year being homeschooled, and my last. So what iâ€™m getting at is at the end of everything I have one close friend and a cousin I care about. My Close friend attempted suicide a month or two ago and My cousin says the family makes them want to kill themself. Iâ€™m terrified of loosing the two people I actually trust. They are probably the only reason iâ€™m alive at this point and iâ€™m ashamed that I didnâ€™t offer enough support to the point my friend tried taking there life. 

I am infinitely thankful it didnâ€™t work but still scared. What if they do it again? What if my cousin attempts it? Not only that but Iâ€™m scared about so much shit getting a c in class because my standards are too high for myself. Scared of my parents finding out I think theyâ€™re toxic and abusive, Scared to go back to school and the possibility of dealing with bullying again. At the end of the day iâ€™m just an antisocial overwhelmed loser whoâ€™s waiting till they crack. I mean I have no friends to the point i'm making a reddit post about how I want to kms I feel completely defenseless in a way Like I have no outlet. I have no way of knowing whatâ€™s happening next. Every time Iâ€™m a little happy something bad happens to the extent I feel like I donâ€™t deserve happiness. Iâ€™m staying up to avoid tomorrow because iâ€™m scared of whats coming next. Itâ€™s like I haven't had a breath of fresh air in years.
