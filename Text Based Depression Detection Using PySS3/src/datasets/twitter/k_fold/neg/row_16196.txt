Back again. I tried last night, but threw up the pills. I ran away from the hospital angry that I am still alive. My GF of 10 years is gone. My family mostly hates me. I have no friends. No job. I can't even afford to get a replacement drivers licsense. I'm waiting on umemployment and living in a halfway house where everyone is drinking or using drugs. I've tried to see a light at the end of the tunnel, but I can see nothing good about my life. It's almost unfair to ask me to endure this pain. I'm in such a hole and I have no way out. I'd move out of here, but I am broke. I'd get a job, but I have no ID. I can't even afford fucking bus fare. My GF is seeing someone else and my heart is broken. I've never in life imagined a person could hurt so deeply. Nobody really cares about me. I'm all alone and the only thing I can think of is how great it would be to not feel this way. And no amount of alcohol or drugs can fill that void. It'd be better to be dead. Christ, I can't even go out in public without wanting to cry and hide. I'm stuck in this foul house, with foul people and nothing to look forward to, except a non-stop montage of thinking about my ex, and the life that I lost. I'm crying so hard right now. I can't take this. I've had three serious attempts in the last two months. I think my next one will finally do the trick. I don't even know why I bothered to write this, except that I want somebody to know how hurt I am and how that pain is causing me to take my own life.
