11 Dec.I've been lurking around the depression sub red lately, seeing how everyone was doing, making sure that I wasn't the only one one who has the feeling of getting eaten up inside. That I wasn't the only one going through this all alone.

I have been seeing a psychiatrist and a social worker for almost a month now. Just doubled my fluvoxamine intake since Friday. There had been times when they wanted to admit me, just for my own safety. But I managed to convince them that I was fine, that I'll look for help when I need it. The truth is, I can't afford to stay a night there. I really wish I could be there, getting help. I haven't let my family know, I just don't want them hurt. Staying at the hospital would inform them and I don't want that either.

What I am trying to say is, that I am really done. I can't take it anymore. I already gave myself a date. Planning to live to the fullest till then. I've been updating my journal, saying my sorrys and goodbyes. I hope the rest of you guys to be well. Seeing how some of you get out of your attempts has made me want to give it another go. But I don't think I can anymore.
