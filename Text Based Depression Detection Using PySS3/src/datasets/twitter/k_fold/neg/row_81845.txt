What's the point?I just made this Reddit to vent out my feelings and suicidal thoughts, because they have been bottled up for so long. 

Let's just recap my life:

[F 19] First and foremost, I lost my mom to cancer when I was only 9. It was horrible watching her die in front of very eyes at such a young age and there was nothing I could do. I am an only child and the only family I had left at the time was my father and one uncle because the rest of my family is bat shit crazy. Fast forward to age 17, and my one close uncle died in front of my very eyes from cancer just like my mother. Now, it's just me and my dad. I love him so much, but he's very strict and can be overbearing at times. He's an older parent, so I know I only have about 20 years left with him at absolute *most.* After that, I will have no family whatsoever.

I am athletic, fairly attractive, and "normal," yet I have never dated anyone or have any friends. I am currently in college, but I still get bullied every single day by my peers. I thought this pointless harassment would end in high school since college kids are more mature, but it's only gotten worse. I am friendly to everyone so it drives me nuts that I get bullied for no reason. Nothing sets me apart from my peers because I'm not a "nerd" or "weird." I wear makeup/nice clothes and smile at everyone and that has not done a single thing. Is there a sign on my forehead that says "bully me?"

Some days, I really want to die because I have nothing. I am almost in tears typing this because I feel like my life will never get better because it's only gotten worse. The only thing I have that keeps me sane is going to the gym and lifting weights, but on nights like tonight, nothing can stop me from being suicidal. I am scared of dying so that is another reason why I have never attempted killing myself. I feel like one day things will only get worse and I will end up doing it once I reach my breaking point.
