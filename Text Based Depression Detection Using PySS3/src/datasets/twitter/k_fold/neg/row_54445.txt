Eventually...Throwaway account.  


I've never wanted to live into old age. I'm 30 now and am content with the idea of being gone in the next 10-15 years. I am not actively pursuing death - rather hoping it comes to pass. 

I'm so disenchanted with the world as we know it. I don't see the point in the human existence and am so disgusted by what is going on in the world today. I just don't see the point.

The problem I am facing now is that my husband wants a child. I have always been on the fence about this but have been leaning way over to the side of staying childless. I could not fathom leaving this world with a child of mine in it. 

Right now - it's lose my marriage and likely pass on in the next decade or have a child and live on. But I don't know if it is fair to anyone if I live a life I don't even want. 

I'm just kind of lost in this in-between where I have to paths to choose: childless and early passing or child and living a life I can't say I want.

I don't really know what to do or what guidance to seek.
