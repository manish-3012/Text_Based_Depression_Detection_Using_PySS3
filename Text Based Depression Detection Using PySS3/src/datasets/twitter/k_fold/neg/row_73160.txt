I felt like i lost all my happinessYou can find my status my depressed situation. A friend i know is dating my ex, and i cried and cried. I try to be happy, i thought maybe i can find another man but...it feel like i lost. I give up, i cancel events and hangouts. I just wanna die. I feel like i can never be my self nor can i bring myself respect after the breakup. I feel such a loser and i just wanna give up and plan my day tp kms.
