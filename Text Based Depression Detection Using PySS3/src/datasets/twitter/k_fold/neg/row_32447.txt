some mental health resources for California and beyond...Ok, thanks to the hard work of aenea,  here are a few places to try in California for those seeking some assistance:

[Lifering Northern California](http://www.unhooked.com/meetings/meetings.html#1)   


[Oakland Centre for Holistic Counselling](http://www.jfku.edu/counseling_centers/locations/oakland/)  ...affiliated with JFK University. 

UC Berkeley Psychology Dept.. (http://psychology.berkeley.edu/graduate/cl_clinic.html)  cheap or free or sliding scale.

[Alameda County mental health resources](http://mhaac.org/community_mental_health_resources.html)  some free, some sliding scale.


Also, it's worth reposting the incredible list of inpatient programs put together by cfabbro some time back - all sort of places [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8bwsy/mental_health_resources_usa_states_behavioral/)



Thanks maxwellhill for reminding me of that.

And [this](http://mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/databases/) is a "Mental Health Services Locater" from the US department of Health and Human Services.
