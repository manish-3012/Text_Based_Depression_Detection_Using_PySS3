I'm starting to think today is the dayCall me selfish if you want but not being able to find anyone to love me the way I never was growing up is really making things hard for me. Nobody talks to me anymore and the girls I do get close to just use me for sex and don't want to go any further with me. I hate this feeling. Being unwanted and j loved by everyone including yourself really fucking destroys everything good in you. Unfortunately I think this might be the last straw for me. Again, call me selfish, but I'm not able to continue like this. I'm not able to keep feeling unloved and unwanted by everyone around me. I can't just love ,yself and be single. Loving myself has been an impossibility for as long as I can re,ember without feeling loved and needed by another person. Therapy has never ever helped and I'm not going to be looking for a fourth therapist or seeking medication that will ultimately just make me feel worse and take the joy out of the last few things I have left.

I'm unable to be helped and all I want in this world is to feel wanted at this point but I can't. I think I'm going to blow my fucking brains out tonight.
