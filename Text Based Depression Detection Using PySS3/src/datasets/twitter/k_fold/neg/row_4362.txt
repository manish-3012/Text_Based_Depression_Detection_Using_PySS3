No where to goMade a throwaway account for this, but I just feel so lost now. My dad hits me, I'm struggling in school, and I just feel like I want to end everything. All my friends ditched me after 8th grade and girls don't take me seriously. I feel loved by no one. I'm a 240 pound freshman and I try to lose weight but I just can't.  I play 4 sports, only eat 3 meals a day, work out constantly, and eat extremely healthy. I just want to end my life so I don't have to go through this shit anymore. I had big dreams for myself and now I just want my future self in a grave.
