what's the point in living when i don't feel as if anyone is really herei know some people care but i really don't understand why i still live, it seems as if it would be better just to end it all. other than a few people no one really cares, and i just can't fucking take it anymore. i know im a burden to everyone, and just a fucking pain to them too.
