I think its timeIts getting bad again. I dont have any friends and i just feel like nothing but a burden on my family. I have no life experience all ive done is sit in my room for the past 7 years. I only leave the house a few times a year. Ive only had one job that lasted for not even a year and im 24.. atleast i think i am i dont even know my age anymore. Im so ashamed of the person i am. Im so embarrassed. I'm a failure. I honestly cant do this anymore even the will to stay so my family doesn't have to deal with the pain of me killing myself is dissipating. I'm an empty shell with no meaning so i think its time. I just dont know how to do it. I dont know what to do all i can think about every second is killing myself i dont think i can fix it this time. I dont even know why im posting this. Im sorry.
