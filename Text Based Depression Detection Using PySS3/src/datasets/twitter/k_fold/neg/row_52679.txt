Just wanna dieI'm a failure and worth noting. I rolled into the best art university in my country and I failed it. I grew up watching a never ending drama in my family. I'm suffering from depression and social anxiety. I have no friends. I loved someone to pieces but a few days ago realised that he was dating another girl. I'm a closet atheist in a religious family and I can't tell anyone because I'm a coward. I've never talked about my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts to anyone. I just posted this because I can't take it anymore. 
I didn't even make a throwaway account. I hope I die soon. I hope I'll be able to end this shitty life. I feel like I have never truly lived so what's the point of continuing this life?
