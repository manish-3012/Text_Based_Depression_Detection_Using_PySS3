To my imaginary girlfriend that appeared in my nightmare;I'm so sorry.

I'm so fucking sorry.

Please, believe me, I never wanted to hurt you. All I wanted was to love you. The warm kiss was completely intentional, but what I did... I've seen shit like that happen to my mom. I've had that shit happen to me. I know what it feels like when the person you trust bashes your head into a wall and makes you bleed. Sure, it was my father then, but still...

I never wanted to hurt you. I never wanted to make you bleed. I never wanted your beautiful dark brown hair to be covered in your own blood, or your deep dark eyes to be filled with tears. Your beautiful lips where meant for lovely whispers, not agonizing screams.

I'm so sorry. I'll never forgive myself for what I did to you. I know you're a figment of my imagination, but seeing myself beat you to a pulp... It's broken the last little bit of hope I had. If it makes you feel better darling, I will punish myself wholeheartedly for what I did to you.

I'm so fucking sorry, baby. You didn't deserve to be hurt like this. You deserved love and kindness, and even though you're only in my nightmares, I wish I could love you. I wish I didn't have to hurt you. I'm so sorry babe.
