My world is crashing downTonight is the night that will decide if I have the will in me to continue. Iâ€™m in a relationship that is currently going downhill atm. She would usually throw the â€œletâ€™s breakup or we need time apartâ€. Itâ€™s not easy we have a kid together so thereâ€™s that. Guys I actually donâ€™t know how to go on without this chick. Ik there are some people who say that i will get over it. Yeah maybe in a few years but I donâ€™t want anybody but her.  If sheâ€™s gone from my life then thatâ€™s it
If thatâ€™s the case then expect to hear on the news of a guy who threw himself off balboa pear.
