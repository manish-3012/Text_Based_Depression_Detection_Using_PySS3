I have nooneI have noone to talk to. At all. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since i was 11. I've been to therapists and a mental health clinic so i know pretty well what happens if someone talks to a therapist about their suicidal thoughts. When i was in stationary care people who talked to their therapist about their suicidals thoughts weren't allowed to leave the building, or even their small rooms until someone decided that they are doing better. So talking to a professional about my thoughts isn't an option. My father died 2014 and my mother is bipolar. I've tried talking to her but she only told me that i'd be better off killing myself. So that isn't an option either and since i don't have real friends (the people i associate with only tolerate me and only talk to me if they want something from me) I have literally noone to talk to. My point is that I'm alone and my desire to kill myself is getting bigger and bigger every day. The only things that are keeping me from jumping off the nearest bridge are drugs (weed, alcohol) and videogames. I don't know for how much longer i can postpone it though.
