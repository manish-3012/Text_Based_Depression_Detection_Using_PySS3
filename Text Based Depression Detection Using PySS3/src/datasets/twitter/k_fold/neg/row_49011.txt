I can't keep up this charade much longerI'm coming up on the finals for my masters degree, I've got no job prospects, no ideas, no future. 

I have an exam tomorrow that I haven't been able to prepare for because I've been buried alive in term papers, which I am now stalling out on. I haven't slept restfully in weeks. I've got no ideas what to do, and now I'm running out of motivation.

I got pushed through school every step of the way with the promise of "It'll get better better", "you'll get to be a grownup one day" and all the other cheesy bullshit. Now I'm staring down the barrel of the end of schooling and I'm worse off than when I started. I'm not even sure I can make the hurdle at this point and I don't know how I'm supposed to let everyone down. I'm fucking 24 If I hadn't hit my stride by now, I'm not gonna hit it here. 

I feel like I'm not even in school anymore for myself, but just so my parents and grandparents think I'm successful and can brag to all their friends. My friends think I'm being melodramatic, and I can't even talk to my parents, my dad just appeals to authority and tells me If mom finds out she'll be upset. 

Fuck I've got no place to be, might as well head over to the bridge.
