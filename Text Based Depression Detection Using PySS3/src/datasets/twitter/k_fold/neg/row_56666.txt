The most infuriating thing about this sub is the "your life has meaning" responsesThey are the most empty and meaningless things ever said. Someone could be suffering though the worst period of their lives and contemplating ending it because of it overwhelms them and someone will just say "Don't kill yourself, your life has meaning". Like no, even if someones life has meaning, if they have to suffer everyday in agony, what is the purpose of that meaning?
