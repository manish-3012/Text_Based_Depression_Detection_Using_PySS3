My friend killed himself.So on Christmas day, my friend of just over a year made the decision to end his life. His wife of 14 years had decided to get a divorce with him and he didn't want to live anymore. I was out of town but I tried to talk to him. He stayed with a coworker and only the coworker and I knew where he was. I talked to him for a few days trying to tell him that it will get better and telling him that I was suicidal too. I tried to get him to go car hunting since the only car he had was with his wife. He had sent me a message in the middle of the night thanking me for being so kind. I woke up and asked him if he was alright but he was ready gone. I feel awful and heartbroken. I don't want to bother his wife, but I feel so guilty that I got the last messages he ever sent. 

Love you for your kind soul
I hope you found some peace Andrew.
