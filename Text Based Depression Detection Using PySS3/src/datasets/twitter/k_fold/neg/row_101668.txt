It just feels like it keeps getting worse.Suicidal thoughts have come and gone for the past 4 to 5 years now. I'm nowhere near where I want to be and everything seems so far away. Hard to get to. I just constantly think about how I know I will never be satisfied with anything I will ever do. I don't want to be forgotten. I miss everybody I used to talk to. I feel so alone. I keep thinking why should I even try anymore. I've been thinking I love doing stuff to counteract it. But I don't. I don't want shallow friendships where I'll just be forgotten. I want love. I just feel like I'm going to die alone. I think about my future I can only picture myself all alone wondering what the fuck I'm even doing anymore. I want to give up. I'm sad. Indoor want to do this anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I feel like I haven't been truly happy. I'll be safe but I just want to give up. :/
