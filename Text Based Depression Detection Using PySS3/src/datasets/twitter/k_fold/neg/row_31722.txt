I dont want to live my life anymorefirst of all, if anyone wants to ask anythings please read at least one of my many other posts on this sub because I am tired shitless of explaining the stabbing story. My life is fucked and nothing seems to be going in my favour. Why me?, why does everything that seems good end up being utter shit. I love both my parents so much but when they drink I seriously want to fucking kill them. Im sick of being like this and I want to unsee and unhear so many things. I want to unsee him covered in blood, I want to unhear "do you have anything dangerous or sharp on you?" I want to forget so many things but I want another option than suicide. My life is so fucked, what is the point in posting this?, I have already heard everything but at this point its just therapeutic. I'm so so sorry to everyone I have hurt and caused pain too. I haven't cried in so long but I want to get my emotions out. I have so many reasons to end it all. I know that people will miss me and I will hurt more people when I die but I'm just so fucked. I don't know how to handle this, so i'll just say that I'm sorry to anyone I have ever hurt.
