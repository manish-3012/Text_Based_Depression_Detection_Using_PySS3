HelpI've been stress vomiting lately. About 7 times over the last few weeks. I'm pretty sure I had this weird sort of hypomanic thing that was off and on for two weeks and doesn't really fit criteria in length and consistency especially since people didn't notice and I'm fucked. I have my final exam for my incomplete this Friday. It was already extended but I'm a fuck up and have made no progress in my essay or notes. I also fell further behind in my other classes. I really would like to self harm and I've noticed myself telling myself that if it all goes to hell I can try killing myself. Idk if that's just now a fucked up coping mechanism or... i can't do this. My therapist hasn't been much help.

Right now my thoughts aren't too serious but I know from prior experience that I can go from not too serious to really bad and writing notes and holding stuff.
