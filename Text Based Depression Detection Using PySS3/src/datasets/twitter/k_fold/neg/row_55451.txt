Forever alone...So jealousWe are all born a slave in this sick capitalistic culture which is designed to leech our talent from us to service the tiny majority rather than ourselves. We all have been fed a fantasy that everyone will live in a magical land when that is not possible. 

When you realize that you are just a number in this game and the people that are the lucky ones are the people who are behind the camera pursuing their dreams but the person running the dreamworld is a creep himself and basically entraps you in your own fantasy if you get too comfortable. Does anyone else feel that we are all trapped in one sick science experiment used to leech the life out of us until there is nothing left and that we are just here to reproduce rather than make love with each other?

 I get the feeling that life is a rigged game and against you and that I feel so jealous of the people that got to turn their fantasies into reality and can keep on doing over and over again but the catch is that it gets broadcast on the internet which is just another capitalistic invention and does not feel human.
