I have nothing left.Ive pushed all my friends and family away, I donâ€™t have a job, Iâ€™ll be 25 soon and I still live with my mom. I deleted all of my social media, Iâ€™ve let all my id expire and as of today I no longer have a boyfriend. For the past year Iâ€™ve been a drunk mess and yesterday during a hangover I started throwing up blood and I would rather kill myself than go to the hospital and be judged and formed. 

-no friends 
-no close family
-no job
-no id 
-no boyfriend 
-health problems from neglecting myself and heavy drinking

I donâ€™t want help (I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s possible) I just want to die.
