Donâ€™t know how to copeI read somewhere that suicidal feelings are a result of pain outweighing your coping resources. And I really feel that. Iâ€™ve been depressed for years and donâ€™t know how to deal with these feelings anymore. Most of what i see online is something along the lines of either talking to someone, or calling a help line. Iâ€™ve had bad experiences with help lines before, and I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. 

Iâ€™ve moved across the country (America) twice in the last year. Donâ€™t have a single friend, none of my family talks with me anymore, I barely speak to my coworkers. If it wasnâ€™t for my dog, Iâ€™d probably be gone already. But thereâ€™d be no one to take care of him without me. 

My life has been going downhill for years, hopes and aspirations slowly crushed, not sure what Iâ€™m doing anymore. 

I feel like I failed. Like life is a big game and every time I try to do something with myself, I roll a 1 on a 20 sided die. And I donâ€™t want to keep playing. 

Sorry if this doesnâ€™t make much sense/sounds like Iâ€™m rambling. Iâ€™m very sad.
