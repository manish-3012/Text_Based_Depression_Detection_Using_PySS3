I thought about self-immolating todayWould've been easy, the open blow torch was right in front of me. I'm trash, so I should've gone up easily. I hate that while people all over were getting to flaunt their costumes, I got to just feel bad about myself. Couldn't even bring myself to get dolled up. Just another wasted day. Just another reminder that I am wasted space and oxygen.
