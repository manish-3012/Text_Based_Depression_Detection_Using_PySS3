I hate my life right now. so much.I am so fucking lonely.

I'm broke.

I am either constantly in physical pain or depressed or anxious or all of the above.

I actually do hope I have cancer so I can get out of this miserable life. I don't even think I serve a purpose on this earth to be completely honest.
