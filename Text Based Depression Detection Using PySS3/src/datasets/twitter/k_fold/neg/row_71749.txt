Advice pleaseI've been battling with depression for a few years now and an hour ago my SO left me. She was the only one who supported me and now she's gone, I feel truly alone and would really appreciate some advice in terms of suicide. I've failed four times and am hoping the fifth will finally be successful. I just want this to all be Over. I honestly hope there is nothing after death l. 
My dear,
Find what you love and let it kill you.
Let it drain you of your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness.
Let it kill you and let it devour your remains.
For all things will kill you, both slowly and fastly, but itâ€™s much better to be killed by a lover.
~ Falsely yours.

If anyone has dealt with a similar thing please talk to me. I'm just really lost right now
