Getting everything in order before I goWhat all is there to take care of? I made sure all my beneficiaries are set, my debts are paid and nobody will be further burdened by me. I've tried righting some wrongs, but unfortunately it is a strange thing to apologize out of the blue for something people most likely have let go. That sucks since I'll be remembered as a fool; "that weird loser that randomly talked to me and said sorry for some stupid thing."

What am I missing? What else is there?

Sincerely,

That fool that never did know when to quit.


Edit: I appreciate the concern, but I'm just trying to make sure that I have everything covered. So the question really is, what am I missing?
