Suicide in the woodsHello, I made some choices that I refuse to live with. The consequences were heavier than I anticipated and theyâ€™re life long repercussions with numerous limitations. I have considered very carefully and logically whether suicide would grant me the things I desire most over the last several years, and have come to the conclusion that it is the correct choice for me.

I am aware of a location where I can procure a .454 black power roundball cap n ball revolver. The antique device is legal to possess and is loaded with ammunition. If I were to walk deep into the wooded area and produce the antique firearm, and discharge it at point blank range to the chest, how quickly and painful do you think it would be? I intend to do this without being intercepted by any person or law enforcement agency, so I need to make sure Iâ€™m in the woods and careful to NOT be able to be resuscitated.

Does my plan sound feasible? I tried the whole noose on a pull up bar method but I couldnâ€™t make it work. Turns out itâ€™s hard to commit to something like that. A gunshot seems tough to save yourself from.
