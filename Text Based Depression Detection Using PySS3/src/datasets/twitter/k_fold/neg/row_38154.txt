My friend wants to kill herself, and I dont know what to do.My friend (f17) lives in the Czech republic, and has gone through hell these past 5 months. Her life has been utterly horrible. Betrayed by nearly every friend she's made, her family is filled with narcissistic garbage people except for her older brother. Other experiences has traumatized her with severe anxiety of being in crowds, and battling depression for the past couple of years. Her brother rarely visits her, so her only pillar of support was her boyfriend who lived in a different country and helped her immensely with her mental state. However back in July he suddenly went missing, his sister said he had gone with their uncle for something. My friend and her SO's sister had a good relationship up to this point and the sister kept her updated for a day, however suddenly his sister blocked her on everything and even won't reply to a handwritten letter my friend wrote. It's been months now, and my friend has broken down several times, and is exhausted mentally and physically. Twice now she has seriously thought of killing herself, even now she's dead set on doing it as she doesn't want to suffer anymore. I've talked her out of it before but I'm not sure if she will keep being convinced by me and may eventually end it. I'm just scared for her.
