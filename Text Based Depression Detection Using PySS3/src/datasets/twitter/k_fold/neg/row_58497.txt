The true reality of life.I've had my fair share of troubles in life. I was bullied throughout my school career, through elementary to high school. I was called names like "overly horny school shooting retard" "a waste of air" "motherfucking crusty retarded piece of shit". I even tried talking to girls and then ended up being accused of falsely sexually harassing a girl. When I got suspended in senior year, I felt like life sucked. That was my lowest point in life. 

But, I told myself to keep pushing forward in life, and now, as a junior in college, I feel absolutely the same. I thought I could make friends, get a girlfriend, but most importantly find inner peace with myself. Well guess what? Nope. Every friendship I make I keep ruining, while I long for more connections. It's like a slow, ticking parasite that eats up at you. Eventually, it'll explode. I'm posting here to express..... how I feel now. Life won't get better, just work until you meet satan. And I didn't even mention the time I failed a drive time or how I cussed my father out to the point where I don't speak to him anymore, or the time I beat up my mother when I was younger. 

Everything in life is catching up to me, and at 21, I can't stand it anymore. I'm not going to kill myself, but I sure do feel like it. It's not even drugs or alcohol or mental illness, it's just straight depression. If I have to do 40 hour weeks while in college with the depression and stress I've already experienced in life, then I'll be very, very, depressed.
