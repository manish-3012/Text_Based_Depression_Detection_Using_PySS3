Im not gonna lieIve never been this close to just jumping off a roof in my life. My fiancee of 4 years left me, and I didnt know why all my closest friends here dipped until my best friend of about 10 years told me that she was sleeping with him. But for some reason he didnt understand why when I said I didnt have any friends anymore. Because Im just supposed to look over the fact that she left and took every single one of my friends with her. Tonight I deleted every account I have on everything but this. Because as I sit on this roof, I thought for some reason reddit would be a good place to come. Ive thought about jumping off this 5 story roof for years. But now that Im sitting here, its almost a encouragement. Do it. Just fuckin jump. I dont want to see them in my head together anymore. I dont want to see the people I called friends dancing in this fuckin box anymore. I want to be able to sleep again. Just close my eyes and not see that shit. Fuck me man...
