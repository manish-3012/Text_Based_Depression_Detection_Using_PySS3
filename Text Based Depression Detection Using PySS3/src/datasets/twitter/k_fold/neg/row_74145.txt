Relapsed with serious suicidal thoughtsI want to die, I went through 2 years in my early 20s Iâ€™d actively trying to Kill myself, including being hospitalized by police for trying to jump in front of a train and beyond heavy hard drug use 

Got on meds, got â€œhelpâ€ went to therapy and these thoughts have just been coming back on a very real tip for the first time in years, only the primal fear I had of being dead is no longer there. Itâ€™s gone from occasionally thinking about it to actually wanting to do it ONCE AGAIN 

I canâ€™t stand this world and the people in it, absolutely materialistic, spoilt, entitled and rotten to its core. Iâ€™d rather die than spend any more time in this shit hole

I havenâ€™t decided how I want to do it yet, given what I have access to I will most probably hang myself in the next week just like my uncle did. Nothing matters anymore, I accept the pain of suicide upon myself as forgiveness for being so worthless
