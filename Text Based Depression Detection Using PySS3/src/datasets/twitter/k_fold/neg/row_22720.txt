my birthdayitâ€™s my birthday on saturday and my mom bought me 2 tickets for an indoor skydiving place for myself and a friend. problem is, i donâ€™t have any friends and i know she was being thoughtful and considerate, but i canâ€™t stop crying and feeling so shitty. iâ€™m alone. everyone has friends who make time for them and i canâ€™t even find someone to spend an hour of my birthday with.
