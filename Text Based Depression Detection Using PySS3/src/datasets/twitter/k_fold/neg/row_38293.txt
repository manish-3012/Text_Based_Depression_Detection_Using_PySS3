I've seen enoughI'm using a throwaway in case it doesn't work this time. I've tried 3 times in the last 2 months and can't even do this right. I took pills and booze but woke up and puked because the whiskey was a shitty cheap brand. I got drunk and started to slash my wrists but passed out and only wound up bleeding a lot and got light-headed from blood loss in the back yard where I had tried. I also tried jumping in the river near me but some asshole good samaritans on their asshole boat pulled me out even though I struggled.   
So many things have gone wrong lately. Job loss, miscommunication with the gas company resulting in my gas being shut off yesterday (straightened out and supposed to back on Monday......so good for the wife and son), a bankruptcy, a loss of a house a couple of years ago and having to move to a rented shithole, and the thing that totally fucked up my brain is some shitty story brought up by the wife's friend's daughter on Christmas Eve. I hate Christmas anyway but this story is something that has eaten away at me every minute of every day since.  
Anyhow, the son is going to college and he's got his shit together. The wife is beautiful and has guys way better than me hitting on her so they'll be like sharks circling in a couple days. They'll be fine. My mother is still fucked up over my father's death a couple of years ago so she won't be too impacted. Other than that, no one knows me or will give a shit.   
I'm feeling the whiskey right now and I'm going to go dig out my stash of oxy.
