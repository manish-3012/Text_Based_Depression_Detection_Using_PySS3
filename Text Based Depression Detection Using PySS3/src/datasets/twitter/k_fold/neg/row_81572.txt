Never really thought about suicide, but I'm just boredBored of everything.  Don't have any reason to get up in the morning.  Sick of trying, sick of having nothing to do all day every day.  Sick of people in my life who are so fucking selfish.  Sick of being angry with a bad attitude.  Wouldn't it be better just to not have to deal with it.  And I know what you guys are going to say,  so I guess you can spare me the answers that are always given on these posts.  Just want to get this out.
