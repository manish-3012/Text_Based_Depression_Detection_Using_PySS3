I can't stop thinking about harming myselfI'm very distraught, depressed, and I keep thinking about ways to harm myself. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to live. I'm in this strange spot in the middle, and I do not feel like myself. I've always had problems with keeping focus, but now my mind just wants to think about death.

My job makes me miserable. I hate the people I work with.

I'm antisocial and have no friends. I'm married, but my spouse seems very distant. I fear we are failing.

I have had two major mental breakdowns in my life, but this feels different. More permanent. Nothing seems to matter to me. I can't stop crying. I want to get away from life.
