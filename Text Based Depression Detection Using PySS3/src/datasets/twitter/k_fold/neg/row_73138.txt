Is it bad that I feel like wanting to die each time someone tells me they love me?I'm always lonely in real life, zero friends and my family probably considers me a burden. I went out to make online friends and met some really fun people. They think I'm an amazing person but when they say that to me, it triggers me. Every compliment makes me want to die. And I keep on feeling like I should ghost them because I don't deserve them. And lately I feel like I'm always seconds away from self harm or even suicide. Everything truly hurts.
