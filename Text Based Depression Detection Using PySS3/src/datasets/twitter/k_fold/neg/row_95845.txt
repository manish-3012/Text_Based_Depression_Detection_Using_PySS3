Happy outside dead insideSo I'm a "social buterfly" when you look at me. But when I'm home alone, bored of life. Disgusted by myself. I think that one girl I loved and When she sees me in the school. She and her friends whispers to eachother and laughs. And I feel like I must pretend to be happy In the rest of the day. I What should I do? HELP I do not enjoy my life

Also we are broke as a family so thats that
