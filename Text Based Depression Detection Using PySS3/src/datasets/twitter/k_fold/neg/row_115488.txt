I am completely and utterly unlovable and it's all my fault.I'm sitting here at my nephew's birthday party with loads of happy people around me and I just want to cry.

Yesterday I emotionally abused a boy I knew only three days. I absolutely loved everything about him, and most of all I loved that he seemed to genuinely like me.

And what did I go and do? I couldn't believe that he liked me, so I kept sending him messages asking if he did, and if he didn't respond right away I'd want to cry. Eventually I took like 10 paracetamol (nowhere near enough to kill me) and told him I took pills. I did it as some sort of sick punishment for him doing absolutely nothing.

And after I calmed down and told him to run as far away from me as he could he STILL wanted to at least be friends with me. If I continue to talk to him I *will* hurt him, and I want to tear myself apart. Hell I want to do it now. There is a balcony with a short drop outside. Maybe I can break my neck.

I can't be loved because I make it impossible to love me. I want desperately - desperately - to love and be loved, but I can't do it. I can't. I want to sleep forever.

Edit: I just sent him this message:

&gt; I am complete poison to you. Run away as fast as you can. I promise I won't kill myself, but don't talk to me anymore. You need to do this because when I become emotional I won't be able to stop myself. Even if you just wanted to be friends I would continue to abuse and hurt you. I absolutely do not deserve forgiveness for my actions yesterday. I have known you three days and already taken pills and threatened suicide. This is not acceptavle behaviour.

&gt; I'm not going to lie and tell you there isn't a part of me that hopes you'll read this and go "Oh I'll never leave you" but I am fighting very very hard against it. Some of this message itself will be subconciously designed to try and manipulate you. I do not want to hurt you any further, so please do thid for me.
