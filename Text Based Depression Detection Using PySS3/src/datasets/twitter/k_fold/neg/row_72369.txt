I'm tired of being a financial burden.Ftm. Went to the ER as precaution for heart fluttering and diziness. They said it was anxiety. Parents are pissed. I probably can't pay my bill without them. I am such a burden on my family. They poured their souls into a grain of sand at the beach. I am worth nothing in the long run. My death would be a finincial gain for my family. It would take me years to set up a stable income. Why should I live? Why continue to drag my family down with the problems they don't agree with? I will never be enough for them.

I took HRT to get rid of my hopelessness. I've been doing great, productive. But now my stupid mental illness has caused trouble yet again. I'm worthless to the world, there are plenty of cis people who could do any job better than me. 

Why live? Happiness? My career will take many more money-draining years. It's not fair to them for me to live that long. I'm just too insignificant. The world has no place for defective workers. You know what immune cells do when they're defective? They are commanded to kill themselves, as the system has no place for defects. Why should humans be any different? Why should imperfect people like me be allowed to exist?

I am but a grain of sand on the beach...one that's had a lot of money wasted on possible potential.
