in a very dark place right nowOn top of the depression my sleep is 9 different kinds of fucked up that I think I am slowly descending into madness. An AA friend of mine who just became my Sponser (she offered and I know she is married so me trying to date her is not going to happen). Has gotten me a temp job with her. Helping find business receipts looking for cash going out from the last few years has helped keep me distracted but I don't think it is going to be enough. I am constantly thinking about taking my own life. It's the single thought at the forefront of my mind. And while I care about my friend and what my death might do to her. She has made it clear that she has lost friends to suicide but is strong enough to deal with it. I am just so gods be damned lonely and living with crippling anxiety is no way to live. I am so drained and exhausted I just want to sleep for rest of my life. I know I am not in my right mind. But I don't know what my right mind is capable of or even when I plan to do the deed as it were, but I know how and where, I just wish I had someone here to hold me, i just cant relax or get my mind off of how much I want to die and end my misery, I just can't deal with this anymore, meds didn't work, GP said I had to call someone else, and my family would just have me committed if they found out, So i can't really talk to them
