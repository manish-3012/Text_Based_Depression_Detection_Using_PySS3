All my friends left me because of my sexuality...My family abandoned me.It's so hard. I want to write so much...but I'll keep it short.


Ever since I was 12, I knew I was different. You may think I'm joking or something, but I am actually serious. My friend walked in on me doing this with my dad (my friend knocked on my door and dad let him in), and they saw me doing it...


I am now homeless because my parents kicked me out, and my friends made a photo and now I have no friends.
