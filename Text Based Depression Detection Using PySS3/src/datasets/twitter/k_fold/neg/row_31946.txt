No one needs me anymore.Iâ€™m just a burden. My husband lied to me tonight so he could go hang out with friends. I caught him, and now I feel so betrayed. He says Iâ€™m being dramatic.

If Iâ€™m such a horrible wife that he felt the need to do that, heâ€™s better off without me.

Iâ€™m watching my dogs for my parents for a few days. They need me for now, but after that I really hope I have the resolve to just end it. For everyoneâ€™s sake. Iâ€™m horrible.
