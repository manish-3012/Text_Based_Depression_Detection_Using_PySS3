One more nightIn the morning I finally see a psychiatrist about antidepressants.  I just don't want to feel this anymore.  No hope, no joy, abandoned and alone, hating myself, knowing that there is no logical reason to feel like this.  Moments ago I was googling what shotgun I would want to use.  I don't know why I feel compelled to write this.  It is always a shout at the abyss.  Nothing good or lasting ever comes of it and yet I keep doing it.  Maybe if I stare it down long enough the abyss will stare back.  I think I like the Remington 870.  I can make it one more night.
