my last attempt makes suicide less scaryit was an impulsive but i was at a very difficult spot, mentally, in my life and it was too overwhelming. iâ€™ve always been passively suicidal and had these ideations since i was 11. itâ€™s nothing new to me and that day, i just snapped. this was about a month and a half ago but i still remember certain bits so clearly, despite dissociating the days following. i took an overdose that was deadly lethal for my size but ended up vomiting up what seemed like most of it because my stomach couldnâ€™t handle the burning and bitterness. i spent about 20 minutes on the floor, nearly choking on my own vomit and my everything burned but i didnâ€™t feel regret. years of pain and self hatred made me believe that i deserved it. i eventually did call the ambulance out of confusion and pain that made everything seem fuzzy, i actually hung up the first time before i got to say anything. i felt ashamed and even more depressed the entire hospital experience because i realized that they were fighting to keep me alive. since then i have been through the mental health system but it doesnâ€™t seem to be helping. iâ€™ve been in an out of therapy for the past 3-4 years and i donâ€™t feel satisfied with what iâ€™ve worked on. my parents blamed me for what happened and have always refused to talk about mental health, this only closed that door even more. i feel hopeless and so emotionally unstable, even my closest friends have drifted away and i donâ€™t want to burden them with my suicidal thoughts. iâ€™ve spent the past weekend writing plans and i already have everything prepared. itâ€™s so methodical and i did my research to mix together medications to achieve the most effective outcome. i even gave myself a week to see if this was just another impulsive decision but itâ€™s become so automatic to me that i canâ€™t think of anything else that will make me feel alive again, ironically.
