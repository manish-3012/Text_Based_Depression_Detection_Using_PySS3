please help ASAP This post is more about my mom than me; I've had thoughts but would never go through with it.

Recently my mom found out about my dad having an affair with a prostitute, this has exacerbated marital problems that they already had.  They constantly fight at night and I end up in the middle, but because of school my mom always tells me to just go to sleep- but how am I supposed to sleep while this is going on?  

Anyway, my mom left the house after one of the arguments got particularly bad, and after yelling at me and my sister accusing us of siding with our dad.  (Admittedly, we're a little selfish in that we both want our mom to take him back so things can go back to normal, but there's certainly no bias.)  She called my dad and threatened suicide a couple of times before hanging up.  She certainly has been going through a lot, even besides this particular situation, and she's talked about suicide before.

I can't reach her at all, and I'm worried about her...but I I do finally get to her or somehow get ahold of someone who can help she'll just be upset with me for still being awake at what is now nearly half past four in the morning.  What can I do to make sure she's okay?
