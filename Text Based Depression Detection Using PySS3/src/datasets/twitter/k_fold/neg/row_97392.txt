Thoughts of suicideI've been having thoughts lately. I won't do it now cos I'm too chicken shit to do it but I am really worried I'm going down that road again. Been on celexa 40mg and remeron for 3 years, I feel like it's not working too well anymore. I quit taking it for a few days just to get rid of the brain fog every once in a while, and usually it starts working again, but now I feel like it's not working as well as it used to, or I'm just more depressed?

My wife is due with our first child in January, I feel soooooo guilty because I should be happy but I'm not. I always told myself if things are too bad I always had an out (suicide), but I feel like I'm stuck even more than before. Nothing is working for me, and I am afraid nothing ever will. 

Oh and also my dad has Parkinson's which is hitting him hard, my mom might have bladder cancer. What's the point of living to just go out like that. Fuck that, I want to go out on my own terms.

Told my psych I don't think meds are working, but he pretty much just ignored me. Told me to take melatonin at night ðŸ˜’. I've had three different psychs just in the last few months because no doctors wants to stay at the place I go to.
