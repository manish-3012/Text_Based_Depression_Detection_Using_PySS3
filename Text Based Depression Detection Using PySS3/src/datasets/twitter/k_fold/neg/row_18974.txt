Why do I feel this way? I don't understand why I feel like I want to die. I'm a successful professional. I have a good career and another great side job that I love and that fulfill me. I have a great new partner who makes me feel alive and gives me hope for the future. I have pets that I'd never in a million years want to abandon. 

But when I spend any amount of time alone I just want to end my life. I walk my dogs, I think about ways I could kill myself.  I drive home from work and I want to swerve into traffic. My life is good and although I feel overworked I don't feel depressed like I used to.  But still... I think about killing myself a lot.  

I haven't tried in years... not since I before I came out and thought it would be the end of me. No... I don't want to hurt anyone or do anything.... I just think about how calm things would be if I died... its stupid, I know. How do I make this feeling go away?
