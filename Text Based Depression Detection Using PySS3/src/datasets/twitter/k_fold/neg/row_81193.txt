I hate this quote, it's one of the highest rated posts on this sub: Nothing drives people crazier than seeing someone have a good fucking life. A lot of people are just fine and I don't think they deserve it 

All I think about these days is how everyone who's fucked me over is fine. They're all easily able to have normal lives and function in society. A few women I've met have told me about molesters and rapists targeting them, I either know these people personally or can look them up online and they're all fine. They don't care about anything they put me or my friends through. The truth is that all of the people who have good fucking lives are bad fucking people. Everyone it drives crazy is a victim who never gets over it.

It certainly drives me crazy. The quote is not wrong and that is the problem. Only these terrible fucking people are the ones who can sleep easy have good fucking lives. They'll never care unless it's beaten into them and at that point why even bother because it might be difficult to get away with. And by why bother I mean that at this point I might as well get back at one person and then die. Am I wrong? I don't feel wrong.

I've pretty much given up on being able to function properly.  Every attempt to seek help ends up me being fucked over like manipulated by family or involuntarily held at hospitals.  When I was a kid it felt like every decision was taken away from me and everything was decided for me and done terribly.  Can't do anything about it because no matter how good I can make anything now, it's not like none of that ever happened.  You can't undo any of this, and if that's the case then why bother.

If I don't kill myself then I might live long enough to make it all worthwhile for someone who doesn't deserve to feel comfortable.
