I'm so tired and I feel like I don't even know myself.I'm so tired of the cycle of a coin flip to see if i'll be happy or miserable the next day. I self harmed today when I havent in weeks.

 I'm tired of feeling like a failure, burden, and a "leech" to my parents and friends. 

I'm tired of feeling like there's someone else controlling my emotions where they flip a switch from me feeling okay to miserable. I started therapy and It's only making me feel like more of a burden due to costs.

I'm tired of my mind treating me as a bully, constant insults and telling me to kill myself.

Im tired of having to write posts in r/suicidewatch.
