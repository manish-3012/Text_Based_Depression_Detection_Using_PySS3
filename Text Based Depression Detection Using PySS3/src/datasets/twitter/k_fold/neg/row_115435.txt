A titleI want to give up. I do. But idk whats stopping me. I know very well i wont live long like this. I feel horribel being so behind, so lost on what im doing but  too afraid to ask for help. I dont want them to hate me. I dont. Maybe im over reacting. Im  sick and tired. I dont want to endure this but i dont want anyone on this earth to know. I just want to vanish. I wish i were never born, its a mistake that is in much regret. I dont want to live anymore, theres little to no joy compared to the misery and torment. What is a life worth living when you have absolutely no one who cares about you, all alone, no happiness, restlessness, and that feeling chewing at my guts. There are nice things in this world, id admit. There are wonderful people. But within a crowd, they are only a needle in a hay stack of hateful people. Im so tired of living. If someone were to lock me away in a closet with no contact until i die from starvation, it would be almost no different to my life now, the only difference is that i wouldnt have that cold feeling of pressure in standards, id have nothing to look at nothing to talk to, but only one task and one fate. Die slowly but eventually.
