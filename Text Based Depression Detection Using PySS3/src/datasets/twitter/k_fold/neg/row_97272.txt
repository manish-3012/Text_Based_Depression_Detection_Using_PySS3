Frontline healthcare provider, ready to die.Iâ€™ve seen enough. Iâ€™ve lost countless patients to the virus, Iâ€™m all alone, and Iâ€™ve lost faith in the humanity of this country. My baseline anxiety and depression has never been dealt with, and now itâ€™s finally crippling me. Iâ€™m done losing patients, Iâ€™m done listening to people doubt the severity of the pandemic, and Iâ€™m done with how cruel this world is.
