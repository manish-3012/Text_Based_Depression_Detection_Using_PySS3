maybeI've posted on here before, and I hate to do it because I don't want my problems getting in the way of somebody else who's life matters more who could use the help more. But man this is too hard. I've lost so many friends, I try to make new ones, I end up failing so fucking hard and it crashes into nothing and then I see them living happily without me like I never existed. I feel like I leave zero impact on this earth to anybody, I feel like if I just popped out of existence right now, nobody would notice. I am awful at trying to make friends. My mom took her life and I'm convinced it was my fault, and god did she mean the world to me. Everybody always says "gods always here for you" but every day I feel like there is no god. what god would let me constantly get my Hope's up that maybe something good is coming around the corner then smash my Hopes and leave me alone. what is talking to him gonna do? he doesnt reply. how do I know if hes even listening? my brother hates me, I tried to help him earlier and told me he hated me for personal reasons. my parents yell at me all the time for not being perfect and make me feel alone and contribute to my sadness. my lack of friends and continuous losing of friends slowly tears the remaining shreds of life I had left in me.
