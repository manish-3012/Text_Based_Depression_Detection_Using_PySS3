Why do i feel this way?Every day.. The same thoughts of ending it all..I can just picture ways of doing it..be it at home, driving, etc. I dropped out of college, work a factory job (actually quitting). I'm a disappointment to all around me..I'm on probation and have to do 60 hours of community service, due in a month and haven't even started it. I've thought about just letting myself rot in jail, maybe that could be a good place to end it..I hurt those around me and i don't know why. Every day the same thoughts of ending it all come across my mind. More than that, i dream them. I have a loving mother. A loving father. Amazing brother and sister. None of them would ever understand, no one around me even knows why. Or knows in general..Every damn day i want to end it all, I'm trying to "recover"..I don't want to feel this way anymore..This is the first step, but honestly i don't care if it's the last. I can't go and see someone or talk to anyone around me, i don't want them to know anything. I already feel like a big enough burden..I just don't know why I'm here anymore..It's been four years since I've tried any form of suicide, and I just wish that it would've worked then, I wish I could do it now..I write this as a final plea for help, and possibly even a final note and a last goodbye. We'll see r/SuicideWatch..
