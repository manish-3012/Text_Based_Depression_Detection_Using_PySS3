Married my red-headed girl and was cuckoldedI married the love of my life just a few short years ago.  Financial problems and a debilitating injury left me angry at the world.  While I smiled at the world, my wife suffered from my withdrawal.  She is an amazing person who has entered the bed of another man.  I am left watching our 2 children while my life crumbles and I have no support.  My family feels that she is evil and gets mad at me when I defend her.  She says "I know" when I say "I love you".  At this moment, she is at a bar with her friends while I think my kids need their mom.  Mods, feel free to delete my post because I am not suicidal.  I just feel that I don't have anything worth living for.  My kids are everything, but I close my eyes and see my wife's smile.  I don't know how to move on without my rock.
