Why?I don't know what to do anymore. The absolute only thing I find any fulfillment in is my job, it's the only thing I feel somewhat competent in doing. I don't look forward to going home after work, I dread my days off because I know I'll be completely alone until going back. It's like clockwork,  day after day, the same fucking thing. What is the point in living a life like this? I'm lost.
