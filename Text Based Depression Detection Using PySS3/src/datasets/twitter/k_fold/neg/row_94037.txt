I wish I couldI wish I could kill myself right now. I really do. But Iâ€™m trying my hardest to wait until I find a therapist so I could attempt to get better. But things arenâ€™t looking good at all. Suicide seems great for me. I donâ€™t wanna deal with this anymore. I wish I could just get away. Forever. I could risk putting myself in the hospital once again this time through a suicide attempt. There is so much stuff that I wouldnâ€™t be going through now if I wouldâ€™ve just went through with both of my attempts earlier this year.
