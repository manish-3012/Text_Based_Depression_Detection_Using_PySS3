I need someone to talk toWill these thoughts ever stop? 
Im about to go to college, it's quite promising.  Yet it also means i cant afford to see a therapist rn. Which seems to be the only solution to feel a bit better.
I feel like shit all the fucking time. All i think of is cutting myself and im trying not to but its the only way i know of coping with these feelings and i dont know if i want to stop. 
I cant be like this forever. I need to make it stop. How do i make it all stop.
