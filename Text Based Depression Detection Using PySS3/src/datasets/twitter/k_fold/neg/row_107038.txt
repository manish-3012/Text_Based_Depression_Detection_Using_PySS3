dying tonightIâ€™ve been planning my death for tonight, thinking about it all morning at work. Still reeling from a ghastly breakup on the heels of a one-year distance relationship, that ended 8 days ago with â€œI never want to see or talk to you again.â€ We were so close that as recently as May/June she was telling her mom she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. We planned to move in together in October Then she backed out on me in the last month and now we arenâ€™t even talking. I was an asshole to her in the sense that I didnâ€™t let her go quietly - I protested. Which is the death knell to last minute relationship â€œtests.â€ sheâ€™s permanently gone. I wanted to send her a two-three line card just apologizing for what a prick I was, how I didnâ€™t respect her feelings. A female friend of mine referred to such a card as a violation and said the very act of sending an apology screams disrespect, because it means ignoring her last requests. She said itâ€™s typical of what insensitive clods guys are. So it goes. Iâ€™m an asshole and a prick. And I donâ€™t deserve to live.

Anyway, I re-purchased the means to take my life nonviolently (online), now I just need to go to the store to pick everything up and sign for it. I will probably kill myself tonight, late tonight after work, in a lot about 5 miles from my house. I imagine they will find my body in my car, in the morning. I have appointments and commitments tomorrow, including work, and when I donâ€™t show up it will hopefully tip them off. There is a note Iâ€™ve written that Iâ€™m going to leave at my apartment. My ex will likely never learn of my death, because sheâ€™s thousands of miles away and I have no mutual friends or connections with her - unless my parents seek her out. And her not knowing is fine with me. Lord knows she doesnâ€™t need the guilt. This isnâ€™t a revenge suicide. Itâ€™s my being exhausted and rank from pain and sick of the whole goddamn journey Iâ€™ve been on over the last 4 decades. Life is a bullshit farce.
