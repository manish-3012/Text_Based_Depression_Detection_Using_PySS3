I need a reason to stay aliveIâ€™m going through a lot right now and Iâ€™m finding it really difficult to stay alive when I can end it all right now. Swallow a bunch of my pills, swallow it down with alcohol and hope thatâ€™ll be enough to end me.. I know this is.. not very convincing on why you should even talk to me. Iâ€™m desperate. You can call me Marie. I like Nintendo games, skating, playing the guitar, drawing, and writing fiction and non fiction. I want to own a cat one day even though Iâ€™m a total dog person, but I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s worth living another day, Iâ€™m in a lot of emotional pain. And I donâ€™t mind being in physical pain either. I also want to own an iguana one day, Iâ€™m getting the tank for it but again not sure. Itâ€™s late at night for me and.. Iâ€™m really trying.. I am.
