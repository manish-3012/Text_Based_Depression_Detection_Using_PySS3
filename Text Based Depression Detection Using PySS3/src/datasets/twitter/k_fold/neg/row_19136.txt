I've struggled with depression for as long as I can remember.I'm a 21 year old male, married with a 4 month old son. I just finished school to which I can't find a job for. I'm in a constant state of anxiety. My wife and I constantly argue back and forth. I play a lot of games to try to ease my mind, more or less of a distraction, but my wife doesn't like that I play them which leads to more arguing. I've tried to get her to understand that I play them to distract myself but to no avail. I feel you m not good enough anymore, that all I'm doing is dragging my family down with me. I feel my time is almost up. I'm afraid my wife will one day realize that I'm not worth her time and she will take my son and both of them will disappear from my life. That's when I know there's no moving on anymore. I'm worried how close I'm getting to that point. I want to just end it. End all of the pain. The only thing that keeps me from doing so is my son.

I can't push myself further anymore.
