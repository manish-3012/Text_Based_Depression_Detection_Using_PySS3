I am still with you because I canâ€™t find my boyfriendâ€™s gun.Fuck. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m lucky or unlucky, I have been searching for it for an hour, it is not in the same place that it usually is. I have asked him a million times to hide it from me, as a precaution. He never listened, I just havenâ€™t had a night like this in a while. Iâ€™ve managed to blow off the sight of that gun for months. Tonight, I went to grab it. It is finally hidden. I even stole his car keys to check his car for it. I am legitimately desperate, but fate is weirdly telling me that tonight is not the night. If I find it, Iâ€™m fucked. If I donâ€™t, Iâ€™m going to bed.
