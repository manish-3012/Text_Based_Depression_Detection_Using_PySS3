I'm Tired of WaitingHi everyone. First of all I want to say thank you to this community, I believe this is my first time posting here but I lurk a lot.

Now I'll get right to the point: I do not want to be alive, but I cannot kill myself until my parents die. I love my parents and I have a good relationship with them, I know it would absolutely destroy them if I died. Thus, I must let myself face their deaths before I'm allowed to end my suffering. This is painful for me because like I said I love my parents and the thought of them being dead makes me very upset. I also feel like it's unfair- I'm trapped in this world and I can't leave until something so horrible happens?

At the same time, I really really want to die. I've been suicidal multiple times before (never attempted), I understand how the universe works and how people work, I understand that existence just isn't for me. Sure there are things that I enjoy about being alive, I'm capable of feeling happy and excited- but even in those times, I know I'm ready to throw in the towel. It's not worth living for.

I wish there was something I could give my parents to make them completely forget about me, or a way to make them stop loving me, or a way to go back in time and stop myself from being born. It's getting harder to deal with being alive. I might be here for a long time, and I don't know how to cope with that I guess.
