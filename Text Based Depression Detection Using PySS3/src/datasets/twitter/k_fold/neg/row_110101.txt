Simply let it go...Sorry, not my main language.

I think I need at least to post it somewhere. I need to talk about it...
Did you ever look at your past and just felt ashamed ? That's how I feel. Just by thinking about who I am, what I did makes some tears appears.

I'm 23. Almost 24. A trans (MtF) with heavy depression since 8 years now and many personality disorders and traumas.
I have friends. I have family. Everyone around me is supportive about my transition (over a year of HrT). So why ? Why do I feel like this ?...
I have severe social phobia (taking the subway is making me very anxious, simply walking in the street around people is hard, I often just lay down for half an hour, my hands shaking, after being outside for more than 15 minutes), avoidance personality disorder (I can't take decisions, it freaks me out. Even simply deciding what to eat when I am with friends.) and a deep fear of being left behind. Those are my "main three" as I call them...

Recently life turned gray. I am in second year in an informatic school. Here, people that have my age have mostly finished their 5 years of studying and are currently looking for jobs. (Most school have both a 3 or a 5 years program.)
Yet here I am. I changed my mind after trying an engineering school that wasn't for me. I took a year just for myself, trying to heal and to get better, seeing psychiatrists and psychologists every flipping week at minima. And I got in my current school only to fail my second year and having to take it back.
I do believe in evolution, adaption. And to be honest, I know I am a genetical error. Only few decades ago, someone like me wouldn't have any chance to live. I am not one of the strongest. Not in the average. I am that part of any species that should have died to make it evolve. "Leave the weak behind".

I can't handle myself. My head is screaming to just end it. After all the help I got, it just got worst and worst. So I think it's time to let it go. And to finally give up.
