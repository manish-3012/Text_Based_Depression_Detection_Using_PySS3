After much deliberation, I have come the conclusion, that it is time for my life to end. I'm just not pleased with life and feel like "A man out of place,...out of time." Just doing a bunch of self renovation won't culminate in a fixed soul. I'm just a empty shell. I tried, very hard and long.Tried very long and hard to fix myself. None of which was the cure to what illness vexes me.
