I need help ASAP! Took 3000mg of Wellbutrin and I'm scared!I'm very terrified rn because I feel like I'm going to die and idk what the consequences to this will be. I just did this 15 minutes ago and I'm already starting not to feel good. Wellbutrin has made me sink into a deeper depression and the past few days all I've been doing is crying and wanting to die and now that I did this I don't want to anymore. What do I do? Do I call an ambulance, drive myself to a hospital, I'm very confused? Please help!
