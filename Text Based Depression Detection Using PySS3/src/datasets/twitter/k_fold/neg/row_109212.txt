My two cents to those considering suicideI've been going through dark times over the past year, very dark times. Ive been struggling with many anxiety related illnesses, such as GAD, severe social anxiety, and OCD, as well as deep depression. Some days I couldn't even get out of bed and puked on an empty stomach because of the anxiety and guilt that I had harbored because of who I was and my past actions. I've also recently experienced death up close by someone close to my family for the first time in my life (drowning). Because of this, I felt as though I had seen the reality of what life and death truly are, and subscribed to existential nihilism as the only truth. And although there is something to be said about the truth behind that philosophy, it is no way to live a life. I became hedonistic, and grew in frustration against how selfish, simple, and quick to judge people are, and have hurt people, and myself, as a result. And although some things you can't take back, however much we may want to, I learned through my mistakes and delusions and now see suffering as an experience that no one, even the "worst" among us (serial killers, rapists, etc.), should have to go through, although suffering is an important concept i believe that all should reflect on daily. As long as they feel regret and guilt for their actions, anyone can change. Even those who have a psychological inability to feel guilt (psychopaths, sociopaths), should not suffer. Although suffering is a given in life, what's helped me get through it all is Mahayana Buddhism. I could also link you to studies, but psilocybin also helps a lot with suicidal ideation and mental illness. It's definitely helped me more than you could probably imagine. I don't mean to preach about philosophy or come off like a snake oil salesman about how a chemical could be a panacea for your problems, but I seriously recommend looking into these two things before you consider committing. Because of Buddhism, and with with help of psilocybin, I now have found a sense of peace that I haven't had for several years and that I'm working toward enlarging, and now find great fulfillment in helping all living things, even those who hate me. I wish for you all to find your peace. Even if you have committed heinous past transgressions, you deserve peace and forgiveness if guilt and regrets arise. Just remember, humanity is both a very emotional and logical species of animal, but there is no "supernatural" intrinsic value to us. All of our actions can be reasoned through evolutionary psychology, developmental psychology, and abnormal psychology. Remember, you are your brain, and the brain is simply a pattern recognition computer influenced by neurochemicals. No one has more intrinsic value than another, we simply naturally feel that way as people because we are the byproducts of these three branches of psychology. To be truly happy, one must let go of worldly desires. The desire of "I don't want to be sad anymore, to do this I must commit suicide", is one of these desires. Such is the desire to please those you feel the need to please. Practice letting go of everything that you are attached to, albeit life itself and its basic necessities (food, water, shelter), and you will be on the right path. This is were meditation and letting go of the ego itself comes into play. The idea of "this is who I am, and therefore who I will always be" is one of the greatest fallacies of life, one that is natural to humanity, as we like to label people as it makes us feel a sense of superiority, although it's not true in the slightest. People make mistakes all the time. However much society may tell you i your mistakes do not, and should not, define who you currently are.
