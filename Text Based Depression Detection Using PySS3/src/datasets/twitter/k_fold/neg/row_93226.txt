I'm readyTwo months ago, I gave myself 9 months to recover. But I guess I'm a bad person, too weak, too clumsy, too done. I'm ready to go because the pain is so unbearable I barely breath. My mental illnesses are getting the better of me, and no matter what anyone says, labels me as selfish, or any other bad thing, I'm ready to go. I've started gathering my supplies, notes have been ready since a long time anyway. I'll pick a convenient way to go soon. I'm going crazy am I not? Maybe. But who cares, it's going to be over anyway.
