I have a lump on one of my testicles and I couldnâ€™t care enough to go get it checked outIâ€™ve had it for about 5 years now and it occasionally hurts pretty bad and yet I couldnâ€™t care less. I have no idea what it could be, but I donâ€™t want to know incase itâ€™s something that can be treated if caught in time. I really just want it to somehow be testicular cancer that will take me out for me. I hope it is.
