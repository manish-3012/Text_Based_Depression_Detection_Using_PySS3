This feeling has maintained for too many days now.Hay folks. Thanks for reading this. The TLDR; over a year ago I was drugged, raped, beaten and robbed. My secondary survivor split up with me just before the year anniversary. I lost my home, my dog, my soul mate and his family in a matter of days.

 I am living with my alcoholic parents now who do try, but just don't have the capacity within themselves to offer a great deal of help. I have ptsd (rape trauma syndrome) and the year anniversary messed me up. 

I haven't really been good, is an understatement. I am genuinely suicidal and its hard to admit. I have so much pain and anguish inside me, about everything that's happened to me over the last year, that I just want it to stop. I've been fighting for so long, maybe it's time to lay down arms. Once and for all. I've been feeling like this as a base line for a few days now and its intensifying. I've been to therapy and it seemed like she didn't think these feelings were valid for some reason. Which pushed me further down this nasty path. I have multiple issues as a result of the trauma and then the loss of my partner etal on top of it all. My question is, do any of you lovely folks have any experience of allowing yourself to feel the suicidal thoughts whilst maintaining run of the mill lives? Is it/has it ever been something you can function with feeling?
