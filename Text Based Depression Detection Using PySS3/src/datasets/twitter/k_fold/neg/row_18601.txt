not comfortable talking to therapisti have been having suicidal fantasies and self harm thoughts a lot. but i dont feel comfortable with my therapist. i dont like him. i dont find him much use. but i dont know how to dump him. i have been given him by the nhs. i dont know how to stop seeing him without creating drama but i dont see the point of going to another appointment because i will just lie to him and tell him i havent been feeling bad because i dont feel comfortable talking to him. i have been on lexapro but i am quitting cold turkey because i still feel terrible and it makes me feel unlike myself
