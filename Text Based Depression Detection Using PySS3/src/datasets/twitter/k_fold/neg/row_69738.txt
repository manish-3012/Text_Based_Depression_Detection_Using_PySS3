Not sure if I should even be posting here, but suicide has just recently entered my mind. Living alone for the first time and I am 2000 miles from anyone that cares about me.I am not sure what I intend to achieve by writing this but I am lonely as hell and suicide crossed my mind tonight and I don't want to feel that way.
