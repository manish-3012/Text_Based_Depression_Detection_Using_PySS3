It's been rough, but who's life hasn't been?It's been rough...

Financial issues, medical bills, low wages, dropping out of college due to stress, family fighting amongst themselves, promotions being handed to someone else, slowly losing my relationship, my trans identity, just in general it's been crap...

But why should I have to stay here? What is stopping me from saying "I give up"? Why can't I just throw my arms up and give In after time and time again watching others' ships come in and I am waiting for mine to get out of the desert?

Only two things keep me here: my dog, Sasha. And my mom. I shouldn't care of the after effects of leaving this world. I shouldn't. I want to make sure my dog is taken care of as she brought me any joy she could muster. My mom has always been my best advocate and tried to keep me afloat. I don't want to harm them as my last action, but I'm afraid I will...

It's been rough...

A pic of my puppy, maybe she will bring some poor soul happiness when they are down.
