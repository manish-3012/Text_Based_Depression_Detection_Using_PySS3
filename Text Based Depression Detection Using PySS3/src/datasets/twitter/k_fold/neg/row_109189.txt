Iâ€™ve never had a women ever like me and Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself because of a lack of Tinder matches on three occasions. Iâ€™m studying in Indonesia (a poor SE Asian country where Iâ€™m taller and richer than every other man and Westerners are rare) and get dates constantly. Fuck going back home.Why the fuck should I go back home? This is the only country where Iâ€™m actually able to date. Iâ€™m going to have the time of my life, then hang myself in my dorm on the last day of this one-year study program so I donâ€™t have to fly back and return to never getting matches on Tinder and having girls in clubs refuse to dance with me.
