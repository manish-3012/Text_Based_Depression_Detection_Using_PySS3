Never Stood A ChanceI've owned a pair of dreamers eyes since '98. 

Those eyes witnessed their first broken dream in '04. 

I've learned to have a sinners mouth since '05. 

That mouth spoke it's way to loneliness in '07.

I unintentionally grew a soft heart in '09. 

I got that soft heart broken in '12. 

I learned to have adult thoughts in '13. 

Those thoughts forced my sinners' mouth to eat sleeping pills in '14. 

My dreamers eyes died in '15. 

My soft heart grew hard in '16. 

My head broke in '17. 

That head will hug a bullet in '18.
