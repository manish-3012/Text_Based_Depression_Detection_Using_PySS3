Everything is disappointingNo matter how hard I try in anything I get fucked over for no reason. I've tried killing myself twice before a few years back, this time I really hope I dont survive, I think I'm going to kill myself after my winter break is over, I dont care anymore, I've always tried being nice to everyone no matter how big of a cunt they are.

Honestly I just dont see a point in living if everything just turns out like shit, I've had so many people tell me that i have some of the worst consistent luck they've ever seen, its ridiculous. I just dont care anymore, I've been treated like shit by family, friends and fucked over by just about everything that I've tried to escape reality with. It's stupid how unlucky I can get sometimes and no matter how dumb this sounds people will never understand until they meet me in person.

I legit just cant take it anymore and I dont want live on this shit rock that's already nearing its end either way because the human race is too fucking dumb and money thirsty to care about the state of the planet they're living on, I'm gonna die either way, why not just leave this shit place earlier than I'm supposed to, nobody's gonna give a fuck anyways...
