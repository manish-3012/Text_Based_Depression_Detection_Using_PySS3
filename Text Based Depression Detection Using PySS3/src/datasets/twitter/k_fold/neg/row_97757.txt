I can't do it anymoreLife is just so painfully awful that I'm about at my absolute limit. There's just so many things that I can't make any better. I'm incredibly facially ugly, which has had effects on my social life all throughout my life. I've never been in a relationship, and i have very few friends. I'm not fat and don't have had hygiene, my face is just ugly. To make matters worse, I'm also FtM and disabled, making my life just that little bit more difficult and making me hate myself just that bit more.

I just got kicked out of my volunteer work because my depression is stopping me from being physically able to drag myself outside, even though I'm on a high dose of antidepressants, and my mum and stepdad hate me. They think I'm useless, they tell me I'm lazy and I don't do anything. My brother hates me, he uses what they say about me against me, he loves to make my life hell.

I just can't do it anymore. Nothing is getting any better, I'm so lonely it hurts. Nobody has low enough standards for me, I hardly see what few friends I have anymore, and I don't get to go outside much because I have nowhere to go. My life for the past few weeks has just been sitting in my room trying to pass the time with things that can't even make me remotely happy or entertained anymore, getting shouted at if I dare leave my room, or even sometimes if I don't. I just have nothing to live for anymore, there's nothing I can improve, I have no willpower to keep trying things that have failed me so many times, like trying to go out to bars on my own. I'm not good enough for anyone in any way.

I don't want to fall asleep another night feeling so alone and hopeless, knowing that there's nobody in my life who can or will help me. I'm probably going to do it tomorrow.
