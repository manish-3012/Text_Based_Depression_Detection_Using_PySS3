When your friend asks you â€œhow are you feelingâ€, and you wish you could answer â€œa tad bit suicidal â€œ.I mean Iâ€™m not actively suicidal, so I donâ€™t want you to be worried. But the back of the mind refuses to simply stop thinking about suicide. And that always freaks people out so I feel like I canâ€™t tell anyone. Because there is nothing concrete thatâ€™s going wrong, in fact Iâ€™m pregnant with a much wanted baby. But part of my brain just thinks of it as just another thing to do, even though part of me thinks itâ€™ll be like magical and wonderful, part of is like â€œbut we if  jumped off this building now, weâ€™d break from the   it: the monotony of anxiety , of suspecting that no one wants to hear us complain about everything, of having to deal with lifeâ€. And what kills me is that I feel like I ought to be able to just deal with it,  because nothing bad happened externally, but internally my brain seems to say â€œnope, weâ€™re just not ok recently.â€
