I didn't attempt suicide tonight. Thankfully, I started drinking before I downed my whole clonazepam prescription and the 750ml of gin.As the title says. I'm drunk right now and don't intend to end things tonight. This morning was terrible I woke up feeling like the worst hangover I've ever had and I didn't even drink the night before. I was defeated as fuck. Read my /r/depression post from earlier. Right now I'm finishing off my bottle of gin and gonna hit the sheets with some headphones when it's empty. I don't  know what'll happen next month when I get another full refill of my clonazepam. I may consider suicide again, or maybe I won't. I dunno. I'm trying to make it until at least mid July. My favorite band(Streetlight Manifesto) is coming to town and I'd at least like to see them live once before I die. I've already got my ticket. Maybe that'll be the night I down all of my pills and a big jug of vodka. I don't know yet. But that night is not tonight.

By all means, I wish I will get better. I want to, dearly. If anyone, after reading my previous post to /r/depression, wants to offer any form of support, please do. I'm taking what I can get right now in this tough time. However, if after that show, at the latest, I don't make any more progress, I may very well end my life. Escaping depression is difficult and, at least for me, forming meaningful connections with others is urgently imperative. 

This won't be my last post here, so hopefully I can obtain some good feedback while my heart is still pumping. I'm so lost.
