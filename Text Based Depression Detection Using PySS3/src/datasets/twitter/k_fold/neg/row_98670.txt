My wife and kids will be better off if I kill myselfIâ€™ve tried for so long. Tried all the meds and 20 + years with 10 or more psychologists or psychiatrists. I canâ€™t hold a job anymore. I used to be successful. I lost our home, savings, and we  have nothing left while my wife works a minimum wage job.

It doesnâ€™t get better. Thereâ€™s some up times and then it just gets worse. Iâ€™m like a virus that spreads. Iâ€™m dragging them down and they deserve a chance to be free of me. Theyâ€™ll move on, which I want. I want them to be happy and find joy in this life. Iâ€™m a failure in every way. I need to be exterminated.
