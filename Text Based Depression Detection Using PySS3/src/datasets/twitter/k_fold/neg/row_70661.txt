Gonna workout to death...I'm 18 years old. Had a very bad past. I no longer have a father, due to fucking alcohol. Just a mom as a parent, and 2 sisters. Younger one is 13, and older one is 20. Mom is 42. My depression didn't come just like that. I just really wish i had a better past. If my father was still around, i think i would've have a future to be honest. 
I don't see a therapist. No meds. No need them. 
I just can't imagine having a life anymore. That's all.

My death won't be on purpose, but naturally is gonna happen. I work on my bench alone in the basement when nobody is home. (And they aren't home often)
I work on increasing my bench, without a spotter. No power rack or anything. Either arms push the weight up, or the weight goes down as i'm struggling, choking me to death. 

I've ready many of the posts here. I truly feel bad for you all. All i could say is... this is a good death method. If your arms don't go up... then the inevitable will choke you to death.

Good luck everyone:)
