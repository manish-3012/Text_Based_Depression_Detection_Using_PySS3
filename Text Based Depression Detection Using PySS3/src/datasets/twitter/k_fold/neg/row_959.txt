I feel like nothing but an idiot and an asshole.I chipped a tooth and got some bruises on my face after I tried to hang myself with a belt. And the thing is that I didn't even think about it. I was just going through the motions, not even thinking stuff like "this is the end" or any kind of acknowledgement. First thing I remember after getting all tingly and blacking out was having random images flashing before I started to focus on what happened and realized I was lying on the floor and that I had just tried to kill myself. I don't know if was a poor not or something I did unconsciously, but I had smacked my face on something and when I calmed down enough to get to the bathroom and see what happened, I saw I have a bruise under my chin and a knot on my forehead, and when I fished around in my mouth because it was hurting, I found a chunk of my tooth. It all made me feel like shit. I had a friend who was helping me through this and I promised if it got too bad I would talk to her. But not only did I not even ask for help before it got to that point, but I didn't give her any sort of final word or anything. I feel like an asshole.
