i wish i had a solution to my depressioni just really really want to die. i wish had done so years ago but people always told me it would get better but it hasnâ€™t. my life has just spiraling downhill since i was 11. i have a rope in my closet that i might use to hang myself soon. the problem atm is iâ€™m too tired to get up the motivation to do the deed. every day for the past 6 years iâ€™ve thought about dying. i have plenty to live for but the pain iâ€™m in is excruciating. i donâ€™t know how to relieve it. i just want things to be different. i just donâ€™t know what to do. i just wish i could have peace.
