I'm done. Goodbye all.I think I'm ready to go. I can't do this. I can't deal with this world anymore. It's so fixed and flawed. I've accepted the fact that I was preprogrammed to fail. That's just the way it is. I haven't the money or skills to get anywhere on my own. I have no direction. It's essentially decided that I can't afford college, and if I can't go away to college I'm going to be stuck here for who knows how much longer. I thought my art and grades were good enough to garner a significant scholarship, but apparently not. What I got barely covers 1/5 of the cost. That's my fault though. I'm just not good enough. I don't know why I always have any confidence in things like this. It always ends in disappointment. It feels like I'm trapped in a loop and every time it seems like I could possible break it something stifles me. And I continue to ride this loop. It's absolutely surreal. I'm sick of people. I'm sick of this world. 

I'm going to tidy up a bit. Write my remaining goodbyes to my friends and family. 

Anyway, I'm done. Goodbye everyone.
