Why am I still here?I have overdosed on Tylenol twice in the past two weeks. I have not seemed medical attention, and yet here I am, very much alive and completely healthy. I don't understand why I'm not dying of liver failure. I want to be gone so badly. I have no future. I can't function in the "real world" as much as I pretend I can. I'm in so much pain everyday and I can't take it anymore. Why won't I just die? Why have I not felt sick yet? What's wrong with me?
