Let me tell you a story all about how I want to end my life right now.I honestly don't know what kind of catharsis I expect to feel by posting my suicidal ideation to reddit, but let's go I guess.

My life is fine. In fact, given the current state of the world, it's more than fine. I'm financially stable, I have a job I tolerate, my family loves me... I got all that going for me. But I still want to kill myself.

My problems are all self-imposed. I dropped out of college due to severe anxiety, and as such, only have an associate's. I broke up with one person I truly loved years ago and have never gotten over it, the cause instigating the breakup being my fault as well. I can't even muster the effort to cook for myself. It's all takeout here. I feel like my best years are behind me and I'm better off cutting my losses and heading off to oblivion, where I won't have to feel anything anymore.

But with all that said, I still don't think I've properly described why I feel the way I feel. It's difficult to put into words. Imagine, if you will, that every action in the world that you take, from waking up in the morning to going to the shitter, had some energy cost that you had to pay every time you did it. Biologically, they actually do right? It takes calories to do anything. Well, it feels like for me, it costs three or four times what it costs someone else to do anything. Because of this, I'm tired all the time. I oversleep, usually in the range of 14-16 hours, but I've slept 20 hours before. The only thing that keeps me up at all is taking my pills in the morning, one of which is similar in nature to adderal.

While I've always had a weird relationship with sleep, up until about a year and a half ago, things never felt this bad. I never felt so drained all the time. I've always had difficulty motivating myself to do things, but this feels like that 'ugh, I have to do the dishes' taken to some kind of twisted extreme.

My dad killed himself when I was a teenager. My brother tried to shortly after. My genes are fucked and I'm honestly tired of fighting them. But I have to, because I can't do that to my mom and my brother, and my newly born nephew. I guess after posting this I can go back to the cycle of sleeping and going to work without doing much in-between.

I guess for a tl;dr, here's a nice numbered list of the reasons I want to kill myself. I guess I have enough in me to care for the lazy people who don't want to read the full thing, mostly because you're my spirit animal.

1. Past relationship stuff.
2. Academic failure.
3. Narcolepsy maybe?
4. Suicidal Ideation runs in my family.

Oh, and I'm not actually going to kill myself like I said in one of those paragraphs, got too many people who care about me to do that, fortunately or unfortunately, you make the call.
