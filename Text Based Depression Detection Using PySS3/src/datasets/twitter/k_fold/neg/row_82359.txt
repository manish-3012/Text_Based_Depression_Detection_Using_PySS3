Iâ€™m trying to kill myself again within the next couple of hours.I canâ€™t be alone with myself anymore and donâ€™t have an outlet to get away, as everything i try comes full circle. Iâ€™ve been beating myself physically for 30 minutes now and canâ€™t stop. I canâ€™t ask anybody for help otherwise i would feel selfish and hate myself more. My life is just a constant loop of no confidence and self hate. Life like this isnâ€™t worth living, Iâ€™m torturing myself by trying to live through it. Please donâ€™t try to talk me out of it, this needs to happen.
