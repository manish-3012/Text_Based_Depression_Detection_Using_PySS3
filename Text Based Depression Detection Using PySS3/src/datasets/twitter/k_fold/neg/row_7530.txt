[Update] I tried to hang myself.  Not much has changed.  Asking for help again.I posted the other day after my failed attempt at hanging myself. The guard rail broke and I woke up several hours later. 

I have so many problems.  [Complex PTSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder), borderline personality disorder, bipolar 1 and anorexia.  I have been improving but it's still so difficult.  I have a therapist but I've never told him anything.  Never told him about being a child prostitute, witnessing a murder, being gang raped when I was 18 and a drug addict.  It's so hard to talk about these things in person and it's so hard to trust anybody IRL with such information.  I'm an alcoholic, an addict, I hurt myself and everything else.  This year has been the best year of my life in terms of target behaviors but I'm still miserable.  

Just wanted to vent.  Thanks.
