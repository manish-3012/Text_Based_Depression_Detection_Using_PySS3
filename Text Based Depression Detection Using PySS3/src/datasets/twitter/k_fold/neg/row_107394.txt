Apparently my plan won't work - just another failed ideaI've known how I want to kill myself for a while.  Had a bad day and looked into the details - turns out modern cars have enough pollution control that they don't produce enough CO to really do the trick in a timely manner.

Nothing I want to do, anything I try to plan, never works out.

I have no real friends. Joining groups that do things I'm interested in didn't work, everyone already has their little cliques.  I'm wasting time and all my savings getting a Master's degree and don't have any internship offers for the summer after 20 applications - and I'm in engineering for christ's sake I'm supposed to be desirable.  I'm almost 27 and have only had one girlfriend in my entire life for 4 months before she got bored and left.  I'm too old for anyone to want to have the patience for teaching me how to be an exciting person or be in a relationship.  I'm going to die alone and a penniless failure, might as well end it now while people think marginally highly of me.
