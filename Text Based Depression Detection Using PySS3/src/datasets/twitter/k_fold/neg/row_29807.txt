I can't live with myself anymoreI'm a pedophile. I admit it. I'm attracted to underage girls. I'm not sure I can keep going on knowing that I could one day act on these desires, ruining someone elses life in the process. I am 28 years old and have had these feelings since I was about 19. I've never abused a child and never would, but have viewed images online, so-called "jailbait" pictures of teenage girls. This has been kept hidden for so long but as I grow older I see friends from high school and college getting married and having kids of their own, I wonder what the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't I just be normal? I live with my parents and I'm fairly certain they know now too. I think I've heard them talk about it downstairs, and I can feel their anger every time they look at me now. Next time I'm in my car, I might just pull over somewhere and jump off an overpass. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm a disgusting piece of shit, I'm sorry I couldn't be what my parents wanted me to be, I'm sorry for indulging in those possibly illegal images. I've pretty much accepted that this will never allow me to fully be a part of society, and I can't do this anymore.
