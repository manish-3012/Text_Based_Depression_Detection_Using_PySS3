Depression is worse, constant suicidal thoughts.This year has been extremely difficult for me. Not a lot pf things have gone well and I feel extremely confused and like most people only speak to me as connivence. Since I have been told I am a good listener. I am run down and my motivation for anything has been at a zero. Im not proud of my art or writing I anymore after some things that have happened.

I have always had depression and anxiety. (Professionally diagnosed.) At a young age my parents took me out of treatment because they felt nothing was working and I was faking it. Im a lot calmer now, but my suicidal thoughts are worse. I want to get help but I cannot afford it, and I donâ€™t think I can ask family for any support because they donâ€™t really get how I am feeling and seem irritated when I talk to them about this.

Lately I have isolated myself. I donâ€™t want to talk ti my friends about this because I feel will drain them emotionally if I do. I also am afraid to be thrown somewhere forcefully for â€˜helpâ€™ if I tell people. Really, nothing makes me happy. Im disappointed in myself and my lack of emotional strength. I have been contemplating suicide everyday after the whirlwind this year has been. (though I have not actively made a plan.) Things scare me about it but the emotional pain has been far worse.
