I hate being black!I hate being a black male!
No matter what I do I will always be viewed as a monster who will be unsuccessful. The statistics show that most rapists are black. And most people in jails are black. Why even bother living?  I turn on the news and see black youths, unarmed being shot. I wear a suit and or argyle sweaters and khakis so I don't look like a gangster. I just look like the Christian I am. When I walk past women they clench their purses. I get good grades but I read that a white man with a criminal record has a higher job opportunity than a black man without a criminal record. People often complain about welfare, something that I found not use. People also assume that if you are black with a high position people will assume that you have your job because of affirmative action which usually helps Caucasian women 90% of the time. (Exageration) I will never be able to marry a beautiful wife. Why even bother living? The Blacks around me do not appreciate me, they think that I think that I am better because of my education. Growing up in school I went through years of being called an African refugee and kuntakente. What I meant by not marrying a beautiful wife is my own personal preference. From a very youngage I found blonde hair blue eyed women attractive. Unfortunately I could never feel accepted by a blonde hair blue eyed white woman. I simply am not good enough.
I hope that you noticed the update.
