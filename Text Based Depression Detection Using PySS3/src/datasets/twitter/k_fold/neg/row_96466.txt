I have no future.The only reason I haven't killed myself is because it would crush my mom. My brother is mentally handicapped and wouldn't understand. 

I feel selfish for wanting to die but I don't know how long that will hold me back. I'll probably just end up convincing myself that they'd be better off without me anyway and do myself in. 

I'm scared. I'm just so scared.
