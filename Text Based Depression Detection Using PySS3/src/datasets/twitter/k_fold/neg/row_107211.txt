I disappoint everyone...
I go to a prestigious school but can't get my homeworks done so I get detention a lot and I might not be readmitted.Its got to the point where I check my homework at the principal's office.When I see my parents they just sigh at me.On the car at the way home they only talk about how I disappoint them.I never succseed to do anything.When I try to do anything,they talk about how my grades are absolutely horrible and tell me to focus on my studies.I try my best but I always fail.If I died,it would have probably made no impact.Should I just be gone?
