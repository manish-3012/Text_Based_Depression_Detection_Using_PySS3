I am so terrified and overwhelmedthe most dramatic and painful events of my life have conspired over the last few days. i really only have one close friend and they are a part of this pain. having no one to hang out with or talk to makes everything a million times worse. i'm so sick of talking to myself. there is so much hate and violence around me constantly. i love my city but i am in the south and it is impossible to escape this terror. i'm so fucking scared of what is going to happen to me. i feel i can't get myself up and doing anything. i want to go to the protests more than anything, but i have no one to go with. all i can do is sit here and culminate in how afraid i am. i just wish i had support. i wish i had anyone. i'm so fucking scared i i don't know what to do
