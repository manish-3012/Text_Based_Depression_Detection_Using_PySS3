The reason I'm still alive.This may get written off as the stupidest thing ever, but I attribute the ongoing of my existence to coffee.

Hear me out for a second.

I'm 37, married, and have been suicidal for over 20 years now. I find no comfort in being comforted by people who don't get it, nor hobbies, nor anything simply because the good feelings that come from these little things Dade and only temporarily dull the ache.

Except coffee. 

When any friend of mine is struggling with emotional f*ckery, I tell them this: it won't solve your problems, but go get a good cup of coffee and sit there and slowly drink it. During that time, do not focus on anything other than the coffee...the smell, the warmth, the flavor. It may only be for a few minutes, but that's a few minutes where nothing in the world matters except the coffee. No stress, no bills, no stupid people...nothing. And many of us know that sometimes all we need is a short break from thinking.

It sounds stupid, but it works for me, and I sincerely hope that it helps for someone elss, even if only for five minutes.
