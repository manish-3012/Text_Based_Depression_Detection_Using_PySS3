back againtwo weeks ago i made a post here expressing my thoughts on whether or not i should jump in front of a train, since then i was in a psychiatric ward for 10 days where they deemed me to be at a low suicide risk, ive been out of the ward for a few days and have since seen a psychiatrist and have been prescribed copious amounts of medications and iâ€™m not sure why today iâ€™m feeling particularly badly but i am finding the urge to take all the medications iâ€™ve been prescribed all in one big go (possibly downing it with alcohol as well to affect my system more seriously i guess) and i just hate how when iâ€™m in hospital i seem fine because i know i canâ€™t hurt myself yet as soon as i get out all i want to do is attempt again which just isnâ€™t fair on everyone who has been looking after me these past two weeks

i am mainly just feeling lonely and i just want to feel some sort of connection to someone
