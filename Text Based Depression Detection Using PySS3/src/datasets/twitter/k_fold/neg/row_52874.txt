That's itToday I went to the skatepark and everyone was skateboarding and I haven't skateboarded since my last injury and swore off from skateboarding. I only went because I got it in my mind to prove to myself that I can put together a cool skate video and learn some things at the skatepark and I felt like shit and left. Everyone was friends or knew each other and it was like a small community. Last time I felt like shit I was in high school. I can't take it anymore I have nothing to live for now.
