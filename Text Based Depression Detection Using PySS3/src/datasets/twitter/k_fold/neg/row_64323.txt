I feel like I don't belong anywhere.I recently bought a room in an apartment for the summer with a friend, but it turns out that I really don't fit in with her group. I feel weird and awkward and pitiful, and I know that they all think I'm crazy. My friend has tried to intervene by telling me that if I don't try harder to seem friendly, her friends will stop hanging at our place. So I've staying away as much as possible to make it easier for her.. I don't want to ruin her summer. I also have a boyfriend who's sweet and gentle and kind and amazing, but I feel awful for asking to stay with him so much, because he has a life and a career and an amazing group of friends who I don't fit in with either. They are talented musicians who will all be famous someday and I'm useless. I just feel burdensome and worthless and awful because no one wants to deal with me. I want to stay asleep forever so no one has to interact with me. I'm a disappointment to my family, so going home isn't an option either. It might just be easier if I disappeared. I don't belong anywhere.
