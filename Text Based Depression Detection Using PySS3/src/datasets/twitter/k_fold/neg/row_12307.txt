I think I know why I'm depressed.. please help meIts so dumb but, I just want someone to love and someone to love me. I'm only 15 right now and I'm not in school because I got kicked out for not attending. I'm currently on Fluoxetine (Prozac) for my depression but It isn't really doing anything. I thought it was maybe because I had no friends but its not that, I talk to people online and I went to meet a few friends yesterday. But I didn't feel any better, I just want someone to be with and sometimes I just feel like I want a hug. I'm so lonely and I have been for so long and each day it gets harder and harder and I fall more and more into this pit of despair making it harder and harder to actually find someone, plus whos going to want to be with a depressed idiot like me who isn't even in school right now, how am I even suppose to meet people? Its so hard to keep going and sometimes I just wake up and start crying... I don't think posting here will help but I have nothing else to do..
(also this is a repost because of how pathetic I am..) Last time I got 0 replies
