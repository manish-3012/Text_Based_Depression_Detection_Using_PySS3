This afternoon?I'm in the middle of a college semester. I had a medication change (bipolar) in January that resulted in sadness and numbness. The numbness made it so I didn't feel the consequences of a potential suicide attempt - like, I knew I had a son but he seemed so far away. I went to the hospital for a medication change and felt somewhat better. I missed two weeks of school. Due to Coronavirus, Spring Break is two weeks. So basically, by the time school starts again, it will be only online and it will have been a month since I studied any of my (hard) subjects.

My mood has been getting a lot worse since I got out of the hospital. The sadness and numbness are back and I can't stop thinking about suicide. I think it's partially because I feel trapped by school. I've been talking to my therapist. I've always been honest with her but I lied this last time to stay out of the hospital. I've been trying different ways to commit suicide but wasn't able to find one I liked. But I found a quick, painless method and I'm getting the stuff in the mail this afternoon.

I'm worried about my son, who's a toddler. I've read the literature on how messed up he would be. I'm also worried about my brother, who would possibly follow me if I do it. They seemed like distant problems, but the closer I get to this afternoon, the more real it becomes. Also, I'm home alone with my dog, so I'm not sure how to make sure she's cared for without tipping people off in time to save me. Scheduled text message?

I guess I'm looking for a little hope. My next appointment with my therapist is Monday, and if I'm honest with her I know she'll send me to the hospital, which might not be a bad thing. I want to commit suicide but I'm thinking if I can just hold out until Monday, maybe everything will be OK.
