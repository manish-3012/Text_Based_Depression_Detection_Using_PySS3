I'm tired of lifeNobody's gonna see this and I don't care either. I just fucking can't anymore. You're born, against your will, you go to school for like 13 years, then you work a minimum wage job paycheck to paycheck for like 50 years, and then you rot in a retirement home until you die. I wanna do something with my life, but I can't. Im bound by the basic duties and responsibilities of life. And you're probably expecting me to say how I deserve better and shit, but the reality is, I don't. Life doesn't owe you or me shit. And what's the alternative? Am I not going to go to school? Am I not going to work? Well, im sure that would turn out great in the long run.

Is it fair that you're thrown into a world against your will? A world where all you do is work, work, work until you die. It's not. It's not fair. Life isn't fair and I hate it. There are amazing, smart, talented people that will live terrible lives and there's nothing you can do about it and there's terrible, fucked up people that will live amazing lives and there's nothing you can do about it. That's life. It will treat you however it wants you to and there's nothing you can do about it. There is nothing you can do about life. Well, other than one thing. And its starting to seem like more and more of an attractive option. I hate school, I hate work, and I hate life because that's what life is. I want to live in a world where I can do what I want. A world where I truly have control over myself and there's no way ill ever achieve that. Its complete nonsense. Im describing a fantasy world.

Bye. Time to leave this place once and for all.
