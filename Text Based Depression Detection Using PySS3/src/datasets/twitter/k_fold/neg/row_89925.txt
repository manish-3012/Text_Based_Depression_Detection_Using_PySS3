How is it fair that ANYONE is allowed to raise children?I've been sucidal since 15 years old. I was separated from my dad when I was 10 and was too scared to say I wanted him to be a part of my life. I was profoundly emotionally abused and neglected by my narcissistic mother and will probably have to go through years of therapy for it. My mother raised me as an object, just the second child or æ¬¡ç”·. At 21 years old I referred to myself in third person because of her brainwashing. Why not just end it all? Suicide is my destiny. Those are some thoughts that go through my mind every single day. It's just so much easier to suicide. My past is too painful to bare. I wish I had a different mom. I wish I had gone to see my dad when I was younger, that's what my heart was telling me to do at the time. But I was too scared. I wish I had a mom that loved me. I was constantly called stupid and lazy. She once told me, "I don't give a single fuck if you end up a loser or homeless." Well saying that to your child, no fucking shit I'd end up this way. I'm sorry for being born. I'm sorry for existing. I never asked to be brought into this world and now I'm forced to live. I think about suicide every day. Thank you for reading.
