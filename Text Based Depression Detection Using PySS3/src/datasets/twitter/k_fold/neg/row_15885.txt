Wanting to die but not really suicidal.Im not really sure what wrong with me. I have a good life, a wonderful family and friend. I don't have much hardships compared to others...but shit! I really want to die. 

I remember somehow at a young age of 8 years old to 10 years old (I have a good memory) I tried to hurt myself but not seriously..... I think it started around highschool or college where I thought that "it wouldn't be so bad to die now. No regrets" Maybe its because I'm quite happy with what I had and it is ok to end it there lol.

I don't know when I started praying whenever I can that I hope to die today. A car accident, a missed bullet, stabbed and accidental coal suffocation is my most approved scenario. 

But lately... sometimes.... I want to end it by my own hands but I don't wish for my family to suffer with that selfish doing. 

In the perspective of others, I am quite a happy go lucky and bright person. So I believe that no one would really thought that there is something wrong with me.

Can anyone relate? Anyone got through this crazy shit? 

I'm tired.
