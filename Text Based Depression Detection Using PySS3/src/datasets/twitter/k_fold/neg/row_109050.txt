i hate how i look. i want to be pretty. since everyone thinks i'm ugly i want to die. i want to die. i want to die. i just want to die. i hate being alive looking the way i do. i just want to die. everyone hates me because i'm ugly. everyone tells me to stop worrying about it and dismisses me. they all just say i need therapy. i. don't fucking need therapy i just need plastic surgery. i hate everyone and i hope they all die painful deaths because that's what they deserve. i just want to be pretty. that's the only thing i want. since i can't have that there really is no point to continuing to live. everyone lies and says i'm 'cute' i just need to smile more and everything but i hate those people. i hate being ugly. i want to die because of my face. i hate being ugly. i want to be happy but i can't because of my ugliness. i wonder what i did to have been cursed so badly to have ugliness bestowed on me. i would do anything to have the curse be lifted. does anyone know any reversing curse chants that can help me? thanks.
