I tried to drink myself to death tonightI apparently drank so much tonight that I couldn't function but somehow I called the EMTs on myself. I woke up in my bed with my best friend sleeping next to me and my stomach hurting. I remember vomiting but I haven't eaten in days so it was just alcohol and stomach bile. Im not cutting or anything anymore but that doesn't make me feel better about my decisions tonight.
