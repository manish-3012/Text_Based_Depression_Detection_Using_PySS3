Even reddit wants me dead, why shouldn't I comply?Even this site has grown utterly sickened by my self-pity and weakness. I just, why can't I just man up and fucking do it already? I've been thinking about suicide since I was 13, I talk about depression all the time, why can't I just man up and fucking do it??? My life is fucking worthless, I spend all my time on reddit like a sad fucking loser, I have literally one friend. I wasn't supposed to become this, I had potential once and now I'm fucking nothing. I just, why did I do this to myself? Why is this my life? Why can't I fucking end this, why?
