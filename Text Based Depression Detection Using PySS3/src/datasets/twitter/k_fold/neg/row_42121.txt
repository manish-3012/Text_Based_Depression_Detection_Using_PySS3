I feel so fucking bad for my dogsThey donâ€™t understand that I donâ€™t have energy to play they donâ€™t understand why I stay in bed all day they donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m always screaming they donâ€™t understand I canâ€™t understand that anything mildly annoying Iâ€™ll drive me over the edge theyâ€™re so small and innocent I just hope they donâ€™t think theyâ€™re as dogs or that Iâ€™m neglecting them or that I donâ€™t want them. I wish I could explain that Iâ€™m not well, so theyâ€™ll know I donâ€™t mean it, but lately that hasnâ€™t been working with people either so I donâ€™t know what to do but to fucking cry all day I feel so fucking miserable can I just stop the pain I donâ€™t know how I feel and I donâ€™t know how to control my thoughts Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m might hurt someone what the actual fuck is going on insid e my head I donâ€™t know who I am and all I do is sleep till 5 and god help me I donâ€™t have a personality and Iâ€™m in constant need of approval because I feel no one loves me besides they telling me they do and im so fucking tired I canâ€™t handle this shit anymore and really want my dogs to be happy and I really want me to stop being fucking pathetic
