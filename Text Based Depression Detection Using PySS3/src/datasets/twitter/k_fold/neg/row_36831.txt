Took several sleeping pills last night. Nowhere near lethal but I just needed the pain to stop for a moment.I ended up "drunk texting" my exwife and I don't even remember it. I've been a little sluggish today but less anxious. Still a basketcase. Will always be alone. Hate myself. The only reason I'm alive is I have a son who needs me. 

I played Starview valley today and can't stop crying. What the hell is wrong with me?
