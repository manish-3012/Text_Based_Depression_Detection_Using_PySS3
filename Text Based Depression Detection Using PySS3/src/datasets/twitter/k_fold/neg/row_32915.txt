telling people in your life you're suicidal is a no from me dawgworked up the courage to tell my dad that i had been having suicidal thoughts and had written suicide notes to people in my life and he told me that and i'm being dramatic and that i'm applies just like everyone else my age (20) i thought he would take me seriously because his sister killed herself back in the 80s. 

i have a plan but i'm too much of a little
bitch to do anything so i don't need to go to the hospital according to my mom. it's like nobody around me takes me seriously. i'm getting super close to being brave enough but just when i think i can do it i chicken out.
