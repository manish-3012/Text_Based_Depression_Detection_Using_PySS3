i have a lot going for mebut one of these days enough will be enough. i'm tired and i don't think i can keep pretending to be okay. i have good grades and i have good friends and family and people who love me and the people in my life have been my reason for continuing. but soon enough i'm going to have to be selfish because i can't take it anymore. i don't want life i don't want a future i don't want to try. i have no energy to keep going. i just want to not be here anymore.
