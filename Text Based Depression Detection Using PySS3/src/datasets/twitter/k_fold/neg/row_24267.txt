No reason to live.I'm nearly 21, still live at home, have no real friends, don't have a girlfriend, bad relationships with family, unemployed and nothing that makes me happy. Honestly really struggling to find good or any reason to live at all. Get yelled at for not finding a job, but why should I? I just look at the job offers and think: I can't do that, too difficult for me, nope social anxiety, have no car to travel etc. Why should I work 8 hours a day when I don't even want to live and have nothing here? Really at the edge right now.
