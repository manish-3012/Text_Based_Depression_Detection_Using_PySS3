â€œWell, thatâ€™s life.â€I fucking **hate** hearing this. There are so many things in life that make me want to die. So much pain and misery in the world. The idea of slaving my life away for someone else. Literally trading hours of my life for currency just to make it another day so I can do it again and repeat the process. All working towards the inevitable goal of being alone and dying.

Memories you canâ€™t get rid of. Watching others being happy. Being ignored. All the loneliness in general. The losing of everyone you care about. Just the suffering. And all I can hear from others is: *â€Well, thatâ€™s life.*

Yeah, it is. But that **doesnâ€™t** mean I have to fucking like it. 

And you wonder why I want to die.
