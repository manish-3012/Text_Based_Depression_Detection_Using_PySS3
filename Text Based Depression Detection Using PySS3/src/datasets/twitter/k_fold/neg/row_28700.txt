I'm a piece of shit, that's that.I've come to realise that I'm done. There isn't anything left for me in this life. I don't like anybody, I don't enjoy doing anything. The only hobbies I have are to kill time. It's not like If I talk to anyone around me they'll understand. I'm different, always have been. I never liked my family, even if I tell them that whats gonna happen? Not like I have anywhere else to go. Even if I did I'd feel sorry for whoever I'd be freeloading off of. I only wish I could snap my fingers and be dead.
