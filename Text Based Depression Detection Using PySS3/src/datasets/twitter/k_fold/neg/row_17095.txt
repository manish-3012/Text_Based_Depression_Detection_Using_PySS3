Not impulsive Nor desperate. Pouring my h3artHi, 
I've been thinking about leaving this wicked world on and of for a year.
Troubles came to me eight years ago. Not going into details. For eight years I tried it all. You name it - I tried it. Yoga, vegetarian, exercising, travel, living alone, antidepressants, reading, believing and so on. 
It just existence is unbearable. 
I'm not psychotic or impulsive. My thoughs are like sell everything and go to Swiss "Dignitas", donate kidney and then, take out donor card and finish it in a hospital territory, make that 3D printed euthanasia pod.. Not to do it in my house for parents to sell it. Overall, I'm planning like a vacation.
Please, don't tell me people live with worse, I'm not gonna feel better if someone is worse than me..
I had a good life. All opportunities which I ruined, maybe partially.
I still have hope and few ideas how to turn it at least a little better. But you know, it is just not flowing.. I see how people just go with the flow and the world just bends under their feet. Meanwhile I give all myself and get nothing.
And it's not money or material things. I've been homeless and it was okay for me.
My biggest dream is a homestead in backwoods. All alone, no people around me.. few animals.
To be honest I had a few days when the day before I wanted to do it, but next day I was "ohh, good thing I didn't take that "shake".

I just wanted to pour my heart out..

My advice, give it all of yourself. ALL. Try it all. ALL. When you can gracefully say "Well I did it all, I tried it all it didn't worked out"

Thanks for reading
