I'm not sure if I deserve to dieI accidentally sexually assaulted my (now ex) girlfriend about a month ago. I was at her house helping her with studying, but weâ€™d both agreed that â€˜studyingâ€™ was essentially code for â€˜making outâ€™, so we were making out in the living room. Iâ€™m pretty sure everything was fine at this point. Then, her mother came home, and she became uncomfortable. She didnâ€™t seem to object at first but after a while she began occasionally saying â€œstop, we should studyâ€, in what I thought was a playful, flirty way. We had often talked previously about how we liked being â€˜sneakilyâ€™ intimate when there was someone in the next room and I thought that the whole situation was a joke about that. I now realise that I am disgusting for thinking that consent could ever be joked about.

When I realised she was genuinely uncomfortable, I stopped and apologised, but I should have realised much sooner. She said that it was okay, that she hadnâ€™t been clear, and that we could talk about it later by text, presumably because she was scared of being with me in person. Later that day I sent a very long message apologising again and I told her that I understood if she broke up with me and/or went to the police. She told me that I didnâ€™t understand consent, that I made her feel sick, and that she didnâ€™t feel safe around me. I tried to explain that I had never meant to hurt her but ultimately it didnâ€™t matter to her and shouldnâ€™t matter to anyone. My intentions didnâ€™t stop me from doing something very hurtful and violating.

I know that she was right to break up with me. I havenâ€™t been in contact with her but from what Iâ€™ve heard sheâ€™s mostly okay. On the one hand it pains me to admit that sheâ€™s better off without me, but on the other hand it comforts me to know that sheâ€™s safe from me now. I miss her, but I can handle the heartbreak. What I canâ€™t handle is the guilt.

I keep going on about what has happened to my friends and family and I feel like Iâ€™ve become an enormous burden to them. They all keep lying to me and saying that I havenâ€™t really done anything wrong. I know that theyâ€™re trying to make me feel better but I think I should stop talking to them about it because they all refuse to recognise how awful I am. I also feel like I should stop dragging them through my problems.

I canâ€™t trust myself around other people. I feel like I have a disgusting and horrible person inside me that Iâ€™ve been trying to hold back for my whole life and now Iâ€™ve failed. Iâ€™m terrified of physical contact because I know that itâ€™s only a matter of time before I hurt someone else. I feel like a rabid dog that needs to be put down. Iâ€™ve self-harmed a little but my self-preservation instincts are irritatingly strong so I havenâ€™t managed to do any major damage.

I donâ€™t know if I want to kill myself. I know my family would be distraught, and I worry that my ex would feel guilty for it. On the other hand, it might bring her comfort to know that I could never hurt her again, and my family might welcome the relief from having to constantly deal with me. Iâ€™m not sure if I deserve death or if I deserve to live in pain. I know that I should go to the police myself, but to tell the truth Iâ€™m scared, and I also donâ€™t want to distract my ex from her life by dragging her through a massive legal process. I wish I could ask her if she would prefer for me to go the police or to kill myself but she doesnâ€™t want to speak to me.

I don't think I'm at imminent risk of killing myself so I apologise if that means I've just wasted this sub's time.
