If ~70% of one's waking hours are spent consciously or subconsciously worrying about stuff, what even is the point of staying alive any longer ?It just occurred to me that the majority of my 25 years of life have been consumed with literally just worrying. The worst kind of worry is the one that lingers in the background. It's like a spider on the back of my head that just won't let go. It just feels so pointless.
