Please, end this shitty teenager life. I am begging.I cannot endure anymore. I am almost going crazy sometimes. Crying, almost self harming. Why do I have to live??? Why can't I just die??? Please, don't say I am just young. Screw that. I don't care if I am just a kid. I don't care! I just want to die! I am unlikable, unworthy, shitty. Undesirable. Nothing special. Less than mediocre. I don't want this anymore! If people care about me so much about me, why do they want me to live? Living makes me *suffer*. It hurts me. It's only pain. Why? Why should I live if that's the case? Huh? No reason at all! I am sick of it. Of everything. Of being alone. Of being lonely. Of existing. Finishing me would be the best course of action.
