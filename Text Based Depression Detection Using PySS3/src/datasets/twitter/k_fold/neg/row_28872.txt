Music is my escape lately, without it I'm the exact definition of "empty"Ambient rock, nu-metal, hard rock, these are some examples of genres I listen to when I feel absolutely terrible about myself and my life. Right now for example, I'm listening to this kind of music. Takes the pain away, right out of me. 

Sometimes the songs I listen to show my life flash before my eyes, and makes me a little more hopeful. But life is never that easy. My life has been chaotic lately, filled with self hate, all on top of financial burdens. Whats more, the pandemic has taken a toll on me and I've been isolated beyond belief. 

But music... something about it... not the hopeful sparks of its message, nor the beautiful notes, but the very chaos of it is what keeps me striving. I don't know, I guess when you can't predict any moment, there is gonna be hope somewhere. In this way I feel life is worth fighting for.
