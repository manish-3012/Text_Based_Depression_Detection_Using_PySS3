PLEASE help I don't know what else to doI am a 23y/o female living in Texas. I have suffered from anxiety since I was a child and depression since I was a teenager. I am so tired, I am at my END. 

On November 7th I called 911 because I was so close to harming myself. They "assessed" me by asking a few short questions then kept me in a room with some chairs and a tv all night, then released me in the morning. They did nothing for me. 

Yesterday again, I  was so scared and ready to die and again I called 911. SAME THING. I pleaded with the assessment lady that I needed help, that I needed somewhere to take me in for a while, I need some help before I just die. She said there is nothing she could do. Same thing, released me in the morning. 

I am so scared. I want help but I feel like I have no options. I know if I Walt much longer I will be dead soon. Please, does anyone know what to do? I am scared
