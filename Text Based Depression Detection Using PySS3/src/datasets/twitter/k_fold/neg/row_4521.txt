I can't take this...I live everyday in a house filled with people that have lots of hatred towards me. Everyday. My own father tells me that he doesn't need me, or love me. My mom always sleeps... She shows no affection towards me at all. I want to move in with my aunt.. I hate it here so much. Yesterday, my 12 year old sister attacked me. ATTACKED. I punched her in the nose to get her hands away from my throat. She screamed, clawed my face, then ran to the bathroom. I got screamed at, and slapped, saying it was all my fault. It always is my fault. What would you do if a 250 lbs 12 year old was coming at you, and you have no muscle whatsoever, and weigh a measly 114 lbs at 15? you would fight back right? She had her hands around my throat. I was so close to passing out. She constantly chanted, "you dirty whore, you deserve to die." and yet again... Its all my fault. The only person i have there for me is my boyfriend. he hates that i live here with these people. Just a few minutes ago i went to go pick up my cat in front of the tv, and i got in my dads way and he pushed me completely away calling me a bitch. I HATE IT HERE! They both know i am selfharmy and suicidal but yet they do nothing to fix it. THey still constantly treat me like shit and I really cant take this anymore. all i want is to be told, hey, you look nice today. or hey, you're a good kid, or hey, i love you. But nope... I've sstopped eating completely because everytime I leave my bedroom i get yelled at for something.... I just want a way out ;( my dad left a little ago so i snuck on my laptop he took from me..
I dont do any thing bad.. Im really a good person... but they treat me like a piece of shit... and I cant take it... I dont want to be here
