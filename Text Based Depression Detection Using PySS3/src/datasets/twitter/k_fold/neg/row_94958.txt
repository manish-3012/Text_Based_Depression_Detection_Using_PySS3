household toxins/ hydrogen sulfide suicide?does anyone know anything about this as a method of suicide? from what iâ€™ve learned from researching it, you lock yourself in a car with a source of hydrogen sulfide and die within minutes. but does anyone know how painful or successful it is? and how would this be carried out? what household toxins do you need to mix in order to create enough gas to die?
