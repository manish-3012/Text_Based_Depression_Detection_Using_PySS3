Research Study for Disclosure of Suicidal Thoughts or Behaviors  

Hello, 

I am seeking participants for a research study about the disclosure of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. I am seeking individuals who experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviors after the age of 18, are not currently suicidal, and who live within the United States. This study has received IRB approval from Kansas State University. All responses are completely anonymous and you may leave the study at any time. If you would like to participate, please use the following link:
