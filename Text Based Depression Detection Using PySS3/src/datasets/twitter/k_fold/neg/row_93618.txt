I fear not having the courage to kill myself.My life sucks, the idea of dying makes me feel mesmerized and blissful, knowing that I will be able to get rid of the weight of this life once and for all.

However sometimes I feel like I won't have the guts to do it. I see no future for me, I dropped out of high school because my life was hell and I couldn't cope with it. I can't last in a job more than a couple of months, I just can't stick to a routine like that, so my future seems obscure, depressing/empty, lonely and miserable.

I hope one day I will be able to let go, gather the guts and do it. Maybe jumping out of a tall building into liberation by death. Everything will make sense in the end, and death is true freedom, bliss, breaking free from this perpetual meaningless suffering.
