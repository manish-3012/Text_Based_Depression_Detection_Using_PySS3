suicide as revenge?i wonder if it would do something.

my long term boyfriend/best friend cheated on me with his coworker and they are now raising her kid together. my friends donâ€™t care. one left me in the rain at midnight after he screamed at me, triggering a panic attack. another ghosted me. another spread around that i was an asshole skank for not dating him. another told others about a really intimate secret. all of them didnâ€™t notice i was gone for a week in the mental hospital. another spread around calling me â€œpatchyâ€ because i have trichotillomania. probably wonâ€™t be able to go to college since this virus has shut down most campuses in canada, and that was my escape.

i found out that my friend group (+ ex bf) hung out a couple nights ago for a birthday, which i was supposed to be invited to, and talked about how much of a whore i am and sparked untrue rumors about me. i dated a couple guys in the friend group, and both cheated on me, and have the nerve to treat me like the antichrist for seeing other guys after we broke up. theyâ€™ve all been incredibly toxic for the entirety of high school, so i am not surprised, but i have no one else.

right now i have been hyperfixating on my friends. they donâ€™t care. i put four years of work into them and they treat me like shit. i fantasize about making them care about me, to feel sorry for all the horseshit theyâ€™ve put me through. i want them to feel sorry.
i wonder if suicide will make them regret it. i would want to kill myself in front of them. i would want the image of my carcass to stain their minds for the rest of their lives. i would want it to haunt them forever. for them to feel the pain theyâ€™ve given me would be the best gift to me. i want them to be hollow empty shells of their former selves, condemned to a relentless sorrow for the rest of their fucking pathetic lives.
