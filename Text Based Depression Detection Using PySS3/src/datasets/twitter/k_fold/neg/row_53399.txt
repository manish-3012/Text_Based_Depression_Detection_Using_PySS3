All things endEverything ends at some time bad luck good luck doesn't matter the question is can u last long enough r will u give up and end it
I've already tried to kill my self 2 times but they didn't work obviously
I gave up on my life along time ago and I realized that if u have someone to talk to and hold u should keep them close so u can  serve r last longer and find happiness in someone 
I lost that and I give up
