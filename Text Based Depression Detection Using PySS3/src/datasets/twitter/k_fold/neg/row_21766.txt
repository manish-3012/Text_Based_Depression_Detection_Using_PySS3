The more the time the worse it getsBroke up with the love of my life. I swear it's been one and a half days and it's getting worse with time. I miss her so much. I miss texting her at the morning and night. Texting her throughout the day. Talking on the phone at night. There's no reason for me to use Facebook anymore. She is completely gone and it was my fsult and can't do anything about it. It's the worst feeling ever. So much pain and it gets worse when I reminisce about the good times. The good times of my life was with her. Today I dreamed about her at night. When I woke up I felt utterly terrible. My life is completely fucked. I feel bored, sad, unmotivated. I feel like a zombie. I don't even care about finishing school. Everything is black and white. I don't have a therapist nor a psychologist and I don't think they could help me. The only thing that could help me is her.
