My mom died 3 hours agoI thought id be ready for this some day but i realized thats impossible. Shes still in her room, she died in her sleep. She looks at peace which makes me glad. I kissed her goobye and i dont want to see her anymore because it hurts to look. My brothers and i are waiting for the ambulance to arrive but they are holding up since shit sucks here in Mexico. Nothing but silence. I dissapointed her beyond comprehension and she managed to love me and be so kind. I dont know what im going to do without her. I was already suicidal before she died and now its only going to get worse... If i had a reason to live then now i dont. At the moment im containing myself from crying because she didnt want anyone to cry when she passed and im going to hold up for her since its the only thing i can do right for her. Im just trying to think of how good a life she lived and how strong she was which is ironic considering im constantly down in the dumps. She was a phenomenal mother. I love you mom. Goodbye and rest easy.
