coping with a friends suicideHello everyone,

A close friend of mine killed himself this afternoon without even the slightest warning signs and i feel empty inside and i don't know who to talk to and i'd never go there myself so don't worry about that, but i'm just hoping for some support and maybe some guidance from people who went through the something similar because I'm in my room smoking pot crawling up the walls trying to cope and i'm not getting anywhere.

thank you
