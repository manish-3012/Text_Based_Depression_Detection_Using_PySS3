Tired of living with chronic painBeen living with chronic debilitating pain for over 25 years. It gets a little worse every year and my condition progresses. There is medicine that helps greatly but it is expensive with the doc visits and there are so many barriers. A copay assistance card from the manufacturer helps but it is always so difficult. From what I understand I am supposed to be allowed to have a 3 day period of overlap for medication in case of issues with refills but pharmacies want to wait until I run out of medication before they fill it then it always takes them longer than they think it will to fill because they never have it in stock. It makes me cry every time it happens. Then they claim the warehouse won't supply it anymore and to go somewhere else. I hate it. I can be almost a normal person on my meds and without it I can't do much. I recently had to move for my wife's work and in this area the meds I am on are not common at all and it has been really hard. I feel suicidal right now like the world doesn't want me around because I have medical problems. I am afraid I am going to miss a dose again or even worse, that I am not going to be able to get my prescription filled at all this time. I fear that every month. I do everything they tell me to do, call ahead of time to give them notice and everything and they still can't get it on the day it is supposed to be filled. I just tired of being treated like I don't belong and that I am bothering people just because I need a prescription for my fucking pain. Life sucks at the moment.
