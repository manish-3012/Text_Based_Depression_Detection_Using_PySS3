Why?So to start this little story of my life off, I am 14 years old. A few months ago I went through a spell in which I wanted to kill myself. The only reason I am here typing this today is because my friends, who I had sent a farewell to the previous night, texted my mom and let her know of what was going on. Now I am back where I was, except much much worse. I have been texting my friends a lot asking them for help, because I fear death yet I want to die. The reason for my previous depression stage is memories of being raped by my step brother had resurfaced. And now it's all I can think about. And just to add onto that, I am extremely introverted and socially awkward, which causes me to be a prime subject for bullying. I have been told by several people to kill myself even people I used to consider friends. And the cherry on the cake, the only girl I ever loved said yes to going on a date and wouldn't text me till she got a boyfriend. This has lead to my physical insecurities arising as well. I have sat in my bed for 2 weeks now without eating yet I still feel overweight despite people telling me I'm not. I have been surfing the Internet looking for bullsh*t reasons as to why I shouldn't finally kill myself. And I doubt anyone will actually read this or even see this, but if you are, why shouldn't I kill myself?
