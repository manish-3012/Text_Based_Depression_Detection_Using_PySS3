I donâ€™t want to live anymoreItâ€™s becoming harder to get out of bed every morning. Itâ€™s becoming harder to do simple tasks like brush my teeth and shower. The only girl I want doesnâ€™t want me in the same way. My family thinks Iâ€™m a bum and are about to stop supporting me financially. Iâ€™m 19 years old. I have no direction in life and I barely graduated high school. I donâ€™t know what I like or want to do with my life. The only way I know how to get money is by selling weed. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to be able to support myself. Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending my life more and more recently but I donâ€™t want to do that to my friends and family and Iâ€™m also scared Iâ€™ll botch the suicide attempt. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. The mental pain hurts more than any physical pain Iâ€™ve ever felt.
