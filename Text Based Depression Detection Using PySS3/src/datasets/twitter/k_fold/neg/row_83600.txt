I want to die and it is so petty.This is just sort of a rant that I feel the need to post, this can be ignored or deleted or whatever, I just have no one I feel like I can talk to or want to bother with this.

I hate feeling like this because I have no good reason for feeling like this, I have as many good irl friends as I feel comfortable managing with my mix of dyspraxia, aspergers (albeit quite minor in my opinion) and being an introvert in the privacy of my home. I have a lot of online friends, I am pretty well liked in the communities that I have been accepted into. Although I am not happy with my body and genetics overall I am no longer overweight (kinda skinny fat but nowhere near as bad as I used to be) and have multiple body parts that I do like. I am not particularly ugly, I am pretty average looking and have gotten compliments from people of both sexes while also having facial features that I personally like, in fact people get mad at me for making bad jokes about being ugly because they really don't think I am.

I haven't been bullied in a long time. While still being a virgin I have had girlfriends irl and online and have had the opportunity, just turned it down for whatever reason. I am somewhat intelligent, not going to be in mensa or anything but I am not stupid. I am in community college and slowly getting to where I want to be in life. But while saying all this, I hate myself and I hate my life.

Although I have a natural dissatisfaction with my life, my genetics, looks etc. My feelings of wanting to end it all is culminating from the last girl I loved. I believe this because I just rejoined a group I added her to that she wonâ€™t ever leave.

It was a long distance relationship and I loved her a lot, I broke up with her twice, the first because she lied to me, we had an honest discussion about sex and she lied to me about being ready so that I would visit sooner. When I did end up visiting I wasnâ€™t treated like shit by certain members of her family and she acted quite selfishly, sexually and emotionally. The second time because it just didnâ€™t feel right and practically it wasnâ€™t going to work. Her mother now hated me, she was too scared to tell her father about us being back together, she wasnâ€™t making the right plans to ever visit me and things just didnâ€™t sit right with me about what she did previously. Throughout this relationship I had anxiety and insecurity because at the time I was uglier and less attractive as well as she was not truthful about some things. For example, her exes, I met 3 of them and I had to find out about her past relationships through third parties. 

I am bringing this up because although I broke up with her, I canâ€™t tell if I am still in love with her or I hate her. She rejected me and made me feel like dirt sexually and emotionally and yet, knowing she got back with an ex I was anxious about crushed me a few months ago. I also have learnt that she has said things to some of my online friends, downplaying what she did, making me out to be a sexual fiend only going out with her for sex and never loving her. I canâ€™t work out what is wrong with me, why she of all people didnâ€™t want me. I feel like after this experience that no one will want me, I feel like I am going to fail at everything I want to achieve in life, I feel like I canâ€™t connect with girls again like I did her and I just donâ€™t want to continue like this. I keep thinking about making audio tapes like in 13 reasons why and then just jumping in front of a train or tube on my way back from london one day. I am not making any big plans too far ahead of time because I think I am going to do it this time.

This rant probably seems spastic and doesnâ€™t make sense but yeah, I needed to get things off my chest, looks even pettier now that I read it like this though lol.



TLDR

Had a bad LDR relationship where I felt sexually rejected and treated badly when I finally visited her. She is back with an ex and her being in my life in anyway causes me to want to die for petty reasons. I just cant shake it and keep fantasizing the different ways to die and I am almost afraid to make any plans ahead of time because I think I may finally do it this time.

Also I am just going to note that conventional help is not an option, I can never see my college therapist/counsellor till after my depressive spells, already had a GP betray my trust and break a law when I opened up in the past and can't afford private therapy.
