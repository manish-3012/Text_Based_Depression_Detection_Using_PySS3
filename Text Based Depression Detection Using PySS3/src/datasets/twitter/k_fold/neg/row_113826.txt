Iâ€™m worried my professor judges me for my mental health last semesterLast semester I went through this whole episode in which I felt suicidal due to pressures of school, then fell behind in my classes, which caused anxiety and gave me the worst suicidal thoughts Iâ€™ve had in years. One night this intensified beyond my grip and I checked myself into the ER for a psych evaluation. I spent the night there and the next day the doctors worked out a treatment plan with me and sent me on my way. 

It was awkward timing and I didnâ€™t have time to go home and freshen up before my professors office hours, so I went straight to school, still in my pajamas from the night before with the hospital wristband around my wrist. We talked a lot about what I was going through and got on good terms, and basically he agreed to go easy on me while I worked on catching up. (He has been hard on me previously which was part of the problem) 

I have this professor again this semester and everything is going just fine, but Iâ€™m starting to feel embarrassed about the whole thing, like I bet heâ€™s always nice to me on purpose or something because he thinks it might happen again, and perhaps he thinks I canâ€™t handle real criticism or something
