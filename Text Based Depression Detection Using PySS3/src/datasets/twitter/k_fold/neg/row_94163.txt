I think Iâ€™m finally in too much pain to handleIâ€™m not really trying for you to talk me into or out of anything. Iâ€™m not going to call your hotline, Iâ€™m not going to talk to you, itâ€™s not going to get better. Iâ€™ve gone through three years of agony holding out for the day it gets better, it isnâ€™t coming. In fact, itâ€™s only going to get worse.

I have these thoughts that just donâ€™t ever stop coming, and every time I think about them, It just hurts way more than anyone should have to hurt. I just want this feeling to go away, and Iâ€™m going to make it go away.
