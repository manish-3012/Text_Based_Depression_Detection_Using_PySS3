I tried to kill myself last night.I was sitting on my patio, imagining myself walking into an intersection that I could see from there, when all of a sudden I had a compulsion to walk out there, so I did. I was standing on the sidewalk, watching a few cars pass by, almost daring myself to walk out in front of one, but also getting frustrated that none of them were going fast enough to kill me. After a few minutes of this, I broke down crying and punched a wooden post in frustration, making my knuckles bleed, and cried at the sidewalk for a while. I feel like shit. I wanted to die but I couldn't bring myself to do it. So I'm stuck here still.
