Who do I call when I'm on the edge.I am sat here, ready to do it, my plan is made and laid out. But I don't want to die, not really. I want the pain and confusion in my foggy brain to end. I've been in this position a couple of times recently, but always managed to talk myself down, ashamed. Then I beat myself up for not just going for it. Is it what I want? I don't know any more. I think I need someone to help me, but I don't know who to call. My partner is away, and I don't want them to know how desperate my situation is. My family is too far away. My friend lives over an hour away, and has told me to call her in the past, but I don't want to be a burden and I don't want her to have to come and pick me up, and I don't know if I can just sit for an hour and wait that long.

I could call 999, but I don't want to waste people's time, I don't want to be kept in hospital as I'm worried my partner will find out, I can't let that happen. I don't know what to do and I'm scared of myself.
