Waking up sucksIt sucks to wake up, last night I took a bunch of sleeping pills and drifted off into a peaceful sleep. Then they wore off I guess and I woke up so I took some more. Woke up again and it's the worst feeling in the world, while your asleep everything is peaceful but then I woke up and got hit by a sudden wave of reality, I'm still here I still have to face whatever comes next, I still have to deal with the dreadful drag of life that never seems to end.
