Situational DepressionI'm on a good mix of anti-psychotics and anti-depressants that I have been on for a while, and they still keep me relatively healthy, but that hasn't prevented me from falling into situational depression. As you may have guessed, I don't handle it rather well. I wanted to increase my dosages, but I'd be confronting legitimate situational depression with medication intended to combat chemical imbalances. I'm poor, I'm lonely, there's no real way for me to currently improve my standing, and my suicidal ideation has been sky-rocketing lately. I'm not sure what to do. I wanted to post something, just to, I don't know, get some of it off my chest I guess.
