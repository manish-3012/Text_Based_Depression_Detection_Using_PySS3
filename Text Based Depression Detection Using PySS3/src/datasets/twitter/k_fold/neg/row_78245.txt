I really want to die.I am just so scared of the pain. I am terrified of the pain. I never know how some people can go out by jumping off bridges or setting themselves on fire. I want it to be peaceful when I die. Why do fuck am such a coward and why does killing yourself, have to be so hard? All I want to do is go to sleep and never wake up. That's all I ask for so I can end it all. Especially the thousand thoughts in my head. I have never been able to control it. Have you ever been in position where you just think and think constantly with no end. My life is so pathetic I now live in my head and i just can't get out of it.

I have so many  essays to do. I know i will fail them. I am just too distracted and useless to attempt it. But once I get my bad grades am going to do it.  fuck it am going out. It has to be done. Everyday I wake up knowing that these are my last days on earth. I should be trying to experience life. But it has never been good to me. So why should I try.  I honest to god can't wait. Its the only thing that reassures me. The only thing in this world that gives me comfort.
