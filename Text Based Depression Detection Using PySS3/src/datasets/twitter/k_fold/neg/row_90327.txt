Im alone and i want to kill myselfI dont have anyone to talk about this stuff so im just gonna to write some stuff here.
Im 17 and i feel like life is doomed and the only way out is to kill myself. I dont have a single friend and i dont remember having one in the past 2 years, i keep pushing people away for so long and now im all alone without anyone to talk while everyone around me have a bunch of people. Thinking about my future just give me more reasons to kill myself and i cant let myself worry about it because im sure i will die soon. I cant give a single shit about school because i hate it all and i get bullied just because im shy and dont talk to people. I didnt choose to be like this, i want to be fucking normal and have a group of friend like every one at my age, but instead i just stay in my room, smoke weed and cut myself. The only thing that still give me joy is to play video games but i get judged from my parents because its the only thing i do everyday. They dont know how i feel and i cant let them know cuz they would probably freak out and blame me. Everyday i wake up i just want to die more and more and im afraid that i cant do this forever. Sorry for the vent, i don't expect anyone to read this but i just needed to write something to clear my head off
