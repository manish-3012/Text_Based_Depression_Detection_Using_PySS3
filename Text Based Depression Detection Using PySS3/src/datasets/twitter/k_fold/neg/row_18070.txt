Am I being selfish?I have struggled with a lot over the past decade or so and it has really fucked me up. I have had to sit back as I watch people around me die off or abandon me. I have had to deal with heavy verbal/physical abuse within my family. I can't seem to pass in college anymore. I can't seem to do anything that can make enough money to move out and start a new life. I can't seem to look past any of it. I know for a fact I should be the one six feet under, not those who I had to say goodbye to. There are people who I have in my life who I know love me and who I have given my all to just to make sure they were happy just like they did me, but that doesn't really help me feel better in the long run when I remember those who have left me. For too long now, I have wanted to just simply end it all, whether it be a bullet, pills, car crash, etc., and I am at my breaking point. I have so much depression and anger that I literally feel physical pain every waking moment and I just want it to end. I feel as though I burden those around me, and I am tired of fighting my emotions and body. I am tired of being hated by my own flesh and blood. I am tired of trying so hard to make things better for myself, just to have everything end up horribly in the end anyway. Is it selfish to put me first for once and end it all if I am constantly fighting to get along day by day with the memory of every mistake and loss I have experienced? Is it selfish of me to want to not suffer anymore? I'm pretty sure I have made up my mind, but I just wanted to reach out one last time to see if this could help me.
