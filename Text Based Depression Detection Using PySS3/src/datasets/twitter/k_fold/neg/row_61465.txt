Giving myself until November 7th,2017Hello,

I am 31 years old and don't really care about life anymore.

I was in the Military until November 7th, 2014 and I was medically released because of some things which can't be cured. I really loved the Military because it made me feel like I belonged some where and it's like a whole new family. Well when I was released, everyone I knew from there took me off of Facebook and didn't want to hang out anymore. Due to the reason for myself to be medically released, I can't take on any actual "fun jobs", such as police or border security.

 Ever since then, things have just gotten worse. My health keeps getting worse and I'm fat again. My girlfriends dog recently passed away and I am actually sad about that. I also can't believe that the dog was the first person I ever cried for whom passed away. 

I also have a bunch of debt that I'm either going to have to go to jail for soon, or somehow win the lottery to pay it off or go bankrupt. I was trying to get a loan for the $25k that I owe but I don't have any assets so I can't get a loan. Yea, spending all your money on drinking and gaming will do that.

I am in the public service and the job is okay and the people are nice but I don't feel social after work. After work I just go home, get high and drunk and play video games until 9 and then go wake up at 5 and go to work and repeat.

I just keep thinking that if I didn't get injured in the Military, then I wouldn't be here. I didn't have any spending/drinking problems before and I was in very good shape.

I have been feeling very suicidal since May, 2017. I started working on the base where I was when in the Military and everyone just tells me to act like a civi and it's just so annoying. I can't do this anymore.

I already planned how I'm going to go and I'm only stopping if I get caught.
