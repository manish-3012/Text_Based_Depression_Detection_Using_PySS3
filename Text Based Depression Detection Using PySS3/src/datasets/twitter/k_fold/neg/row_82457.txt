I've wanted to kill myself for the past 8 years.I'm 20 years old. When I was 12 I tried drowning myself in my bathtub because my grades were slipping and I felt like I had no real friends. Since then I have never gotten a good night's sleep, I consider killing myself at least once a month, and I ended up dropping out of college because of my mental instability. I could reapply in the fall but I know that I'm just going to fall behind and drop out again due to being tired and apathetic all the time. I also have about $10k in loans to pay back from my first try.

Right now I work a minimum wage job with no real future. I haven't gone to work for the past few days and haven't even bothered calling out because I really don't give a shit anymore. I've probably already gotten fired because nobody there really gives a shit about me. I haven't showered or changed my clothes in a week, and my room is a fucking mess. Food doesn't taste good anymore, I can't remember things I did 5 minutes ago, and my entire body aches. Normally music makes me feel a little better but now that isn't even working anymore. I just want to climb on the roof of my house and jump off head first. I'm sick of feeling this way for no adequate reason.

I'm taking pills but they aren't working. I can't explain my problems to other people because I have social anxiety which causes me to compulsively lie about myself because I'm afraid of what people will think if they know how I really am. I told my mother that I tried killing myself when I was 16 and it absolutely broke her heart. Since then I've always told her "I'm fine" whenever she asks me if I'm feeling okay when it's the exact opposite. I feel like there's a billion things I could list here but my mind is so fatigued that I can't even think straight.
