Iâ€™m feeling suicidalIn 2013, I tried to kill myself.. I obviously did not succeed and I went to many years of therapy after that. Trying to find out what/why this was happening to me. Later in 2018.. I was diagnosed bipolar with mixed mania. Iâ€™m on meds but I also take something for my panic attacks.. and recently I ran out. I canâ€™t stop crying, I canâ€™t eat, I canâ€™t sleep, I feel nothing but hatred and disgust for myself. Iâ€™m 26 and I have never been happy. I know Iâ€™m ranting.. Iâ€™m just scared. Iâ€™m scared of what may happen.. my suicidal ideations are in full force.. I just donâ€™t wanna be here anymore. It all feels like a dream. I donâ€™t feel real. Or maybe I donâ€™t want to. If anyone has any advice, I will listen. Iâ€™m so tired and as much as I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.. I donâ€™t want to die.
