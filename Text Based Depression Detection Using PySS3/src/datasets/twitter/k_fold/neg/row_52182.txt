just so fucking tired of pretendingdont even know why im posting this here, im tired and 2 wine bottles deep at 11 pm n want to vent. Every single day i pretend to be fine, , hanging out with friends and family telling them that everything is good and that im searching for aj ob. when in reality i drink and bawl my eyes out every night, just lie in bed almost all day wishing i was dead .

i have no clue what happinees is supposed to feel like, i've hated my lfe since i was 13. yet i cant fucking bring myself to do anything about it., survival instinct is a bitch. i just dont know what the fuck to do, i just wnana leave everything that is my my "life", friends and family, i just can't deal with it. i wish they pushed me away so i didnt feel so much guilt
