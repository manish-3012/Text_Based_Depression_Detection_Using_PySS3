My first panic attack and strong suicidal thoughtsFriday has been the worst day I had in a while. 

Everything actually started on Thursday when I studied until midnight again. And after midnight I was very tired after a very terrible week, so I decided to go to sleep for half an hour and study more afterwards, but my luck was running true to form and I didn't hear my alarm and overslept. I woke up at 4:30 in the morning and when I realized what happend I started panicking. I tried to study, but cold sweat was pouring out of me, I was scared and crying by then and probably woke up everyone in the house. They were angry at me of course and started screaming at me so everything went from bad to worse. But as I was trying to study while freaking out my heart started to hurt I got scared shortly after my hands started tingling and I couldn't breathe. By the time it ended I had to go to school. The day just got worse afterwards. We wrote three tests that day and I was being tested verbally in front of my class on one subject I didn't have the time to study for. And all that time I was thinking how I was going to kill myself. If that's what my life is going to be for the next four years then I'm better of dead. My family would be hurt yes, but they would get over it, it's not like i'm important to them and I have no friends that would grieve for me. So i guess if my life will keep punching me in the gut like that I guess killing myself would be for the best for everyone.

I'm sorry I wasted your time by this post. But I wish everyone to have better day them me.
