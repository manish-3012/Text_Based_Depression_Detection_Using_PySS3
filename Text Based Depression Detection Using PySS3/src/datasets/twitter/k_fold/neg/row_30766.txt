Too depressed to go onI can't commit suicide though, so I'm slowly starving myself to death. I just wish things didn't have to be this way, but you have to play the cards you're dealt. I'm choosing to fold. There's really no point to posting this, I'm just so sick of keeping everything to myself. Don't mind me. I'm easy to ignore.
