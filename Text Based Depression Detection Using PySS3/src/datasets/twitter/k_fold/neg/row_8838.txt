I never thought it would get this bad.I feel stupid, I canâ€™t take this anymore.

The girl I dated for almost two years left me back in November. Itâ€™s made me so depressed. I didnâ€™t want it to get this bad, I was doing better. I canâ€™t live through this pain anymore, the unbearing thought. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore, I canâ€™t stand the pain. I just want to be gone
