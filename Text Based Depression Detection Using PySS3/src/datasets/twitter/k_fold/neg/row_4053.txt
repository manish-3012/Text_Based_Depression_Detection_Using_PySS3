Incapable of seeing anything further.Probably the weakest excuse, but my relationship of 4 years is starting to see push.  I've been abroad for 9mo, and it's been hell on me and her.

I'm now in a whirlpool of hanging on by the tips of my finger from absolute heart break.  I'm swimming in my own doubt.  I haven't been able to eat, my sleep cycle is an hour to violently wake up and try to fall back asleep.  It's been going on for a month. 

I've never felt such dread in my body.  I don't know if I want to go on without her.  I haven't felt this alone in a long time.. If ever.  It feels the older I get, the more accepting I come to the idea of ending my life.

I tried to talk to a counsilor, and it truthfully made me feel worse.
