Anyone think this sub does more harm than good? Or at the very least, needs way more moderation?All the time Iâ€™ll see posts of someone talking about how bad theyâ€™re doing. Then half the replies are â€œYeah Iâ€™m in the same boat so I canâ€™t help muchâ€ basically just affirming OPs feelings of suicide.

Or people will discuss how suicide is an OK thing to do, and even discuss methods. Which seems to directly contradict the rules. 

Lastly, to someone who is slightly suicidal (like myself), browsing this sub makes things worse. I feel like all of our negative energy bounces off each other and gets stronger lol. I had to unsubscribe and take a break from this sub, cuz I was commenting often and trying to help people, but it was making me feel worse. 

Iâ€™ve very rarely seen anything positive come from this sub. I think itâ€™s an echo chamber and a very dangerous one...
