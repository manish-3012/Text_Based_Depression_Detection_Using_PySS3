ImpossibleFeeling bad again.  I'm no victim of circumstances.  My life is good, better than most.  Everyone is so far away.  My friends don't know me... I can't keep going.  I struggle so hard just to pretend to be human, but no one knows or cares.  I need to walk away.  I believe in nothing... please someone end this for me.
