Exhausted.Today I'm more tired than I've ever been. Even the antidepressants have stopped helping me. I feel this indescribable pain that eats away at me each day. I don't know if I can go on much longer like this. Everything people see of me is just a facade. 

When I'm alone, I break down constantly. I think about different ways to die all the time. Truth be told, I've already picked the method. I think about writing my will, bequeathing certain possessions of mine to individual loved ones. Symbolic gestures, to remember happy times: a knife for one friend, my prized watches for another. A stuffed animal for my sister, my finances to my parents in hopes it improves their quality of life. 

I simply don't want to live anymore. I'm sick of being me. I'm sick of the pain I feel every second of every day. I just want to be gone.
