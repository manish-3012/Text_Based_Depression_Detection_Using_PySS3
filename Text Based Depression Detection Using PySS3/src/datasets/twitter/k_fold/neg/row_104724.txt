To be honest, I just can't find a reason to keep going.I'm ashamed of myself, I'm not bright at all.

There really isn't anything I'm good at, my parents, older siblings and brother in law are also ashamed of me, my life has no positive energy.

Hate to say it, but I'm not good with anybody, let alone making friends.

I've realized I'm just one of those guys who can't get girls.

Trust me, I've tried time and time again, it just doesn't work.

There's nothing for me to be glad about.

I honestly don't see any point to keep going.
