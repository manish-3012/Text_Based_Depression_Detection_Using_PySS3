I just don't see the point anymoreI just graduated high school and will be starting college in the fall. For awhile now, I've just felt either felt either really unhappy or empty on inside. I was bullied on and off throughout middle school, and throughout high school I've been reserved and anxious. As a result, I don't have any confidence in myself and my future despite having been accepted into a decent college. 

Throughout high school, i never really had any close friends, and to the "friends" i did have i was just the third wheel. This changed, however, about 2 months ago when I began talking to S. For once, I had actually felt santed. I had gone to middle school and had classes with S before, but i never really payed much attentiom to her. Somehow or another S and I began talking. S was the first other person that I really opened up any to, and it made me feel... happy and hopeful towards life for once.Â  I ended up driving S away through my indecisiveness and because I somehow took my anger out on her. Since then, I've gone back to just feeling empty and hopeless towards life. There's nothing I really find enjoyment or happiness in anymore and just want this to stop. I have thought about suicide on and of for a long time, but dont think i could do it. Sorry for the unorganized wall of text; I honestly don't even know why I'm posting this.
