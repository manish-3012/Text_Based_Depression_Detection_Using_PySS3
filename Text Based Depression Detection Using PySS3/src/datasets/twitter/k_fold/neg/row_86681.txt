I can't do this anymore.. possible trigger warningPosted in r/depression decided to post here too.

I'm a 21 year old transgender girl. I seek validation through sexual encounters with men on reddit. It's awesome, until it's over. Then I feel lonely.. and sad.. and... empty.. so I go looking for more.. But the thing is.. it's never enough.. and I've dug myself into this hole of despair, depression, and.. and loneliness.. imperfection..

I feel invalidated.. until I post on one of the subreddits, and guys answer, and validate the fact that people ***want*** me.. I don't know how much longer I can do this.. after it, I'm just a depressed mess.. because they always leave.. they never stay, they never keep saying how perfect, attractive, amazing I am.. But I just can't stop myself from seeking more.. It makes me want to fucking die.. it makes me want to kill myself, blow my brains out, throw myself in front of a train, etc. It sucks.
