in rough spotI just finished a call with my local suicide watch. The call helped, for now at least. I'm an alcoholic, I posted first time in r/stopdrinking about it and I was advised to post here as well. I should be happy with my life, but I'm not. I got a job, friends, I travel and I even met a great girl. Still, I'm depressed, and my medicine is alcohol. If it wasn't for my family, I would take my life already. I just don't want them to deal with my death. I don't want for them to think they did something wrong. I'll be attending an aa meeting tomorrow, and probably seek professional help too. I guess this is it, the call helped I think, I'm just venting I guess... I hope I'll go to sleep now, and tomorrow will be batter.
