How can therapy help?I'm not here to make a long drawn-out post about how bleak my worldview is. I've just noticed one common thread among the posts: the advice to seek counseling. My question is this: why is therapy so helpful? I don't understand how a stranger could be helpful or much less genuine when money is obviously their main motivation.
