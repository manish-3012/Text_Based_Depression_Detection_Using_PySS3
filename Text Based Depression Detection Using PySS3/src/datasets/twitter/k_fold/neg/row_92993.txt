Considering buying rope and hanging myself on the tree I see everytime I walkI (18f) got out of an almost six month ldr for quite a bit, and it still feels like yesterday. I made excuses for his behavior and I always blamed myself for it. Eventually I broke up with him and we cut ties. Some other things happened while we were together, I saw him once for a week and some things I just can't share happened. I feel so numb and hollow and i dissociate more than ever. I loved this person, and it's just the fact that they hurt me so bad and never truly loved me.
Strangely enough, I am in a new relationship, a new ldr. He knows how bad and broken I am and he truly makes sure I am okay and is healing with me. I don't like the distance because my ex lived in Oregon and this new guy lives in Washington. Everything still feels so raw for me and I know I have a lot to go through and I need to heal. I guess I'm still in dismay and I'm in pain that this ex didn't want the best for me and he wanted me to die, hell, I want to die. 
I can't take feeling the way i do, as some fucking sex object. I feel so lifeless, so dead, i can't fucking believe someone I loved so deeply hurt me so bad and I don't understand why this person I met and waited for a bit to be in a relationship with accepts me with open arms and wants me to heal from this fucking nightmare. But it's as if I can't escape. I'm so fucking caught up and i really wish I just ended things when I could of. Man, I really need to fucking go.
