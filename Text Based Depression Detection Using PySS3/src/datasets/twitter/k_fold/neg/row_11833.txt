Welp, tonight's not my nightI'm a college student and I've been living at home for over a year now and hate it, it's an hour commute both ways. For the past couple of weeks I've been talking with someone about subletting their place but dragging my feet but I was finally ready to sign tomorrow but he found someone else and now I have to start all over. And now that I feel shitty about that I feel shitty about everything. I don't have any friends, almost completely socially isolated, no job, shit grades, etc. It's a Friday night and I'm alone again and haven't left the house in over two days and I have no one to talk to. Nothing is worth it and I'm just a burden on others and especially a financial burden on my parents and I have nothing to look forward to.
