Girlfriend wants to kill herself. I can't deal with this anymore and need help.My girlfriend diagnosed with social anxiety when she was young, and depression around two or three years ago. Supporting her used to be easier, as she would listen to my advice or attempts to comfort her etc.

Recently, everything in her life has been getting very complicated. She wasn't accepted for courses she wanted, her parents have been harsher, she has few friends. She is on anti depression meds but she ran out and is too anxious to go back to the doctors.

Every night for months has been me staying up late to comfort her and make sure she is ok. She has had a history of self harm, and recently I feel like I've been less helpful and she's relapsed and started cutting again. Now she's convinced she will kill herself soon and I don't know what to do.

I can't help her all of the time and it is taking a toll on me as well. I'm the only one there for her so I feel a lot of second hand stress. The courses I'm doing are intensive and I have a lot of other commitments so everything feels like it is building up around me as well. I don't want her to die, it would ruin me. What can I do???
