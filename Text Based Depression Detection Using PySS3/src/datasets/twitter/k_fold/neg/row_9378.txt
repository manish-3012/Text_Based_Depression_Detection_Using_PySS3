I just had a long talk with my dad, a Vietnam vet, about what I, a 28 year old vet has to go through every fucking day, and I know now my life is fucked. When I went to my room, I realized something...Sometimes you gotta look at yourself and others like you and wonder what the hell led you to this point...and then you realize there's nothing you can do to change it because others have predestined you to be like the way you are. It's all part of a script as old as time itself. The rich conglomerates and political behemoths who they pay billions of dollars make the calls, while you, the pawns, follow their orders. You are the puppet and they are holding the strings. I wish I could cut myself from those strings and do my own damn thing for once, but it will never happen. I'm 28 years old and will never have the opportunity to be a father or a husband because of my PTSD and severe depression from the trauma I have experienced. As the people I grew up with grow older and start their own families, I will have nothing to show for my existence. My bloodline will end with me. I was a pawn in a political war and I will forever be chastised for it just like my father was.

I am sorry, my fellow citizens of the world, especially Iraq and the Middle East. I did not support the war in Iraq, but fighting in it made me party to the crime. I wish I could take back what I have done to affect countless people. I wish I never signed up for it. Please forgive me for my sins.
