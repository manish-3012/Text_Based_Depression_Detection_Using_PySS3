Iâ€™m about to turn 21 and I wish I could just kill myselfI guess I should start with the fact that Iâ€™m failing out of college. The only classes Iâ€™m any  good at are my art and painting classes, but I canâ€™t ever get a job or make enough money to support my self through art alone itâ€™s simply not realistic 

Iâ€™m too anxious to get a normal job, Iâ€™m afraid of answering the phone, or talking to people. the one real job I did work was as a dish washer and I hated it so much I ended up leaving after 2 weeks. 

On top of all of this is the fact that Iâ€™m trans (Male to female) and I hate my body so fucking much. Iâ€™ve been on cross sex hormones for 2 years now and I know I will never look or sound like a real woman. 

I know Iâ€™ll always be nothing more then a cross dressing freak show to most people. My body is too fucked to ever look female, I will always look and sound Male and I will always hate my body. 

I just want to kill myself but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m nothing more then a freak, a fuck up, and a waste of human life. 

I wish I could just change my sex and look like a normal female instead of this freak who will always look Male. I wish I could just get over my anxiety about people and not be so afraid of people. I wish I could just be dead already.
