Here againThis is the third time being on /r/SuicideWatch and I'm on my third throwaway.
I really don't know what to do I've been thinking about killing my self for two or three years now and I still haven't done it, some days it's all I think about.
I do this because I feel useless and destructive. All I'm able to do is break things and whenever I try to help I always mess up. 
I don't see suicide as a good or bad thing when it comes to my future, just a fast track to the end without hurting anyone else other than my closest family and myself.
