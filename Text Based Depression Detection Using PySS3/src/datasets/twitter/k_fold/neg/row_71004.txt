i am leaving something so they remember mei am going to record (regardless of how i sound) all 30ish songs ive created. on my death note i am going to request they publish my songs in an album called "this is where it ends." it's been my dream to release an album of my own, but everything is getting worse, im crying every night wishing i would die. i never feel like im good enough. i wanted to make my music with so many cool instruments, but life is dragging me down. the ceiling is my life, the ground is the noose. once a strong enough earthquake comes, the ceilling will fall to the floor. this is where it ends
