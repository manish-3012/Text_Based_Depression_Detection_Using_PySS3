Beginning to relapseI want to do it, but I don't see a way I could commit suicide without having to involve someone else. I don't want to jump in front of a car because then the driver would be traumatized and be legally responsible. I can't own a gun because I'm not old enough, I have been officially diagnosed with mood disorders, which prohibits me from owning a gun, and it would involve multiple people. Pills wouldn't be a viable method because it would cause me great pain and my family would have to watch. I have all these suicidal feelings because I don't think I have a chance at some happiness or contentness. I'm worthless. I'm stupid. 

I was attending a hospitalization program for depression and anxiety about two weeks ago, and I felt pretty good. But now I don't have that positive and hopeful environment, so I'm beginning to relapse.
