i think tonights the nightmy caretaker is still awake but they wont be for long. i definitely have a solid valid plan and i think tonights the night. the only person i truly have in my life is my caretaker, and they hate me. i cant leave the house. i have no friends to go see. my family has disowned me. my therapists are sick of my shit. everything would just be easier and cleaner if i killed myself. im sick of being a schizoaffective mess and i no longer fear death.
