Same thing everydayI wish there was somebody, but anxiety makes it so talking to people is impossible I'm 18 and still in high school sadly I've given up on that I live with my parents still and don't know where life will take me. I want to end my life every waking moment it's been the same for about 4 years and people always tell me it'll be okay or it'll change over time but those people could not handle me. I Fucking despise the people I live with who get angry at my depression.. what am I supposed to do when I have no friends and nothing soon I'm just gonna be homeless then that's it for men could give a shit less to what happens to me..
