I could right now.I could right now. And I've had to put the bottle of pills back twice today. It would be easy. 

No one is here. Shit, I'm not even home. I'm waiting to go into work. But I could do it and all of this would stop. Fuck everything right now. It's only getting worse. 

I'm either drunk or I want to die. There's no in between.
