I hate eatingA while ago I made a post where I talked about staying in my room for two days and just drinking ice tea for sustenance. I think it's becoming a pattern.

I just hate the entire feeling of eating, so I've been eating things with a lot of sugar so I can eat less, so I've only been eating chocolate and drinking fanta for the last four days. I'm sure there's a glaring flaw in this plan, but it's already become a habit.

Plus I don't need to go to the hall to eat with the people in my dorm, that's a nice plus.
