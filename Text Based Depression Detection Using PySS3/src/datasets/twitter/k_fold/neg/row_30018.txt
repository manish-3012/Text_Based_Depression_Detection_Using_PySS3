Hello, Suicide WatchI'm writing this here because I believe this subreddit is a great place to vent out your thoughts on depression or the thought of suicide. I've been here before under a different name, but never asked for help. So please read and ignore the bad grammar or punctuation mistakes you see. 

So where to begin... 

About two years ago my sister passed away from an aggressive form of cancer that was very rare for someone her age to get. She was strong, much stronger than me and had the mindset bound for success. And so here I am, thinking to myself "why not me"? I was angry to the point where I thought I was going to go insane. Because there I was, someone who neglected to chaise their dream and constantly fall under the umbrella of mental drought -- still standing. Why? Two months and several weeks of stress later she was gone and so was the remaining sense of happiness and security. I was the one who was supposed to let everyone down while she achieved dreams and opened doors. 

During the past two years not much has changed. I'm jobless, currently have no money and now kicked out from my parents house. So where do I go from here? Two options. Either take my own life and give up or work on changing myself completely to hopefully one day reach everything I set my mind out to. 

I'll make the decision tomorrow. 

Final thought: I almost feel like I shouldn't post this, but screw it. The mods can take it down if it isn't appropriate.
