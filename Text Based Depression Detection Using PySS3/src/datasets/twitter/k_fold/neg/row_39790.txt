Needing clarityI often say that my ex-husband is one of the best people Iâ€™ve ever known, and thatâ€™s true. I wouldnâ€™t have stayed so long with someone who was deliberately malicious. That said, here are some facts. 

For 18 years, I could never express unhappiness, especially if I said heâ€™d hurt me in any way. If I did, heâ€™d get angry and defensive because I was being cruel and unfair to him. 

Sometimes, he would acknowledge heâ€™d done something wrong and swear heâ€™d never do it again, but always did. The thing is, I never blamed him for that. Instead, I always felt guilty as hell for torturing him when I knew he couldnâ€™t change. It was my fault; I was always so unreasonable. 

Iâ€™m the one who wanted a divorce. He would have stayed with me forever because it really doesnâ€™t make any difference to him. I wanted more from life and I wanted to free him from having to care for me with my health problems. So, I said Iâ€™d just let him keep everything, which would make the divorce simple and inexpensive. The new suv, our house, all of our furniture, the bed I spent 5 years getting just right, almost everything but my clothing. Also, he wouldnâ€™t have to pay me alimony. And, he was okay with all of this, felt it was just. I felt like I deserved to be kicked out on the street with nothing, and so did he.

Things went very badly for me after I left and I ended up having to crawl back and beg for a place to stay, which is where I still am. I do have many health problems that make functioning as a normal adult challenging at times. Iâ€™m not proud of that. In fact, Iâ€™m deeply ashamed of myself for it. So, I try to do as much as possible to earn my stay. He takes it entirely for granted that I will do all of these things, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Iâ€™m basically his wife again except he no longer has the burden of pretending to care anything for me. And, we donâ€™t sleep in the same bed. Not that that matters as heâ€™s asexual. 

One day, I felt overwhelmed and made the mistake of saying he basically treats me like a slave. To which he replied, â€œyou get a place to sleep, donâ€™t you?â€

If I sit quietly and listen to him or simply agree, things are okay. If I try to talk about anything heâ€™s not explicitly interested in, he shuts me down and scoffs. 

Just a little while ago, I mentioned that our son said he was tired and wanted to sleep instead of getting up for dinner. I know that he often feels guilt over that, so I carefully mentioned it to my ex-husband, trying to make him aware so heâ€™d tread gently later. Instead, he says to me, â€œwell then, donâ€™t say things to him to make him feel that way.â€ I repeated him statement to him because I couldnâ€™t believe what heâ€™d just said and he confirmed it. So, I asked him if he felt that was something I did to our son often. He replied that, yes, thatâ€™s the kind of person I am. 

Iâ€™ve never been able to muster any kind of self-worth. Itâ€™s pretty clear in my interactions with others that I consider myself less-than. I certainly donâ€™t see myself as someone who actively shames my son. My ex-husband used to tell me that I was the only reason he was a decent father because I made him aware and helped him break bad habits heâ€™d learned from his own father. 

I donâ€™t know what to do with this bit of information. Honestly, I am completely devastated. I need some clarity because I canâ€™t tell anymore whatâ€™s real and what isnâ€™t. I used to think that I was better than I believed and Iâ€™ve tried so hard to see myself in a positive light. But, maybe Iâ€™m just not and I really do deserve all of this. 

For myself, I just want the pain to end. But, I donâ€™t feel like I deserve to live. People who know my whole story (or as much as I can bring myself to share) often tell me that Iâ€™m strong. But, I feel like strength is wasted on me. I contribute nothing to society. Iâ€™ve lost track of how many employment rejection letters Iâ€™ve received lately. I am desperately searching for a place to belong, where I can be useful. But, Iâ€™m running out of ideas and I donâ€™t know how much more of this I can take.
