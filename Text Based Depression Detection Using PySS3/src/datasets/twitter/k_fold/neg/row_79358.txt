Miserable, but can't morally justify suicideI'm mostly posting this because there is no one in real life I talk to about things that aren't surface deep. 

But I struggle with depression, and it obviously gets worse in the winter, and this year it hit me like a ton of bricks. Doing anything is difficult. I'll probably get fired soon since I no-call-no-show at least once a week nowadays. Last night was intense, after going to a friends birthday party and having the all-to-familiar feeling of only being physically present, and I decided I needed to get my life in order so that I can die. I've had constant thoughts of suicide for the past ten years, but the intensity can get dialed up in certain situations.  Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective), when I get home and think things though, I start to evaluate the morals of suicide. My brother committed suicide a few years ago, and whenever I think of killing myself, my mind goes back to the agony my mother felt after he died, and how much pain it would cause her to lose both of her children.

So instead I feel trapped. I have to stay alive until my mother dies, and at that time I'll be free to kill myself. I think I need some other motivator in my life, something intrinsic, for me to live with any quality of life, but I'm not there. 

Just throwing all this out here I guess, do with it what you will
