im a messtwo days ago my friend vented with me, she told me she was beginning to see suicide as the only answer. obviously i did what everyone would have done in my place and so i hypocritically become the biggest preacher against suicide. i say hypocritically not bc i dont think it's true, but bc i don't believe it's valid for me. i made her promise me she would try to stop thinking ab suicide and then she said goodnight and went to sleep.
i was talking with other ppl that night but out of nowhere i just stopped answering everyone and decided i wanted to have fun, in fact i felt my house to have fun, didn't last much. btw ive kinda run away before, therefore leaving my house at night wasn't a problem.
outside all i could think ab was how worthless i was, that i was a bad person and that no cared ab me. even though most of this things aren't true, i was feeling so empty that those lies my mind keep telling seemed true.
i decided i wanted to end my life and disappear. i wanted to do it in a clean and quick way but i had to walk a bit.
i saw a car stopping in front of me, i think he was just parking but i got scared and run in the opposite direction, i wanted to die not to be raped or kidnapped.
i went back to my house crying a lot and once i got there i the adrenaline was out of my system and i felt exhausted + i was feeling hopeless, i still wanted to do it, im tired of the pain.
sth weird happened, my body hasnt obeying my mind. idk another way to describe it other than autopilot. i was doing things mechanically and i couldn't control it. my mind was trapped in a quarantine, i could only observe. ig it was a way i found of protecting myself from ... well myself. when i wake up i was still feeling like this but now im fine.
im scared i will actually do it, i wasn't even feeling that bad on that night and out of nowhere i tried to do it. im scared it will happen again, i act on impulse a lot and that's going to kill me someday.
maybe i should do it, i can't take it anymore.
