I want to end it all.I'm a complete failure. Everything I touch, I make unhappy, my family, my fiancÃ©e, even my friends have all left me. I know a lot of people out there are in worse situations than me, and even if one person reads this, I just want to feel like someone has heard me because I've told very few people about my suicidal thoughts.

My fiancÃ©e only wants me because it's easy. Grow up, get married, get a house, have kids, die. She doesn't want me, she doesn't love me and she never wants intimacy, no no no the dishes are far more important than our relationship.

My family show love, but do nothing about it, I told my mom I feel down ever now and then (a lie I feel.depressed 80% of the time) and she pared it off. My dad and uncle are on anti depressants and I want some, I want to be happy. No. I want to be someone that isn't me, which isn't going to happen, so maby the best way out of my life is suicide, because things are not going to get easier.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I hope I haven't been a waste of time, though I probably have.
