I think I'm ready to die. [EXISTENTIAL CRISIS]I can't stop thinking about the paradox of free will, and I want to kill myself so I can stop thinking about it. Is there another way to remove individual thoughts from my brain?

edit: It says there is a comment on this post, but I guess the commenter must have been shadowbanned, because I can't see anything.
