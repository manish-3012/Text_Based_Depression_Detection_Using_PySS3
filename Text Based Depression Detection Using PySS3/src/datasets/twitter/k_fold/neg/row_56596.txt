I feel empty and I am really giving upI feel like I am just about to give up my fight against suicide. I just feel emotionless. I can't do anything to help bring myself out of depression. If my parents were not so one sided then that may help with it but I cannot do anything to change them. The only thing I got going for myself are my friends but they can only go so far.  We may laugh but when I am done texting them I go back to the same empty feeling. I want to talk to this one girl in my school but I get nervous and will probably make myself look bad. Anyway I think that killing myself is a lot easier than trying anymore. I have easy access to a gun and its just one painless gunshot away from not having deal with anything anymore.
