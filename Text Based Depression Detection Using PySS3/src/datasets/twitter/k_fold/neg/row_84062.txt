It's my birthday and I hate it!It just reminds me of all the things I could of done. I lost my job, I didn't start school, I'm single and I'm 24. I hate myself for it. All my friends graduated, have jobs and most of them got married. And I still live with my parents, I'm such a loser. And this day was another reminder of my life and I've spent most of it crying in my room. I hate this day, I hate my life and I hate myself. I cant remember the last time I wasn't thinking about suicide.
