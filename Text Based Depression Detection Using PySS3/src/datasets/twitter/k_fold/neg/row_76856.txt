Overwhelmed and ready to be done with life.I just don't know what else to do. My life right now is not what I envisioned for myself as a kid. Its so out of control and i dont feel that me living is benefiting anyone and only dragging my family down.  My "fiancÃ©" of 13 years is not working, unless you call staying at home and playing video games all day working. I work for cash at a sandwich shop. It isn't cutting the bills. Our power has been turned off because we owe so much, and the power we get comes from a generator in the back yard. I'm embarassed by this immensely.  Right now I have no medical for me and my kids, and because of this i can't refill my anti depression and anxiety meds. I have been taking them every other day to reserve them and keep myself from being completely psycho. Our lot payment is past due, we are going to court for eviction on the 11th and we don't have the money to pay this or the lawyer for bankruptcy (we have to do this because of the super high electric bill). I feel like a failure to my family and myself. If I had enough medication in my house to do any damage I would have taken it all by now. All I had is 150mg of vistaril. So at the worst case I will probably sleep well. FiancÃ© is sitting here playing video games while I sob uncontrollably typing this. I dont know what to do or who to turn to for help. Please, anyone, I hope someone can read this and tell me they have been here before or make me feel better. I'm ready to cross the road here to the highway and step in front of traffic... :,(
