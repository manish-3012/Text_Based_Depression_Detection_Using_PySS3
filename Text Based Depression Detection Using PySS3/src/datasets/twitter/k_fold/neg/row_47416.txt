Do you think sheâ€™ll send me in?I just texted my therapist to see if she can see me today and Iâ€™m wondering if sheâ€™s going to tell me to go to the hospital?? Iâ€™ve been having pretty serious suicidal thoughts for a couple of weeks, but I just developed a plan as of Thursday night and spent all day yesterday fighting going through with it or self harming in other ways. Iâ€™m willing to go into the hospital at this point, anything to get relief that doesnâ€™t involve hurting my mom, but I guess Iâ€™m wondering what you all think. I definitely donâ€™t feel safe in my own head right now...
