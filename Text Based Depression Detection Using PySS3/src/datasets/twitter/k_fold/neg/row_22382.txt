Can anyone, please, convince me?I don't feeling alone. I mean, in any way. I gotta friends, not much money, but i can live with It. I don't feel sad. I just see the life and i question : "what's the sense of It?"
I really don't see a purpose, but i recognize it's not okay, i know it's not healthy think that way, i know It Hurts. It's wrong. Anyways, i don't have enough courage to kill myself today, but i'm really thinking... Btw i'm from Brazil.
