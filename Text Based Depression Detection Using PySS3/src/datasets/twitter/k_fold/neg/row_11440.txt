â€œSlowly they realize failure is all that awaits them.â€My safe place has been breached. Given, it wasnâ€™t a very safe place to begin, but itâ€™s safer than the real world. I drowned myself in overwatch for the past month about. I felt safe there, and every win brought with it dopamine that my broken brain finds refuge in. With losses would come no feeling of pain, rather that there was nothing I could have done to change it.

Then today happened. I missed a critical play and 5 people got on voice comms and berated me. The enemy team made fun of my attempt too. 11 people bullied one. Thatâ€™s when I heard Moiraâ€™s voice line, the one in the title of this post. It broke me.

The year and 2 months of unemployment, the struggle to find something to help me get out of my abusive household, my schoolwork going by the wayside... itâ€™s all failures. And thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve really had. It goes back further. I failed classes in high school. I failed social interaction in middle school. I failed failed failed. Before that even! From preschool to first grade I was constantly trying to make friends, but the ones I made betrayed me.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. Am I destined to fail? Is failure all that awaits me? I hear Moiraâ€™s voice line, â€œMy keen analytical mind detects a pattern forming.â€ Mine does too. Based on the data, it would not be an outlandish assumption to say that success is out of my reach.

I know. The world isnâ€™t a fair place. But I play by the rules, never do anything to get myself an unfair advantage and I want it to stay that way. I donâ€™t cheat, I rarely lie (if I do itâ€™s something minor), and I do not steal.

So what am I to do? I see no logical explanation other than that I am in some way meant to fail. If there is a god or goddess or deity or great spirit or any combination of the four, what did I do to deserve this? A broken mind, a less than able body, and no chance of improvement? 

I connect my self worth to what I produce, or so Iâ€™m told. I guess thatâ€™s right. I cannot do art anymore as the result of hours of creation renders a piece unworthy of existence. Similarly I cannot write, as the words and syntax and flow are not satisfactory. 

If youâ€™ve believed in me, I am sorry. I produce another failure. I wish to fail no more. I will succeed at something, even if it kills me. The curtains draw closed, and the lights go dim. May my final crescendo be as beautiful as I thought the world to be! But alas! It shall end in a horrific crash.
