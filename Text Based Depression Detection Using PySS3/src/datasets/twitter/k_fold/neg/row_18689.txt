Everything just seems to get worseThe treatment I'm getting is shit

I'm falling behind in my studies because I can't cope

No one in irl is helping me

I want to find the highest point I can and jump but I'm scared that I might hurt someone

So I won't. I'll chicken out. Again. Like the failure I am
