So tired of everything.I just need someone to vent to. Everything is building up and I can't control it.

Last weekend my boyfriend said he was going to the beach with his dad. I find out when he got back that he actually went with his friends. But what makes it worse is that one of the friends is a girl im not quite comfortable with him being around much less staying with.

It honestly hurts so fucking bad being lied to. I just keep questioning everything. I feel alone in all of this shit.

I don't neccesarly want to die. I'm just so fucking exhausted of all of this shit.

It isn't the first lie. It's the biggest by far though. And every lie is involving her. I don't think he's cheating and i'm not leaving him. I just don't understand why all this is happening. 

I have no friends anymore, he's all I have. I'm fucking scared of everything, especially myself. I've reduced to self harm. It's pathetic.
