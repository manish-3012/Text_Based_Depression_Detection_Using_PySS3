Being followed?I've posted here before, so somewhere in my post history, you'll find my story. Lately I've had this weird feeling like someone is out there following me and watching me, but when I bring it up, everyone brushes it off, saying its my meds. My psychiatrist has asked if I felt like someone was out to get me, but this was before this feeling, so at the time it was a no. I'm not really sure what to do, because I honestly feel like someone is out there.
