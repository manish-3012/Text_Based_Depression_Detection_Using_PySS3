I got the love of my life pregnant and she ended thingsI'm 17 years old and I Just found out that my girlfriend is pregnant. Long story short I've been struggling with depression and self harm for a while now and she knows about it and understands. But lately I've been getting worse and worse and I've just been hurting her more and more with this. But today the line was crossed I guess, she found out she is pregnant and she left me. I've been cutting my self for a while now but this is the first time I tried to end it. But I couldn't cut myself deep enough even though I wanted to. I have a bottle of pills and I think I'm going to try again with those. I just don't see a point in going on anymore.
