I've done terrible things, and I deserve a terrible end.First of all, if I'm in the wrong sub I'd like to apologize. I did a search for "suicide" and this is all I found. 

I'm 33 years old and my entire life I've done nothing but bad. I've been in prison twice and am currently on parole for the next 14 years. I've hurt everyone I have ever cared about, ruined countless lives and had no remorse. Since my incarceration I have learned a lot, and I'm not the person I used to be. I was a predator. I hunted children and did unspeakable things. Thinking of my past sickens me to my stomach, and I see no reason to go on from here.

I have no family that will talk to me, no friends, and no happiness. I still have the urges from time to time, and I will act again. I can feel it. If I take my life now, I can't hurt anybody else. This is the way it was always meant to be. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. I'm not looking to be told that I can change myself for the better. I know what I've done, and this life I was given has been thrown away by my own selfish actions. I wish I could go back to when I was young. I have an amazing mother, a supportive father and a brother who I never would have thought would give up on me. I want to go back to the days where I was young and free, to where I had no regrets. I want to take back everything I have done.

There's nothing left that I can say, so I will lay here in my pool of tears and reminisce on my golden days. The one promise I made myself when I got out of prison was that I'd stop drinking, and here I am with a bottle of tequila and juice. Thank you for reading, and please hold the flaming, because trust me, I know.
