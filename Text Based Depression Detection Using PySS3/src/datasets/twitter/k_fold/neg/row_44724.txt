Community college making me miserableCommunity college feels more like high school than like college. Nobody wants to be friends, the classes are boring, the campus provides no freedom, and I don't see an associate's degree helping me get a job. I feel like my mom has a fetish community college and is making me attend with no interest in my job prospects. Community college is making me want to die.
