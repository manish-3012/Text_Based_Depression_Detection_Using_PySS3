I'm too weak for thisI just want to die. I don't see why I should be made to keep on dragging myself through life's challenges when I'm a lazy fuck who just wants the easy way out.
Things do get better, I'm aware of that, but then they just go back downhill eventually and I'm fed up of that inevitability.
I want to be killed, find myself in a dangerous situation, have something happen that doesn't scream 'she killed herself' but says 'she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, noone could have seen that coming'. Maybe that would make it the tiniest bit easier.
