everything is building up and I see only one outcomePretty much just done with everything. My house is a mess because the cats have shit all over the floor and I have no motivation to clean it. I can't use the kitchen because the dishes have piled up. I can't even navigate my bedroom because of all of the trash and clutter. And I can't bring myself to fix a goddamned thing .

I love my boyfriend, but he's just as depressed as - if not more than - me. Between the two of us we have $6. And that's it. He just got moved from full time to part time, also, so our income is about to drop even lower. I work 12 hour shifts and still can't keep up. 

I'm 20, have 3 felonies, no college education, and an assload of mental diagnoses. I just want to die because my life is literally shit. I don't go a day without thinking of the shit I've dealt with.

I was molested as a kid, raped as a teenager, and was a felon by 19. People keep telling me how strong I am and how much courage I have. I'm only alive out of guilt. How much it would hurt my family, who I've already successfully destroyed, btw. My boyfriend has already told me he couldn't handle it if he came home to find I'd killed myself. But that's what I want. I tried when I was 16...took pills and drove into incoming traffic. I wouldn't do that again, I don't want anyone else to get hurt. I just want it to be over. I don't want any more bills. I don't want my debt. I don't want this dumpy ass house and sub-par existence.

I want a hole in my head. 

It's occurred to me that I would benefit from a lobotomy. And that's about when I realized how bad this all is. My insurance doesn't cover counselling, though. Well, it does, but only 3 visits "per incident". And I can't afford past that. So fuck me, right? So that's where I'm at. I'm ready to go. But feel trapped here. Fucking kill me.
