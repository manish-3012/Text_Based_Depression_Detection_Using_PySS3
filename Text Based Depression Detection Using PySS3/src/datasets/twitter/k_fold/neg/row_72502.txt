I (17F) am only alive because of my parents.Based on the title youâ€™d think itâ€™s a good story but itâ€™s not. I have different plans to kill my self but I donâ€™t act upon them because Iâ€™m an only child and I couldnâ€™t leave my parents like that. I went to therapy but they said since I donâ€™t have any current plan to actually kill myself it doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™ve been so sad recently and itâ€™s just getting worse. Iâ€™ve thought about getting myself hurt really badly so that I can spend a couple of months or even a year in hospital to see how badly it affects my parents. Anythingâ€™s better than what I have now.
