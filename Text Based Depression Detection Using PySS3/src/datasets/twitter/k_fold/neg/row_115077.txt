Last week I wrote my noteLost my job in November. On unemployment for the last few months till my ex boss filed an appeal against me. Unemployment got taken away. I've been depressed for years but this is the worst it has been in a long time. No money in my bank. Last week, i wrote my note in my car after a job interview. Decided to keep going instead of renting a hotel room with the last few dollars i had and hanging myself there. Figured it would be easier on my family if i did it away from home. Got the job but had to turn it down because I have no money to get to work. Last night i got called too hard to handle by my SO. This morning we got into a petty argument but what he said last night is still running through my mind. This morning I got told to go to hell by my mother. If no one wants me around then why am I still here? The note is written. I just need the belt.
