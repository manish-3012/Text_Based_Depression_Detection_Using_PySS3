itâ€™s all over...I did it, I made it to where I wanted to. And thatâ€™s good enough for me... I can be at peace finally knowing and haunting the hundreds of people that have hurt me. I can finally show what a breaking point is and that is suicide. Iâ€™ve made it 13 years and Iâ€™m done. I donâ€™t wanna go any further because itâ€™s already hard enough. And god knows how much harder itâ€™ll get I mean hey itâ€™s already gotten to the point of cutting almost daily and crying. I mean how much more is a human supposed to take? Iâ€™ve reached my place. The thought of just being peaceful is so comfortably warm. Iâ€™m so sick of being the one with no life so Iâ€™m going to take that life and shove it right into the ground. Iâ€™ve had a good run. Guess my cards werenâ€™t played right nor was I dealt a good hand... itâ€™s time for me to go now before itâ€™s too late. Iâ€™ve lost everything so whatâ€™s this wouldnâ€™t affect anyone anyways. Iâ€™m sorry to the people I hurt. Iâ€™m sorry I was brought into this world. Itâ€™s a long ride but you get to decide how long it really is and my stop is here. Love yourself, never give up, Iâ€™m sorry.
