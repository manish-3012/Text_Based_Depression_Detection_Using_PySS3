couldnt even spell the subreddit name rightthere isnt a moment that goes by where i dont think of just ending it.  i dont really want to participate in this shitty rigamarole anymore. i dont know why i keep going on. i think its mostly so i dont upset those close to me, but if i really believed that nothing mattered then i could do something about it. during a sorrowful bit i made a date to end it all, roughly two months away. i hope for good things, but i also hope that i have the courage to bow out of this shit i hate. im not mature enough to keep it up. im weak. let people who have the courage to fight on continue with this shit.
