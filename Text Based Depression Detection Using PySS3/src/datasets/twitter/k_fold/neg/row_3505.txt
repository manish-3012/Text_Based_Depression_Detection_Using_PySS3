Why are there people who think that ONLY THEY deserve to be depressed,sad,suicidal, etc.?I was talking with my mother the other day and i was telling her that i am sad, that i feel trapped here and many more things. She responded with something like "you had everything, you're ungrateful. My parents never loved me but me and your dad did love *YOU*. If **YOU** are sad, then what am **I** supposed to be?" 

A week ago i told her that i was thinking about suicide. She didn't even respond to that and she kept on talking to me about how "love" is what is missing (from my boyfriend) and that she KNOWS that i don't love him and he doesn't love me and stuff like that (not true). Her parents neglected her and she had an awful childhood. I know that. But my parents neglected me too. She was verbally abusive, i have talked to her about that AND SHE DOES IT STILL. 

**(Trigger Warning)**

3 days ago a woman in my area commited suicide. I told her about that and she was like "she is stupid. she should have taken care of herself. How was she sad exactly? What could have possibly happened to her that made her "sad"? (she doesn't even recognize depression as a serious matter) 

My boyfriend knows how many times i have thoroughly planned my own suicide.He knows. And i never let him inform my mother because she will scream in my face and curse at me and i KNOW that i will instantly jump off my balcony if she does this. I don't know how to make her realize..

(btw i found the courage and tomorrow i will call my local clinic for a therapy session)
