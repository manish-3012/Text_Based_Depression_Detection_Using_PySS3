Give me a reason, oh my fucking god just give me oneI've made so many accounts, so many posts, so many calls to the hotline, tried to call my therapist, and oh my god they say if they can't hear you scream even louder and I've tried everything today. Too late for my therapist, hotline guy was inaudible and I was inaudible from sobbing too hard for them to help, so they hung on me. No friends or family members to speak to, meds are fucking useless. Been suicidal for fucking years, 2 attempts this past year, depressed for god fucking knows because does happiness even exist, please just give me one reason not to put this glock in my head, nothing else to impart.
