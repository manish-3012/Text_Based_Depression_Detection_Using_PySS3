Need help coping with my current suicidal thoughtsI had trouble driving home since I felt overwhelmed with emotion. I hardly could see or focus on the road. These thoughts are crippling anything I can do. The thoughts are just obsessive and destructive. I am afraid for my own sanity to stay safe. 

Before anyone suggests it, hospitalization is absolutely not an option. I will not even discuss it. I just need someone to talk to, or just hear me out
