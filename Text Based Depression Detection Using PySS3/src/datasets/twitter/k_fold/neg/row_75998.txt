I'm sorry.I'm sorry mom. I'm sorry dad. I'm sorry Alex. I'm sorry to everyone who has ever loved me. I just can't do this anymore. 

I've tried to tell you how miserable I am but I don't think you ever truly understood. I'm sorry you wasted your time, money, resources and emotion on someone who ended up being a failed human being.
