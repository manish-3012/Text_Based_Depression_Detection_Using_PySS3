itâ€™s midnight and i was scrolling through youtubeand i found this video, not really of interest but in the thumbnail there was a cute guy. now iâ€™m quietly sobbing in my room, ashamed that something so simple as a picture of a cute person can me break down, knowing iâ€™ll be them or have someone like them. iâ€™m not attractive inside or out, iâ€™ve had one failed relationship and it was online and my fault it didnâ€™t work out and iâ€™m just tired of feeling like a complete screw-up who isnâ€™t worth anything. my meds arenâ€™t working and iâ€™m debating on whether or not i should just take some more. 

i just needed to vent a bit, thanks to anyone who listens.
