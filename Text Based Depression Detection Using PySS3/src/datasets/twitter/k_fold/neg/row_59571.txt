I can't feel anymore and I'm withdrawing from everyone I know.I feel like my life stopped and I'm just a husk of past mistakes. Everything I ever did is catching up to me. I've hurt people before and I'm reliving that mistake every night. Every embarrassing thing I ever did is eating me. I remember the lies I've told when I was a child. I remember promises I made which I deliberately broke.

Up until recently, I thought I was apathetic. I did bad things without second thought, without remorse. I was a bully and a liar. I've manipulated people and was proud of it.

I stopped socializing to prevent myself from making any more mistakes. I withdrew from the people I know for the mistakes I had already done. I had such good friends who constantly remind me that they love me. I can't see why. I don't understand why. I'm a bad person. I have always been the type to hold a grudge and would hurt innocent people in a fit of rage.

Even before I realized I was bad, I was already suicidal but there's always that fear of dying. Now that I see what kind of person I am, it's easier. I just can't do it yet. I think my mistakes are calling to be corrected.
