If things don't work out...I'm graduating college in June, but only borderline passing a class because it's so difficult. I have a job offer lined up and fear that I'll lose my offer if I fail this class, and my entire career will be over as a result. On top of this I have a difficult time making friends and haven't had a girlfriend yet at 23, which is pretty fucking sad. If I fail this class it might just be the straw that breaks the camel's back, and I don't even want to imagine life after this happens. Help?
