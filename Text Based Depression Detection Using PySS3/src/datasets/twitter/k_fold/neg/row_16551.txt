I'm scared.I'm scared out of my mind that I might hurt myself. My mother is driving me insane, she keeps breaking her promises and it just hurts so much, plus she lets her best friend put me down everyday. It probably sounds stupid and childish of me. 
The only person who truly loves me is over 200 miles away, and it just drives me insane. 
I see a therapist, but I don't think its helping, I'm on meds, but who knows if those are helping.
