Sometimes I wonder why I was born...I'm 22 years old, and I tired of failing in most of the things I've ever done in my life...

I remember my younger days, when people used to tell me that I had so much positivity that it was contagious. I never expected to spend the first four years of my adulthood like this.

I let my fear control me, I let many bridges die or wither away, I became a very toxic and negative person, and pretty much I've lost most of the dreams and ideals I once had.

I just wanted a father who would love me, I wanted a dad whom I could go camping, or fishing or any stuff like that... But instead I got a womanizer who abandoned my mother and my family after she gave 25 years of her life to him, 25 years of support and love, gone to nothing.

It didn't help that I haven't been able to move on from the old days... I was bullied for years, and that crippled my confidence and self-esteem, turning me into a machine of sorts.

And the final nail in the coffin... I let a misdiagnosis destroy the happiness I never knew I had. It wasn't 100% perfect but, I had bonds with people, I had a little more confidence and I believed I was doing the right thing... But then I found out I was wrong.

After I told people about it, everything changed. I started to get treated with pity, with condescendence, or as if I were a child or snowflake. But it was my fault, had I kept my mouth about it, none of this would've happened.

I've been told that if I don't change, I'll probably end up dying alone at my house, and that society will leave me behind if I'm still the same.

I know I'm a very hypocritical person. I wanted people to be honest with me, yet I also had condescending behaviors to others, there were times I said something to avoid problems or confrontations, or when I forgot promises, or when I isolated and distanced myself from others... And I could go on and on...

Just being positive alone won't fix anything, because... Most people think I'm disabled when I'm not.

That misdiagnosis was of Asperger's, and I don't know what to do or say... I feel like I lied to others when I told them about that, I feel like a worthless liar and coward...

I don't think I can keep going on like this... I don't want people to treat me like that anymore...

I don't want to die, I just want to stop suffering, to have a new chance to fix everything, but I don't think I'll be able to endure the years to come...

If I will probably die alone, without marrying or without someone to bury me then... Why keep waiting 60-70 years?

I love my family and friends despite everything, they're the reason I'm still sane but... Even with that love, I don't know what to do to keep going on...

That's why I wish I was never born... My mom could've married a better man, she could have birthed a better person, someone who would be working right now instead of being a leech to the family, someone who would not have flunked out from their first career, someone who would not have made a fool of itself in front of others, someone more mature and grounded to reality and so on...

I hate the existence I have right now, I hate it so much... But, do I have the right to hate it?

I'm the one who put himself in this situation so... I guess I have to endure it for the sake of others.
