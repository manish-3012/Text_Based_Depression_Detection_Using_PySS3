I can't be perfect.I don't know how. I don't know why every single thing I do has to be criticized down to the decimal point. I went in just trying to do well. I can't take this sort of pressure anymore - I don't understand why I can't just be acceptably wrong or imperfect. Why do people have such high expectations, such high standards for what's acceptable. I tried to just be good, but it was never good enough for any of you. Goodbye, harsh world. You're imperfect, but you decided that I can't be. And for that, you're not worth living in anymore. I'm sorry.
