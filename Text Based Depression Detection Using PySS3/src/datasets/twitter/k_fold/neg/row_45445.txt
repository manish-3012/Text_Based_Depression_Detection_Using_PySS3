I need advice for my friend, please.I have a close (ten years) online friend. He has always suffered depression but the last few months it has gotten worse and worse and now he talks about suicide daily. He is 100% serious. I'm in a different country (he's in the US) and I don't know his address. He doesn't want to call a suicide line or anything like that. Is there anything I can do, at all? If you need more detail, just ask.
