No more painPlease, any one of you. Tell me how to diee

Please, I'm begging you

I don't want help, I don't want the bullshit cheer ups

I just want to die

No more pain, I have enough, no more pain, I don't want this..

I don't chose this

Am i wrong?  What did I do wrong?  If I'm wrong, why didn't you just kill me

I'm sorry for all the mistakes, I'm truly sorry. Just let me die

I don't want this

I tried everything, I can't kill myself 

In can't jump off the building, I wake up 3 in the morning everyone day just so I can jump

But I can't 

I hang myself, couldn't push my legs

I cut my wrist, never deep enough 

I drank the bleach the pills, vomited all over

I don't want to live, yet I can't 

I'm a coward

Please tell me how to diee without me interfering 

I can't cry like this all the time

I can't feel like

I hate it

Because I know it will never end.

It should end by now

15 years 

15 fucking years 

My mind told me there's nothing for me

I will never find peace or happiness 

My mind's always right 

Gonna hang myself, I know I won't die

Pussy, scared shitless when running out of breath 

But I'm gonna try

Please someone kill me

If you care, anyone, please take this pain away

No more, I don't want more, just kill me
