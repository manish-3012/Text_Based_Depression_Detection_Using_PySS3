I feel crazyI'm 18. I feel so fucking old, and I hate it. I hate that people marginalize any experience that I've had, because of my age.

I'm 18, and I'm a 2 time college dropout. Not a lot of people can say tha, because not a lot of people are as dumb as I can be. The first time around, I was 16, and didn't realize how expensive it was going to be, or how little my parents actually cared about my education. I understand that I'm not owed anything, it's just really hard to watch so many people have that large a sum of money just handed to them, and it makes me wonder, why wasn't I born into one of those fucking families? I couldn't handle working and attending school, because it was just too depressing, and felt like I'd never really catch up to those that didn't have to work.

Second time around, I'm at a shitty community college because it's all I can afford, and it's a little easier, because my new job pays better, and it's a more pleasent environment. Of course something has to go wrong, though, so my adoptive father decides that since my mom is out of town, why not start molesting me? I immediately tell my family, and the response is overwhelmingly negative. It had to be me that provoked him, right? I always dress like a slut, so how is he supposed to control himself, if it did REALLY happen? Fucking everyone accused me of lying, and I realized that they've never really liked me that much, and this was the perfect opportunity to finally get rid of me. I know I shouldn't have told anyone, and school would've been a good distraction until I turned 18, but I wasn't that smart, so I dropped out, and moved.

I work my ass off for everything I have. I have a roof over my head, I'm not starving, and I have clothes on my back. It's still a fucking chore to get out of bed in the morning, because I still feel so useless. Even with how far I've come in the past few months, I'm still fighting an uphill battle. I live in a "college town," now, simply because it's cheap, and I'm still close to my sister, the only one who believes me. I meet students every day, and all of them are so fucking condescending. They can't comprehend why anyone wouldn't be a student, because they can't see beyond their own experiences.

It's getting to be too difficult to fake being okay everyday. I keep having flashbacks, and I feel like it's my fault that it keeps happening, and I can't make it stop.

I wish I could just get on with my life, and I know I'm being immature by constantly thinking about it, but I can't stop.

Life doesn't feel worth living right now. I feel like too broken of a person. I'm 18, and I'm already so fucking bitter about too many things. I'm tired. I just want all of my thoughts to stop. I want to not exist anymore.

I don't know if I have enough energy to continue living. I don't know if it would really bother anyone if I didn't exist anymore. I'm just too scared.
