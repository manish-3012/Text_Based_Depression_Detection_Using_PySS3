I'm lucid and death feels very reasonable to meUnlike a lot of folks here, I'm not all angsty over this decision. I've come to terms with it and I'm as clear headed as one possibly could be. Is it not possible for this to be a rational choice?

I'm not going to say for sure that I'm going to off myself, I just don't know. But I do have a plan, a date, and the means to do it. I've written my will and got my financial affairs in order. From everything I know, that makes me high risk. I'd have to agree.

In my head, I can with ease replay every humiliation, every mis-step, and every mis-calculation of my life. When I think about it, it makes me want to die.

Time will tell.
