Why do we ask for things that we know will hurt us?Last night, I was catching up with an old friend. She is extremely close with my ex. We broke up about a month ago now. I stayed away from asking things about her, but I got curious later on and was digging for answers I didn't need to know. My friend does not have a poker face, but when I ask certain questions, you can get the answer without words. And, I sure did. 

My last relationship was two and a half years long, and it took her less than a few weeks to go sleep around just like she used to before we were together(learned over the relationship how she used to be). I had been keeping it together for a while since the breakup, working on myself, then last night it all fell apart. I don't know why I am so torn up about it. I had immediate suicidal thoughts. Tears down my face. I couldn't keep feeling hurt. Ended up at home drinking, cutting and the finally in bed at 430am. I did have support around me. Beyond lucky for a friend that stayed up to text me throughout. But, I cannot escape the thoughts. They barate my mind.

I don't blame my ex for moving on quickly. I don't blame my friend for giving me the answers I looked for. It was shitty of me to put her in that situation and ask the questions. 

I just don't know of I can keep going like this. It hurts. Every time I feel like I can stand on my own, the rug is pulled from under me. And I have no one to blame, but myself. Why do we ask for things we know will hurt us? I want to be better, stronger, but I feel so lost. I can't do this again.
