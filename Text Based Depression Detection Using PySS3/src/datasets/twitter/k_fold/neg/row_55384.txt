Not cut out for thisBeing stuck with my daughter (4mo) 24/7 made me realize Iâ€™m a really detached parent. I donâ€™t think I could ever give her what she deserves and honestly, I wouldnâ€™t want me as mother so why would she. I canâ€™t set aside my depression or enjoy her smiles like I used to or even find the patience to comfort her when sheâ€™s colic. at least sheâ€™s young enough that she wonâ€™t remember me if I died.
