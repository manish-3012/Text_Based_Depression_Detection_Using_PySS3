Im super desperate to get out there and live a life but Iâ€™m stuck in my house because Iâ€™m ugly...I'm a 6 foot tall male lanky, slim build...aged 27. Some say I look younger others say I don't. I'm a virgin and never kissed, and it used tinder and no matches (pics below) because I put it down to only chiseled 10/10 hunks get laid. I'd love to be at least a little attractive and dress up nice and go out on nights out with friends and meet people, but in ugly so I'll just get humiliated and ridiculed. My friends go out and at times take girls home etc. It's not all about that, but going dry does have its toll on me. the worst is when a girl thinks I'm checking her out like at work etc and gives me a snotty look like 'ewwww no', but if a good looking guy did the same thing? different story. Iv cried so many times, imagining women Iv met in professional capacities that Iv liked and that they're probably getting banged by at least 9/10s. Seeing myself in reflections just makes me want to go home and stay there. It's ok for girls who can put makeup on and fake tan, then again all sorts of girls get liked, but men don't have that option, men need to be the 6,3" channing Tatum hunk muscles 6 packs abs to get laid, or you will die alone and unloved. I wish I could just die, constant heartache Is too much recently. The only easing of the pain is to drink alot of scotch and smoke weed. Anyways rant over. Thanks for reading. 

Edit; pics are on my account history if it helps
