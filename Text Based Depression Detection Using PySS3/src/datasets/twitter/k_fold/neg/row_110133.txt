I'm finally ready to give up.I keep trying to improve upon myself, but truthfully I don't know where to go from here. I keep fucking things up, and it makes those around me hate me further and further.

I want to just stop existing. I am so tired of being a disappointment to those around me.

I'm exhausted. Just tired of the fight. Please let me go and not wake up.
