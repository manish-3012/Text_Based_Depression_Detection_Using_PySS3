What if itâ€™s just a logical decision?I donâ€™t really want to kill myself. Itâ€™s a messy prospect and (fortunately) there are a lot of people who care about me that I would never want to hurt. But Iâ€™m really done. This life is not for me. If I could function, with the way that I am, I think Iâ€™m strong enough that I could hold off until I die naturally. But I am realizing more and more just how totally incapable I am of taking care of myself. Iâ€™m both completely miserable and terribly ineffectual. All I hear about from people is how smart I am, but I cannot hide how much I absolutely despise working. Even as I write this, I can hear the voices. 

&gt;Spoiled brat!â€
&gt;â€Lazy!â€
&gt;â€You were handed everything on a silver platter!â€

Well I am and I was. I have really tried. No matter what I do I will always fail because of my inborn laziness. Iâ€™ve got a really sweet programming gig. Just canâ€™t really impress anyone. Iâ€™ve got 30 days to prove to them Iâ€™m worth keeping. I will try, hard, because I have nothing else. But theyâ€™ll fire me anyway because Iâ€™m a failure. 5 years in college for no reason. As I sit here thinking to myself â€œwhat am I going to do?â€ I realize that there isnâ€™t anything. I have a cushy, 75k desk job. Iâ€™m never going to do better. And yet Iâ€™m still miserable, it feels like being in jail for 40 hours a week. Just more responsibilities. I canâ€™t focus on something I despise so much. And it doesnâ€™t actually get better.

I always end up writing these stream of consciousness posts that donâ€™t resolve so Iâ€™m just gonna cut myself off. TLDR, I absolutely hate and suck at the career path I chose and everything else is worse. At that point Iâ€™m just a burden to society. Doesnâ€™t that mean suicide is just a logical choice?
