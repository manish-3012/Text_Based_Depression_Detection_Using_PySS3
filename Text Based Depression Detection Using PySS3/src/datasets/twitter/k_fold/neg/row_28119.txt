Thoughts won't go awayFirst of all I'm not entirely sure this goes here... I'm definitely having my fair share of suicidal thoughts right now but I'm a lot closer to hurting myself. I checked over at self harm, but that seems like a community where they sorta support that kind of thing.. obviously, I don't WANT to do it, or else I wouldn't be typing this, I'd be doing it. But I also really really want to do it. My grades have gone to shit and I feel like a fucking idiot about it, but my problem with it is more so that if I get shit grades then I won't get into a good college and I won't get a good job and then I'll be fucked for life. I feel like a fat fuck, and no one will like me, so I'll be fucked for life. The best part about that last thing is I'm like 6"4 and 150ish pounds. The point is, I feel like I deserve to be in pain because I'm shit and I should just give up. 
I'm terrified of going to school tomorrow because my classmates are going to give a presentation on schizophrenia and that's basically my biggest fear. My entire life, anytime I do anything, my family tells me that's something my schizophrenic uncle did. One time I jokingly said to my mom, "you can't tell the future king of America what to do" and she got dead serious and said my uncle said that to her when he started losing it. Point is, we're practically the same person, and now he lives off 2000 dollars a month that the government gives him and he can't get a job and he lives in a shitty apartment complex and if that's what's destined for me, why the fucking fuck am I putting myself through the balls to the wall hard advanced classes? I'm having a hard time seeing why I shouldn't hurt myself is all, I guess.
