Anterior Pelvic Tilt ruining my life.. need help.I am extremely depressed.  I am having a hard time functioning.  I have spent the last few years eating healthy, exercising, but I suffer from what I think might be APT (anterior pelvic tilt).  Which means I'm often doing more harm than helping my body when I exercise.  I really need some help to correct this because I can't afford a doctor or physical therapist, and probably not a personal trainer too.

I know this sounds like a trivial reason to be completely devastated over, but it affects my entire life.  I'm sure my poor self esteem and even fear to socialize and go out in public are due to the fact that I feel deformed, and though I'm strong and virtually limitless endurance, my balance and core is completely dysfunctional.

I would like some help.  I have researched many sites, and trying different exercises, sitting and sleeping patterns recently.. but I need a mentor, therapist, trainer.. or maybe someone who's fixed it themselves to help me.  I don't know what else to do.. I will repay you when I'm well again.  Any advice/criticism is appreciated.
