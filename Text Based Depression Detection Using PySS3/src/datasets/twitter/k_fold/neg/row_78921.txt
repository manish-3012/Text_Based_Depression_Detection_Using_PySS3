Suicide positive?For some reason it seems like a lot of the comments on posts are really suicide positive, not actively encouraging people to do it but not exactly telling them not to.

The comments that actually do discourage people are super downvoted too, which is all super alarming.

Iâ€™m not exactly sure how to articulate this, but this is super bad! Like instead of this sub being about helping people, itâ€™s just people talking to each other about how much they wanna kill themselves and why and how theyâ€™ll do it.

I get that talking to this with someone whos going through the same can provide solidarity and solisce, but it seems kinda counter productive at this volume
