I am not okayI don't know what to do. I'm scared. I'm alone. I'm too afraid to talk to anyone. Every day feels like I'm being smothered. I can't breathe. I don't want to be alive anymore. Every time I wake up, I feel disappointment. I feel like I'm moving a million miles an hour in no particular direction and the only end I can see is my suicide. Not college. Not family. All I am physically capable of envisioning in my future is darkness. I don't want to feel this way. I don't want to want to kill myself. Why am I not happy? Why can't I be happy?
