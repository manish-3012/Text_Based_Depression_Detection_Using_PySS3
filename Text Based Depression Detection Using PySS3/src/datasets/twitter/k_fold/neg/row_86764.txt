I have not had food or water for over 24 hours and it's staying that way until it kills me.I don't care how uncomfortable or painful it gets, I'm sitting here and sleeping until I die of dehydration, I'll spare you my sob story, but I've tried to be a good person, it's hard to keep that up when life treats you like this, I just want out.
