My brother is making me suicidal.My brother calls me fat all the time and normally I just brush it off. 
Tonight he was on Skype with his gaming friends after I sai Ii was going to bed, but I got a glass of water before I did, so I overheard him and his friends talking.
His friend asked if that was his sister in his profile picture, he said yes, then they both called me a stupid fat bitch and laughed. My brother then agreed and said that I try to make up for it by showing cleavage. They all started laughing.
I stopped taking my antidepressants last week and this isn't helping. What can I do?
