Think about it so much. I don't think I would.I'm coming out of a 7-year relationship. We broke up about a year ago, and it's much worse now than it was then. I don't really know what else to say except to tell the whole story, and that's long and tedious. I miss her so much. 

The short version was that she was an intellectual type that I met at college. She's nothing like the girls in my hometown, who are fucking idiots. The only things the girls here have going for them is that they're deferential to their men; they'd make good housewives.

Nothing was perfect with us. But we had promised each other to each other for life. That's the part that really kills me. We both agreed that we knew each other long enough to know each others' flaws and to look past them. We told each other that we weren't the type of people to say forever and not mean it. But she didn't. 

She tells me she hopes I can fix all my issues for my next relationship. What a joke, she knows what I promised. When we made that promise to each other, I made a promise to myself too, I promised that it was her forever. I actually meant it. 

rest in comments.

**I don't know why I'm writing all this. I probably don't belong on suicidewatch. I'm not going to kill myself. I just think of how nice it would be to be free of this pain, and it's the only way I can think of. Everything else is only temporary.**  

**Like many suicidal people, I think I romanticize it a lot, without really thinking: "Nobody is going to give a fuck if you kill yourself, and you are going to miss out on a lot of cool shit."**
