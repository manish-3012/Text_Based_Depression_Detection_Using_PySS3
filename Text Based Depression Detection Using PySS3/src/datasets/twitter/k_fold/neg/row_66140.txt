I'm not a dumbass. Stop treating me like one. (F13)This is just going to be a rant, read it if you want. If you don't i don't care.

I don't feel 13. I know I am, but I've been through so much the past couple years it feels like my childhood was taken from me. Not only that, I'm top of my class even though im a year younger than everyone in my grade. I'm pretty intelligent for my age. And I feel like my family, friends, everyone are constantly dumbing everything down for me. I know they don't mean to but sometimes I feel like I'm way older than I am. 

I've been through things that no 13 year old should have to. And yet here I am, years of self hatred and trauma later. I just feel like my childhood is over. And honestly with my mental state I don't think I'll be alive more than a year or two. I have never really thought about my future because whenever I try to I end up having either a panic attack or a mental breakdown because it's so fucking stressful. I have no idea who I am anymore. I have no idea who I want to be anymore. Honestly most of the time I just want to end everything. It feels like I'm repeating the same day over and over, especially now, everyone's in quarentine. I wanted to figure out who I was, instead of just feeling like a blank, numb canvas all the time. But I'm probably gonna end it either on or immediately after my birthday, it's in late October.


I know how dumb this sounds, I'll stop talking now. Sorry.
