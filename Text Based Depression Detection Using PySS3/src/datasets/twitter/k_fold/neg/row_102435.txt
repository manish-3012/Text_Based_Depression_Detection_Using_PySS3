After I complete a project, I think that will be it.I want to die because I'm fat, ugly, and disgusting. I struggle with emotions that are too strong, and my siblings have seen that and I think I've ruined them. I'll die so I don't ruin them anymore.
I have a writing project that I'll complete and then I'll end it all.  I'll stay awake so I can finish it in a few days and be done with everything. Or maybe I'll just end it tonight instead. Maybe it's not worth holding off.
