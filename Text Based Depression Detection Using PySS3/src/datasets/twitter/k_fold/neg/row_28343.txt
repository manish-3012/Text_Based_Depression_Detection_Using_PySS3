I am broken.I thought I was getting better (I've been taking zoloft 100mg for about a month now). I started getting a little better and doing simple things such as taking care of myself again (showering, skin care, shaving, and gym daily). The thing that is killing me is crushing loneliness. I am an introvert and enjoy spending much of my time rotting away in my bed on my laptop doing nothing productive. I would KILL just to have a close friend or even a girlfriend. I want a relationship/girlfriend/lover more than anything in the world. I'm so alone and I've lost a lot of my friends this year. I have fallen completely for this new girl at work but I just know it'll never happen and that KILLS ME. I'm so sick of being lonely and just want some friends to talk to throughout the day and a girlfriend to love and care about. My life is a complete mess. The only socialization I get is from work. There all I do is act really weird and make jokes and try and make people laugh. I have a good time and love to see people smile but it's honestly just a hidden cry for help of my loneliness. The only thing I could do is continue to make myseld look like a fool in front of the girl I'm head over heels for. I don't know if this really made that much sense but it's hard to see (read: crying). I'm pathetic and feel like being socially awkward and outcasted is going to cause me to take my own life. I have failed as a person and there is nothing I can do to fix it. There is only one way out which I have not considered before and now am. It just seems so rewarding and blissful. Please help me guys. I've been a redditor for 2 years and have a lot of faith in my community. This is my last cry for help.
