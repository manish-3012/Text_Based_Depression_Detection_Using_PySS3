I just landed the best job and now I want to kill myselfI started my new job last wednesday. This is one of the biggest opportunities Iâ€™ve ever had in my life and it came at the right time. I did my best in the interviews. Left my previous job with a stellar reputation and now... now Iâ€™ve spent 2 days taking it easy and not really focusing. 

They gave me a month to adjust and self learn but deep inside, I know I can do more. Iâ€™ve always been proactive and really just hardworking. Now, i feel like Iâ€™m going to fuck it up. I realize how this feels like the ending for me. I just want to stop and hope I croak soon. I feel like I am letting the pressure get to me, and Im just sick of it. I know im being ungrateful right now but iâ€™m just tired and i just want to slowly ease into killing myself one of these days. 

Wish me luck I guess :/
