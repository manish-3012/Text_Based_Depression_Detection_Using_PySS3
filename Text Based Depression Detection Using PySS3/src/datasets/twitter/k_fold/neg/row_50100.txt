I'm lost, Help me find my way.I don't know what to do anymore. I was in a relationship for about 9 years, with my high school sweetheart. We were doing fine, sure we had our fights but nothing serious. Well she ended up telling me that she slept with another guy. I died that day. Well I loved her and I thought she loved me so we talked it out and she told me that we would get some help. As time went on, she would always push the dates to go talk to someone back, or just skip out altogether. We continued to fight. Needless to say she did it again but this time, she didn't tell me. I had figured it out myself, but when I asked her about it... All she could do was smile and laugh as she nodded. She insured that I was dead, practically killed me. I still see that smile to this day, it haunts me. I was depressed for months, she kept messaging me for help with bills and when she needed money I helped her, knowing that she was still seeing the other guy. She eventually cut me out of her life when her boyfriend started to get jealous of me, I guess? I'm thankful that she did too! Its been a year now. I've found a beautiful women! We are together now! But for how long? The 'honeymoon phase' is starting to die, we've been together for 9 months, almost 10. She is growing distant and Im afraid and depressed. I CANT do it again, Have my heart torn out. Im at my wits end, Im so close to pulling the trigger to ending it all. I need help, I don't like being this way. Please tell me that someone out there can help me. I just need some help.
