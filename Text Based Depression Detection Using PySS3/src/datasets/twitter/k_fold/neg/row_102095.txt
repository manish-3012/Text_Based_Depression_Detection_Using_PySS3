Wanting to escapeIâ€™m tired of trying to pretend I am alright. Pretty much every time I attempt leaving the house someone will start saying horrible things to me, and then when I am here at this apartment my neighbours do the exact same thing and I canâ€™t breathe without them flipping out at me. I canâ€™t stay with my parents because thereâ€™s too much pain there. The doctor told me there is NO other psychiatrist in the area and the psychologist said under his breath he hated me. Now on top of all that I have been told Iâ€™m paranoid and that none of this is real.

Iâ€™m tired of being hurt. I want to get away from here and go somewhere completely isolated. Iâ€™m not a survivalist by any means I am just done with trying to live near people and being mistreated.
