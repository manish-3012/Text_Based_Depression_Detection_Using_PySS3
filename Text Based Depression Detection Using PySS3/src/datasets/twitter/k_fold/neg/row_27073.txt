Life is not fair and it definitely is not a blessing.Some people are born into shitty families, some are born with deformities, some are born already fucking dead, some are killed right after theyâ€™re born... I could go on forever. This world is a fucked up place and humans are trying to cover the truth up, making everything look better than they actually are. Because theyâ€™re scared of the truth. Theyâ€™ve even created religions because of that. Afterlife, my ass. 

Think of the ocean, so beautiful right!? Well, you could fucking drown in that beauty. Mountains, cliffs, volcanos... Amazing isnâ€™t it? There are countless of ways to die on those places. You could die any second because of anything. Everything is designed to kill you if you just think about it. Weâ€™re all going to die. Weâ€™re all suffering, believe it or not. 

Everyone only think of themselves. All you have to do is just to look around to see that. No one cares about you. Even your family. When you die theyâ€™re going to be sad for a little while and theyâ€™re going to slowly forget you. Humans are selfish. And itâ€™s not their fault that theyâ€™re selfish. Weâ€™re just trying to survive in this tiny, tiny planet, making everything look bigger and better than they actually are. I just want to quit all this but this stupid self protection instinct we all have is not letting me. 

Lastly I want to say a big FUCK YOU to the creator/creators if they exist.
