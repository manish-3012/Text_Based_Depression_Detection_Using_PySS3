Anyone held back by guilt? I worry about my mother's wellbeing, but I am very close to deathMy mental health is worse than I thought, I felt I had my life together because of my education was going well and I seemed to be excelling in my field. 

But I can't continue anymore, I don't have it in me. I feel more sad about how my mother would feel, she would never be able to move on from my death. She has more kids, but I am the youngest and spent more time with her. Once I can shake that feeling away nothing would be able to stop me from doing it already.
