Nobody ever really gets betterI came to a realization. Nobody ever really recovers from severe clinical depression. The only people I've ever known to get better from this killed themselves.

Everything is constantly getting worse, and I don't know how I've lasted this long. I can't keep going any longer. I'm constantly having flashbacks, I'm dissociating, I'm extremely mentally ill, and even if I *could* get better, the mental hospital in my state is what caused the flashbacks in the first place

At this point, I'm not sure I'll last the rest of the year.
