I feel worthlessI am 15. I am a sophomore in high school. I feel like my life isn't going the way that I want it to. I'm not doing well in school because I have no motivation, and I don't feel like I'm good enough. I don't feel like my friends want to hang out with me. It always feels like they want to hang out with each other and I just tag along. It makes every day at school so much harder. I have suicidal thoughts multiple times a day now. My parents just tell me that I need to put myself out there, but it's hard. I am not confident. I try, but it doesn't work. I feel ugly, stupid, and like no one likes me. I don't feel comfortable talking to my parents about the suicidal part with my parents because I am scared about how they will react. I find myself searching google for "how to kill yourself" multiple times a week. The online chat never works. I always get stuck waiting in line. I don't really have any time alone where I can call the hotline. At this point I don't really want to die, but it feels like there is no other option. I hate myself, I hate my life.
