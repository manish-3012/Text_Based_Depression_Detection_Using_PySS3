Going trough divorceHi , please note that English is a second language form me so I will do some mistakes.

So about 5 weeks ago my wife (31f) and I (32m) decided to end our relationship. The main reason is that in the last two years we got further form each other, we taken less care for each other and less interest in the project of the other. And at the  end we where more like friends who have sex than a real couple.  But damn this is hard , even if I know that our relationship was not what it should have been , I feel so depressed .  We have 3 girls that I love so much and they are the only reason that I didn't already hang myself. I have a couple of great friends , a really good job , I know I should not feel like that but I can't stop thinking about hanging me .  I know that there a lot of things that I should have done that I didn't and now it's too late . I asked here to try one last time , I wrote her a letter with all the things that I would change but she said she didn't want any of that anymore. When I get home after work all I do is crying .  I feel so freaking lost .
