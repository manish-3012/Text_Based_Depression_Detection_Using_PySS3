I don't have a hold on my lifeEvery day that passes I get a greater understanding of why so many middle aged men commit suicide (all sorts of people do, I just happen to be in this group). I am so trapped by my decisions and the people I let walk all over me. I'm in a job I don't like where I'm forced to meet never ending and untenable demands but I need it to pay the bills to take of the children who are ungrateful and rude and a wife who won't get a job and over eats every day. It's all a never ending cycle of stress, anxiety, and suffocation. I want to break free. I browse ways on how to hang myself and ponder where I would do it, and where I gather the strength inside at the final moment to put the last suffocating decision into action.
