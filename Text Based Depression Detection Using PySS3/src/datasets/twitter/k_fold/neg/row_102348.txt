Safety plan? Right.In a really really bad spot right now, so I decided to actually try and use my safety plan for once. And not a single person answered a text.  I just want to die. I donâ€™t want to do this shit anymore. The endless drama, non stop fighting between family, constant anxiety and PTSD, thereâ€™s nowhere for me to get away. Nowhere for me to breathe. I canâ€™t go to a psych hospital because then Iâ€™ll lose my job and Iâ€™ll definitely be fucked. Iâ€™m drowning, and feel like I have bricks tied to my feet. I donâ€™t know what the point of this post is. I donâ€™t care. I just needed somewhere to type this out. Maybe someone will listen. Everybody preaches about speaking up if youâ€™re feeling suicidal but not a single person will answer when you do. Iâ€™m just so tired
