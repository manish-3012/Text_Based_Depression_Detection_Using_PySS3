i've been alive too longi'm 18 but i think i've been alive too long. i've been chronically ill since i was 6, sexually traumatized and mentally ill and in therapy since i was 8. being alive feels like there's a rotting, gangrenous limb that needs to be cut off; me being alive isn't helping anything and it would just be better to lop it off and end this now. the reason why people who have survived their attempts report being happy they lived is because their brain freaks the fuck out and tries a last-ditch attempt to save itself by making you so glad to be alive, it's not because things are actually better. i barely have any irl friends anymore so i can't go to them or even talk to them, if i tell my parents again then they'll either ask redundant questions or not let me out of their sight and not trust me to be alone even though i've never attempted before. i haven't been suicidal with a capital S for maybe 2 or 3 months but it came flooding back last night, and it doesn't feel good man. i should have ended it back in high school when people knew who i was and would have cared. my cousin died about 2 weeks ago and it hurts but also i wish i could have died with her (telling me to get grief counseling would be useless, i barely knew her and there wouldn't be anything to talk about.) i just don't see any reason to stay. no dreams, no apparent potential, no relationship, blah blah blah. whatever.
