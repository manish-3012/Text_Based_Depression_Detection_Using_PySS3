My recent ex gf just tried killing herself. What can I do to help now?Hi everyone, this is my first post from a throwaway (to hide her identity).

We just broke up this afternoon (I broke up with her), she has been battling depression for a month, now with medication.  I got better for a while and then got worse.  Tonight, I messaged her to see if she was ok and after an hour of not hearing from her, she started responding and judging by the fact her messages were almost illegible I knew something was up.  She gradually told me she had taken over 21 sleeping pills, and even when I managed to alert her roommates and called her an ambulance she still maintained that she wanted to die.  I was hoping it was a cry for help but I think she genuinely wanted to do so. 

What I need from you guys (please!)
I don't know what I can do now.  I live in Miami and she is back home in London so I can't see her - would that even be a good idea? I don't want to get back with her, we are just in different places in our lives but would contact help her?  I feel she is better when I speak to her but I don't want to give false hope. I love her very much but don't want to be in the relationship anymore. What should I be doing??

She tried this once before when we were on a break but her roommates stopped her before she could do it.

She used to be a really strong minded lady and now she kind of feels like a shell of her former self. It is really sad to see, particularly from afar. 

Further info if it helps: She is 26, i am 28. We started going out 15 months ago and I moved across the pond in January 2015. We have seen each other four times since then for a week or so at a time. She was signed off from work a month ago and struggles to find motivation to get out of bed some days.
