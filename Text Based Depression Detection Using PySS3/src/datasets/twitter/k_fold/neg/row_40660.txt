Want to be dead but don't want to have to go through dyingIf I could just be dead or die in my sleep I think I would. I hate almost everything about myself, and I don't think it's going to get better. The only thing stopping me is that I'm too scared of being hurt or of whatever method I end up trying not working and just landing me in hospital. I'm really scared that I'll *stop* being scared of that and actually try.
