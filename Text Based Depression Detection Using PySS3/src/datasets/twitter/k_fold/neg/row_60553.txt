if anybody could help I am very depressed and have been for about 3 years. I want to kill myself. Sometimes it seems as though its getting better but really its just not getting worse and then another episode hits and i dont know how many more i can take until i kill myself. I feel like it is coming. I am lonely but i do not want to interact with anyone. I cannot exercise because i have a stress fracture in my foot which hasnt healed in the past 7 months which drives my current frustration and depression. I try to subdue my mind by asking girls out on dates to which i proceed to get rejected. Or go on one date and then get rejected. To which then I play video games and feel like the worthless piece of shit that I am. I wasted the past 4 years at college, realizing that I accumulated massive debt for a lousy degree that i learned nothing from. Nor can i get a job from. All i do is sit or lie still, to forget about my foot. I have also not been eating regularly. I have mentioned this to my family and they try to help but they dont really understand and they just wait a couple days hoping that i get better. i just mask my feelings and play it off that im fine. i dont know what to do, i just want to sit still until i die
