If only there were convenient tools for suicide...If only I had a gun. If only I had a convenient cliff I could drive my car off of without hurting anyone else. If only I had a sharp enough hunting knife. If only, if only. 

I get so tired of being triggered by the same thing that repeats itself. I'm so tired of being patient and kind and understanding and asking nicely when all I get in return is the same defensiveness and anger. I finally started escalating in return, and now the escalation hits immediately. I shout and curse. I say nasty things. I am emulating the out-of-control behavior of the abuser that made my life hell. And I feel gaslighted into it. 

I read a title of a narc mom in a narc sub saying "i wish I had aborted you" and I thought that's as nasty as something I might say to my partner in my peak anger and vindictiveness. And now I just want to end myself before I get any worse. I have therapists and I've made so much progress but I hate what I become when I'm triggered again and again by the same condescending reaction to my best efforts.
