Are your problems temporary?By reading this subreddit I've noticed that most suicidal people here don't really have â€œseriousâ€œ problems (I know people will hate me for saying this, but it's just their perspective), they just have a depression, feel alone or feel unsatisfied with their lives. As long as you have a healthy body and access to basic stuff like food and shelter there's really NO REASON at all to commit suicide, no matter how lonely or depressed you feel. 

Why I am saying this? Because I have a chronic illness myself and I am in physical pain every day. Every day is a struggle. I don't want to talk about my illness here, but it's an illness with no cure, so it's getting constantly worse with age, although it isn't deadly. Of course I also think often about suicide because my health is pretty hopeless, but I manage to push myself from day to day.

If you feel suicidal think about it. Are your problems temporary? You will say no now. But let me explain. Depression is temporary, a heartbreak from a breakup is temporary, lonliness is temporary, being bullied at school is temporary, living with toxic people is temporary, being unemployed is temporary (mostly), etc...

Why? Because the day will come you leave your environment. People come and go. You will move to another place. You will meet other people. You will get over your heart breaks. You will finally find a job. You will find a girlfriend. You will forget about all the dumbfucks who hurt you.

As long as you have health, food and shelter you can do ANYTHING with HARD WORK. Just leave every dumbfuck behind and move on. Honestly, fuck them! 

Don't kill yourself because of temporary problems. Your current situation won't last forever! My family abused me for years. I moved out into my own apartment and banned them from my life. Now they're crying like little children because they see that I don't need them.

Don't give up guys. Most things are temporary in life.
