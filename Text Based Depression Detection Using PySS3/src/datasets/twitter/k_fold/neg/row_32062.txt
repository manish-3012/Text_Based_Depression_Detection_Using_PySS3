Just stopStop telling us to go get help. Go see someone. Because obviously the last thing I want to do when Iâ€™m already down is talk to a random stranger about my issues and problems. The people who care so much about me, can only tell me â€œgo see someoneâ€. Iâ€™m trying to talk to you and you push me off. And then, when I finally do commit suicide, itâ€™s all the â€œI wish they would have told meâ€ or â€œthey never said anythingâ€. Bullshit.

And they wonder why depression is so prevalent because nobody really cares. You see a therapist but at the end of the day, they are there just for a check.


My depression lately has me noticing that nobody really gives a shit about me. And what an awful surprise it would be if I was perished one day.


End rant.
