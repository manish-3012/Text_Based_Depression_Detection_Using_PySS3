I can't stop crying and I can't leave my bedThere's no groceries and I tried to call my mom to talk me into leaving but I was crying so hard I couldn't communicate so I hung up. I can't get up, my muscles are too weak to support me. I've been like this for days and I can't suffer anymore. My chest hurts and I don't want to feel this anymore
