19, gay, alone, on lockdown. What better time to go than now.The whole world is collapsing. Iâ€™m beginning to not give a fuck about anything. My date tonight got cancelled and I feel like as a gay man Iâ€™ll be alone my whole life. I have nothing to kill myself with, but the feeling of eternal loneliness is my biggest fear. Iâ€™d rather die than be forever alone. On top of this, the COVID crisis is only making things worse. I just wish things would turn around.
