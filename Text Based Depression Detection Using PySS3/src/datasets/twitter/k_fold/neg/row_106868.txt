i donâ€™t know where to start.my best friend just moved into college. we were both supposed to move in together but i couldnâ€™t afford it so iâ€™m living at home and she moved without me. itâ€™s so hard to watch her live my dream life, the one i couldnâ€™t afford. the pain of someone you love having something you were so excited for and wanted to badly, trying to be happy for them and push down the jealousy and sadness you have because itâ€™s wrong to feel that. i donâ€™t know if i can deal with this pain. i have never felt this sad in my life, itâ€™s unbearable. it was a last minute switch to me living at home. my dreams were ripped right out of my hands. and i canâ€™t even think about how this semester is gonna look bc itâ€™s too painful to think about all the friends and memories sheâ€™ll be making without me. iâ€™d rather die than have to deal with that. please someone i need hope, why does life hurt so bad and itâ€™s not like this for other people.
