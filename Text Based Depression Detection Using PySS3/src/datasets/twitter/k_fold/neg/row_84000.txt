August 20th is the dayI'm 27, struggled for a very long time to be able to get a decent job and settle down.

It's not happening and am feeling like a complete waste of space and extremely useless.

I have decided on a date and method and now just need prayers that I make it to a better place and don't end up as a vegetable.
