Never got over childhoodMy childhood was pretty rough, i was never abused, but my parents abused eachother (literally) like they hate eachother. When i was a kid i would have to listen to my parents scream hit eachother, and throw things across the room, every single day. They always made sure i was fed, and clothed. But they hated eachother more than they cared about my feelings, the cops have been called on them several times because they were so fucking violent towards eachother. They left bruises on eachother, and holes in the walls, like they actually physically fought several times. And that has affected me, because i cried every day, begging them to stop, but they didn't. They finally divorced when i was 15. I'm 17 now, and they live in different states. But I've never gotten over it, and now i feel like killing myself almost every day. But i won't until my dog dies
