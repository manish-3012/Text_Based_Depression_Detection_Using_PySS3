Feeling so alone and ready to end it soonI am writing this post as a last ditch effort to try to force myself to change my mind. I've been seriously contemplating suicide the last few days. It would be easy. I have several methods that would work. This is my cry for help.
I feel so alone. I've lived on this earth for 19 years and I've been raised to believe that a person's worth is determined by the relationships he or she can build and maintain. I know this might not necessarily be the right way to think, but it's how I was raised so I can't change my definition of human worth. Unfortunately, by this definition I am pretty worthless. I have friends, sure, and people who care about me, but I've never had that one person who I can talk to about anything.
Actually, that isn't entirely true. That person does exist. I can tell her almost everything. The only thing I can't tell her is that I am absolutely in love with her. I can't tell her because she is so happy with her boyfriend of two years and I can't imagine the pain it would cause for both of us if I told her how I feel; pain for her because we are close friends and it would most likely end that and pain for me because there isn't a chance in hell she would leave her boyfriend for me. Just writing that last part is causing me to tear up. I can't bear the thought of living life without her and I can't imagine a world where I can be with her.

There are other reasons for my depression. A messed up family, a friend's suicide attempt, a general low self-esteem. But my loneliness is slowly pushing me over the edge. I'm giving myself until the end of January to find a meaningful relationship. If it doesn't happen by then I will end my life.
