Im so afraid and I dont know what to do anymoreI dont know anymore.. 

I dont know if I dont care at all, or if I care too much. 

I dont know why Im hurting so much. 

I dont know what to do against it, how to ease the pain without giving it over to others. 

And Im afraid. Im so fucking afraid. 

Im afraid that Ill always feel this way, that it never gets better, because truth be told, my life couldnt be much better. I have great friends and family, a job I love that pays well, my own awesome flat, a therapist, hobbies and interests, I got it all...

Im afraid one day I dont have the strength to carry on anymore. That one day I lose my battle, because I can win everyday and have to fight the next, but if I lose once, its over. 

Im afraid to let people in, because I fear I will hurt them eventually. Im afraid of what it will do to my mother, my brother, my sister, my friends. 

And most of all Im afraid this day is today...

Before you ask what happened; Nothing did. Its as good and bad a day as any other, thats the scary thing. There is no reason, no trigger, no problem to fix, nothing happened.
