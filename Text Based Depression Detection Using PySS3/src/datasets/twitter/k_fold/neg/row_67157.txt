Might not make it past the end of the weekGave up my whole life to become a professional stock trader and just failed my assessment. I lost everything pursuing This. My fiancÃ©, my dog , my house and my  job. All gone. What do I have to show for it? A stack of bills I canâ€™t pay and room at my cousins house with no bed. I might just take a trip over seas and stage some type of mugging gone wrong so my parents donâ€™t have to deal with the stigma. Itâ€™s not like they will be able to handle any scenario where I donâ€™t make it but I think them thinking I was murdered is better then me checking out.
