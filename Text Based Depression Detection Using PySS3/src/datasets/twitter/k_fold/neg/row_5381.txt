Why insist everyone lives?I am currently debating whether or not I want to (or have the nerve) to kill myself.


It's not my first go-around with this feeling.


I'm online looking for info (best way to do it, least painful, etc). It seems like the prevailing attitude about suicide is "don't do it! life's worth living" etc.


I just don't get it though. Isn't that a personal opinion? Why should anyone have to suffer more than they want to?


We're all going to die eventually. Why do the vast majority of people seem to insist on making EVERYONE else go through the motions?


All perspectives much appreciated.
