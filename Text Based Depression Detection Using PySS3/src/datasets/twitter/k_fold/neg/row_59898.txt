Saw a kid on a bridgeI was driving home and saw a guy, probably 16 or 17 years old, with his leg over the wall of a bridge I always driver over, so I turned around and asked if we was all good. I was really nervous because I have some anxiety but I felt like I had to go ask. He seemed normal and said he was okay so I took his word for it and left, again because I was really nervous. Everyone else was just driving by and I feel like that alone would make me upset if I was depressed. I hope I didnâ€™t leave too soon, and I hope the fact that I stopped in the first place was enough to make him reconsider, if he was thinking about jumping.
