Please help! I don't want to lose my closest friend.There are a million things to say about this man; he's very intelligent, funny, kind... he's been through dreadful times and come out stronger, but now I know it's all overwhelming him and after last night I know **I don't have long to help him**. I'm getting desperate here. 


I know I am the only person left who could significantly help him as I've had similar life experiences and have been suicidal for many years - although I've overcome it, so I truly understand it more than most. His family are very dysfunctional, with a dad who he barely knows and a mum who'd rather ignore the signs and buries herself in her own life. He's also successfully alienated himself from all of his previous friends, but I know what he's doing because *I did this to all my remaining friends!* I got to a point where I thought I was helping by removing myself from the world, and that the people who used to care wouldn't notice when I was gone, because I had successfully made them hate me.   

He has many reasons for feeling this way:

* Most importantly, his illness. Basically he has severe chronic joint pain which cannot be treated, and it's getting worse and worse. He tries to walk everyday just to keep himself moving. He doesn't like to show it but I can tell it's a struggle moving at all. He doesn't know when, but at some point he'll end up in a wheelchair. **He's only 19.** 

*  Secondly we both have similar views on life. We're both very science-based and so have a logical mindset. We used to have long, deep conversations about life and death, and agree that life is effectively pointless, and everything that we do or could ever do is meaningless (I won't go into this debate here). So he has little care for life in general.

* As I mentioned, he has a dysfunctional family. He's been seeing a therapist for a while but I don't know how much it truly helps.

* He's been smoking weed for years as it seems to relieve or mask some pain for him, however in the last year he's turned to more and more drugs. He's heavily addicted to methedrone (mcat, drone). He's also done a range from cocaine to ket to shrooms amongst others. The sort of friends he's gained from this aren't exactly too helpful either. I forced him to stop everything a few months ago...but now I don't know whether that's bad or good, seeing as he's gotten progressively worse. 

* He's had immense pressure his whole life to exceed expectations as he is very intelligent. Earlier this year he did have ambitions for medicine and was being pushed towards all the top uni's, but he realised this motivation just came from others telling him what to do. I asked him yesterday and his response was that he had no motivation to study anything; 'I live for nothing'.
  

The trouble is I'm currently at uni. This is draining all my energy trying to help when I need to be studying for exams. A few weeks ago he phoned me that he was just coming out of A&amp;E after attempted suicide. I've come back from uni recently and the first time I saw him was last night, and it was the most soul destroying experience. He wasn't there, it was as if he's an empty shell, utterly cold and lifeless. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Should I continue trying - and how do I even help him? Or is it kinder to let him take his life, knowing that he is in pain constantly. Reddit, I need your help.

TL;DR - I'm pouring my heart out over the closest person I've ever had in my life and I don't want to lose him. Go back and fucking read it.




**Edit -** Anyone who was following this story at all / interested to know what happened next, well I think things are going to improve from now :) 

I've been speaking to his mum and she agreed to put him in a specialist mental healthcare hospital near where he lives. He moved in last night and will stay there for at least 4 weeks, so hopefully something can be done! He's also on suicide watch, so that's a definite relief. 

Thanks for everyone's help on here. To those feeling suicidal, please remember that you can get help and you can get over this, it doesn't need to end badly.
