still suicidal, but not avid on acting on it as muchI realize what i recently posted. I have major mood swings, which are part of the reason im suicidal. but i texted someone out of guilt because i cant stand hurting them. Sometimes you have to listen to people other than yourself and realize that you arent hated. People do love you. and thats all i ever wanted to hear. as someone who has childhood trauma and has always been neglected/emotionally abused by my parents, words have a lot of meaning to me. The person i love the most also has trauma, so hearing things from them means a lot. they never say they love me. But they did. it makes me rethink my decisions or what i wanted to do. i would feel guilty leaving these people behind. Im still extremely bad at friendships no matter how much i try, but i want to be able to manage my feelings better and try not to treat people badly because i dont know how to manage my own feelings. Ive been extremely mean to people in the past, and i believe that why i want to suddenly disappear so they dont have to deal with it.

But, they deal with it for a reason. If they didnt care they would have left a while ago. It still doesnt excuse my actions of course. I want to be held accountable but also realize that killing myself will also hurt them in a far worse way. I still do not like the mindset that suicide is â€œselfishâ€. Thats not what im trying to say. However, i couldnt imagine how they would feel. Losing a close friend to suicide. Ive also suddenly gotten a lot of posts or videos of people talking about losing someone to suicide, thats made me rethink things too. To anyone whos lost someone to suicide or to anyone whos suicidal, im sorry. I hope we can all feel better some day. 

And if you are reading this and think no one loves you, i do. I love you. you are also deserving of love. I hope you all know that.
