I'm so lost in life, I could use some kind words.I dropped out of University this year after my anxiety and depression got so bad I couldn't attend class or do any work. I went through a very bad break up 6 months ago and we still live together. I'm a 20yr female living a few hours away from home, I am on anti-depressants, and attend therapy once a week. I was extremely reliant on my boyfriend and now he's out of my life I never go out or see friends. I spend all day home alone, with barely the energy to get up and shower, while my housemates go to Uni/go to work. I've applied for 20 jobs and never even got a response. My anxiety is so high (my therapist told me a score of 19 required therapy..I got 49) that I can barely go to the shop to buy food, nvm go see friends. I'm supposed to go back and do my degree in September but I don't have the confidence to think I can do it, I am so lost, I have no ambition, and cripplingly low self esteem. I feel so lonely, I know seeing friends would help me but I barely have friends as I've alienated myself from them and I find it SO HARD to have social interactions. Everything is boring me, reading and writing were my passion, but nothing holds my concentration anymore. I'm just so lost :( I self-harm and throw up and take more meds than I should so I can sleep most of the time. Just..I could really do with some kind words, please.
