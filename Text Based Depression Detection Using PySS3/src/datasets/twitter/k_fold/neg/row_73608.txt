I feel sick.The longer I live, the more I realize indoctrination has fucked me up. Iâ€™m just so confused. 

Am I Christian? Do I believe in God? But Iâ€™m bisexual. So I must be a fake. But itâ€™s okay, as long as I accept Jesus, Iâ€™m fine. But if youâ€™re not showing signs that youâ€™re changing, youâ€™re not a true Christian. You believe love is love? Youâ€™re going to Hell. But God loves you. Itâ€™s free will, you choose to love God or not. Just remember, if you choose to not believe in God, youâ€™re going to Hell and burn for eternity, in complete agony and torment. But itâ€™s your choice, itâ€™s free will because God loves you. He loves you so much. Just accept Jesus and youâ€™ll enter His kingdom. But you have to mean it. And you canâ€™t just accept Him because you want to go to Heaven. Otherwise youâ€™re going to Hell. Youâ€™re confused? Read the Bible, youâ€™ll get your answer. Interpret it for yourself and try to listen what God is telling you. Wait, not that. Thatâ€™s wrong, what you just interpreted is wrong. If you believe in that, youâ€™re going to Hell. Honor your mother and father, no matter what. Even if they tell you they wonâ€™t go to your wedding if you marry another woman. If you look at the Bible and feel like you should read it, thatâ€™s God. If you feel nothing, you should check that. Youâ€™re a sinner. Oh you feel comfortable being with your atheist friends and not the church? You donâ€™t have God in your heart. Pray. You want to cut? Youâ€™re depressed? Just pray. Itâ€™s not true faith if you donâ€™t trust in God 100% 24/7. 

Do you see why I want to end it
