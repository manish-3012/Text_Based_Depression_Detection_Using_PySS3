I can't do this much longerThis is pretty much a stream of consciousness, sorry if it's hard to read 

My 7 year relationship is pretty much over. All my relationships have failed. I don't want to put myself through that wringer anymore, but I don't do well being alone. I gotta fake it with my partner through the festive period for the sake of our 8 year old but after that idk. I'm disabled, in constant physical and emotional pain and welfare isn't enough for me to have any standard of living. I don't know how long I'm gonna last but I already feel like my life is over.
