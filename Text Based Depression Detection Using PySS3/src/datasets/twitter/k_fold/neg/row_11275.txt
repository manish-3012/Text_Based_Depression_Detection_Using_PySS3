I hate who I am, how I behave with othersIt seems that I can not function well in the relationships with others, I believe I only create problems to others, and that I am a problem by myself. I asked my advisor to review a research project I wrote, but I felt like I violated his personal boundaries to get his help, indeed he politely refused, mentioning that he doesn't know the field. Maybe because he knows me, he knows that I am extremely sensitive to critiques, and if this project I wrote sucks, maybe he couldn't feel free to tell me the truth. I don't know how to behave properly with people, I just can let them down and I only want to disappear from the world
