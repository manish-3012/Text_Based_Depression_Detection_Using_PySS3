I just want her back.Me and my ex girlfriend had been going out for over a year. I loved her more than anything and to be honest I still do. She was my whole life, we did everything together, we went out pretty much every night and every weekend. She was my only friend

We broke up because she constantly lied to me, she didn't show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself. She didn't come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her "friend" who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugs.

It got to the point where on the night I broke with her, I flipped a coin, if it were heads I would break up with her and if it were tails I would kill myself. Thankfully it was heads but I'm getting back to that stage again. At school I have no friends anymore, when I try to approach anyone to try to become friends with them they just tell me to fuck off or something like that, so at lunch I just wonder about on my own and everyone just points and laughs at me

I can't even try to be friends with my ex because she can't even look at me and she won't tell me why. 

It's eating me up. I can't live like this anymore. 

I just want to wrap my arms around her and never let go. She is so intelligent and beautiful. She is the most amazing girl I have ever met. Now she has started to walk around with the "friend" who I mentioned before, that "friend" made my life hell for months, she is the reason why I have cut myself on many occasions, she also told her (My ex) to kill herself constantly to the point where she was about to. 

I just want her back, I can't live without her anymore. If she doesn't even say hello to me by next Friday, I'm just going to go and hang myself because I can't take it anymore
