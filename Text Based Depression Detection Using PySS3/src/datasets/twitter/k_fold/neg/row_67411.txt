its happening againMy last post talked about my cycle of depression and how it never got to suicide until then. My cycle also goes from at least a year or two. This is the quickest it came back and it hit harder then before. Before it was just an urge, like an ich you know you are not supposed to scratch. This time its much worse. No one will believe me, but its a voice this time, horrible. Every time I hear it I feel more and more hollow. There are also images I'm imagining, me on the floor bleeding out, me stung up by a rope. Last time I could almost escape by doing the things I love to do; play video games, talk to my girlfriend or wight a few poems or a short story. But now everything seems tedious and unimportant, not to mention I haven't even talk to me GF in over 2 weeks. The only thing that makes me feel even a little bit alive is putting a blade to my wrist and feeling the pulse of my vein struggle against it. I feel like there is nothing left for me to be strong about and all that's left is weakness. I don't think I have the strength to stop my self next time I try. The only thing really stopping me this time is I haven't picked a method of death yet; bleed, strangle, snap or OD
