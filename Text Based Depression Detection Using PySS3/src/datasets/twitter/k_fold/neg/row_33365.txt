I think this is it.I think the end of the road is near. Iâ€™m just so, so tired. Iâ€™m tired of fighting and Iâ€™m tired of the bad things that keep happening and Iâ€™m tired of being alone. Iâ€™m tired and I just want it to stop. The carousel never stops turning and I just want to get off. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this except I want to shout into the void, to let someone, somewhere know. To say goodbye, even if itâ€™s not to the people I want to say it too. Iâ€™m reaching the end, and Iâ€™m making peace with it.
