Todayâ€™s the day!Iâ€™ve written the note, and texted the few friends I have about how much I loved them. Hopefully I can go through with this. I feel a strange sense of peace...

I just wanted to tell someone, anyone, that Iâ€™ll finally be gone. In a few hours, Iâ€™ll try to take an acetaminophen overdose, but for now Iâ€™m gonna spend the last few hours playing the game I love most.

Iâ€™m not sure how this is gonna end out, but Iâ€™m hoping I either die or fall into a coma.
