I'm just so tiredI just can't stop these self-deprecating thoughts, can't stop seeing hanging out with people as a chore. Year after attempting and I have nothing to show for it. Feel like such a social pariah all the time and hate it so much. I hate not even bothering to pick up a project or new activity because I already know I won't have the energy to pretend to care about it a week later. Can't remember the last time a truck passed me and I didn't weigh the odds. Iâ€™m tired of my social interactions being all over the place, I don't know why I couldnâ€™t have just been born with a regular thought process. I just want to stress over normal things like grades, dating, higher education, etc. but I guess that isn't for me. Worst part is not being able to talk to anyone about it that I know, I don't want people walking on eggshells around me. That'd just make everything worse. I can't keep on pretending like i'll be fine and dandy someday, because so far that's just not happening. Sorry for ranting, I just needed to get that out. On the off-chance that someone checks my profile I'll be deleting this in a bit.
