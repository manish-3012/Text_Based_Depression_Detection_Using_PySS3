Life is pointless workI feel like the work I do is essentially pointless since I hate existence and I hate being forced to do things. Why work?  I look at the animals in the wild and they just do the same stupid bullshit everyday(eat, sleep, piss, shit, etc.) until death. Humans are no different except we can see the stupidity of this cycle. Itâ€™s just a never ending struggle until death and people think this shit is worth it? Fucking lol.
