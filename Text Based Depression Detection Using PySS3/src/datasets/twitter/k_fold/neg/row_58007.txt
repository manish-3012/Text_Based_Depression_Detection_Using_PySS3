Overly stressed to suicidalIâ€™ll try to be quick. People donâ€™t care enough to know about your life anyway. 23 yr old female here. 
Ex boyfriend/friend no longer wants contact with me. Mind you, heâ€™s one of two people I have to go to in times of need. Background, we started dating in March and we lived together in my apartment since dating and lasted until end of October. Thatâ€™s when we broke up.
Iâ€™m overly stressed due to my unemployment not working and hasnâ€™t all of the pandemic, Iâ€™m living alone now and Iâ€™m broke. I rely on other people and my monthly bills add up to about 2k a month. My parents are really wanting to cut me off but canâ€™t this month due to Christmas (moms words whoâ€™s also a narcissist and bipolar) and my friend is going broke trying to help me survive.
My mental health has been so shitty since the break up and Iâ€™m on medication but it isnâ€™t as strong to take away all of my depression and we canâ€™t up it due to anxiety. And my psychiatrist is running out of options to help my anxiety because of my physical health and side effects (Iâ€™m bipolar type 2)
I have no job and no friends. Iâ€™m relying on others for financial stability and have been for months. Theyâ€™re tired of it. Iâ€™ve been trying to find a job and no luck. My physical health is straining as well.
I see my ex one last time Saturday and Iâ€™m gonna kill myself after he leaves. Thereâ€™s no reason for me to be here anymore.
