I've wrote this post and deleted it 100 timesI don't want to explain my situation, I know people have it worse, I know I have my faults, but it doesn't change the fact that I feel helpless and beyond repair. It doesn't change that I'm so financially in a hole that I see no way out, I don't think I can make it through being homeless and having to restart my life. Homeless shelters are sole sucking, you're kicked out on the streets during the day to job hunt, scavenge for food and the people in there aren't full of joy.   


I don't have friends, my family is a support system only if you're looking for drugs, and I lost my job. Turns out if you're overqualified even McDonalds won't hire you as they're worried you won't stay with the company. Whats the point? Even if I restart will I ever overcome depression, childhood traumas, actually find joy and meaning, or will I just become even more numb to shitty circumstance?
