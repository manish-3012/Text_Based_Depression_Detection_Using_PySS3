Suicide is NOT selfish.I'm so tired of hearing this. This is MY life. I didn't ask to be here, other people made that decision for me. You're telling me the reason I HAVE to stay here is because that would inconvenience other people? It's ridiculous. Suicide is the ultimate right a human should have. I have to deal with my own thoughts 24/7, my own life 24/7, my own existence 24/7. To say it's selfish for me to NOT want to keep living is insane. Sorry for the rant.
