Why don't girls like me manI don't know if this is the right place to post this but the root of my sadness all comes from being alone and never having an actual relationship with a girl, it fucking sucks. Most guys my age have at least had one girlfriend or at least had sex...Not me, I'm a social introvert and never go to social gatherings. I've used tinder a couple of times but I keep deleting it because of the lack of matches I get which makes me feel even worse about myself. I'm not the ugliest guy in the world but I'm probably a 5/10 on my best day. I honestly feel like I'm going to die alone, I can't see myself ever being with a girl, or having a soulmate. It just isn't something I can picture in my head. Now I'm just writing for the sake of writing but just know If I kill myself, its all because of how fucking lonely I am and It's getting harder and harder to cope with being this sad all the time.
