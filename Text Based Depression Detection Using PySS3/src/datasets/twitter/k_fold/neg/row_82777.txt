Why doesn't anyone like me?In the past month I've lost all of my friends. A year ago I stopped cutting my wrists and arms because I had met a girl who agreed to be my girlfriend. She made me laugh all day, and we had so many good times together. She broke up with me a month ago with a single message, and refused to talk to me after that. She moved to another Country and white-listed her phone numbers so I couldn't talk to her. I never did anything to her, I just wasn't the one. That's when I started cutting again. I posted on here before but nobody commented after a month so I got embarrassed, cried, cut myself, and passed out in a small puddle of my blood. I tried to drown myself the day after, only to be pulled out of the river by my friends dad who was supposed to be dropping me off at a party. My friend found out and refuses to talk to me now, along with my other friend who noticed my scars and said he won't be there when put myself in a ditch somewhere. I told my ex-girlfriend who I still communicate with on a daily basis. She's uncomfortable talking to me now. I want to die more than ever now. I was raped as a 5 year old kid and now live with an embarrassingly overprotective and perfectionist family, which makes me want to die even more. Nothing I do is good enough for them, they try and forzce ADHD meds down my throat, call me a dumbass and a retard on a daily basis and remind me of how much of a waste of skin I am to start my morning. I lay in bed, depressed because I didn't die in my sleep from some chemical spill or disease. I have to go to a math class with a math teacher whose a fucking imbecile and doesn't know his shit, yet is allowed to teach a class of students, meanwhile I keep being reminded I don't meet the requirement to be an exceptional human being. If somebody would talk to me or something that'd be super cool of them. 

EDIT: goodbye
