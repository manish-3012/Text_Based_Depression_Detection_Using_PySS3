i'm 26 and it get harder to let people know you aren't ok.i've been recently falling into depression its been a slow decline over 2 months, i've recently moved back in with my family since i've lost my job and falling into debt. i really dont have friends, my only friend lives in LA, and he's been down too, and i feel like he wants to open up to me, but even as a person dealing with it i don't know what to say that sounds like bullshit. we're both going through what i believe is a quarter life crisis. My family as of today have picked up on my odd behaviors, theyve finally popped the question, but i choked up cause i don't know what to say, or open up.
