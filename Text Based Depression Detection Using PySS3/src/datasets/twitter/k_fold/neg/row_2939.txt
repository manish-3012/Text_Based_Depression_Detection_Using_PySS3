I realized no one really cares about me I am drinking to finally have the courage to jump off the 7th floor. My life was a joke. I never had a romantic relationship and never feel loved in my life. When I went to my dream college I lost all my motivation in the quarantine I fucked all my grades. I slept all day one day and then my sister asked if I was ok, after that I keep sleeping all day and my family just ignored me.  There is so many things wrong with me but I an too drunk.
