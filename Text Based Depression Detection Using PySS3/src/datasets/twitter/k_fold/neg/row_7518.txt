SGMI want to jump off a major building at my university tonight. I know that it will ultimately be pointless, and everyone will ultimately chalk it up as a mistake and many will blame me. How could I, an intelligent upper-middle class male dare to be unhappy? I have 'everything going for me'. Maybe I don't want to be a part of society or exist anymore. Maybe I don't see traditional markers of success as something to look forward to. Maybe I just don't give a fuck anymore.
