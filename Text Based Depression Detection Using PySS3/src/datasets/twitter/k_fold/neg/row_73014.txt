i donâ€™t deserve to keep going ontitle says it all. iâ€™ve fucked up so many times and have made so many mistakes and done so much wrong. iâ€™m the worst person i know iâ€™ve mentally scarred my best friend, lied to and manipulated her, been directly shitty to friends iâ€™ve known for years, racked up costs for my family to deal with just piling the debt higher and higher, etc. iâ€™m the worst fucking person alive. i keep receiving forgiveness and iâ€™ve just about had it. i keep convincing people iâ€™m not that bad or that i deserve another shot but. i know i donâ€™t. i just keep lying because facing the truth is harder. but we gotta do it sometime right; iâ€™m a horrible person.
