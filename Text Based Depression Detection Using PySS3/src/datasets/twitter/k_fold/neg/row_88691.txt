Chronic Pain gave me a scary thoughtI've been suffering since 2 years now. Discs in my spine degenerating. Pain going down my arm. Had a recent MRI done and found out even more of the discs in my spine are degenerating(cervical and lumbar). I've just started my career but sadly it's a desk job (corporate lawyer). I've got all these dreams but I can't even go one hour sitting comfortably in the office.

I am religious so I think about an afterlife often and how nice it would be to be rid of this pain. Today I asked myself a very difficult question; do I want to die? 

I broke down into tears because all I could think about was how miserable the past 2 years have been. I'm only 23.. am I just expected to grow old? Have my spine continue to deteriorate? I cried like a little bitch.
