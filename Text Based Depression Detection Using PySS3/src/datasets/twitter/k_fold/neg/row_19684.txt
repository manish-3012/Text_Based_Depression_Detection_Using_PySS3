Iâ€™m alone and need someone to talk to.I genuinely think, Iâ€™m unfit for the world. I have 1 friend but he has tons of friends and they go out and party. My friend never invites me because â€œthey donâ€™t knowâ€ me so instead I sit in my bedroom all the time. I even tried to hang out with my younger cousin (who is only a few years older) and some of his friends but he said that he doesnâ€™t want them to say anything to me. I mean wtf, am I that bad. I tried dating but that never works out for me because I have a foot fetish and when I bring up the topic, they get creeped out. Iâ€™m so ashamed of my foot fetish so I donâ€™t tell anybody. I tried killing myself almost a year ago and I never wanna put my parents through that. I am most definitely gonna kill myself when they are gone. I just feel alone And unhappy.
