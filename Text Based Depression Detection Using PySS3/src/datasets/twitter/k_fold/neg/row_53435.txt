Every nightSo Iâ€™m 21, been around a few places and done a lot of things, but every night I just think about the bliss of being dead. Donâ€™t have to worry about work, your health, society in general. 

Every night suicide is like, â€œhey bro Iâ€™m here if you want it!â€

Iâ€™m not even sad or depressed, Iâ€™m way past that shit. Got my sister, thatâ€™s it and I ainâ€™t doing it while sheâ€™s alive I know that it would destroy her very existence. 

Does anybody else feel the same way?
