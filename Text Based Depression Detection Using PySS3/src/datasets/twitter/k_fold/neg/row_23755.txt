Nothing wrong with quitting if you're dealt a terrible hand.If you're born with the right cards, you'll live a decent life; whether it's a safe environment, a supportive family, good friends, a romantic partner, money, or the means to gain any of those. And before you tell me about someone who had none of those who made a happy life for himself, consider the last thing on that list. Think of people born into starvation, into warzones, into slavery, disease or terminal illness, who never had that chance.

I don't have a terminal illness and I live in a good environment. But there are many other things that take away any chance I have at living a decent life. They may be invisible to most other people but they are very real.

But none of that matters to the lucky ones. People who are blessed with all the necessary tools to live a happy life believe that anyone can have them. They have to believe in a fair and equal world. That's why we're told not to kill ourselves. So we don't upset the lucky ones. So when it comes to suicide, who really is the selfish party?
