my therapist has to cancel this weeks session againthis time we arenâ€™t even rescheduling, she has to cancel completely until next week. itâ€™s not her fault but this has to be a sign, twice in a row?? my dad is disappointed in me and i canâ€™t do anything right and now the person who really helps canâ€™t talk i feel like itâ€™s a sign. i donâ€™t know what to do iâ€™m really losing hope and talking isnâ€™t helping
