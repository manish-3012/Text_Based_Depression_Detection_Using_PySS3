Im just tiredIm just tired. Im in an unhappy marriage, have no friends, am not a good mom and have to borrow money from my parents every month to make ends meet. Im just a defective model of a human being and Im done - if it werent for my kids I would be gone already. 

Life is not good. I try to be positive and kind to people, to set a good example but theres nothing there. Im not smart or pretty, Im not an amazing mom or spouse, my spouse maybe loves me hut can also be incredibly cruel to me. Injust thought at this point in life something would work, but its not and it wont and Im just fucking tired
