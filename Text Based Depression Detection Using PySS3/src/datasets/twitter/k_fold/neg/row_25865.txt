I chose a date.Tonight, I chooe an exact date.
I know these posts are typically scoffed at because people assume that we do this because we want attention.. 
I'm not posting for attention. I'm not posting for pity. 
I've always felt overwhelmed when it comes to my mind.. I've lived each and every day dealing with constant feelings of anxiety, depression, loneliness and self-doubt.
I suppose I'm posting because I want to know if anyone else has had this same experience... I want to hear about it... To know I'm not alone in this time. 
I guess I just want to know that I'm understood.. For once in my life.. I want to talk to someone who can understand.. I don't want someone to run away from me because of my thoughts.
