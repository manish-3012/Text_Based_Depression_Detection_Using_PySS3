It's been a while since I've posted here...Or maybe not. I can't think. I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you guys everything. I am 13 years old, going into 8th grade tomorrow. I have almost no real friends, my father is borderline abusive, and I am extremely paranoid and stressed right now.

I thought I was ok. Until very recently, I thought I was happy and not going to be depressed anymore. I guess not... Some days I'll be really happy and joyful, and sometimes out of nowhere I get all sad, for no reason. I suspect bipolar depressive? I'm not sure. I'm just very tired of everything. Very exhausted. I don't want to deal with anything anymore.

I was close to doing it. I was about to kill myself when a friend stopped me. This has happened many times. I just want them to let me die... I want to die.

I wish they didn't know about it so it wouldn't hurt them... I just want no one to worry about me so when I go it hurts less, knowing they couldn't have stopped it. I really need help... Please. I want to die, but I know things could be better.

I don't know what else to say... I just want someone to hug me.
