i feel too sick to live normally but too "ok" to go to the hospitalim not happy. i dont have any acress to something that would kill me. but im sad and have no job or anything to live for. when is enough to go to the hospital? i dont hear voices or want to hurt anyone that's not me. i just feel sad and genuinely see no reason to live anymore. i dont want to talk about it and i just want to close my eyes and never wake up again
