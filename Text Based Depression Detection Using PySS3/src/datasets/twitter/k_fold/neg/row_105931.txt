The choice of what I should and shouldnâ€™t doIâ€™ve suffered from anxiety and depression throughout my childhood, ptsd being the catalyst to my fall. Some time in middle school I was introduced to self harm and since then, in one way or another, Iâ€™ve harmed myself. Starving, cutting, bruising, scratching, punching, etc. It was an outlet, it was the only way I knew how to cope...

Therapy helped with some aspects of my illness from when I was five years old to now sixteen, but that didnâ€™t mean the pain has stopped. Iâ€™ve learned ways to conceal the pain, how to make it go away in a healthy manner but the problem never went away.

Iâ€™m going through a new hurdle in my life, something Iâ€™ve never experienced and now I donâ€™t know how to handle the situation. A silly teenage relationship that bloomed into the biggest problem Iâ€™ve faced in my life. The panic attacks donâ€™t stop, the crying continues, the bad thoughts hoard my mind-

â€œLetâ€™s go to that bridge up the street. The police still havenâ€™t found that girl those two men threw over, maybe they wonâ€™t find you eitherâ€

Stop

â€œRemember in the 6th grade when you wrote a suicide note to your family and parents? Remember that park on the beach side of the lake? Hang yourself on the play equipment like you said you wouldâ€

No-

No? 

I donâ€™t know what to do and I donâ€™t know how to handle my emotions. The crying isnâ€™t stopping and the occasional thought of killing myself is a constant flicker in the back of my mind and I canâ€™t focus on anything... 

Whatever happens, Iâ€™m sorry.
