I'm worried about myself.I've been drinking a lot lately

I'm even drunk right now

My arms are cut up from things I've done to myself while drinking in the past

I'm an 18 year old guy and I was diagnosed with clinical depression a number of years ago. Lately, I think about suicide every day. 

I'm not in school, I have no hobbies to speak of, and there are no jobs around here. Unfortunately, I'm going to be moving in with my crazy biological father soon, because I have nowhere else to go.

I hate myself and everyone around me. I don't feel like I have a family or even any friends. It's like no one had ever been able to really relate to me. I drink most nights so that I won't have to think about it.

I do have a sort of long distance girlfriend who I care about a lot. I would never want to hurt her in any way, but I rarely get to see her, and I really feel like my life is going to take more effort than it's worth. My dad is going to try to get me the most difficult job possible, and I don't even know why. He id actively trying to make my life more difficult. 

I've clung to life for so long, even though I didn't want to, and it seems like I'm really starting to lose my will to live. I'm just so sick of trying to please people. I don't think any amount of work would be worth it.

What do I have to live for anymore? If I go, my girlfriend will move on. My "family" will get over it. I won't have to live up to crazy expectations anymore.

What is one among billions?
