Whatâ€™s the point of living if I cannot even get laid?Serious question. I was born catholic, but few years ago had this realization when I was meddling with philosophy that there is no God. Now, for me that meant that life stopped having a meaning. Whatâ€™s the point? Am I going to be used by government until Iâ€™m old? So I decided that instead of killing myself, I would go full hedonist and indulge in all the pleasures that life can offer... but I canâ€™t really afford that. The closest thing to hedonistic pleasures was good food and alcohol. But I stopped enjoying eating, I still do overeat but only as a coping mechanism. In my opinion, the biggest pleasure life has to offer is sex, and that I cannot get no matter what I do. Hookers in my location are so low quality that I would just catch some disease. But I canâ€™t get a girlfriend either, thatâ€™s the dilemma. So am I supposed to kill myself? Letâ€™s be honest, there is nothing better to do anyways. What will I do? Read a book? Get some stupid senseless hobby like most of you recommend? Tell me why I shouldnâ€™t  do it. There is nothing more to life, so why not kill myself?
