I read something on reddit today that made me really sad.&gt;My best friends are a very tight group. We lost a few along the way and don't hesitate to make it known we love each other-because we do. It was like that before I came out and nothing has changed.

&gt;I don't know what I'd do without my best friend in my life, and I don't know how I would've gotten this far if I didn't know he cared about me, or if I couldn't tell him I care for him. He is my brother.

I've never had a friendship like that. I probably never will. That sounds like the kind of thing that might make life worth living and it's out of reach.
