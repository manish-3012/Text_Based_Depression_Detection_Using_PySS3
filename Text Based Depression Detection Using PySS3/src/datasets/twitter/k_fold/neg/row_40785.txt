I dont have home.I realised that today, home is safe place where you can feel loved and appreciated, but not me..

Im abused, i hear all the fucking time how useless i am, yesterday i was called "useless", "psychopath", "shit" and much more.Im a sensitive person, its too much for me.She doesnt understand, she blames all the time and she doesnt see anything wrong with her..

I wish i would have any money on start to move out, but its not an option for me currently and i wont handle even another week at this home, i will just stay here and  starve myself to death or i have bunch of pills to stop this hell

Wasted oppurtunities and here i am, cant even afford any place to sleep and food

Goodbye friends :(
