UselessI've never felt so useless.
I'm strange, unappealing to the eye, and just an overall failure.
I work at a video store, but I'm never given hours because I can't sell to people.
I can't keep a girlfriend, because they always find something shinier.
I'm in debt, not enough to demolish me, but enough to cause monetary problems.
I can't sleep, and it hurts to be awake.  I've tried sleeping pills, but they give me terrible nightmares, and I can't keep going on like this.
Every breath is mentally excruciating.
I just want someone to help me.
