Can't shake thoughts of suicide...My life has gone to shit...  I'm 23 year old homeless guy, and I can't stop thinking about taking an xacto knife across my wrist.  I have a job that I hate as a receptionist at the Back to Work program that I had to go to when I applied for welfare, but that job, psychologically, is hell (very stressful), &amp; it doesnt pay very much, so saving for a room is very slow, &amp; they are very expensive in NYC.  I dont have time to look for other employment, because as soon as I get off work, I have to hustle across Manhattan to get to my storage unit where I keep what little clothes I have, in order to make it to the other side of town in time for the bus to the church bed where I sleep.  If I quit my job to look for other work I'd be broke &amp; get kicked out of the church bed thing, (they want to know we have income to save $ for our own place) &amp; I'd be sleeping on the street.  I'm a college drop out, so my options are limited with no degree.  I have no family I can turn to.  That's a whole 'nother story.  All I have in this life is my girlfriend, which is why I can't bring myself to join the military.  If I stay in the situation I'm in, eventually I'm going to give into the desire for suicide.  If I join the military as a way out &amp; get seperated from my gf, I'll be as, if not more depressed.  I dont have the time, money or insurance for pills/therapy.  I don't know what to do anymore...
