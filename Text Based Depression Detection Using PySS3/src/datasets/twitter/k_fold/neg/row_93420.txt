The last one awake, as alwaysI donâ€™t know about you guys, but those days when Iâ€™m not asleep all day Iâ€™m always the last one awake. The last one to fall asleep, I walk home from the party knowing I could go on for ages. I donâ€™t know if anyone else feels like this. We could go on forever, do anything, as long as we donâ€™t have to go home. I just donâ€™t want to be alone. Iâ€™m always so fucking lonely. Someone, anyone, talk to me. I am breaking apart. Please tell me there is someone. Please tell me I am not as dreadfully alone as I feel. I feel broken and I am sick and tired of it. What else is there? Please, of you are awake, talk to me. I so desperately need it.
