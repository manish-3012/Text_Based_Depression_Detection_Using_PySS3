The worst partMy life has utterly fallen apart. My boyfriend and I had a fight last night and he left. It's 4 am now and I haven't heard from him. He defended his right to swear at me if I am being "disrespectful," something I apparently stumbled into accidentally while joking around about a board game. This relationship was the last bit of hope for my life.

But that's neither here nor there. I have a plan I can carry out. I have my suicide note mentally written. I'll write down my passwords to everything and where I'd like my money to go. I'll take a picture of the note and post it to Facebook. 

The worst part is that I won't be able to see people's reactions. I want people to realize that it's not okay to treat me the way I've been treated. I want there to be regret. I want there to be change. I want people to see what they've done and the effect their unkindness has on others. I want them to realize that they had a friend in me and didn't appreciate it. But I'll never see all that. And maybe it's a blessing, because my hopes for all those things would probably not be realized. My death will be a mere blip on the radar. People will shrug their shoulders, now confirmed in their belief that I am crazy, and get on with life.
