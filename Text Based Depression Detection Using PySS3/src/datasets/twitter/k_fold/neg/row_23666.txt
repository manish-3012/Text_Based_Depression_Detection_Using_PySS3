No improvements no matter what I tryFeeling 16 years depressed and suicidal.

Unable to maintain a job. 

Unable to form a bond with a person. 


I turned XX today and have reached nothing. I don't want to interact with people anymore, I don't want to work 40+ hours per week till I'm 67 years old only to make someone else rich while I'm having financial struggles and no free time. 

There are 3 choices for me:

Suicide
Slavery
Homeless

To me, being dead sounds better. My logic makes sense to me, or am I being irrational?
