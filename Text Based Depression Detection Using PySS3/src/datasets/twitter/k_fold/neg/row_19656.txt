Hi. Sending this to the void.I an not here for anything. I just want to vent a bit.

Everyday. Everyday is a struggle. My thoughts have began to completely consume every moment I'm alone. No matter what I'm doing, what music, what company, what weather or what day. Always the same intrusive thoughts.

I am sick of life. I'm exhausted fighting myself all the time. Im tired of hurting myself. I'm done trying to cope. I don't know what to do anymore....

I don't expect help or answers. I just needed to share how I'm feeling. I'm afraid my own mental deterioration will become to much for me to handle.

That scares me.

I'm sorry.
