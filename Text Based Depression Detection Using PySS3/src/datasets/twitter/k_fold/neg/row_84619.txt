Why pornography and little social activity is extremely dangerous and ruined my life. I'm only 17 years old.Forgive me if my wording is really scrambed. I'm typing this on a tired mind. I feel that I need to get all of this off of my mind. I will describe my past as brief as possible. Basically, I've always been sheltered too much. I also REALLY hated school for some reason. I always had problems with being absent a lot. This led to me being depressed at the age of 14. Anyway, I got into pornography as a source of entertainment and tension relief, but I started TOO young, like at 10-11 years old. This constant cycle of PMO has led me to interest in fetishes and social taboos like incest. Now typing this out sickens me, but after watching a lot of porn and reading incest hentai, I almost tried to make an incestual advance on both my brother and my mother. Luckily I didn't do much. It was only two years ago that it happened (which was around the time that I started going on anti depressants). Only last year did I recognize that I really had a problem with porn so I sought out to COMPLETELY QUIT pornography. I'm currently very successful in doing so. I'm completely avoiding the lure of porn and looking at women in lustful ways. So much that I associate pornography with my depression. I feel that it is one of the major contributing factors to my depression and I dare say even my anxiety. It's just been bothering me so much ever since I stopped PMO. It's haunting me and eating me alive right now. I'm feeling so much guilt and remorse over those incidents. It doesn't help that I'm not going to school anymore either. I just wish that the pain could stop, or that I could rewind time and redo things. I really don't deserve this. I'm only 17 years old... this fucking sucks so bad. Praying to God everyday helps a little, but isn't enough to help me get back on my feet. I'm at a total loss as of what to do. Please help me.
