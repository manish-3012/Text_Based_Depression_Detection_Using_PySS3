From the outside looking inFrom the outside looking in, you might think I have a great life. Graduated from top schools, working at a high- paying job, having a loving family. I know how to wear the mask that smiles.  

&amp;nbsp;

From the inside looking out, I am a mess. Constant self- doubt, constant self- hatred, almost no friends, and no chance of a girlfriend. It seems like my only value in this world is to work and die. I've cared about so many people, maybe I cared too much. I've been there in others' darkest hours, but it seems I'm alone in mine.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
I've been to therapists, but none seem to understand. Now there are voices in my head. They're my own voices. I think they started talking to me because I've been so socially starved for so long. The voices used to be calmer. They used to only provoke self doubt. Telling me I'm not good enough for some friends or to even think about a relationship. But now they want me to kill myself. Now they tell me I don't deserve life. These voices now consume me. Whether I'm at work or at home, my death is constantly on my mind.
