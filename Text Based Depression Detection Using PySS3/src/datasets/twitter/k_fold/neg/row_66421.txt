it's all pointlesswriting this is pointless. it'll likely get buried with other posts. even if it isn't, there isn't anything that can be said that'd make me feel any better. me trying to get better is pointless. trying to move on with my life is pointless. trying to talk to people is pointless. every time i try to get better, or try to do anything, it's pointless. i am miserable and incompetent. i can't do anything for myself. i will never have my independence. i will be stuck in this house with these rotten fucking people until i die. i will never be happy. i don't have it in me. no one will ever truly care about me for longer than a week. i will never get off probation, i will never lose weight, i will never get my own apartment, i will never have a real job, i will never wake up with someone i love, i will never make my father proud, i will never be a good example for my little brother, i will never have my family back. i will always be a miserable, hopeless, selfish, manipulative, worthless, and RUINED piece of shit. i hate that i can't just do it. i want to die. i want to die every single fucking day. i don't have highs and lows anymore, i don't have a bad week or a bad month, it's not going away anymore. i'm living with this every day and i don't want to be. i don't want to make my grandparents or my father have to go through mourning me. i don't even want to hurt my mother, even though that's all she's ever done to me. but it isn't like there's anything to lose. i am nothing. i am a shell of a person. i don't understand how just going through every day mindlessly and in fucking mental anguish is any better than just letting me die. i have no quality of life. i don't want to be here.
