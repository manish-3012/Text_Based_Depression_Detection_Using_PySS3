I wish I had a lifeAll I do is sit at home. I try to take peopleâ€™s advice and volunteer and do other stuff but nothing interests me. I got a job hoping I could make new friends but they donâ€™t care. I want to be busy like everybody else but I donâ€™t have that same independence. My life sucks and I want to die. Iâ€™m tired of fake people and not being able to make friends. 

I would talk to my mom but she says itâ€™s all my fault and I blame everybody else/ make up psychology terms to be a victim. If everything is my fault it makes me want to die more because I hate myself. My ex is seemingly my only friend but thatâ€™s only because weâ€™re both losers
