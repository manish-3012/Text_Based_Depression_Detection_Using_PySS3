I hate this worldI hate myself so much. I see all my flaws, and I can tell people are lying when they say that I donâ€™t have any. Iâ€™m fat, ugly, idiotic, unfunny, untalented, and below average. I always try to stay happy but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m a geek. Iâ€™ll always be a loser. I like things only children like. I try not to cry but I can barely hold it in anymore. I need to get my emotions out but not to anybody. So here. I want to cry but I canâ€™t. It will be better in the end. I try so hard to get strong and fit and then I blow it all in an hour bc my fatass doesnâ€™t know what stopping is. I have superhero posters on my wall, which is babyish. I hate lgbt which will bite me in the butt when Iâ€™m older. I hate all feminists and people who support equality because lgbt should be low. All the way down. But I could never say that in person because then the whole world will hate me even more than they already do. I just canâ€™t wait to die

Why is the world forcing people to be gay. Why canâ€™t people just STOP forcing people to have their sexuality what they want. Iâ€™m straight, and people force me to be gay. I hate it so much Iâ€™m really just pissed off rn. What is this world coming to?
