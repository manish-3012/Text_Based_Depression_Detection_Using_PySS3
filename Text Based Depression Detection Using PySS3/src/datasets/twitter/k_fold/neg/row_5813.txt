Everyone abandons me.I canâ€™t take it much longer. Everyone who says they wonâ€™t leave ends up leaving me and hurting me. Iâ€™m a burden alive and Iâ€™ll be better off dead. Hope this rispiredral overdose kills me off or leaves me severely brain damaged so I canâ€™t feel emotional pain anymore. 

So much for â€œIâ€™ll be here for youâ€ and â€œI wonâ€™t leaveâ€
