I Need HelpI don't want to live. I haven't for awhile now. And I am so very angry at everything and everyone. All I do is hate any more. Hate, hate, hate. So much it hurts. I've considered sending myself to the hospital with a knife through my arm just to see what happens. Do not tell me to ask for help. I am asking here and here alone. My hate and my anger is born out of fear and rejection. Anxiety won't let me seek help. I'm not allowed to break in front of others. But talking about this openly would cause my breaking. Help me please. Offer your hand. I won't be asking twice. I hope that one day soon I find a way out of this or at the very least make a way out for good myself.
