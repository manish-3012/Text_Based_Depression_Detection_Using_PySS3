I feel like a massive faliureI recently have been very 'depressed', or at least that's what I think it is. I have huge break downs, mainly when I'm alone and I just don't know what to do. I failed my maths and english twice in a row, my driving theory test 5 times, my course exams, and now, as edgy as it sounds, I feel like the part of me I once had, is dying.

I no friends as I used to confine myself to a small friendship circle. The friends I had ditched me because their girlfriends didn't like me, so they pushed me away. I sit alone in my room at home because when I confronted my parents they called me an idiot and said "You're just sad, get over it".

The reason I am here though is because, recently, I have been thinking about suicide a lot, and have hidden pills in my drawer that at the moment I can't bring myself to take, but I can't bring myself to get rid of them either.

I am 18 years of age, have tried meditation, walks, exercise and suicide phone lines. I just want some advice.
