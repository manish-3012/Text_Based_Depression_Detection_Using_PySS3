I have the equipment ready and Iâ€™m at peace with the idea but something urges me to tell someone.Hey all, I havenâ€™t been feeling well lately and thatâ€™s with antidepressants (the 5th one Iâ€™ve tried consistently) 
Iâ€™m away at college as an undergrad currently with good grades and my hand in some intense theoretical high energy physics research. 
We could blame Covid for how Iâ€™m feeling but in reality Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m hypercritical of my body/physical appearance with no self esteem to show for it. I try and workout regularly to the point of my body feeling like it will fall apart. I canâ€™t stop. Iâ€™m 27 and I thought by now Iâ€™d stop giving a shit. I cut things off with a friend (My only true friend around here) I grew very fond of because she kept triggering episodes of my trauma. I donâ€™t want to go into detail but itâ€™s from my childhood and SA/verbal abuse related. It definitely ties in with the self esteem over my appearance. 
I have the tools needed to fix up my car and leak fumes into the cabin. I want to do it at night out where I can be uninterrupted. I plan on concealing any/all reflective surfaces and do a little star gazing before I â€œgo to sleepâ€ but something still urges me to say something.
