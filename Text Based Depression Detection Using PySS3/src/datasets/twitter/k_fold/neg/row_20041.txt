I cant keep pretending that im okayIm supposed to be the one people can lean on to. I always wondered how they would react if Im thinking of offing myself. Im also scared of my family getting the blame. But Im just so tired. I cant even cook because when i am near knives, I get the overwhelming urge to pretend to slip and gut myself. That whay itll be seen as an accident and not a suicide. When I do eat I try to take big bites so that there is a chance I choke and die. Im the only one who knows Heimlich in here and im pretty sure I would be DOA once I get to the hospital. Sometimes Iâ€™d try to think how Iâ€™ll slip in the bathroom so it will also look like an accident. The thoughts are overwhelming but for some reason I entertain it
