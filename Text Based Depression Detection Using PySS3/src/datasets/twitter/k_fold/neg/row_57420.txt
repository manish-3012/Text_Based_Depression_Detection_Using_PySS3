As someone who regularly contemplates suicide, I want to share what keeps me from going through with it.1) Possibility of botching the procedure. You may live the rest of your life more miserable than you are now.

2) You don't know for certain what's on the other side. You could reincarnate in worse circumstances.

3) If you decide you don't give a fuck anymore and don't want to live, try drastically changing your life. Pack up, hit the road, do something radical and ridiculous for the adventure. Perhaps you might find something worth living for.

I've gotten to the point where every single thing in my life was devoid of joy. I didn't even feel like getting up out of my bed (which is a couch). All I did was just wait. Wait until the darkness passed and eventually you'll build momentum for vitality.
