Give me a real reason not to...Iâ€™m a 20 year old male and mentally Iâ€™m a wreck. I think about killing myself everyday and continually come to the conclusion that inevitably itâ€™s my only option as I will never find what Iâ€™m looking for.

When it comes down to it all I want in life is love, and that has proven to be unattainable for me. Iâ€™ve been on two dates with one person who ultimately told me they just wanted to keep things casual, to which I respectfully replied that I wanted more which led to her ghosting me. A year passed and I met someone else, someone that would ultimately become my best friend whom I had to stop talking to because the heartache was too much. Sheâ€™s been in a relationship for years so what I was seeking was not realistic, I tried to accept that because she was the only true friend Iâ€™ve ever had but my emotions were too overwhelming. So here I sit, no friends, forced to move back home because of finances, and no chance at love. Iâ€™ve been trying to work on myself but I quickly become reassured that my efforts lead me to the same spot I alway end up in. Iâ€™m turning 21 in December and I truly cannot stomach the idea of being alone in nearly every sense of the word at that age. Iâ€™m always told things get better, that thereâ€™s someone out there for me, but I just donâ€™t believe it. My social anxiety and depression control me, I have so much love and passion to give but nobody to share it with. So ultimately I must ask, why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself?
