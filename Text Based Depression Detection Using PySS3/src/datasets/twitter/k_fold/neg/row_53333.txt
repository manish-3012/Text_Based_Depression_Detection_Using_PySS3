Kinda strange?has anyone ever been more afraid living then death.
Hate going to sleep because i wake to another day.
Have wonderful family little dysfunctional.  But think we are all these days.   
For me lost myself..........RN by training....... blah blah..ick.same sob shit........ this that and seems everything....in my head is plain f@cked up
Death all around except the one!!! Who wants it!!
PTSD Agoraphobia deppression(of coarse).  There is no real help out in the world.  No scars, no cast, no arm, no pain.  Being a women in need that is running out of time,  there is nowhere to go.  Unless I want to play with crayons.    It is horrible living in my head
