Holy shit whatâ€™s happeningNot sure whatâ€™s happening to me, canâ€™t breathe one second, my heart is racing, I can barely walk, talk, do anything. I fell asleep feeling like I was drowning, I thought I was seriously dying. I woke up with the most horrible and severe panic attack. My entire body was shaking like I was having a seizure, I kept gagging like I was going to throw up my stomach, my heart was racing I could hear it loudly in my ears like someone was knocking a huge rock on them. I wasnâ€™t able to walk, my mom had to put my pants on. I donâ€™t think I ever want to live after this, I really and from the bottom of my heart want to sleep forever. Itâ€™s been a year and a half with complete suffering, I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s real anymore. I close my eyes, I can only think SUICIDE. Can people who suffer from severe and chronic facial trauma get euthanasia? Itâ€™s not out of boredom, I am seriously in so much physical and emotional suffering.
