I think im going to give up nowY'know I figure it should be fine. Im 21 and no connections to anyone or anything on the world aside from strained relationships with my immediate family. I just quit my job and have been wanting to follow through with this for a while. I dont have children or anything that ill be leaving behind, just a few family members who will be happier when im not ruining their days. I have no friends, no contact with people at all. I have no ambition, no drive, nothing I care about. Im a simple human husk. I dont feel anything, whether it be physical or emotional pain. I sit alone, all day, and think. I contemplate my life and my decisions. It always leads to this conclusion that I should just end it now. I cant explain it. I dont feel anymore. I just drift through life from one place to the next and i dont fit anywhere. I cant relate to people, i cant empathise. I dont understand people, i dont even understand myself. Should I end it? I want to. I really do. Does it make me selfish? I dont have any debts or anything important that ill be leaving behind. This is my opportunity. My chance to exit the world without a trace. Ive made no impact and I will not be missed.
