I'm just so lonelyIt's almost 5am for me rn, I've been sitting on the ledge of my window for like half an hour, listening to my playlist, waiting for a notification, a comment, a dm, anything, but incase I want to jump of I'm already at the window. I know I'm to shy to kill myself, but I still want to do it. There's just actually no one I have a long term friendship with, not a relationship, just a friendship..
