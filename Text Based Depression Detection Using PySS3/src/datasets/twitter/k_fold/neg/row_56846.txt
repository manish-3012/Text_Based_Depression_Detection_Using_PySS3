Nothing LeftIf you ever played a pokemon game, one will feel the utter boredom of completing the adventure. Sure! You can complete the pokedex but, why bother.  

My metaphysical adventure is done; and, I feel numb. If I can be dumb and sad, at least I'll be happy in a while.  

Pathetic, isn't it. One will either see it as "you're seventeen, you haven't found shit" or "you are smart beyond your age" or the et cetera of responses to a teenage nihilist on the internet. I'm just fucking tired. Yes! I want attention! I have fucking depression! I want that but despise the same of spewing excuses.  

I'm bragging again. "I'm so sad and I'm so smart. Lalala I'm fucking Lord Byron. I know everything!"  

I want someone smarter than me to tell me how dumb I am! Not just tell me "you're right, this is this" or "you're young and wrong. Live your life."  

But, that's not going to happen--is it?  

Nothing is satisfying anymore. Spending a shitload of money and comfort eating is now unenjoyable. I stroll the sidewalk hoping to get hit by a car or be provoked by someone so I can bludgeon their head in and feel whatever simulation that will give me.  

Spring break is over in a day. I'll wait for a miracle in school for maybe a day or two: cue impossible romantic fantasy or just fighting one of those druggy kids to death. Mine or his.  

But, that's not going to happen. So, after another appointment with my doctor and psychiatrist, I'm going. I recently found that you can hang yourself painlessly. Too good to be true? Whatever. If it's painful, I don't care. As long as I die. End the final chapter of my stupid book.  

I'm a writer, I know when a story is going to end.  

I don't truly know why I'm posting here. Maybe I'll just use this as a suicide note. But, I think it is the small chance that grand philosopher will respond. A bullshit free God with the truth. Please prove to me my idiocy.
