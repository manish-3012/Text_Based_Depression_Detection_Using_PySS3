I fantasize about dying in a tragedy in hopes people will express their care for me.It's weird, I am aware people care for me but I feel like they treat that as something that is to be assumed through their actions. I need direct communication though, and between that and just, horrible experiences with people, I fantasize about dying in a tragic manner to either have the horrible people feel sorry for how they treated me, or for them to show the horrible people they actually are. I also fantasize about this so because I seem ti like imagining the pain it'd bring to those who care about me as if that'd be the only way they'd express it directly. 

I believe I've impacted people greatly but have no way of confirming it. I just thought today, of directly telling people what's going on in my mind and asking them how they feel but I feel like that'd be way top unfair to ask of them and now I just don't know how to respond to any of this. Any advice is much appreciated.
