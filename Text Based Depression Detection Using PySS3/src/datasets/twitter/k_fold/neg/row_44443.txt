I'm being forced to get help. I need words of encouragement to get the strength to tell someone.I lost myself today. I broke down in school. I feel so numb and empty. Like I'm watching someone else live. I see all the actions I do but I feel nothing. I literally feel like I'm above myself watching myself walk around. Nothing but numbness and my emotions are gone. Literally fucking gone. 

A friend of mine who I love more than the world got mad at me when I said I was done with life. I was ready to give up. She won't talk to me until I get help or tell an adult. I can't don't this life without her. A while back I told myself I wouldn't kill myself till I went to reconciliation to forgive my sins and tonight I'm doing just that. I'm going to reconciliation. It will go two ways. I'll have two chances to gather the strength to tell someone or kill myself tonight. Those are my only options because going on without telling anyone isn't an option. When I'm confessing my sins to the priest I'm going to try and tell him how I'm feeling. If I can't get the words out I'm going to go play magic and when the only adult I trust in this world takes me home I'm going to talk to him. If I fail at both I'm giving in. I'm hanging myself the second I get home after that.
