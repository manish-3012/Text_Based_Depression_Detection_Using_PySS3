Clueless on how to continue.So much to say but i'll try to keep it short...

Couple weeks ago I got a call from my aunt that my mom was in the hospital. She tried to kill herself because my stepdad left her for someone else. I was devastated and cried for 2 days straight. I took the rest of the week off from work. I wanted to go visit her but I just couldn't. It took me a couple of days before I was even able to talk to her again. Childhood traumas came back to me and I just felt broken, angry, sad and left alone all at the same time. Sadly this wasn't my first rodeo.

When I was 7 my biological dad also tried to kill himself. I walked in on the whole scene. It wasn't pretty to say the least.

I can understand that her situation wasn't easy but I just feel abandoned. I want to be able to be there for her but i'm internally struggling. I know I can't be mad at her but how could she let me go through this again. I hate feeling this way because it feels very selfish. Everytime I see her I just feel more and more depressed. I need my time alone but want to be there for her at the same time. 

If I help her I'm gonna be depressed in no time but at the same time I can't risk it of her trying again.

Any advice would be very welcome
