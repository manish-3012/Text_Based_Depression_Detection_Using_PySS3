Why canâ€™t I be happy when things are good?I just always want to die. I donâ€™t want to kill myself. I just wish I was dead. Even when I find myself experiencing happiness or joy in some form.. at the end of the day I just wish I would fall asleep and never wake up. I feel guilty for feeling this way because I am blessed with so many things. My health, a good job, loving family and friends. Iâ€™ve gone to therapy and he told me that I just donâ€™t think I am good enough to be happy and that I have survivors guilt over childhood trauma. But how am I supposed to work through something that doesnâ€™t even bring me pain anymore? Itâ€™s as if I am numb to it all. Idk. I guess Iâ€™m just wondering if Iâ€™m alone with these feelings or can someone else relate? 

Itâ€™s not like I havenâ€™t taken the steps to feel better. Iâ€™ve done it all. Stopped alcohol and drug use, started eating healthy and working out almost everyday, going to work out classes to socialize, treating myself to things that make me happy, doing things that bring me joy. But I still feel like this. I just feel lost at this point.
