I don't know why I'm going to North Carolina.I've always wanted to just take a trip and get away from it all. I live in New Jersey. I wanted to go to Kansas to visit this one friend of mine that I met online, but it was too far for me to drive to only stay there for the time I had alloted (5 days). So I decided to go to North Carolina and hang out with my ex. I called her up (we broke up on shaky terms and only really talked occasionally). And now I'm set to leave and go down there tomorrow. I'll be staying there from Monday until Friday afternoon.

  The problem is, for the past few days, I've had this looming, terrible feeling, and I can't figure out what it is. I have not been in a relationship (and I practically haven't even been hugged by) a girl in almost a year, and I doubt I'll become anything with her (or even hook up with her). Can anyone help me possibly pinpoint whatever this feeling is?

  (Sorry, I didn't know where else to post this.)
