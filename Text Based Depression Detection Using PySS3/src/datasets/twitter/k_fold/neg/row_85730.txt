Self harm and me- with suicide makes three.I donâ€™t like to talk about my self harm much in anything more than a dismissive way, but as the nights get longer and the shadows in my life grown darker itâ€™s been consuming me again and Iâ€™ve become overwhelmed by the question of /why/ I do it. 

My journey alongside it has been a long one. Some could even say I started young. 
I used to bruise myself with a hammer when I was 8. Because I could hide those easily and eventually they would fade. I hated to see them go. I didnâ€™t like to forget the lessons I tried to teach myself in blue and black. 
I needed to hurt moreâ€¦

So at 14 I went through a stage of stitching embroidery thread into my skin. Always in the shape of hearts. I decided if I was to be alone, then these would be marks of me trying to love myself. But that wasnâ€™t enough, and I quickly began to become shaped by the world around and reactive to the way people treated me. Donâ€™t show emotion. Help others. Always be available. Donâ€™t complain when youâ€™re unhappy. Others have it worse than you. Selfish. Needles through skin hurt, but the pain never lasted, and neither did love the burning hearts tried to represent. 
I needed to hurt moreâ€¦

Then came the cutting, taking on a crueler twist by the time I turned 16. The result had been nothing more than scratches when I was 12, but before long, every easily concealable place was covered. Wrist. Shoulders. Stomach. Sides. Thighs. 
It was widespread. But it wasnâ€™t serious. Nothing that left â€˜realâ€™ scars. 
I needed to hurt moreâ€¦

So I found comfort in the dancing fire that sprung from lighters and matches alike. Though I myself did not smoke, I always had cigarettes on my person. The small circles of anguish they left behind were too good to give up. I must have been the only teenager I knew that used cigarettes as a cover for something even more unacceptable and sinister, but the pain was fleeting, and even burns heal.
I needed to hurt moreâ€¦

By 18 I had found a certain beauty in the force you could use to press down on a blade. I could, and did with pleasure, pierce veins and tear through capillaries with hatred and disdain. I could quite happily reach the subcutaneous fat layer without even a flinch. This time it did leave scars. Many.
Even still, I needed to hurt moreâ€¦

So now here I am. At 23. And the journey is far from over. When nights are very dark, I have even broken bones. In my fingers and toes. Can you even comprehend the level of hatred one has to feel towards themselves in order to break their own bones? 

I thought it would be the best pain I could cause myself, for I knew I needed to hurt to the superlative.

Itâ€™s almost sad really. Sometimes I think about that little 8 year old version of me, hammer in hand, and I find it hard to hate her as much as I hate what she has become. 
So as for why I self harmâ€¦ I guess my view of myself is so low that I feel it necessary to both punish myself for living in spite of knowing I donâ€™t deserve to be here, and also out of guilt for even wanting to kill myself when so many people would do anything to live my life out for me. 

I hurt myself to keep myself alive. I canâ€™t commit the ultimate act of self destruction, so I have to inflict pain as severely as possible. Because only then do I seem to be able to live with the overwhelming guilt I feel for staying alive and burdening people by breathing and such. 
I must be a very difficult person to be around. I wish they would just let me go, because I feel a step closer to suicide every day.
