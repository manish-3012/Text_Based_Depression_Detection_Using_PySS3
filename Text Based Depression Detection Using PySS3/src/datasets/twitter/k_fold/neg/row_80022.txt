Redditor needs one of y'allHowdy All,

I'm not familiar to much with Suicide or helping those out struggling with it, but I did find a post on Reddit that looks like OP could use a reach out. I'm here asking of one of you more experienced with this could message OP and talk to him so he can get the help he needs.

Thank you.
