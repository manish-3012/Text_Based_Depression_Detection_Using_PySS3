he girl I'm in love with wants to kill herself.  She owns a handgun, and made the comment that she might do it in the near future.  Please help.We've known each other for awhile.  We knew we had feelings for each other after a week of knowing each other (we worked together).  At first nothing happened because she was in a 4-year-old relationship, but it was growing weak before I even met her.

I am madly in love with her.  I know I want to marry her and grow old with her.  I want to eventually have a child with her, whether it be ours or we adopt.  These are things that I thought I'd never want, but there's no hesitation when it comes to her.  I want to build a life with her.

She told me early on in our relationship about some horrible experiences in her past.  She eventually told me she knew relatively early in life that she wanted to take her own life eventually.  This was shocking to hear, of course.  Granted, I've wanted to commit suicide at several points in my life, and I continue to battle with depression.  It's just different when you're in love with someone, and that someone wants to do it.  She made it seem at first, though, that she would kill herself rather than die old, i.e., when she was 60.  This was still very hard to hear, since I want her to live a long, happy life.  We both have gone through a series of bad events in our life (like being fired by an insane boss for simply wanting to have a meeting).  As a result, we've both lost health insurance, and she cannot get a prescription for effexor at an affordable price.  

At the same time, she doesn't even want to take effexor now that she's off of it.  She doesn't think that she'll ever get better.  She does not want to live.  She owns a handgun, and she expressed the desire to kill herself in the woods.  It's so hard for me to handle this.  I want her to get help, but she refuses.  I want to tell someone, even if it means her hating me.  I don't have contact with her parents, though.  I'm sure I could contact her family somehow, but I am scared of losing her (despite my previous statement).  This is tearing me up.  I can't sleep.  I'm stressed out.  I'm so worried about her.  And I wonder if I would even want to live if she did this to herself.  She has become my reason for living; my sole source of happiness.

I don't know what to do in this situation.  I have no one to confide in about this.  I don't want to be extreme with her so as to push her away.  I freaked out crying, not able to make coherent speech, and she refused to talk about it because of this.  I calmed down and listened to her and tried to ask her why she wouldn't ask for her parents' help to pay for medication or why she wouldn't seek medication + therapy.  In the end it just kept coming back to she didn't want to live.  I didn't want to push past that (why don't you want to live) because I know that would make things worse.         


EDIT:
I want to thank everyone for their support and responses.  There were some common themes in the responses, and I thought it would be easier to address it here.

-She was on effexor, but we both lost our health insurance.  Regardless of this, she doesn't want to take it any more; she refuses to take it.  I have noticed a distinct change in her off of it.

-She refuses to talk to anyone about this.  She wouldn't even go in depth with it to me, but I made her talk to me about it.  She's made up her mind.

-She has known that she was going to do this for a long time now, more than a decade even though we're in our mid 20s.  So even though it only takes a quick decision and action to use the gun, she's been thinking about it for a long time; she's had the gun for many months now.  She knows that this is a conscious decision on her own part.  She cares about people, but she doesn't care about their opinion on her decision to do this.  

-I have no idea where the gun is.  She lives with someone else, and I don't feel like I can just go into their place and start looking through their stuff.  I'm sure she has it locked up safely somewhere.  

-She will not give me the gun.  Telling her to give me the gun will only make her mad at me.  She will not talk about the gun.
