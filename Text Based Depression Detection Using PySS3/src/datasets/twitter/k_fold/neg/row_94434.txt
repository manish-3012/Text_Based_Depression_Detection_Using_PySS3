Ive been resisting it for so long, but im giving inI've been trying for so long to not give into my urges to plan and prepare for my suicide. But I've reached my breaking point. 

I have no one anymore. I am too much of a burden on everyone around me. 

I've looked up parking garages (I live in a big city) and think I've decided on one. I have a tentative date. I just need to finish up cleaning out my stuff and then I'll be ready. 

It will be much easier on everyone after I'm gone.
