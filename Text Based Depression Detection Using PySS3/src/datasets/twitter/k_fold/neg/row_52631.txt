Chronic injury, no hope. Want to check out and save myself more pain.I wish I could summarize without this turning into a book. I'm tired, I'm almost 35. I have a bad injury that keeps me from working, but I can't qualify for disability (because they are useless at helping people.) I don't want to be on disability, I'd like to have my life back and have a job where I can make enough money to live reasonably comfortably and not struggle. (I don't care for luxuries, like clothes, cars, etc. I just want whatever gets the job done.) I'm in the process of juggling doctors and treatments that haven't been helpful. I might be injured forever. (Type of injury doesn't matter to this story.) 

I've been suicidal on and off for close to 2 decades. Me being injured, having no options, is literally my worst fear come to pass. I worked and spent my teen and 20's at terrible low paying jobs. "Sacrificing the present, so I could have a good future." But nothing panned out. So I have nothing good in front of me. I went back to college, while struggling with the physical pain I'm in, and got an associates degree. I'm not gambling 30grand on a degree that doesn't matter. I can't stand the thought, of going back to another dead end job. I'm not intelligent enough for tech/med type jobs, nor can I physically do anything I might, might be interested in. I don't have the willpower for anything anymore, and I'm just slipping away. There is nothing out there for me, and I accept that, I was dealt a shitty hand and there is no hope. My life is hell and I want it to end.
