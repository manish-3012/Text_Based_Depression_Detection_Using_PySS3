Just wanted to shareHere I am, cannot coping with life and thinking about 'stuff', looking at the posts here to feel the positive things, calm myself, and I find myself writing a post. Because life is so weird. I mean it's been *exactly* 6 years (even the hour is same and that gave me chills) since my grandma died at my current home. It's so weird that out of nowhere I remembered that while I was trying to calm myself and read some posts here. 
I really don't know why but this subreddit gives me hope. Everyone of us feels the same fucked up way about life and its good to find people going through the same shit and see what motivates them.
If you are reading this, stay safe.
