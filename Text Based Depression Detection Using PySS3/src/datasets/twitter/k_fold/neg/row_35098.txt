i'm not suicidal, but i'm definitely having an existential crisis.How does one deal with the knowledge that the universe will one day end? I find no solace in the idea that we should try to do the best we can while we're alive.

Let me stress: not suicidal, just on the verge of pulling a Chris McCandless.
