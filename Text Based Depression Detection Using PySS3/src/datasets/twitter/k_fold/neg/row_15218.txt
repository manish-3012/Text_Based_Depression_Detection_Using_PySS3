Whatâ€™s the point to try fighting if all my efforts are always in vain?I just canâ€™t fit in this world. I struggled very much just to finish high school and in the end I was so exhausted that I had to drop out of college because Iâ€™ve lost my ability to concentrate. I canâ€™t even read now. I spend 10-15 minutes trying to read and comprehend one page. Iâ€˜m absoluTely terrible at socialising. I have no idea what to say when someone is trying to talk to me. So, I will have neither family nor friends. I canâ€™t work because I have no useful skills. Every time I try to pick up a new activity I just mess up. I never did something well in my life. So why should I live? To suffer for decades?
