i battle my own mind every single dayiâ€™m 15 and i have severe bipolar. severe as in homicidal and suicidal thoughts daily and just the fact my emotions snap in an instant. but i havenâ€™t been this low in a while. the love of my life just left me and i donâ€™t really see a future for myself so i think my hourglass is out.
