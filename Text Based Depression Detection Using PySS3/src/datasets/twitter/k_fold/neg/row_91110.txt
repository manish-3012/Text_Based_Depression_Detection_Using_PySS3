I'm done.Not even a throwaway account, my main because no one cares about me enough to look at my reddit.

I'm just done. I'm done existing and I'm done being me. Tomorrow night I'm going under the bridge and putting a fucking bullet in my head. My friends think I'm going to an event in the city and my parents think I'm spending the night at my girlfriend's house, they still don't know she broke up with me.

I'm done being talentless, I'm done being mediocre, I'm done being a failure, I'm done being unlikeable and annoying, I'm done being ugly, I'm done being a nobody, I'm done being a liar. 

Don't know why I'm posting here, guess I'm still fucking desperate for attention right up to the end. God I'm a piece of shit lmao
