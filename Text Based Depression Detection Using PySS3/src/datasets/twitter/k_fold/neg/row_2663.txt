I've had a pretty good run. I can die without too much regret now.No, I'm not going to live for to be 70-80 years old. I'm 26 and I'll be lucky to see 30, though even that's a stretch. I'm far too depressed and suicidal, and the good days continue to get further and further apart. It's been a couple years since I really had a good one.

But I got in some good times while I was still able to enjoy them. And Depression can blow me, because even if it makes me miserable now, it can't take away my memories. As a kid, I had some awesome Christmases and Halloweens. I got to play sports and win a championship. I got to enjoy video games. See some incredible movies. I've done a little travelling and vacationing. I got to see a solar eclipse. I've had a relationship with a remarkably pretty girl, and we had some pretty good times before it fell apart.

I don't have most of that anymore. I haven't had a friend or even a loose acquaintance in 5 or 6 years. I know I'll never have another relationship - I'm too depressed, antisocial, and mistrusting of people. I'll never have my childlike innocence back. I don't enjoy games or movies like I used to.

But most animals live much shorter lives, with much less enjoyment to look back on. They either die of slow starvation or getting eaten by anther animal - I'll likely die relatively painlessly by falling to my death, at the time of my choosing. 

I've done alright.
