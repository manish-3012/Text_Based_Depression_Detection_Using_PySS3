How Do I Find The Courage?How do I find the courage to do what needs to be done? I'm.self harming more and more. I'm depressed. I'm sad. I'm angry. And yet I also feel dead inside and empty. 

I know the only way out for me, but I lack the courage to do so. I wish I could do it. I just want it all to end.
