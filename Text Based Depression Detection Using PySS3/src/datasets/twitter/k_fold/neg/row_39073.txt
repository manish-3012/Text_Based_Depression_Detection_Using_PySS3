I feel like my life has no other way to go other than suicideSuicidal thoughts have run my life since I was about 9 or 10, Im 22 now

I feel so fucking pathetic

I treat my friends, family and boyfriend like shit...especially my bf. 

I dont try in life

Im fat

In tonnes of debt

No money

No home

No future for me

It just keeps getting worse and worse

Im gonna run out of antidepressants soon with no money to get more 

That'll push me over the edge

Then hopefully I'll have the guts to go through with suicide. A real attempt.

Once they confirm im being kicked out of uni that'll be it

Thanks for listening
