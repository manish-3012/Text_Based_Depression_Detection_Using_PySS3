HelpLong time Redditor here, but using throw away account for privacy. 

I suffer from chronic pain, and unfortunately with my diagnosis there is no light at the end of the tunnel. I suffer from fibromyalgia, which already carries a stigma and is not taken seriously by most people I come across. I am sucking the life out of my husband with my constant complaints and feeling down. I have dealt with depression my entire life, but ever since I was diagnosed 2 years ago it has gotten worse. I am considering leaving, but I don't want to leave my husband with our mortgage and 4 cats. No amount of counseling can help me, only a cure to end the pain will be what saves me, and that is not going to happen. I don't even know what I am doing on here or why I am posting. I am actually at work, just staring at my computer screen, my head is so foggy and clouded I cant even think straight. 


EDIT: our* mortgage, not out.
