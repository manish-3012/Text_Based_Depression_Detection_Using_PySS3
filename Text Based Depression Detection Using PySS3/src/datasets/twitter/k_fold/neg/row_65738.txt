HelloI'm not sure if living is for me. I don't have a future that will improve me. I only see down hill. It's been like that for forever. I am a toxic person. I lie to everyone,I bullied people. I don't feel bad for doing it but I don't want to do it again but I do. I have been though alot. abuse by family members. But it what I deserve. I feel nothing and everything. I'm always on the edge of a break down. I can't even love people the right way. I become to controlling. I have chonic pain . I know the the worse writing u have ever read but I just wanna put this out here. I always wonder if I'm just a crybaby , I just need to suck it up and move on or I actually need to get help. Neither way I'm dieing. Nobody cares about me , if someone does they don't need to . Im not worth it. Maybe I'm just a teen and this is a just a phase. I want a end to this nightmare. I'm always scared of what people think of me. Because of that I given up on actually making friends. I wish my life never happened. My life a joke, it's gets worse by the year. Good-bye. Au revoir.
