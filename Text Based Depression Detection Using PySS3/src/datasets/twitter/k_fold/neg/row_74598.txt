Most of you don't live in the same country as me. Tonight, I called two helplines with the same story. Very different reactions. Can provide (non-personal) details if you are interested.Ok, I'm not gonna write a rambling post about offing myself, although I appreciate how severe the situation in this country is. I want to live. I suffer from depression and anxiety and feel totally alone, so tonight called (for the first time ever) two helplines.

I won't identify them. One had a kind person who had suffered from depression and came out the other end. Seems talking about personal experience is OK with them. She gave me the names and numbers of 3 services, 2 of which are specific to my situation. She also advised a visit to my GP (general practitioner).

She shared her personal experiences with depression and bereavement and that was amazing. She ruled. At the same time, I sort of felt like she wanted me to get off the phone, if that is possible. The conversation felt terribly rushed.

Second person was the best listener ever - it felt like he would listen to me for hours if necessary. I kept saying sorry for taking up his time but he was so patient. He was a much better listener then the last call but couldn't recommend any services. Great guy but he said that he is not allowed to tell me where to get help. I am wondering why this guy can't even tell me to go to my local doctor? I am astounded.

This has been refused by my more private account - so here i go public.
