I want to stop existing, I feel like I am a freak, a disgusting worm and I don't have energy energy and hope to change anymore.I have been a freak, an  outcasted person through all of my life. I always see myself as a second class person. I am ashamed of myself. I am 28 years old I don't feel like an adult. I feel like a disgusting worm, a parasite that sucks on people. I feel like I don't deserve a respect. I can't exist in society. Nobody truely loved me, nobody respects me and I got  so used to it. It feels very strange when I recieve respect or normal behaviour from other people. I always feel like a very guilty person, a person with a big fault and I let people behave me like that. The only girl I truly loved, also left me, the only girl made me feel like I am not a worm, I am a normal person left me when saw what I am. I feel like I don't deserve to be loved by a decent respected person. I am constantly trying to change since I am 6 years old. I can't stand it anymore, the same plot keeps going on and on repeatedly. I used to have a hope to be a resptected normal adult, with loving family of his own. But I am 28 and nothing changed I am still the person everybody disgust and avoid just like my childhood. I tried to improved, see psychologist, tried to change my mindset but nothing worked. I don't have any hope to be changed anymore. I have absouletly no joy in living. I would never suicide because of my sister. If I do it it would totally destroy her and I can't foresee what would happen to her. So I can't do this to her. The only reason for a long time that I did not kill myself is my sister. But this life is not sustainable anymore. It is like an hell.  This feeling of inadquacy and guilt is not standable anymore. I just wanted to share.
