I wish I wouldâ€™ve killed myself when I had the chanceEvery day just gets worse and worse. Deadlines are coming up, work, school, business, I just canâ€™t keep up with it anymore. I shouldâ€™ve killed myself back when I was strong enough to do it. 

No one listens to me, my cries for help, my complaints, or anything. To them, talking about Suicide and depression is just another joke I make to them. My emails are piling up with complaints. I just canâ€™t anymore. Suicide/text lines are a joke, and no one listens to me. I wished I wouldâ€™ve listened to myself and killed myself last year.
