I canâ€™t sleepI feel so frustrated. I can never sleep. Every week I have an episode of staying awake for 3 days straight. Working under exhaustion and hallucinations. I also have a separate period of being awake 2 days straight. Sleeping medicine makes me feel drowsy all day when I wake up. Drinking makes my body hurt the next day and itâ€™s gotten way too bad. 

I hate this so much. I just want to end it so I can sleep but I have a few people who love me. I donâ€™t want to hurt them but I hate this so much. Iâ€™m so tired..... Iâ€™m so fucking tired....
