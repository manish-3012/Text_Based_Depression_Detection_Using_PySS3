An Entire Day Without Wanting to Commit Suicide - What's WrongSomething bad must be just around the corner because I had no overwhelming desire for suicide today. This isn't like me.

While my day was filled with emptiness as usual, I did not feel despondent. It's times like these that I use to remind myself when I do feel suicidal: "life doesn't get much better. Even if you survive today, there's not anything worth living for anyway."

I hope that's not discouraging for others but that's just how I feel.

I'm curious if others feel similarly.
