Presentation/Tour and Vivid Suicidal ThoughtsI have to give a tour tomorrow at an institution. I've already done a practice round essentially with one of my course instructors, but tomorrow's is graded. I felt prepared last time, but since I've been relapsing, everything is becoming increasingly more difficult. Also, my suicidal thoughts are occuring daily. When I try to go through my tour plan in my head, I keep having these vivid daydreams that I'm going to kill myself by jumping from a height tomorrow. I don't want to give a bad tour tomorrow, but I can't even prepare mentally or really make any revisions because I can't think straight. Everything leads back to me killing myself, and I certainly don't want to traumatize anyone from my suicide.

I feel like I'm breaking mentally, and I can hardly get anything done in a day now. My mornings start so slow. It takes me forever to get out of bed. I just want to kill myself the moment I wake up. I still have to finish a paper before my tour, too. So I'm feeling so overwhelmed because I can't fully concentrate on one task. Which makes it difficult for me to sleep. I'm trying to get rid of these thoughts, but I literally can't stop wanting to kill myself. Everything in my life is perfect and should be so easy, but I'm not happy and everything is so hard with my mental health right now. I don't understand what wrong with me.

I've made future plans to look forward to, but even those don't seem that great. Or I guess they don't seem like they'll bring me any long-term happiness. My mind's a mess, and I just want to die. I'm fucking exhausted
