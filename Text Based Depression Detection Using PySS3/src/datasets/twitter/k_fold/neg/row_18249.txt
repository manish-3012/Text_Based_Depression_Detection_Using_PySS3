Infinite CycleI know what I will do and how I'll do it. It's just a matter of when.

Heartbreak after heartbreak. There's no one out there besides my family who needs me. I want to be wanted. I like to be needed. I have no control over most relationships. They are always ended by the other person.

I watched a thirty second clip about the evolution of man. I feel pretty bad to end it after billions of years of successful survival.
