Feeling very depressed and stressed. Someone who's actually caring that can talk?I feel like there's such a dearth of caring or affectionate people on this planet. Why does everyone have to be so terrible or indifferent? 

I write paragraphs and paragraphs of text just to make someone feel important, and I can never get that in return.
