My note, I'm done.I'm sorry I didn't do it earlier, I should have done it 2 years ago when I first planned it out.

I'm worthless, I know that I've always known that. I hope you realize that my life was worthless and I was never going to do anything good with my time. I wasted countless amounts of your money playing games, mostly because they were the only "escape" I had, I wish I hadn't though.

I hope you know it isn't your fault, It's no one but my own fault for this, I'm sorry though.
