I feel like I am towards the end.I have recently been under a lot of stress. I started a new job. My long term fiancÃ© has left and I'm going to have to sell my house and won't be able to afford to buy another. Everything is on top of me and I don't want to wake up. Every day I think about how I would do it. I want to end now because my life has become useless and pointless. My mental health has deteriorated over the past few weeks a lot quicker than ever before and I can't stop my feelings. 
I would slit my own wrists to have her hold me while j bleed out.
