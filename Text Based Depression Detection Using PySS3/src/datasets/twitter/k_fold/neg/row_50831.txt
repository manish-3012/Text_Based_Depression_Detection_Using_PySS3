I think I'll cut my last string that tie me to this life tomorrowSo... Tomorrow is my appointment with my therapist. I think I'm gonna say goodbye to her. I haven't acted on my suicidal thoughts because I haven't said goodbye to me therapist. I want to thanks her properly. After I say goodbye, I'll free and can go for any plan I have. 

Well... That's it.
