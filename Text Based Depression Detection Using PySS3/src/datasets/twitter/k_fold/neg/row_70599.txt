BPD is tearing me apart, so is my lack of friendsi don't really know what to type here except when a friendship goes badly i take it very harsh due to bpd, on the bright side i am clingy, caring, affectionate, and loving when i am "happy". i'm 18 and i've dealt with depression for the majority of my life. i'd just like a few friends who would show they actually cared, for now i don't consider suicide on my list of priorities because i still have stuff ton hang on to. the thought comes up often though, but i don't act on it.
