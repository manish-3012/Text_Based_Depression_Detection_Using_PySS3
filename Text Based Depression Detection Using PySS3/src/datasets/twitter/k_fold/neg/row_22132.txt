what the fuck to doah, here i am again. back on r/suicidewatch. the olâ€™ familiar smell of depression.

so. i planned on killing myself on april 25th but i didnâ€™t. i tied chords around my neck a few times in the hopes of strangling myself because i simply didnâ€™t know what to do anymore. the ways iâ€™d actually like to kill myself with are inaccessible for me which sucks dick.

i dunno, iâ€™m desperate. iâ€™m just a teen so this stuff is Normal and blah blah blah but i donâ€™t really care. i continue to fuck up everything there is to fuck up and iâ€™m tired, so i wanna go. i wanna turn off my conscience and not think about my familyâ€™s reaction because sure they care about me, but i donâ€™t want to live for them anymore. i donâ€™t want to live just because otherwise iâ€™ll be selfish. 

i need to be selfish for once.
