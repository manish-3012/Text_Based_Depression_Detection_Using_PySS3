Stopped having suicidal thoughts, but still extremely depressed and slowly killing myself by neglecting basic needs to survive (ex. eating, drinking water, getting out of bed)Iâ€™m extremely grateful that I have been able to stop actively looking for a way to kill myself, I was feeling suicidal for months and it feels great to have that feeling be gone. The thing is though I donâ€™t want to take any action to commit suicide, but I feel like Iâ€™m not taking care of myself anymore. Most days I stay in my bed for majority of the day. My appetite is virtually gone so I barely eat anything if I even eat at all. My room is a mess and Iâ€™m a very organized and clean person before I started slipping back into depression and suicidal thoughts. Sometimes when I stand up my vision blacks out and I feel like Iâ€™m going to pass out. Iâ€™m not thinking or trying to kill myself anymore, but Iâ€™m allowing myself to completely deteriorate and I donâ€™t really care if I die because of my neglect. I just feel so numb that I donâ€™t do anything to allow myself to rot away.
