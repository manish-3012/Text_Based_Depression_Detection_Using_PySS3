Thinking Of Ending ThingsI (F22)really donâ€™t know what to say. For the past few weeks Iâ€™ve been thinking of ending things. For about eight years Iâ€™ve been battling depression, body image issues and anxiety. Iâ€™m very closed off and rarely talk about my feelings towards anyone bc I was raised in a home where talking about those things was unheard of. For the past two years, my anorexia has gotten really bad. I was 180 in 2018. I am currently 105 and have only digested black coffee and water mostly. I donâ€™t eat bc I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to. Everyone hates me at the moment. My family. My friends. My now exboyfriend. I have no one and I know theyâ€™ll be happier without me. I have nothing and am nothing. Iâ€™m either waiting for my anorexia to kill me or I might walk into the road. What do I do. Iâ€™m lost and I want to go away.

Tl;dr I want to kill myself. Everyone hates me and I have no one to turn to.
