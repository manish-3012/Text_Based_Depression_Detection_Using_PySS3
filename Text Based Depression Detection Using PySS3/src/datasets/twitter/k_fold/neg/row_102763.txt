Expectations of Life1. Go to college and graduate in a useless degree that I feel passionate about.
2. Have a 9 to 5 job for at least 40 or 50 years of my life with some lame vacations, just watching my dreams drown.
3. Taxes, taxes, taxes. Financing shit. An apartment. Rent, food, lighting, heat, gas, Internet, water, fucking utilities. Leases and some horrible housing shit.
4. Being trapped in this country which I donâ€™t love, and being asked to â€œbe grateful.â€ Of course Iâ€™m grateful, but that doesnâ€™t mean I conform with living here.
5. Financing my retirement, because that is supposed to be the meaning of life. Retirement and fucking taxes.
6. Bank, money, bank, money.
7. Once retired, living the good life. Right? Just wait until you get fucking sick, and youâ€™re fucking alone.
8. Then, Iâ€™ll die.

Iâ€™ll be dust. And I was never, ever happy. Only during sex, if I ever find someone to have sex with.
