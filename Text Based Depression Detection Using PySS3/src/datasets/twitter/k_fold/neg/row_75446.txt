Diagnosed as adult with:

Major depressive disorder 
Anti social Personality disorder 
Failed at every job 
Chose abusive relationships lost children then suffered a mental breakdown I have nothing to live for no family who I can really rely on I have no idea how Iâ€™m still here, yes I do my children but how can I be here dying inside alone with imaginary hope one day they will want the close family I planned us to be? 
How do I not be alone Iâ€™m agoraphobic and antisocial? 
Nobody knows me Iâ€™m recluse isolated lonely have 0 friends numbers in my phone Iâ€™ve had most of my teeth removed canâ€™t wear the dentures due to constant sickness as I write this today the actual thought of going into detail about how I came to be in this situation kills me I just want to not wake up.
Every single hour Since diagnosis I feel degraded and guilty for needing help and support and that makes everything so much harder I just need to not wake up.
Pretty much my life CV.. fuck this life!
