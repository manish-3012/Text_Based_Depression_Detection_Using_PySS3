The second top most post of all time in this sub sums up my feelings at the minute perfectly - A goodbye.Nobody cares about your depression. Nobody. Until you make the ultimate decision and suddenly everyone makes a big fuss about how "loved" you were and how much they're all going to miss you. 

If you cared so much then where were you when I was crying my eyes out at 2am and just needed to vent? Where were you when I was drowning inside my own head and all I needed was a hand to ground me, tell me that I AM appreciated. That I'm NOT worthless. 

I'm nothing but a burden you would rather ignore. Until it's too late to ignore me, so you put on your mask of concern to keep up appearances. It's the way of the world. It's sad, but it's true. 

Rant part over.

I feel calmer now that I've decided to do it. That's strange isn't it? Years of trying to get healthy and be... Normal I suppose, have done little to help, but finally deciding to just do it has brought me peace. Given me a twisted sort of purpose. It's funny looking at it like that. I've bought my supplies and they're on the way. I'm going to spend this week writing letters to people. I'm only sorry about a few of them really. My brother and his kids mostly. He'll read this, because I'm going to give him all of my stuff anyway, so I want reiterate that I don't blame you bruv, you had enough going on. But I think you'll be better without me. I've done enough damage already. I'll write to the kids too, but I trust you to know which parts to tell them and which parts to keep to yourself. Don't tell anyone I pissed myself! ^^Haha

It's too much. Living like this isn't living, it's a sad struggle that seems to have no end. I can't do it any more. Saturday night after work I'm locking myself away with a bottle of whisky and some music and I'm doing it. And I'm really OK with it.
