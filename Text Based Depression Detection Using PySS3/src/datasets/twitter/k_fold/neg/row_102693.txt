I'm worried, I just wrote my Suicide noteI've always had a problem dealing with my emotions. I don't want to cope anymore. There's nothing wrong with my mind although many times I had hoped there was. I'm sorry for all the hurt I have caused. I don't want anyone to think this was their fault. It's mine. 
Ben: I have loved you ever since the day we first kissed. I'm sorry for everything I did wrong. I didn't want to hurt you. I really thought we were going to be together forever. Please remember all the good times we had they were some of the happiest times of my life. This is NOT your fault. I'm sorry we didn't get along in the end, ill love you always my Ben. 
Tom: you are a wonderful person. Please stay away from the drink and the drugs. Thank you for being the best friend anyone could ask for and for being there for me when I needed you. Why did you stop caring? It doesn't matter. Ill be seeing you. I love you. 
Danny: I missed you. I'm sorry for what happened and I'm sorry we didn't get to spend more time together. Thank you for being my friend all that time and for being there. Remember, never tickle a sleeping dragon. 
Lauren: you are the most wonderful person I know. This is not your fault. Have fun in Rome for me. 
Mum and dad: you are great parents. I'm sorry. Don't be sad. I love you both. And Charlie, I love you too. 
I can't apologise enough. You all deserve a better person in your lives than me. I am so sorry.
