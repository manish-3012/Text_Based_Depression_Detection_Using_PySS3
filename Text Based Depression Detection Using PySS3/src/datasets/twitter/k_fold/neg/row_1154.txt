Whatâ€™s the best thing to say in a suicide letterI already know that Iâ€™m gonna lie about a lot of things. Gonna say stuff like â€œyou were always there for meâ€ stuff like that. Whatâ€™s some specific things I can say to make it slightly easier on them?

Also I donâ€™t want them feeling guilty. Would it be a good idea to bring it up like â€œppl usually feel guilty when this happens, but I donâ€™t hold you accountable and donâ€™t think u should feel guilty, etcâ€ or would that make them think that I actually do hold them accountable and that Iâ€™m lying
