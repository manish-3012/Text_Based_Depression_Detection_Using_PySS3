I don't know what this is.I cannot believe myself. I have a completely normal life. I go to school, eat, come home, take a nap, do work. Yet I feel so lost. I don't know what I want to be when I grow up, and I feel like I am taking advantage, or being selfish when I say that I am depressed. I have been like this since last May, and since then, this cloud of dark thoughts have only worsened. I have started cutting, purging, and even developed suicidal thoughts. I feel happiness when I'm with my family...but that happiness is gone as soon as they are gone. I can't rely on a therapist for financial reasons, and even though I have told my mother, I don't want her to worry about me. I have stopped talking with my friend; she has been giving me a hard time. We had been friends for 4 years, but I don't sit with her anymore.

In addition to this, I have had so many years of low self-esteem. I've moved to different schools when I was younger, and it was hard making friends. The last time I moved schools was 7 years ago, and you'd think someone who had been in a school with the same group of people would have a friend group, but nope. That didn't happen.

In 4th grade, I feel everything changed. I lived a double life, one for the outer world to see, and one for my family. I'd be so childish and goofy in front of my family, but so quiet in front of my peers. I did not feel comfortable to speak, especially when I was given pity comments, like "I feel sorry for you." I was soon bullied at school (in 5th grade) where a girl would throw a gluestick and ask me to "Fetch it." And then came the shame of talking to the teacher to resolve the matter.

In middle school, I thought, "Wow! This is an opportunity to improve and grow upon myself!" In 7th grade, things went so smoothly. I had a good friend, we were friends, we connected. I was so happy. Until in 8th grade, when she claimed to have "Held a knife to her throat, trying to commit suicide." The rest of my 8th grade year was pretty crappy. I sat alone, spoke to no one, and came home crying, thinking it was my fault. I made her see the counselor. She spoke and had with everyone except me.

9th grade. High school starts, I have the optimistic attitude that any incoming freshman would have. I set goals for myself. I joined the Cross Country team, joined new clubs. I had so much fun. I couldn't believe it when my friend came and apologized (though it's not her fault at all) for her actions. I forgave her and we started eating lunch together, and had fun. This all ended in 10th grade.

I was always desperate for friends. I felt so energized, being around people. If they spoke something and I wanted to speak as well, I wouldn't speak because I'd be so scared. But soon I met another friend. Eh...let's call her Sarah (not her real name). So Sarah and I would have so much fun in P.E., she was so nice to me. However, she knew that I was a good student, and would always ask me to send pictures of my homework to her. I'd say yes (though I didn't want to) and this eventually became a hassle. For Spanish, she'd texted me for a translation. I didn't reply because she could have used Google Translate or the textbook to answer. I was so annoyed and fed up. The next day onwards, she'd started to avoid me. In addition to this, where I sat lunch were a group of boys that would throw food and juice near my direction. And my friend would say things like, "I wish I could jump off a cliff. I wish I was dead." Since then, I started doubting myself and fell into a black hole.

I am currently in 11th grade and have stopped talking to my friend.  I no longer can talk to my parents as they have high expectations. And I can't ask anyone for help, because apparently, I should "snap out of it, grow up, and have a valid reason to be depressed". I've considered ending my life, even (have been planning it). I don't know what I should even do. I am afraid of being judged. I am afraid of hurting someone else by telling this. I wish I can fade into nothingness. Or give this life away to someone who deserves it. I never asked for any of this.

Sorry for the long story, and I will delete this post if it is bothering anyone (again I am sorry that I posted this, I know my situation is minor compared to other people out there).
