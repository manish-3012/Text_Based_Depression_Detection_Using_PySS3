They don't care that I'm suicidal and depressed as fuck, they only care that I smoke weedWent to an intake appt. today for a partial hospitalization program. I really need to be in some sort of program at the moment. My suicidal ideation is really strong and I just have these really strong random thoughts about hurting myself. I can't control them they come out of nowhere. I don't even know where to start with my depression, its just all consuming. It's who I am.

They turned me away because I admitted I use weed as my crutch. I told her honestly that I smoke everyday and use it a lot. I also admitted that its the only thing that has helped for the last few years. They think I need a substance abuse program instead. The rude bitch doing my intake said "why don't you just set up more appt. with your therapist?" 

I cant even get fucking help right. I'm hopeless and I'm a piece of shit. I deserve all the pain that I get and then some. I hope they're okay with what they've done. Wonder how they'll feel after I kill myself or put myself back in the hospital for trying to kill myself.

I need real fucking help, I need to be in an intensive day program with groups. Not some half assed substance abuse program that I don't even need in the first place.
