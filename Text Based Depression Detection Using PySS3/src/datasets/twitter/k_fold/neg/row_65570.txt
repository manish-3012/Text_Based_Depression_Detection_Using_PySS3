My doctor wants me hospitalized because Iâ€™m an addict.I should have seen this coming with the amount of texts I sent him and the appointments I kept making and cancelling, all of this within one week. 

Iâ€™m an addict to xanax and I need help. I know it but at the same time, I donâ€™t see whatelse I am supposed to do to calm myself down. Iâ€™m done with alcohol and weed, I donâ€™t want to go back down this path. He wants me to be hospitalized for a short period of time but Iâ€™ve been there twice already and it didnâ€™t help since Iâ€™m still fucking suicidal to this day. 

I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m such a mess, my life is a mess and I donâ€™t know how to survive.
