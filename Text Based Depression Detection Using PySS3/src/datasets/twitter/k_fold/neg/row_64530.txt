Just broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years. I can't live with these constant reminders.i had been neglecting her for the past three months. i sohuld have caught on but i didnt. last week she told me she wanted to breakup and i wanted to change. i tried so hard to change but she kept yelling at me for being too suffocating. one second i'm neglecting her and the next im too much. i couldnt take the yelling and i snapped. i broke up with her and drove her to her dorm in university instead of our apartment. i regret it so much. ive texted her too many times. i cut my arms all the way down to my elbow. i talked to my mom and she's on her way ove rhere but i dont want to continue living. i have plans of killing myself next month if things dont get better. shes my first girlfriend, my first love, my first kiss. we broke up one time before and i obsessed over her. i couldnt stop thinking ofher. god i dont want to do taht again. but it seems apparent she doesnt want to work through our problems so i had to end it. i regret it so much. maybe i could have lived with her yelling at me for a few months and things would have returned to normal. im so fucking stupid. i dont have any friends. my only contact with anyone that cares about me is my family about once a month, my parents are divorced, but they each live about 1hr30min from me. they care about me but i cant convince myself that that's enough. i would destroy them by killing myself but its not enough. i just wanat to die
