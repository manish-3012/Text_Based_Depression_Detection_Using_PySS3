Why is it so hard to actually pull the trigger?I don't really like living at all, I want to die, I'm only 19, and I don't want to be here anymore, Im in america, I could literally walk out rn go to a store and within an hour have a shotgun that can quickly emd me fast and painless, no more pain, no more stress, no more worry, just, peace

Yet it's the hardest decision for me to make
