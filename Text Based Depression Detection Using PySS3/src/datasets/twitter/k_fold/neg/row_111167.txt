I wish that I could kill my emotions.I can't fucking take it. For starters, I'm a mess today because it's the two-month anniversary of almost dying in a car crash and nearly dying from internal bleeding, so the PTSD kicks in.

And then, I get romantically rejected again, by someone I actually really love who just told me that they've been seeing someone else but were too afraid to tell me because they knew I'd be hurt. and even throughout seeing this other person, he's still flirted with me until I asked. He tells me he still loves me, but I don't feel loved at all anymore. It's actually the second time I've been rejected like that in a row and I honestly think the world is just trying to tell me it will never happen for me. 

I wish I didn't have tears in my eyes, I wish I could know why the fuck the universe would pull such bullshit on me. I wish everything wasn't always so unfair. I wish I didn't just want to fall asleep and never wake up again.

I just want to cry myself to sleep and not deal with anything. I want to cry so hard I don't cry ever again. I hate having emotions, falling for people so hard, and getting flashbacks from the accident. I hate loving people, it's only ever resulted in me getting hurt. 

I just need to kill my emotions. I don't want to feel anything for anyone anymore. I want to rip my heart out of my fucking chest. 

I need to go to bed but now I'm so angry and upset that I can't. I've taken a lot of melatonin and I want to take more but I can't feel a single bit tired from how worked up I am. 

there's no hope for me. maybe i deserved to die in that car crash.
