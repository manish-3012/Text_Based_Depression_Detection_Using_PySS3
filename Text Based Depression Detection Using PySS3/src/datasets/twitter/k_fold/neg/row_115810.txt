This is the most terrified feeling ever, I have never been so scared in my life...This isn't about me. This is about a good friend. We were just in a conversation and it went into some dark stuff about our past. Both of us suffer from anxiety and occasional depression, and hers is relapsing. She doesn't exactly have the best family life, her father, mother, and sister are verbally abusive, and her father left her mother 3 years ago for another woman with a child he liked more. And just last week, she moved away from everyone she knew to live in a city about an hour to the south with her mother. She has a lot of serious issues stemming from this, and she dumped them all out for me to see tonight. Her most recent texts are so... hollow. When I asked her if she wanted to talk about the depression she's in right now, she gave me a simple no, followed by a text saying "I feel so empty inside". She then proceeds to tell me how she has no friends and is "going crazy", even as I try to assure her otherwise. And now, complete silence. Her last text was "thanks, but I have no friends". That was nearly an hour ago as of this post. It is about 2:00 am EST, and she stopped responding around 1 am. No response. I'm terrified. What if she's suicidal? What if she's doing it now? What if she's *already dead*? I don't know her new address, so I can't call the police.      

I'm scared, guys. It's the worst feeling, not knowing if your friend is dead or not. She could be asleep, but I can't shake the feeling that she's about to die. And I'm the one who caused this, I had to vent my own family issues. I've hurt someone really close to me, possibly even killed... and I can't stop crying. Any sort of advice or help is welcome, please.    

I'm on mobile, on a dying phone, so sorry about the wall of text. But just bear with me, I seriously need to get this out there.
