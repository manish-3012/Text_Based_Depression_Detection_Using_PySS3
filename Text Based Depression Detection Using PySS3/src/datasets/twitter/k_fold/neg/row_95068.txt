I fully donâ€™t know what makes me want to kill myself more: school or home?Iâ€™m still in high school, and these have been the worst years of my life. At school I have no friends, and thereâ€™s just a very strong mean girl/bully culture that I canâ€™t stand (itâ€™s an all girls). Obviously Iâ€™ve tried making friends, but none of the friendships have been that genuine.

At home I feel like I have no one to talk to and I canâ€™t truly express myself because my family is very judgemental, they donâ€™t trust me, and theyâ€™re just not accepting of a lot of things. I also have no one to talk to â€” because every time I tell them about my real emotions they just invalidate them, and say Iâ€™m over exaggerating. Iâ€™m also the only girl and Iâ€™m the youngest, and I strongly feel that they donâ€™t respect me and look down on me because of that. The arguments always â€œwell youâ€™re only sixteen, youâ€™re being dramaticâ€ or â€œIâ€™m sure itâ€™s not that badâ€ or â€œyouâ€™re the reason youâ€™re sadâ€

I have so many emotions, but no one to talk to them about and it makes me feel so lonely. A lot of the time I feel like: maybe I am being over dramatic, like Iâ€™m just too sensitive and I should just get over myself. But itâ€™s getting so hard to see the silver lining in situations when both my home and my school life make me sad. I always canâ€™t help but think â€” what if I end it all? A lot of the times it feels like no one would care anyways, and it would be better because Iâ€™m just a burden. It would be easier for everyone else to not have to think about me anymore.
