Feeling like Iâ€™m a phony againAccepted that I was depressed and suicidal. Got meds a few months ago. Now I can function and feel fine, mainly empty. I still feel bad but thereâ€™s no real reason behind the feeling. I still feel down but itâ€™s no where near as bad as it used to be. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve gotten better and now Iâ€™m just pretending to be a sad fuck again. I donâ€™t know why. Maybe for attention. I donâ€™t know. 

I want to feel like I did before meds. It was horrible but at least I felt like it was real. Now I just feel empty and fake.
