whits endPeople donâ€™t understand people with suicidal thoughts.

Iâ€™m tired of hearing that people want those who are suicidal to reach out to them. The reason people are successful at suicide is because they truly donâ€™t care to tell people because they know people donâ€™t *actually* care. Because they think that if they run to people for help, they are viewed as weak and attention seeking. The reason I havenâ€™t reached out to anyone about my suicidal thoughts is because I feel like people will just think Iâ€™m attention seeking. Thatâ€™s why people are successful at it. 

Iâ€™m having a mental break down because I am so fed up with my existence. I have image dysmorphia and hate photos being taken of me because I donâ€™t think I look like my photos and I am annoyed when I see myself in photos because I am ugly. My chin is crooked from a motor accident from when I was little and it causes so much painful insecurity. I am overweight and there are some really evil people out there who love to tell me I am. My boyfriend and I have been together two years and we barely have one photo together because I hate photos taken of me. I donâ€™t want to be like this.

I feel like a failure because I am 27, still renting an apartment, only one full year into my college education, and I still donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life. I was getting overwhelmed with a project for class a few weeks ago and had a total nervous break down and I jotted down, â€œThe only thing that has stopped me from taking my own life is because it would devastate my grandparentsâ€. I am up here visiting them this week, and took apart a bird house to clean up with my grandfather. Building birdhouses has been our thing since forever. As I was cleaning out a house, he had written inside: â€œI love my rooster so much it hurtsâ€. He has called me rooster since I was a child because I always wake up at the crack of dawn. Seeing his note made me cry on the inside, I love my grandfather just the same.  


My nana just tried handing me a donut and I refused, which led into this whole explanation of me trying so hard to discipline myself and asked her not to offer me the donut. I am explaining all of my pain and my thoughts to her a a few minutes ago and she is just not understanding - she is saying all the cookie cutter words like â€œJust stay positive / remind yourself of your blessings / look at all of the people with deformities and those fighting for their lifeâ€. And I am screaming inside, like, TRUST ME, I GET IT. I had cancer and fought for my life. I do have deformities in my appearance. Everyone who knows me knows how positive I am and how much I remind myself of my blessings. I broke down and explained how broken I feel inside and she got so pissy about it, saying â€œI donâ€™t get why people are suicidal but freak out over a spider bite thinking theyâ€™re going to die, if youâ€™re so fed up with life just starve yourself until you dieâ€, because yesterday, I was freaking out I was bitten by a brown recluse, and now I am complaining about being overweight and wanting to die. I told her she just doesnâ€™t get it and she became so defensive over her stance, without understanding where I am coming from. Telling me to seek counseling, but I think counseling is a load of horse shit, and I also donâ€™t have the finances for it.  


Everyone has their chemical imbalances. Iâ€™m at my fucking whits end. I randomly just envision myself and want to end it all in a split second, but always think of how it will devastate my grandparents. I donâ€™t care about anyone else being effected, but I know it would be too much for my grandparents to bare and thatâ€™s kind of the only reason I havenâ€™t. That, and because of my religious beliefs. I donâ€™t know, man. Iâ€™m at a real fucking low. I just want to take control over my life and my discipline and not be fat, and not have a stupid crooked face and pretty skin. Iâ€™ve had ongoing acne for 10+ years. Itâ€™s hard being a female and seeing all of these beautiful fucking girls with their perfect symmetrical face, nice skin and looking cute in anything they put on.   


Now I feel guilty for wasting the little time I came to visit my grandparents with complaining over my mentally unstable thoughts and breakdown. I didnâ€™t even want to break down, the conversation just swayed that way. I want my grandparents to settle down into their retirement without having to stress over their kidâ€™s drama (my aunts new divorce from a predator) and my mental instabilities. I try to keep all of my worries and responsibilities on my own plate, but when people are prying, pointing fingers and not understanding, I become a wreck.  


And today I am a wreck, all because I tried to take a photo of myself and realized how fat and ugly I am.
