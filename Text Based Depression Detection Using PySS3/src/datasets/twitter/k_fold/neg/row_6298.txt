No one cares donâ€™t tell me to think of them when they dont think of meEveryone in my life has proved they dont care, I tried this morning and a stupid mistake meant I failed, I was too exhausted to try again so I slept. I havent left my room all day, I havent drank or ate, my friend ignored me when i said i was suicidal and iâ€™ve been left alone. Tonight when my mum is asleep iâ€™m going to do it, I donâ€™t know how yet. Donâ€™t tell me the people around me will miss be theyâ€™ve proved they wonâ€™t and now that I know it I can die.
