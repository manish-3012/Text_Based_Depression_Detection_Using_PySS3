Is life really worth living?Im not suicidal like at all... But i do question if life is even worth living. I know people die of cancer and this is extremely rude of me to say since i have a good crack at a happy life. But sorry not to sound depressing but i dont see how anyone can be happy in such a selfish world. This world just flat out sucks. So why am i here? Why are you here? Shouldn't there be a goal in the end? Besides getting married and having kids and being happy with a normal life?
