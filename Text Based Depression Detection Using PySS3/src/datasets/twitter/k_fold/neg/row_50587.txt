No one is hearing my desperate cries for help, Iâ€™m shouting into the void here.No one seems to read this but Iâ€™ll vent anyway. I majorly fucked up, mania, lorazepam and the loss of an SO created the perfect storm for my craziness to come out. I think my friends made a chat room without me in it, and fair enough I get it but it still hurts so much, they didnâ€™t intend for me to find out but they obviously didnâ€™t care if I did. I cut a bunch of times and Iâ€™m not even feeling better. If youâ€™ve made it this far in this post, itâ€™s not even that far anyway but thank you. My friends donâ€™t leave me on read anymore they just leave me on nothing. Itâ€™s my fault, I was just me for a bit and I let myself get attached, if serves me right Iâ€™ll die alone. Someone please help me, I always make covert cries for help but this is just a regular cry for help, Iâ€™m not okay, I need help, I just need someone to be there for me. Thanks.
