I'm out of energy to have panic attacksI'm sitting outside, staring at a tree and commenting on Reddit to try and distract myself from my life. I've been out here all night crying and trying to keep myself together. Panic attacks, one after another that's just relentless. I can't afford my meds, but I can't afford the emotional taxation this is causing. I just want to die because I'm tired. I'm depressed and stressed but I'm just tired. I want a good day. Just one.
