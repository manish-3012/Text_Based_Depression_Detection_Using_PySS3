What's the point in livingSeriously like a 9-5 isnt my forte, I hate kids, I don't have the ability to pursue both my passions and a job, everyone in my life uses me for emotional support but no I'm a downer if I ever do the same. I just think I'd rather be dead but once I'm at this point again they only try preventing the suicide but never help me get better. I think I've honestly had enough living at this point and I dont wanna hate myself anylonger
