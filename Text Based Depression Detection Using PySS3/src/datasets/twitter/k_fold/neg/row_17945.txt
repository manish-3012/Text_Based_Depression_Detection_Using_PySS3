How do I tell this to my therapist?I have a plan and I don't know if I can keep myself from committing to it on my own. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow. I rationally know I need to tell her. But because of my emotions I am avoiding anything and everything that could help me feel better or make me change my mind because I don't want to start doubting myself and I just want this (pain, life) to be over. How do I tell my therapist this?
