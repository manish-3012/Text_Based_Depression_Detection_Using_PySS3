Feeling like crap tonightHi SW, so I'm feeling at a personal low since a period of about a year. Usually, I hit my low of my depression around this time of year, but its usually manageable any time out of the deep winter. I think its the lack of sunlight that gets me.

Anyway, I had an argument with my parents, and that's something that always brings it out. Typically, we never fight (maybe once a year, or once every eighteen months) because I stay out of trouble and do good in college. Well when we got into this fight, I went into my room to cool off, so I didn't say anything stupid. While I was in my room, I reverted into my one of my worst states, using all my energy to keep suicide off my mind.

Even as I'm typing this, I realize how many issues I have. I'm afraid. I've never been able to admit that to myself because I've never been able to talk anonymously. I guess I do need some counselling at the least. I use marijuana irregularly, and its been one of the most helpful things I've ever used in helping fight my depression. So for this reason, I know I can get better. There has to be a way, if drugs can help, I've got to be able to reach that place without them. I just don't know how.

Any advice, I feel like I'm at my wit's end here, and I don't want to end up trying to kill myself like I used to. That much I know, I want to live. I'm not there right now, but I feel like the littlest thing could put me over the edge. Any thoughts or comments would be so helpful. Thank you in advance for taking the time to post.
