when are things gonna start being interesting againI literally can't feel anything but complete boredom. I spend my day switching between tiktok and reddit, scrolling through 2 posts and then switching because it's just so boring. I used to be very into video games, but now I can't do it because it's so fucking boring. what's there to even live for if I don't get genuine enjoyment out of anything.
