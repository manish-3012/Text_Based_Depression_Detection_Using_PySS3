I'm constantly sad and I want it to endI've been depressed for as long as I remember. My mother has verbally abused me and has said multiple times that she hates me and originally it hurt but now I'm used to it. The fact that I'm used to it makes me even sadder. I had someone who I talked to and who I fell in love with, she told me that she loved me back and really helped me keep away the suicidal thoughts for a while until I had a bipolar attack and she was on the receiving end and then said that she had never loved me. I moved on somehow and found someone else who cared about me and once again my bipolar screwed up that friendship. Now I'm alone (at least it feels like that) and I don't know why I should bother trying to live on. I told my mum about my depression and she blew it off like it was nothing and didn't understand the caliber of it. She said she would make a doctors appointment so I could talk to someone and forgot the next day. I just want someone who loves me that can accept me for who I am and won't leave me because of something stupid. I am sick of living on this fucking earth where everyone judges me on sight, I want it to end. Every night now I think of killing myself and I want to. One day I will, I know that, but I don't know when.
