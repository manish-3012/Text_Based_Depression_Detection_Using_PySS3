I have no reason to want to die. Yet I'm struggling to live.My life is going better than it ever has. I've moved out of my abusive parent's house, I live with my best friend, I've got a job I love, I'm sober and I'm on anti-depressants. However, I want to die.


I think I'm meant to kill myself. I don't think I was ever meant to live. If this isn't good enough for me nothing ever will be. I think at this point it's only logical to give up.
