i just can't do it anymore.i can't do it anymore. i can't sleep in my room because of arachnophobic intrusive thoughts, i can't sleep downstairs because my stupid worthless sister won't stop fucking taking up the entire sofa and it's impossible to sleep in a chair, im not sleeping in my parents room, the only option left is the fucking bathroom. i can't deal with this anymore. my face is so ugly, i may as well be unlovable, not even my friends want to be around me. no one cares enough. if i even try to talk about it my dad just gets pissy with me. i can't be here anymore. it's too painful. i just need a way out.
