society is so shittyThereâ€™s too many people in this world that are so fixated on their beliefs and it really frustrates me that these said people are having kids passing their ideals down and so on. Racism pisses me off so much and itâ€™s gotten to the point where if I try and speak up about it the person is so dumbfounded and stubborn to their beliefs that I canâ€™t change their mind. I am a white male, I recognize and understand to judge a person on character and some people have such preconceived bullshit implemented in their mind that it infuriates me. I am just sick of living in this type of world. I feel that no one understands me and right now (high school) is about to end for me yet. Everyone is just so fake and goes along with whatâ€™s easiest and most comfortable for themselves only.  Sorry for the rant. I really want to end my life but Iâ€™m a pussy and donâ€™t know which method
