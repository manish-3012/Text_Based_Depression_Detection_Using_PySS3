ConsiderationIâ€™m tired of living. School, anxiety, depression, and high expectations. That combo has ruined any hope for a happy future for me, and I am ready for whatever awaits me on the other side. I will give it a week, as I have many friends that I would like to say goodbye to before leaving, but I am 95% sure I will have moved on by next Monday.
