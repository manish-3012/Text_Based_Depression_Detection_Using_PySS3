Suicide feels like a sensible move for me. I'm 32, a two-time combat vet who suffers from PTSD and anxiety, divorced, recently quit a reasonably good job because I was having anxiety attacks and chest pains. I just don't want to start over again, I'm out of the "can do" attitude I had for years. I keep trying to pull myself out of this depression, I tried to consult friends and family but they keep bringing up religion. I was a try hard and fail christian for my entire life until recently a friend told me "just pray to God and he will reveal himself to you" So I, in total earnest prayed and nothing happened. I don't think I can continue down this path, everyone tells me suicide is a sin, or "you will go to hell". I just think to myself, whatever this game called life is, I don't want to play anymore. It feels like life is just a series of failures no matter how good I have been at things getting my hopes up or planning for the future is essentially a waste of what little energy I have because all things fail. Nothing ever amounts to anything. I know to some people 32 doesn't seem that old, but to me I am half way to 60 and I hate everything about myself and my life. I cannot continue to start over, over and over. What the fuck am I supposed to do from here. What motivation is there for someone who doesn't want to do this anymore?
