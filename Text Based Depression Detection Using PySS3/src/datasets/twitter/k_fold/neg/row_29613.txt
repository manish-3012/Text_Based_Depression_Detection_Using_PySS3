It feels good knowing I can end my life, nowI made a promise to myself that if I wasnâ€™t happy by May of 2019, I would give myself permission to commit suicide. Well, Iâ€™m nowhere near happy. As a matter of fact, I think I have developed PTSD from the last couple of years.

Life holds us down and tortures us. Everything we have, we lose at some point. Every loving relationship we have eventually goes away, or devolves into hatred. Your own body degrades and your mind goes. And thatâ€™s if youâ€™re lucky. Life is not a gift. It is a curse. And when we question why not kill ourselves instead, life replies, â€œHah! You donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to experience nothing! Youâ€™re too scared to do it!â€

And I am scared of death. Iâ€™m scared of experiencing nothingness. Thought I think we may possibly have a soul, I donâ€™t think these souls will experience anything once we die. Itâ€™ll all probably just scatter in different directions, never to form again.

But honestly? There are moments in life where I would gladly call the bluff of life, and kill myself. I donâ€™t care about hurting those who care, because I know theyâ€™ll all go away one day. One day weâ€™ll *all* just go away. And life says to deal with it, because the alternative is nothing. Well I think Iâ€™m ready to call life out on that. Because once I die, life will have nothing left to torture me with. It will be a sort of morbid victory over entropy and pain.
