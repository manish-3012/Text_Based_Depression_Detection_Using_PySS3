Transgender, tried to die before, and now I'm ready again...im 15, transgender mtf. ive felt like this since i was 7 and finally told my step-father (guardian) when i was 14. i regret it. i regret it so much. i've begged for help and asked nicely and even tried being assertive. my family has rejected me on many parts including my cousins who i dearly love's parents.

im so sick of this. im sick of "waiting until im 18" and im sick of being told sorry and im sick of being told theres no answer and im sick of being told i fail to accept life and im sick of being told to just get through it. i did nothing to be born this way. nothing. but everything about my body is wrong. i cant have kids, i cant simply be normal, i cant be loved, i cant even walk around in society without being looked at as a freak. and at the end of the day thats all i am just some gay, freakish man, arent i...

i tried to end my life last march and i was taken to a suicide hospital where i stayed for a whole week. they did nothing, just slapped coping skills in my face and gave me the same old "empathy" number. nothing has been done and im starting to think nothing ever will. literally did not go to gym this entire semester after trying for two months because of the dysphoria and the threats i'd gotten from people in that class. so i left. the gym teacher now hates me, and even though i did all the make up work he failed me. now my dad will find out and he is going to just...its going to make everything worse.

i want to be gone. i want to be gone i want to be gone..._i want to be gone_. its all i want. but i also want help but i seriously doubt anyone can help me anymore...everything hurts. every day. im. done. im so done.

good luck dealing with my impossibilities...if im just going to be a burden to more people sorry..
