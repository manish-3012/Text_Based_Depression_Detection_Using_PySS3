Just a short note to say thank you...... I was really close to the edge a few weeks back. And while I had some other support as well (a new therapist, etc.) -- I really think that this community saved my life.

Thank you so much for giving me support when I needed it. I'm still a bit too timid to post here with my non-throwaway, but I'll get there eventually (I hope). And if I can, I'll help as much as I can.

Thank you for helping me find my own worth in me. And to help me through a scary part of my life and showed me that I'm not alone.
