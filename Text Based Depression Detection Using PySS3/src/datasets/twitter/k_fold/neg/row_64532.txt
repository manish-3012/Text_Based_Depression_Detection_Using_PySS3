I guess itâ€™s finally my time to no longer comment on one of these posts, but instead to make oneâ€¦Not completely ready to take my life or anything. Just need to vent and get advice. 

So, this requires some backstoryâ€¦ Iâ€™m a high school student and back in November this girl (Iâ€™m a guy) approached me and began talking to me one day. Whatever, not that big of a deal. Anyways a couple weeks later, she talks to me again, couple days after that she talks to me again. It ends up becoming a pretty regular thing. Then on one of our final days, she gives me a plate of cookies. For me, I thought this was for sure a sign that she liked me, but Iâ€™m shy so I never really did anything about it. I ended up being able to get her number one day and we continuously chatted on and off during winter break. However post winter break, nothing happened. I still didnâ€™t do anything, and she did nothing either. Well back in February I needed a ride home 2 days in a week, luckily she was able to give me a ride home on one of them, and most would think this is good, I get to talk to her more. Well, for me, that was bad because that weekend was the weekend I intended on asking her out, and if she rejected me there was no way I was going to be comfortable getting a ride. Also while I was walking to her car with her, I overheard her sister behind us talking about how her sisterâ€™s dating someone, I assumed I mustâ€™ve heard my crushâ€™s sister wrong because Iâ€™ve never seen my crush with any dude and acting somewhat romantically. Anyways, the second day that week I asked if she could give me a ride, she said she couldnâ€™t because she was going to have surgery the next day and she needed to do some prep for it. So with that, I didnâ€™t want to ask her out that next weekend, which is now March time, because she was recovering from surgery and all. Then after that I just lost all confidence to ask her out. Well today rolls around and I tell one of my best friends about it all, and about an hour ago, he told me she was in fact dating someone. And now Iâ€™m upset, kinda because I got rejected in a sense, but mostly because I read the entire situation wrong and wasted 5 months worth of emotion. And now Iâ€™m probably the closest to doing something to myself since Chester Bennington passed away a couple years back
