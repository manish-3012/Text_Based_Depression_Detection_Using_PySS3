Stating Facts (Rant)Iâ€™ve been depressed since, well probably since I was thirteen years old and I began to get sick. I was dealing with not being able to eat, no matter what it was, it would just make me sick and I would just throw up repeatedly. I missed school, I lost friends.

As an introvert, I was at a loss for what to do, I had no idea what was wrong. As the middle child in a family that was splitting at the seams, I was the glue holding everything together and I had my first depressive break at the age of 15 when my grandma gifted me an intricately carved pocket knife for my birthday since I was in Boy Scouts. I laid on my bed for close to two hours, holding the blade above my chest, thinking about what a relief it would be to plunge it into my heart and end everything. The thought of how my family would react stopped me though and I got rid of the knife.

When I was 20 the doctors finally figured out what was wrong with me and I was getting better, but the depression wouldnâ€™t leave me alone. Working two part-time jobs without a day off for two years finally wore down on me and I was reduced to sleeping in my car, crying to sleep, because I was so sick of how my life had turned out. I didnâ€™t want to be here anymore, couldnâ€™t figure out why I had spared myself just to have it all come full circle. Again I didnâ€™t do it.

Now 25, I can honestly say I only regret two things in my life. Not ending my life the first time I thought of it, and telling someone that I had these thoughts to begin with. Again, the thoughts are back, and this time I donâ€™t know if I can actually shake them or if I even want to. I think that if I were to get a gun, any gun, aim in at my temple, and pull the triggerâ€¦that everyone, myself included, would be in a better place.
