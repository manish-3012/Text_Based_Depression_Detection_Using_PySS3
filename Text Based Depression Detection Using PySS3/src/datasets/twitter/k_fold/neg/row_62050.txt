Goodbye world, we never liked each other.It's too much to take. The pain, the suffering, the memories, and the regrets, I just can't do this anymore. I've sent hundreds of signs to my family that I am not ok, that I am on the verge of leaving this earth, they just don't care. No one does. People used to "love" me because I used to have an important job and have a house in a touristic city. So they called, they stayed home and enjoyed the gifts from my job. It'll be 10 years since I haven't been able to find a new job and people have abandoned me. I've seen the true face of everyone around me, not my friends, not my sisters stand near me in my time of need. They make fun of my depression, make fun of me, raise their eyebrows when I say something. I asked for nothing, I just wanted to be loved. Hoping that where i'm going, i'll see my dog, she was the only one who made me feel like my life was needed.   
Goodbye world. Hoping I'll finally know rest and happiness soon.
