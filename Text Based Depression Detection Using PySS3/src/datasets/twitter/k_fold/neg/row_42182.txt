I feel like I'm back where I was 2 months agoI've dealt with depression for years, but in the past year it's gotten really bad. About 2 months ago I made a half-hearted suicide attempt that landed me in the mental hospital for a week and an outpatient program for 1.5 months. By the end outpatient program I was feeling much better, so I returned to work full-time.

But now it's only been a couple weeks back at work and I feel like I've relapsed. The depression, obsessive thinking, and anxiety are back in full force and it's unbearable. I know suicide won't fix anything, but it's the only thing I can think about doing to finally give my mind some peace.
