predictability and 'life is a good thing' - why bother anymorei really dont know why i dont just listen to myself. i am not someone who will have friends, or really even contacts, simple as that. but everytime i let myself talk to the next person just for it to eventually fall apart and for me to damage them.

i am basically alone again, go me.

i got used to not being alone, and so now going back feels horrible. i forgot what it was like to think things but have no one to say them to. ill get back to it though, its how ive lived a large majority of my life.



i dont understand the concept of life being good. why is it good? because there is joy at times? what about all those who suffer and experience little joy?

in my opinion no amount of joy overrides suffering. it would be better if no life existed. obviously i cant just eliminate all life, but i can eliminate myself.

ive pushed myself away from the whole suicide thing, i sort of just blocked it from my mind because i had reason to - now i dont. im going to try to convince myself that its the right option and aquire what i need for my preferred method.

just speaking out loud i guess, im not used to not being able to speak yet. gotta ease myself into it.
