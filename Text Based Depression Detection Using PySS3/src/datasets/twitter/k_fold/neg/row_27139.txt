Today I thought about my suicide, painful or painless, my family hates me.I have a problem with my family for a long time, they can't solve that, they pretty much hate me very much. I tried much time to be a different person, but I can't give them what they want.

They tell me that they want to kick me out of the house, I am a mistake in their life, they want me gone. I can do that for them, if they really want that, if that is going to make them happy, better parents to my little sister and better people. 

I am sorry for people, who are in a similar situation I can understand you before when I was a kid, I didn't realize what they told me and how much they hate me. But now I understand everything, for someone 2021. is new hope for a better life, for someone, it's the end? Thanks for reading.
