I'm a wreck and I keep getting worseI've had depression for six years, anxiety for a bit less and I attempted suicide a little over a year ago. I started going to therapy a month or so ago and it seems to help but it also brings out painful memories.
I'm panicking way more frequently than I'm used to. I had a panic attack two days ago and I can barely hold it together now. I keep crying at the drop of a hat and I can't sleep more than a few hours in a row. Today I woke up after a nightmare and my entire body hurt, I lay there for a while crying intermittently and skipped going to work.

I hate that I'm posting here, it feels desperate. I don't want to attempt suicide again, I feel like surviving the last one was another chance at life, but I'm in so much pain and I'm so tired. I can't even picture having a future.
