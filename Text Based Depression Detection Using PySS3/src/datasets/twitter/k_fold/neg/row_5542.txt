I'm so tired of thisThis isn't where I wanted to post but Reddit is making me do it here. My life is the same fucking thing every day. Go to work. Drink until I run out. Sleep for maybe 4 hours. Lay in bed awake until I go back to work.

I hate my life. Work is literally my social life. I have no friends. The last person I considered my friend left the state in 2012 when weed became legal in Colorado. 

My wife bailed on me and took my daughter with her. My daughter is the only reason I'm not dead already.

The only reason I'm posting this right now is because I'm drunk.

I don't want to hurt my daughter but I don't want to live like this.
