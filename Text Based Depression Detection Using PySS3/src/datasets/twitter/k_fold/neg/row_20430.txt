At the crossroadsI won't go into my life story, I'll save that for another time.

I've been unemployed for months after working a night shift for three years, no prospects in sight. 

I have various health issues that include: a manageable yet shitty chronic disease, chronic back pain, and insomnia. 

My anxiety keeps me awake at night. I hunger for distractions to keep awake. 

Every time I try to sleep in my bed I spend at least half an hour tossing in turning to keep my back straight as I lay on it (I take mirtazapine, yet still takes half an hour). 

I feel almost addicted to it since it's pretty much an unconscious time machine yet my anxiety impedes my adherence to it and the rest of my meds.

Talking to this girl, but long distance relationship. Putting in time and effort into building a topheavy Jenga tower.

No future, wasted past, shitty present. I feel incapable of love or empathy. I have ceased to lament these limitations.

I'm thinking about destroying my credit and savings and blow it in a poker tourney or a vacation out of this space I reside in. Destroy myself financially with no heirs to bear the burden and no kin I feel genuinely close to care for it. 

I grow tired of mediocrity. While my various ailments slowly destroy me from the inside I'm the most sick when I wake up limping in this farce of a conscious state.

I have not lived a single moment of my life. I have survived on borrowed time.
