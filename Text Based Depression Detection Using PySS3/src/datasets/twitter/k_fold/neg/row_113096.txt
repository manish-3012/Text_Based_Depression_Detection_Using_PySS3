My kid sisterMy kid sister tried to kill herself today. I know this isn't the typical post on the sub, but I just want her to know how much she means to the world and how it's not the answer.... If anyone is listening and have advice for my 16 year old sister or stories of overcoming your own attempts, I would love to share it with her. Thank you.
