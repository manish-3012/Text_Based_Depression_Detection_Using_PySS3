Only reason why I haven't died yetI have a cat that is 14, had him from 7 weeks old, adopted him from a feral cat community. He sleeps next to me everynight, we both know he is dying .

I also have  dog, he is a rack rusell mix- he was aged at 8 when I got him he'll be age 11 now...sure doesn't act like it!

My point is...my pet's kept me alive. Simba will die soon. I am not okay with that. 14 years  down the drain. I fucking hate this life/die process.....

Simba has been through EVERYTHING with me. If doesn't make it, I don't think I WILL,

Oh and this pisses me off too...I posted a go fund me fundraiser for my cat...none donated. Yet my aunts and ucles took happy trips
