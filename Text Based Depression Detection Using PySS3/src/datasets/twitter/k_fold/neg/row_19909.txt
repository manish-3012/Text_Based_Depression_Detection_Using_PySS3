The language is leaving meI've tried writing suicide notes only to notice even I am not curious about what I have to say.

I've been severely depressed since my early teens. It is as if my life consists of two phases. Childhood phase and the suicidal phase (ongoing for a decade now). I'm drowning in tormenting boredom and losing interest in self expression. Soon I will have nothing to say. Why should I keep dragging this body around? I have nothing to lose except for my "consciousness" (that is, if it can be "lost"). I desire nothing. I can't even tell if time is passing. Just constantly overwhelmed by boredom. Existing makes my whole body ache.

Why doesn't everyone feel this way? Are people brainwashed or something? Nothing we think, say, do or feel matters. Not even in the eyes of other people. I am "stuck" with myself. I don't want to be with myself. I don't want to be.
