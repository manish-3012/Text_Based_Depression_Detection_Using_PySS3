I'm hanging myself tomorrowThe entire foundation of the only joy I've ever felt as been torn out from under me. Now the joy I used to have from her has turned to amplified pain to go on top of the pain of everyday living. I've always hated my life and been depressed but the joy she made me feel kept me hopeful and here. She's torn that away from me without warning, abruptly, and my will to keep going is gone. I've done research, and I plan on buying sturdy rope tomorrow along with tree climbing hooks in order to kill myself via the long drop hang in the middle of a forest at night. I need to escape the pain. Just wanted to get it off my chest. The only way I can imagine living and dealing with the misery of daily life is with that one person. I need that girl in my life to support me and make me feel joy, but the love of my life just cut me off. Thank you for listening, I'll see you on the other side.
