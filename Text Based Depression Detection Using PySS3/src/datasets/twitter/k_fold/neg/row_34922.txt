I look at all the people I know and see how they have relationship meanwhile Iâ€™m too much of a loser to ever have one and Iâ€™m 21 i guess Iâ€™m not good enoughI hate myself I just do but when I see people I knew from high school or know currently from college it kills me to see it hell even my roommate is spending all his time with his gf and it kills me itâ€™s like Iâ€™ll be alone forever last night I tried to kill myself maybe tonight Iâ€™ll try again cause I know Iâ€™ll just never have a relationship
