Feeling as if I'm at the end of a very long roadI'm 25 years old, male, from London, and have struggled with anxiety and depression for around 9 years now. I had my first depressive episode as a result of being socially outcast due to being accused of doing something that would be considered sexually perverse. In the coming days something else shameful may become known about me (no, I haven't harmed anybody or anything like that) and I feel like the cycle may begin again almost a decade later. I would probably lose the vast majority of my friendships yet again and I am beginning to believe that suicide is the best option - I don't believe I'm a good person and I feel I'm a burden on everybody who does help me (my parents and a few friends). I am wishing that someone would talk me out of it in a reasonable way that I can understand. Thanks.
