For the past 3 days, all I can think about is suicideI don't know how it began exactly. I have been dealing with depression (although I have never talked to a doctor yet, I call it depression none the less) for almost a year now, and I have always had on and off thoughts about killing myself, but these past 3 days have been just straight thinking about suicide.  

I could never see myself ever killing myself, but I always think about "I could do this and I would die". I make quick, short plans in my head, but never bring myself to the first step of these 'plans'. These have been going on for the past few months, but over these past few days, they have been much more common. I constantly zone out in school and just think about how easy it would be to end it all, and how few people would miss me, after all, we all die sometime, so why does it matter that my time is now?
