I can't keep doing thisI know my death will hurt the two people who care about me, anyone else just wouldn't give a shit. My cat would be sad, but my friend would care for him and I think he'd be okay eventually. I just don't know if I can go on anymore. I'm on antidepressants, I don't have the money for shrink, and even if I did, what's the point? It's never helped before so why would it help now? I turn 27 in a few days, and every day until now has just been putting off the inevitable and I don't think I can do it anymore.
