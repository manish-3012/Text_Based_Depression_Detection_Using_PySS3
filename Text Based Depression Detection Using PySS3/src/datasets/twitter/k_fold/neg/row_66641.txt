I need to end itMy 40th birthday is 2 months away and I know I'm not going to be here for it. My life is completely empty and pointless. I have no partner, no real friends and my family don't really care about me. This sounds like self-pitying bullshit but it's all facts. I'm in a constant state of despair and misery.

I had a partner and he kept on cheating on me. I kept on forgiving him and in the end he left me because I'm so pathetic. Nobody else is interested in me at all because I'm fat, ugly and past it. Trying to get in shape is a losing battle and even if I did I still wouldn't be worth a second glance.

I am soon starting a new job but I am not in the slightest bit excited because (a) I will be dead not long after I start and (b) I'm not cut out for it anyway

What's the point of any of this? I'm fucking miserable so why put off death when it's inevitable anyway whether it's tomorrow, in 10 years or 40 years? At least I won't feel like utter garbage and I won't have to worry about getting sick or old. Death happens to every one of us, I'm just taking control and deciding when it will be.

I'm going to do it. I'm posting this here because I need to say it but I'm 100% determined to do it. I have it figured out.
