TRAPPED!!I am trapped in this doomed reality in this shithole country and there's nothing I want more than to buy the ticket, take the ride. 

But I can't. 

I currently work somewhere where I'm literally keeping six people alive, as well as my wife, who has her own struggles with suicidal ideation. She is more important than any of you meatpuppets, but without me she crashes and starts self-destructing. So I am required to keep myself breathing and standing so that the world doesn't lose six struggling individuals who don't know any better and one amazing person who has won the rest of the planet a considerable amount of goodwill just by existing. The hopelessness hurts so much... The last time I felt like this, I put a gun in my mouth. If I'd had the fucking balls then, I wouldn't have had to see what horrors you monsters are capable of... But then I would not have met my wife. And, ignorant, we both would have embraced the black without ever knowing each other. 

Either I need to fix myself (break myself) or I need someone to be more of a man than me, and just give me a push. No hard feelings... Just make the hurting stop.
