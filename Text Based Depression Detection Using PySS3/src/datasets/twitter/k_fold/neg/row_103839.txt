Cant live without my daughters.I have the two most beautiful girls in the world.
I've spent almost every day with them since birth. They're now ages 7 and 8.

Their mom just moved from here in Florida to Texas without notice because after we broke up  she met some guy there.
I pay child support, so idk the legalities of this move. I can't afford an attorney. All I know is I can't live without my daughters. They're the only family I have left and the only two people on this earth that love me.

Ive had drug problems in the past and am currently down dosing in a methadone maintenance program.

I'm sitting here with my methadone for the week, about 600 mgs, and 36 Xanax bars. I'm sure it I take all of both of them the pain would go away.
