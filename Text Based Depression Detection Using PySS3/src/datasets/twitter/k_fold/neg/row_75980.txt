Iâ€™m a fuck upEverything I try at I fail. 

I try to be healthy I fail and gain 20lbs and am no obese 

I try to work at the Fortune 500 company of my dreams. Some random neck beard I never met doxxes my old reddit account contacts hr and gets me fired. 

I try to go to college, have to repeat classes 2-3 times because they are so difficult and I have a disability that makes math super hard. I wonâ€™t graduate on time or be possibly able to walk with my friends 

I try to apply to become a police officer, my second dream job which I have lots of experience for and I get denied. 

If everything I do at I just fail why even try? I donâ€™t want an uncertain future where I have to grind to just make ends meet. If I donâ€™t have a degree how will I get a job. What if my degree gets me a job I hate or one I get fired from because some random reason decides to ruin my life. 

I never wanted to lose my job at that company. I went from being able to afford rent to having to drive Uber 12 hours just to afford rent, and one meal from McDonaldâ€™s.

I donâ€™t want know what comes next. I just know my last two years of my life have been hell and that with how everythingâ€™s going thereâ€™s nothing worth living for. 

There is so much pain and I just bottle it up. I try to talk to someone and they just said itâ€™s all my fault and they do t feel sorry for me. Iâ€™m not looking for you to be sorry for me I just want you to know Iâ€™m in pain. Iâ€™m tired of being a failure. 

I just want to graduate and love happily but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s gonna happen so thereâ€™s no more reason to keep going. 

Ever since I lost my grandfather my life has gone down hill. I hate to bring loss on my family because I know what itâ€™s like but I donâ€™t think they like me and just consider me a fuck up so I donâ€™t think it will hurt them as much as losing my grandpa who raised me hurt me.
