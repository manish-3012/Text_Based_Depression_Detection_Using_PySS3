How selfish of you to consider suicide.Itâ€™s a thought I like to tell myself when things get scary.  When things get so gruesome and out of control that the only outlet I can see through this fog of misery is to out myself. But within this fog is not you alone, but so many of us that have to gasp for air, search for a way out, while looking for a hand, any hand in the dark to grasp. 

And you just give up? How selfish of you. I was counting on you to guide me out of this wreck as much as he was counting on me to guide him out of this wreck and she was counting on him to guide her out of this wreck and so forth and so on. 

Iâ€™m not saying you have to drag some random by the waist and exert what energy you have left, to toss him in front of you and direct him, yelling with your last breath, â€œTHERE! That way to the exit! Go on without me!â€ But not even a nudge?! A whisper? Any information at all or are we all just walking blind? How selfish of you. 

When I pass a stranger on the street I try with all of my might to smile in the hopes that they smile back. We know not a thing of our pasts, presents, or future, but remember how far the smallest of kind pleasantries can go, and that everyday we become a little more selfless.
