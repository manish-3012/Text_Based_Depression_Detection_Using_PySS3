I thought I could make a change in college...I made it into a good school, I got in better shape and put on 10 pounds of muscle, I have a 4.0, good enough friends, but I hear no from every thing else. No girls, no fraternity, no one other than my few close enough friends wants to be seen with me. I thought things would get better but no matter where I go I can't get away from this miserable feeling. I thought when I went to a place where people didn't know me I could start new, but I already messed up. The problem is me and I don't know how to fix it. I can't even get a fucking job
at the campus dining hall because I'm too uncomfortable with myself to not choke in a basic interview. Even if I'm 1000 miles from home, look better, and do well in school things still fucking suck.
