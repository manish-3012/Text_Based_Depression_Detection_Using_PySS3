too afraid to live too vain to dieHello dear people of reddit,

Its hard for me to say that-I dont want to live.I dont want to kill myself -I want to vanish from existence like I was never born and no one could remember me .I know I will cause pain,but pain from loosing someone its not something you cant live with.Its hard but it wont stop you.

I'm 24 years old,I love with my mother-67 years old . My brother lives in another country pretty far away with his wife and two sons . My mother went there for about 6 months to help them with the kids so his wife could work.She left here in a hurry ,in the meantime I had a falling out with a group of friends.We planned to go on a vacation but I had to help my mother with the renovation of our home so I told them a week  early that I couldnt leave her and go with them.They told me I screwed them-my room in the hotel was taken by someone else,no money were involved.I argued about priorities with them-we couldnt find a common ground. I was pretty sad,and my boyfriend was friends with them.He couldnt take any side in this which I understood .I finally left him-he told me I was too negative of a person anyway and he considered cheating on me.Im glad I left him before he could do that to me-it fucking hurts.The separation hurt me too .I was left alone in  a very cold winter. I had a new and stressful job-before that I worked as a bartender now I work at a solar company as office assistant-something utterly different.- which means stress.I  went to work where I didnt know anyone  to an empty appartment with my dog and cat! I have few friends always busy and one has a child even.I couldnt get out much...at all actually .I didnt talk to anyone at work or at home or outside....I felt like I cant remember the sound of my own voice. She got back eventually to blame me for not caring enough for my home,my dog made a few small messes-he ate a few old pillows and a 2 bed covers .I gave her some money to finish the renovation in the summer but my paycheck isnt really big.She blamed me for icking the furniture she now doesnt like-yet she was in the store with me and loved it....I feel like I do only wrong thing,I mess up everything,yet I did nothing wrong.I have don bad thing but in the few 2 years almost I do nothing .Like nothing! I help as much as I can and its asked of me .But I dont have the strenght to do more anymore.Every step I take is the wrong one,the wrong friends,men,education,jobs ....everything.I shouldnt be alive at all.I am a burden and a mess .No one needs me ,no one will ever need me.I could die and the world wont change a bit in a few days or months everyone will pick up on their lifes like nothing happened .I dont exist right now.Why I am wasting oxygen at all?
