How do things get better?Hey, first post on reddit, sorry if I screw anything up.  I'm 26 years old and feel like I've lost everything.  Four months ago I lost my job (which I had been at for 5 years), had no income and moved back in with my parents.  Within a month of being there my recovering alcoholic father relapsed and my family was close to splitting up.  I helped my mom load up a car to move out.  My father has been suicidal before so we struggled with how not to enable him but at the same time keep him safe.  I got approved for unemployment and moved out.  A month ago to the day, my girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me.  She's the only serious relationship I've ever had.  She is tired of her life where we live and wanted to move.  She was going to live with a (male) friend across the country, got half way there, turned around.  She told me on the way back she still doesn't want to date me, she just wants to try life on her own.  I don't =(.  For years I've had idle thoughts of suicide but about 2 weeks ago was the worst.  I had seen my ex just to catch up with how we were coping (I'm pathetic?) and was frustrated.  I remember screaming at the top of my lungs and crying on the way back, and just being in a absolute panic.  I called a suicide hotline.  I went in to speak to a crisis nurse at a local hospital and now have an appointment in like a month for a hour therapy session and another appointment the day before to see about medication.  I feel like a complete failure.  I'm 26 years old, have nothing to show for myself.  I didn't really even like my life 6 months ago, and I have lost nearly anything that was good in it from that point.  I've lost my job, most of my connection with my family, and the girl I still love.  

Mornings are the worst.  Basically its when reality sinks back in and I realize I'm alone.  Really all that is helping me pull through right now is that it seems irrational to give up before trying therapy, but every day is really a struggle.
