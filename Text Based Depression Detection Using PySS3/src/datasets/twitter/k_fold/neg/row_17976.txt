I don't want to kill myself but there's no other wayI really don't want to end my life, I have a good family and friends whom I love especially my bestfriend she's like my soul mate, I connect with her on a different level. But I'm so depressed and suffering from horrible feelings, seeing things, hearing things, not being in control of my body, watching line a passenger, feeling like I'm being crushed everything horrible is happening to me my anxiety is killing me.

I really don't want to go, I still enjoy doing things, but there is no way I'm ever getting off this hellish medication that's causing all these problems. I'm going to hang myself pretty soon I'm not ready but I have to. Been researching deeply on the best way to hang myself, I have the spot but just need a rope and learn how to tie.

And if you ever see this I'm going to miss you so fucking much I love you crazy girl (as a friend don't want to get it twisted you russians are weird), you're the light in my life.
