Im just figuring out why im so depressed.I am just trying to explain to myself why i am so depressed to the point where i am wanting to kill myself. I couldn't explain it at first and felt "you had to be in my head" The majority of it is paranoia about things from the past and the stress i take in from work. I feel like my head is going to explode with work and i get flashbacks there and or think about my ex (it still bothers me to this day even though it was 2 years ago) I also like to double question if im ok, and feel like i upset everyone and everything in my way. I hate waking up because i know my life isn't at all perfect and don't want to risk another invalidation or bitchy person. That's all i was really able to come up with, i just needed to update this as i haven't really expressed myself on this page much.
