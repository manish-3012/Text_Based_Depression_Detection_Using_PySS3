Nonstop ThoughtsHi,

At this point in my life (18 years old) I've had enough. My "father" was diagnosed with leukemia around the time I was born and he died 11 years afterwards right in front of me in the hospice with the long beep noise. I've been going through emotional abuse from my alcoholic "mother" for 9 years and still going, getting mad at things and destroying doors and trying to abandon me on the side of the rode before and assaulting me multiple times. I have problems with my identity as well and feeling like no one understands me except my only friend. He's the only reason why I live at this point. All other friends have betrayed me and left. I never was negative or anything, I always tried to act nice and do the right thing even if I had to bottle things up and people still did it to me. I hate it and I hate myself. But I don't want to make my friend feel bad or sad by killing myself. But I don't care about anything else. I don't care about having a career or job. This life is boring to me. I dropped out of high school from depression and nowadays I just rot inside of my room doing basically nothing everyday. Not employed or learning anything. No car or money to even go or start anywhere. I want to get out of here but I'm stuck. I don't even like life anyway. But I don't want to hurt anyone else besides myself. I want to stop. Being suicidal makes me feel bad for the sake of others. Please help. I'm stuck
