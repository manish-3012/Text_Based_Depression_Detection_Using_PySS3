I always help others but they never want to help meIâ€™ll let all my friends tell me about their worst problems and deepest secrets, and I support them. I give them advice because I genuinely care about them. I check up on them and even buy them things if I notice theyâ€™re feeling down. But when I have problems? Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t even matter anymore. I try to say something, and they just say, â€œthatâ€™s toughâ€ or â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€. Iâ€™m not expecting them to be my therapist and solve all my problems and Iâ€™m sorry if I come off as selfish, but at least something to show that they CARE, you know?
