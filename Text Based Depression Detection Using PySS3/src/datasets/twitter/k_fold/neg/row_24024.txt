tired of having to do and be what i don't want toi enjoy other people's company, but as you can guess by me being on the internet im not an extrovert, which explains why although i like interaction, i have no one to do so. that has affected me badly - if i had social anxiety before, that made it worse. and well, even if i didn't have anxiety, i am basically the embodiement of a mess. i'm nowhere near attractive physically enough for people to feel attracted to me and start talking, so most of the time i either start or suffer quiet. if i do start, the conversation ends up awkward as i am incredibly irritating. with all of that it's not a surprise i don't have many friends, and the ones i have are basically colleagues, because... well, they don't know about **me**. they know about the "funny friend" of the school, the girl who likes to act touchy with her group, not **me**.

i have no right to say i have depression as i never had the chance to get it checked, but ever since i was 12 i have dreamed of commiting suicide many times, and i have attempted to overdose on pills once when i was 13, with no luck. i have no one to talk about my feelings in real life, and often times i just keep it to myself, as i should not make others pity me for my problems and think that i am weak. and well, i don't want to be seen as weak. my parents wouldn't allow that.

those habits have definetly taken a toll on me. i ask to leave to the bathroom almost daily when i go out to things like courses or school, because all of a sudden i have a breakdown. certain songs also do the same, and i cannot concentrate anymore. i have no hope for the future, as the future will probably depend on social interaction, and not on stupid shit like art, which would be the only thing i could have a slight chance of doing, but of course its not what my family considers a real job.

there's just too much going on that i cannot handle with my current age. i feel pressured to be as social as possible, to be the perfect student, to get a good job, to satisfy others... in reality i am just a big disappointment. grades getting lower and lower, cant interact for shit, im the only person in my family that isnt a fanatic christian, and to top it all off im a closet lesbian stuck in a homophobic family.i cannot take a break. my parents keep pressuring me to do all this stuff related to work while im not even past 16 yet. i dont have a time to properly breathe and stop for a second without things to do. work, chores, school, pressure, and now that it's time for my school break it's gonna get worse as they'll push more shit so that i have no free time. i don't have the will to even take care of myself anymore, how do i want to find someone like this? i'm fucking useless even for that. i'm dying a virgin, wonderful.

i have planned suicide many times after that time i tried, and the only thing that keeps me from doing so are the two people i truly care about. i cant handle the thought of seeing my brother sad because his useless sister died, nor would i handle knowing my online friend went back to the dark place of depression because of me. they deserve better.

i'm such a fucking coward though. i'm simply holding them back from their true possibilities with my stupid problems. i dream to get the sweet relief of not being pressured everytime by simply ending it all.
