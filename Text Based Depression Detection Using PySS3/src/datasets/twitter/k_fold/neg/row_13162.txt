What do I do now?Had an appointment with my care-coordinator today, what I assume to be my last appointment after being told despite what the medical evidence supports that he felt that I would get better and am not in need of the service, my progression has been slow to naught with even a handwritten note from my last therapy session stating that I do not have the tools to cope, with the result of said therapy lowering my depression score by 2 points and increasing my anxiety by 4. My care-coordinator arranged a psychiatrist to prescribe me lamotigrine/lamictal but i have yet to even touch near my therapeutic dose, I haven't been made aware of a plan in an increase of dose and now have been cut off from any known plan. All I know is that i'll be placed under the care of a new lesser-controlled team to whom I will have to re-refer to every time I finish my 20 sessions of therapy.

I feel that I am not sick enough or not in crisis enough to be worth their time, that despite being told to read a self-help book my carer did not bother to do the same to research the repercussions of creating an experience in which i feel abandoned and invalidated. Ignoring every time I say I'm getting worse, denying me my right to a written diagnosis while still treating me under a working diagnosis. Giving me medication that will kill me and then throwing me off to the curb like it's not a risk I won't save them up to overdose and then creating me a reason to do so.

What am I supposed to do, act on these painful emotions to gain my right to treatment, what's the point. I'd have to repeatedly do so to stay within the system wouldn't be easier to just kill myself not that it's an easy thing to do but it's easier then trying to hurt yourself enough to get treatment and when I think about it in that sense then I really do fit the borderline PD that society hates me for. 

it's bad enough I've be idealization self-mutilation and suicide but now it's becoming the only options as a call for help or an end to the suffering.
