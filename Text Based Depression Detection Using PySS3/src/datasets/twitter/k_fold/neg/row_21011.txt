I'm from the UK and it was an NHS hospital.Was wondering if anyone would be able to give me any advice on how to obtain copies of my medical records and notes from an inpatient stay I had. I know you can get them but not sure how the process works or what step to take to start to obtain them. 
Thank you :)
