How do I hang myself in my room?I'm thinking belt or necktie but just want to make sure it works 100%. Also downing whiskey and pain pills will help I'm sure. Everyday gets worse when I only try to make it better. Forget the dramatics. I've brought myself into really shitty situations trying to look for human connection. Im always looking for a magical solution because I have a learning disability. There's so much going on that is unlikely to be better.
