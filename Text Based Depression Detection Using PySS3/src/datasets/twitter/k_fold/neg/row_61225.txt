The thoughts of suicide become more natural and easyI used to have a gut feeling of fear when I thought about killing myself, and now it's natural and flows easily. I can see myself walking right off the balcony. Or jumping in front of a car. Or pulling the steering wheel. I just don't care anymore and I have a pit in my chest that won't ever be filled. Fuck my life and what it's become. I want to numb myself to my reality and leave it all. I used to try to kill myself with overdoses, but now I think I'll try a different route. I don't care anymore.
