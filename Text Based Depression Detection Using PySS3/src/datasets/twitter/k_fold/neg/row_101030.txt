How do I stop my mind jumping to suicide all the time?It's like a devil on my shoulder whispering it any time something goes wrong. When I was growing up, life seemed hopeless because of my parents abuse, but I'm away from them now. I wish I could just reprogram my brain to stop this. It's definitely started to get better, but it's a slow, arduous process. I wish I didn't carry so much baggage from the abuse I dealt with.
