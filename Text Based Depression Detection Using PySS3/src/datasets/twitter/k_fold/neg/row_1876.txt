I want to end my lifeI.. Ive tried so hard the past few years, to pull through. I learned that I have to be obedient to avoid being the target, to avoid being screamed at about how Iâ€™m a disappointment, and a failure. Iâ€™m constantly told Iâ€™m dumb, being screamed at and threatened over innocent mistakes, such as grabbing the wrong pair of pants on accident. 
And now.. I can barely function. Iâ€™m constantly crying, yet trying to stay there for my only friends, online, as in the real world, Iâ€™m forever trapped in this house, Iâ€™m not allowed to leave most the time. And.. I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t do my work, I canâ€™t get myself up to eat, to drink, to feed the dogs or do the dishes- and I keep being threatened, and yelled at more. Threatened to take everything away, my phone, my handheld, my figures I collect, my drawing books and pencils, my posters- everything. They take everything and treat me like a prisoner till I beg and cry and act as a slave again.. I canâ€™t do that again- but I canâ€™t get myself to do anything- I canâ€™t handle this I canâ€™t handle being told Iâ€™m stupid and a failure and everything every day. I feel like if I killed myself, theyâ€™d only be mad. Because it was another excuse to get out of something. I want to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to live. I want to die. Just let me die and be free please.. I canâ€™t handle this.. I canâ€™t feel a purpose for myself anymore- I donâ€™t have one. Iâ€™m worthless.. I just wanna off myself already- let the world be free of another failure.
