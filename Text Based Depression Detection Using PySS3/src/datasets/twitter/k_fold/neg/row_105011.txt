wellp, it's been realwent out and bought myself a pint of gin, and i'm about a quarter of the way through it

for ten long years i've hated my pathetic miserable life. years of therapy, diagnoses and the like can't help

only thing i have to look forward to is my psych eval the day after my bday to put me on mood stabilizers

i lived the life i wanted for a short while, and to be honest, it's probably the best i'll get

it doesn't add up, the live i have and the way i feel. something is in imbalance here. oh well. i can't keep doing this. keep pretending that everything is okay.

i'll be writing up a note and a final testament in about an hour or so. basically as soon as this pint is done. take care duders and duderettes. 

like ya, love ya, papa bless
