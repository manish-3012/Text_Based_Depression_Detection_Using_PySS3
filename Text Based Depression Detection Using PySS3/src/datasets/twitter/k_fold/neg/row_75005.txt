Why Does Every Year Get Progressively Worse?As a child, I was bullied for my lack of social awareness thanks to my ADD and an emotionally/physically abusive highly religious mother who concocted a poison mindset for myself. She said I didnâ€™t need friends because â€œthe world was going to end soon anywaysâ€ and my childhood was filled with mostly being visited at home by a psychiatrist, going to JW church, speech therapy (for a lisp), and video games. Other girls in elementary thought I was a weird girl for playing video games and anything â€boy-relatedâ€ so any and all rumors of me being weird followed me into middle school and some of high school. 

Last year I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder. Last year was also rancid with the passing of my best friend (may he rest peacefully) and I was looking forward to 2019 as my year of recovery and hope.   


Itâ€™s 2019. My closest friend is now toxic and grew into habitually gaslighting, emotionally manipulating, and abusing me anytime we came to any disagreement instead of properly addressing any issue.  I have spent every breathing moment this year wondering anxiously when he would break again and result into him belittling me in such a carefully thought way. I didnâ€™t recognize he was the problem until someone else addressed this to me. He hates when I talk to other people which led me to drift from the few friendships I have which destroyed them all.   


Worst part? Heâ€˜s an online friend and I have no real life friends anymore. I havenâ€™t had a close real life friend in YEARS. I have become a husk that lives and breathes internet.

This led me to growing incredibly detached from people and now Iâ€™m having a hard time finding empathy in situations. I sit like a stone.   
This paired with my anorexia that pushed me to excessively exercising ALL last year (and now since Iâ€™m relapsing currently)  so I ended up becoming a hermit to socialization. Back then social events = places with food and eating. 

Iâ€™m increasingly suicidal because I lack social skills to bond with people outside of the internet. Even in my small college, I canâ€™t relate much to my classmates either. I talk to them and feed into their conversations but because of my ADD they awkwardly cut me off because I ramble.   


I also have weird mannerisms because of my hyperactivity and childlike behavior and itâ€™s a given that everyone thinks Iâ€™m really weird. I donâ€˜t like to spend my time doing anything that someone my age (22 yrs) would like.. I act like such a CHILD. An actual child. Cupcakes, candy, cartoons, you name it..

Iâ€™ve been self harming in increasingly worse ways and my physical scars are a JOKE to my family. They joke about my isolation a lot (I donâ€™t WANT to be this way, why canâ€™t they understand) and watching my siblings ALWAYS go out with people and experience things that someone my age should be is driving me mad. 

I started getting high by myself so I could make imaginary friends and interact with them midst psychedelic trances.  

I attempted 3 days ago and once last month but obviously it didnâ€™t work. Iâ€™m scared of how Iâ€™d be found and how much of a financial impact it would leave on my family. I WANT to. I really do want to go. If I spent 22yrs on this planet without a close friend to share an unconditional and irreplaceable bond with itâ€™s never going to happen now. I canâ€™t stay longer anymore. It pains to think that even in cases I have made friends they have left or have become emotionally abusive towards me.  The pain of this and other variables mentioned are so strong I donâ€™t want to just â€œcopeâ€ anymore. I want to solve it once and for all.   


tl;dr Anorexic behavior + emotionally manipulative friend isolated me from keeping little friends I had. Since horrible childhood Iâ€™ve lacked social skills + only friends are online. No friends. Literally all alone. Spent my life alone, will die alone. Suicidal as fuck.  


I just want friends, man. Friends in the flesh to do everything with like the way it happens in the movies. I try to talk to people! Where am I going to find people that RELATE to me and want to know me better? The internet. Exactly. I wonâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to go out and do anything anymore. Iâ€™m tired of everything.
