I can't come to terms with my brother's suicide attempt or how my family is handling it.Less than a month ago, my little brother attempted suicide by overdose. I think it just now starting to fully sink in. He just broke up with his girlfriend a few days ago and it is starting to scare me that maybe there are signs he is beginning to break away from everyone and maybe try again--or succeed.
He says one of the reasons he did it is that my dad is so harsh on him and he has always felt like a failure. Last night I had a nightmare about him and my dad. My dad made him cry in front of a group of people (mainly men) and when I went to comfort him from crying, I woke up.
I've been replaying this in my mind over and over again, knowing I couldn't comfort him. I have spent the better portion of my day crying, thinking about him and how he may/must be hurting in real life.
My family, obviously, made a huge ordeal of it at first, and we were all going to change. Really, nothing has happened. I fear this isn't the last time he will try to take his life.
Mental illness also runs in my family. I am diagnosed as Bipolar II, OCD and Agoraphobic. He hasn't been diagnosed officially as anything yet. I have a feeling both my mother and father and sister are bipolar and OCD and my other brother has clinical depression and has expressed his suicidal thoughts after all of this came out as well.
I can't think of what I am supposed to say to him or how I approach him or my family to heal him. I am so racked with guilt and feel as if there is some impending doom coming, I can barely concentrate.
