I tried and failedI've posted here before 

I tried OD on pills 2 times before and last time used a box cutter. Made a mess of things and got a few stiches

It's not being beaten senseless many times in middle and elementary school 

It's not having had a tumor for five years and no one believed me

It's this wonderful girl that I love since 10th grade

It's been 9 years and in November I confessed my feelings 

I've been sad every day, I cry every day, I feel like I have a weight on my chest

I love her so much and I can't keep on living like this 
I take medication, go to therapists, it's all useless 

In reality, many of us don't get better, and it's not fair to be stuck in this hellish state just because other people can feel good about themselves, in the end they are the selfish ones
