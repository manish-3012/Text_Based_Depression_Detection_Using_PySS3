I am too much of a wimpAnxiety is unbearable today after relapsing from being 2 weeks sober. Embarrassed myself in front of my best friend and roommate put myself in a very risky situation. I recently lost my job due to alcohol and canâ€™t stop thinking about suicide. I just want zero pain. I have attempted it in the past but my roommate found me and called 911. I just canâ€™t stop googling ways to do it and thinking about it.
