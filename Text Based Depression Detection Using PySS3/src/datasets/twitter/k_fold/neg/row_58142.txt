Iâ€™m everything that doesnâ€™t belong here and Iâ€™m gonna end it tonight.Iâ€™m 19 and turning 20 soon, and Iâ€™m attracted to 16-18 year old boys. I know this is wrong and bad and I want to hurt myself because of it. Iâ€™m also out on bond for multiple felonies involving grand theft and armed burglary, and I just donâ€™t see this life mattering much anymore. The idea of staying alive just so I can graduate university without a career or opportunity to rent an apartment is pointless. Iâ€™m not welcome here and Iâ€™m the reason for that. My actions are the reason my life is over. ALL I had to do was get help and be more involved when I was younger but now Iâ€™m a useless criminal thief whoâ€™s gonna be looked at as a pedophile later in life. I know what my next steps are, and theyâ€™re gonna have to be taken in the next few hours.

I got an AR15 rifle and Iâ€™m gonna walk up the street with it to a back road I used to walk on when I was depressed as a teen. Iâ€™m gonna commit suicide there because I canâ€™t solve any of my issues, and I donâ€™t have a real desire to continue this life now. I am, however, excited to leave earth early. I may even get to reincarnate and try again!!! My birthday present to myself in the next few hours is suicide, and Iâ€™m extremely excited to end it early. Goodbye!
