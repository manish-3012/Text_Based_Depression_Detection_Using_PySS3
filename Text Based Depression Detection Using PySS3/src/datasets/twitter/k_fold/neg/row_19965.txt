Itâ€™s back and worse than everI donâ€™t know why itâ€™s back but it hit like a truck when it came. Iâ€™ve been going to school but not my classes. I stay outside even though itâ€™s cold as hell just so I feel free. Everything seems dark. My head just feels empty. I feel like an empty shell. I tend to look at the sky a lot, it gives me some sort of peace. Hopefully I can push through.
