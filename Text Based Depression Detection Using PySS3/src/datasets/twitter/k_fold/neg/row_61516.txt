When you're hurt by those who are meant to help.I've been struggling with depression while pregnant. It's not new, it just flared up. So I've been reaching out and ultimately presented to the emergency department with suicidal thoughts two days ago after trying to crash my car and stab myself over a couple weeks. They sent me home with a referral to a psychiatrist at the community mental health centre. I was told it would be for a medication review, but about 10 minutes in it was clear he was fixated on my pregnancy and he spent 20 minutes or so insisting the best thing would be to terminate. He pushed for the termination with really mean wording; saying things like your child deserves better than having you as a mother. In the last 5 minutes or so he said if I was determined to try being a parent there might be support for that, but didn't elaborate on it and said even with it I'd just be hoping to one day reach "good enough". I was already filled with so much doubt, guilt and self-loathing that I wanted to die... Someone who was meant to help me with that piled more crap on top of it instead and now I don't where I'm meant to turn if the urge to hurt myself comes again.

Oh and the doctors love emphasising friend networks to me and I keep saying I don't bother anymore because there's no receciprocity. But they insist. So I thought I'd ask a "friend" who leant on me a bit for mental health, career and personal reasons for support. I told them I'd been to the ED for suicidal thoughts and they replied with "ðŸ‘". Seriously, that was it. I fucking hate people. 

That's all. Now... I don't know. I'm just waiting to see what happens next...
