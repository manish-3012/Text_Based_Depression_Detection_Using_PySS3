Can't get a job, can't stop thinking about ending itI'm a convicted felon.  Was stupid in my early 20s and have a drug problem.  Multiple arrests, all but one are misdemeanor simple possessions.  The felony is also a non-violent drug offense.

It's been several years since all that, did my jail time, probation, everything taken care of with the courts, got a 2 year college degree and trying to find work in my field.  I'm passionate about what I do and have real marketable skills.  I go on interviews, everything goes well, you can start on Monday, sign the damn job offer and everything then background check comes back LOL fuck all that we're not gonna hire you now.

I don't get what I'm supposed to do.  I'm not a bad person.  I don't steal.  I'm not violent.  None of my "crimes" even have victims.  There's no rehabilitation in this country.  I'm just labeled a criminal for the rest of my life now because I'm an addict and even after I did my time I'm still being punished because 99% of all jobs background check.  Why?  I don't fucking know.  I'm not trying to work for the damn FBI.  I just want to earn a living wage.

I can get clean.  I feel like if I can land I job I can stay clean.  But when I keep getting the door slammed in my face before I even get a chance, I go back to heroin.

For some reason today the dope isn't even making me feel better.  Usually it does but all I can think now is I want to call my dude up, buy a fat sack, and do enough to end it.
