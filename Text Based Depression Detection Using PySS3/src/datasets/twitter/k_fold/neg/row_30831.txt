Help?Me: "Where are we going?"
My dad: "I don't know. Why are you asking? Do you not want to come? If you didn't want to, you should've said so."
Me: "I never said that I didn't want to come! I just wanted to know where we're going."
My dad: "Exactly! Didn't I just say that I didn't know!!"

Sorry if it doesn't make any sense in English. It was tricky to translate it from my native language. My dad always does this. He ges mad at me for no reason and it's really been messing me up. :( Is this considered normal?
