I've been done with living for so long nowI've been depressed for years and suicidal thoughts have always trailed with it. Every time, every single time, life seems to start looking up it just fucks me over again. I started doing fine at the beginning of this year and then my fucking dad died. I've been cutting for over a year now and I just want to cut too deep and end it. I have so many plans and ideas but no fucking courage to just go through with it. I hate myself so much but I've let too many people get close and now I don't want to hurt them. I've been at the end of my rope for so long and I'm exhausted. It's a mystery how I haven't even tried to just end it yet but here I am. I'm sorry for such a long ramble I just need to get it out somewhere. I can't talk to friends without fear of being hospitalized since one called the cops and another said that they might. I just want to stop being such an emotional burden on people and just stop being in general. I haven't harmed in like a day or two and it's all I can think about. I want it all to stop.
