After many attempts years spent in treatment, and hurting those close to me, im finally going to do it rightIt hurts too much to stay around. For my family, for my friends, for my significant other. I've caused too much turmoil and worry to keep letting it go on. My girlfriend of 5 years has been so supportive, yet we've been on the brink of breaking up to save her mental health at least a few times. I try my hardest to improve for her, but I can't seem to change. I've tried more than 20 medications, every form of psychotherapy, and tms to no avail. I even have an appointment for ect in a few days but I only made it to sound like I'm going in the right direction. Im exhausted of trying to stay alive and I think this weekend would be a good way to meet the pavement head on. Every second Im alive I'm in worse emotional pain. Im doing well in school, have hobbies I pursue, can hold down a job, and am financially stable. I have an easy life but that hasn't changed my perspective. Im not looking for tips to stay alive, I just want someone who can support my decision to kill myself.
