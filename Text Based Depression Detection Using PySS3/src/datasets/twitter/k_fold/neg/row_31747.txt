QuestionI see a lot of suicidal people online but no one at my school seems suicidal. Every single person seems so normal and happy with their lives. Are they really good at concealing their depression, or are they really normal people who don't feel suicidal? Do I live in an area with an unusually small number of suicidal people or do I just surround myself with a lot of suicidal people online? I guess what I'm trying to say is is the number of suicidal people a lot less than I had thought?
