There was a recent death in the family and I'm suspecting it was suicideWhat signs or things should I look for to confirm this? I know they were suicidal but as of right now it looks officially like drug overdose. However it doesn't fit together quite right. Not the type of person who'd leave a not or even want people to know but there are a couple things which lead me to believe it was self induced. Anyone have any suggestions on what to look out for in order to strengthen or weaken this idea? 
So sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, tell me to remove it and I will.
