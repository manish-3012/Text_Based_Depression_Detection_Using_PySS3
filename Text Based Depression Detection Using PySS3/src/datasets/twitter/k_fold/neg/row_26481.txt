31 with kids, can't call suicide hotline. I've had enough.I am 31, I am married, I have 2 children.

And I also have BPD and possible bipolar. My life is so fucked up, I don't see it ever changing. I know all the prejudices, but I've never threatened suicide to anyone, I've never called my therapist, though I have emailed occasionally. But now...for some reason this is it, I can't pick myself up anymore, I am making concrete plans and my only obstacle is finding someone for my children.

There isn't anything worse in my life than in that of others. I grew up in some European country and now live in the U.S.
Family full of addictions and mental illness. Suicide attempts by my sister, mother and father. Completed suicide by my brother. No family, no friends. My marriage is a farce, my husband doesn't know I have BPD, he is not trustworthy, self absorbed and arrogant. When I cry he is annoyed, he says so himself and I hide in the bedroom when I do. I do not have a finished education, I have no support and feel completely alone. I'll never get out of this shithole that is my life. I get psychotic mini episodes, it is almost as if I'm getting worse as I get older. Dissociation, amnesia, flashbacks, nightmares, insomnia despite medication for it. I can't go on anymore. My children are fucked with me and without me. I don't know what to do. I don't even have good memories to hold on to, to tell myself there are better times. There's so much shit in my life that I can't even go into for fear it will identify me. I want to make plans for my children so they will be taken care off. I'm not even sure what I'm saying here, I can't call the hotline because my 5 year old is at home. I try hard not to cry when the kids are here.

I am so done, that is all, I am just so done. I do not ever remember not being crippled by either anxiety or depression or all the other shit. I am done with it, I don't want this life anymore.
