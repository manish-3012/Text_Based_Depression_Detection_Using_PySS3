I think I was raped by my friend last night and I want to dieFor a bit of context, I am a male who is questioning his sexuality. Last night I drank a bit too much and passed out on a bed. At some point someone came and lay down next to me and made me perform oral intercourse. I went with it because I was barely conscious and I guess because I was already questioning my sexuality. But I cannot identify who it was and I feel violated now that I'm awake and sober. The worst part is everyone is still here and I will have to be around them for several more hours. I don't know what to do and I just want to run off and hang myself, please help me
