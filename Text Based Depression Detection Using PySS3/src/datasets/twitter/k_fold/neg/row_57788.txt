I've grown tiredI'm not going to give a sob story about how I was given a shitty hand with my life, and I'm certainly not going to preach about how things are too dreary to continue living. I'm simply here to vent while I'm still on this earth. Of course there are good people, But for every person with a good heart there are a dozen with no remorse. I've grown tired if the daily 9-5 grind competing in the rat race with millions of others. The only way to beat the rat race is to not participate, and that is exactly what I'm doing. I'm opting out.
