Depressed in Military.I'm a U.S. Marine helicopter mechanic and I'm going to end my life. I've been in for over the year hoping it would get better. It hasn't. I have no friends literally, and am not in contact with my family. Due to the extensive verbal harassment I recieve from higher ups and other's that are my same rank, I'm done with life. I contribute nothing to society, and am a burden that holds others back. Due to this job I've developed extremely bad anxiety to the point where I get extremely nervous talking to people, even those who I've known for years and where always friendly. I can't speak to anyone without my heart rate rapidly increasing and sweating. I've tried everything to find happiness somewhere. I've yet to find anything that brings me happiness or even a smile on my face. I tried doing things outside of base but can't find anything I was even slightly interested in doing. Nowadays I spend my time playing games and watching anime, just trying to pass the time, waiting for nothing. I've completely fucked up my life, I don't want to be here, but even if I try to get out, I feel my anxiety will prevent me from being able to do any normal civilian job, I don't no what to do. I've been preparing and am going to end it all in a little over a month.
