I attempted suicide last year and no one knows.I got into a car accident on an empty street by my house in the middle of the country. I flipped my car.

I was suicidal. I wanted to die. I wanted to die. All I wished for was for death and I couldnâ€™t get it. Iâ€™m in an abusive household and Iâ€™d had a major argument with my parent where they called me basically every name in the book for the 300th time that month. I was leaving another dead end job. I wanted to live with my SO, but my SO lived 4k miles away and it felt like the dream of moving there was fading.

I was driving home and I just fucking bawled and screamed about how much I wanted to fucking die. I still donâ€™t know if it happened by accident or on purpose. I didnâ€™t die. I laid in the ditch. I told myself as I crumbled out of the wreckage that I wouldnâ€™t be suicidal anymore. That my parents would care about me. Everyone cared for 2 days before they began screaming at me when I was too afraid to drive. That Iâ€™m a burden and that I need to get over it. Iâ€™m still terrified to drive but I just force myself to do it.

Nobody cares about me and life is repeating itself. In fact, life is worse than it was before my accident. I donâ€™t even have a dead end job to go to anymore, I just sit and think about how I should have died in that accident.
