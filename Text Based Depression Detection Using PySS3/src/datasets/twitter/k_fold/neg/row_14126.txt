my family is so fucking insensitive and dont care about my uncle assaulting mei was raped by my piece of shit pedophile uncle when i was 15. barely anything was done about it. i thought we had a restraining order against him but they dont tell me shit. 

they always invite him over. they let him around my young nieces, nephews and cousins. they dont fucking care because heâ€™s family and heâ€™s struggling to make ends meet or whatever. they actually pay him to do work around the house. 

i fucking tell my parents and my sister that he makes me uncomfortable. my sister doesnâ€™t care because â€œits not her problemâ€ which i dont get because that piece of shit used to touch her as a kid too. and i get such bad anxiety just looking at him. it fucking triggers me to no end having to come home to my own house and not knowing if im going to run into my rapist that day or not. 

i dont know what the fuck to do anymore. no one will listen to me. they make me feel like im the crazy one for not wanting him to come over. they make me feel like shit for suggesting that they ask him to leave. 

my parents only solution was for me to stay out of the house until he leaves but i have no where to go for hours on end unless im at work. i shouldnâ€™t have to leave anyways. 

i dont know what the fuck to do i have so much anxiety rn i just want to fucking cut. i hate everything i feel so sick
