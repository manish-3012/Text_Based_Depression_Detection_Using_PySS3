I donâ€™t know if I can take it much longerHey, I hope youâ€™re alright. To just sum up what has happened this year: since January Iâ€™ve been having anxiety attacks and thoughts about killing myself, My family has been fighting all year long and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m 15 and I donâ€™t know how I can go through with this. My school grades have been going downhill and I am struggling with the will to live. I donâ€™t know what to do.
