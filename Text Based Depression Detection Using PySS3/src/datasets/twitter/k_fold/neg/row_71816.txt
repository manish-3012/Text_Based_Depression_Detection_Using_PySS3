I'm so uselessI just left for college and I just hate myself. There's a list of stuff wrong with me. I have an issue with binging and purging and so because of that I am getting off of laxatives. The only issue is that I haven't been able to shit for a week. I also can't make any friends here. I tried to join clubs which lead to me being awkwardly left out the entire time. I barely started classes and I'm already struggling. I can't even be a normal college student. I'm away from the only people who care about me (my parents) and it sucks. Hopefully my eating disorder ends up killing me, so I don't have to do anything to myself.
