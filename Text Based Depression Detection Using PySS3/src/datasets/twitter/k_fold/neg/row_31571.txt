If I canâ€™t get out then whatâ€™s the point in trying anymoreI went out with friends today when I didnâ€™t want to and it was going good but I could just keep seeing time pass and know that I had to go home and be around really bad people and as it got later I couldnâ€™t have fun with them cause I was so stuck in my head on the fact that I canâ€™t stay away forever and now Iâ€™m home and it all feels horrible and when things are good itâ€™s never long. I canâ€™t be me I donâ€™t feel safe Iâ€™d rather be dead than live here for another year but Iâ€™m only 16 and I have no money to leave if I wanted to. It feels like Iâ€™m never getting out and all the bad stuff has gotten so much worse recently
