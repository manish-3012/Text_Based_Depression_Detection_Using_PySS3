i want someone to kill meI don't have the strength or really the means to do it right. I just want instant death when I least expect it. I don't feel like I'm supposed to be alive, every day is completely miserable. Most days have always been at the very least not good. The months are just passing by now, I haven't had a real friend in years. My girlfriend lives hundreds of miles away and it feels like she doesn't care anymore about me because of how I am. I don't even blame her. I'm ready to die, it's just so hard to do so. Every day I look at suicide methods and and it's the same fucking articles and posts. It's almost funny. I stopped taking my useless antidepressants because I was tired of being asexual, now I have these brain zaps and it's so weak. I just laugh or cry for no reason at times. All there is in this house is yelling. A simple chore feels sisyphean, why bother? I'm 18 now but I don't feel like I have had any kind of childhood or teenagehood. Where did it go? I'm supposed to be happy about college or something. that's what they tell me. i'm tired of typing, fuck this
