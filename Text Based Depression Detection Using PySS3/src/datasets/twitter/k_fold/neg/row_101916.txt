I'm going to kill myselfLooking at my daughters face it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It always has been. For the past 6 years. It's my sister's birthday and I ruined the dinner by silently sobbing. I've had a reprieve for almost a month but my life was too beautiful to live it now, in ugliness. I'm going. It wont be tonight.
