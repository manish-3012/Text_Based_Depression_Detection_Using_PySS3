I don't know what to do with my lifeI don't know what to do with my life, and in my head the answer is suicide, people often has a passion that they want to do for the rest of their lives, but i in the other hand don't have that, i feel like i bring nothing to the table and am nothing but a leach, that has no reason to be alive, and it sucks, anyone can relate?
