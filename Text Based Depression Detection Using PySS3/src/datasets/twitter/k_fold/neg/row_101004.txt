I am not happy or sadI have been miserable. I know what miserable feels like. 

I am not miserable anymore. I wish I was miserable. That would give me a reason to feel the way that I do.

But I am not. I just don't feel anything. I am empty. I don't care. I am excited about nothing. I thought I knew what was wrong, but those things aren't wrong anymore.

But I still feel the way that I did before.

I don't know what I am going to do. There is nothing that I want to do.

I don't know how to explain what I feel. Pretty much because I am not sure what I am feeling.

I don't want to die. But I don't really care if I do, either.
