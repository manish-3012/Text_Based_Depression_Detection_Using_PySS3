I don't see the point anymore..(NSFW?)To make a long, 26 year old story short, I'm a single mother, high school drop out and ex drug addict. My son is about to be three next month.. and I have absolutely nothing for him. I don't mean just for his birthday, I mean literally nothing for him. No home...no bed.. my sweet little toddler has been couch hoping with his failure of a mother.
My girlfriend is dying from heart failure and she's giving up. She's done with the tests, the hospital visits, everything..
My mother lied to the police. She told them I was robbing her when I was getting my son's and my own belongings from her house.
And I'm just tired.. I can't do this anymore.. being raped and keeping it to myself because he was friends with my whole family and no one would fucking believe me. Tell my mother about the physical and sexual abuse I went through just to be called a "liar" and "scum"..
Every day, every week, every month and every year gets so much worse and, honestly, what's the point of this misery?!?! 
I have no one and nothing... And I know you're supposed to stay alive for your children, but he's at an age where he can forget about me soon enough.. and he'll have people willing to care for him... I just don't want to live anymore.. I really don't
