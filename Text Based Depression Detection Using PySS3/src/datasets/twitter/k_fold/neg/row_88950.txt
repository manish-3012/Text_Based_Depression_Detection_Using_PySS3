Jump - stop this pain and agonyI'm 24 years old turning 25 in April. I broke up with my toxic ex. We've been together for 4 years and he put me trough so much shit mentally and left me with so much financial problems. 

I feel so overwhelmed and felt like that mid way through that relationship. It seems to get worse every day I just don't want to live anymore I will never get my life together and with every day it gets worse. I haven't done much in my life and never will I always put his wants and needs before mine helped him pay off his debt and fulfill his dreams. I always wanted to travel the world and start a family someday but now I know that that is not going to happen for me.

I was such a happy person a few years ago made everyone laugh and enjoyed it so much to brighten up someone's day. I had so many plans. I've never felt like this. Lately when I'm taking the subway I just want to take big step and jump to stop this pain, this everlasting agony already. I find myself on google all night trying to figure out how I can make taking my own life look like an accident(to make it easier for my family) and wondering why I can't just fall asleep and never wake up.

Sorry if my English isn't the best bit I needed to get it of my chest.
