Family member claims they intend to attempt suicide, Police refusing to help...Hi, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, if anyone can recommend somewhere better, please do so urgently.

My 21 year old brother, who is currently at University away from the family home, seems to be acutely suicidal and last night sent several messages indicating his intention to end his life. Our mum and two other family members have rushed up there in the night after finding out he'd gone missing from his shared accomodation, only to find him barricaded in his room by the time they got there in the very early hours of the morning.

Now the police and the NHS are reluctant to do anything and say that he is telling them he is fine, doesn't want help, etc, and they wont intercede unless he asks for help, but it seems to us that he already indicated intent and the police are ignoring that massive detail, for some reason.

Can anyone advise on what the best course of action is in this situation? My family and I are at a loss because he is refusing to speak to any of us, and seemingly lying to the police about his state of mind and intentions.
