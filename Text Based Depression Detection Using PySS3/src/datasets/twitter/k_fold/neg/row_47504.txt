It's all coming back!I spend my 5 years (18-23) living alone away from my parents, in deep depression, wanting to kill myself more than anything in the world. I remember when I moved back to my family home, my father was sitting in the next room and I was standing on my one foot barely touching the chair with a belt around my neck.

4 years after I came back in my family home, I moved to a new country for my "dream job". I am SO afraid that it will happen the same thing to me. I will be depressed, isolated in a very foreign environment, working an extremely stressful job in academia. I am so afraid... Especially now in corona times that many events are not happening. 

I need someone to just call me up and say lets go grab a beer! But ofc, I know no one here
