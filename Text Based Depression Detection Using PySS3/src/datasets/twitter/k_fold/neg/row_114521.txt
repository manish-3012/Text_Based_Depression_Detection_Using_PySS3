I just want someone to listen. Boy, I didn't realize how bad it was until when I decided to submit this and started crying. I've thought about killing myself for awhile, but I always justified it with, "If I didn't have that out, I would feel like I was suffocating." The thoughts have turned into fantasy. I try and laugh it off, but it's becoming less funny. Yesterday when I was jogging though the park, as a "joke," I started testing which branches would hold my weight. I'm good at putting on a fun face and I still go out and have "fun" with my friends (who I love dearly), but there is not joy in it. I was out my a friend and he was talking about his break-up and I couldn't focus. There was like a buzzing in my head and all I could think was, "What's the point." 

I want to tell you how I got here. It might be long, but I'll try and keep it as short as possible. I feel so stupid for even feeling this way; I've lived a good life, but I can pin point the moment it started to unravel. It was supposed to be my senior year of University, but, half way through my senior thesis (which was supposed to be my writing example for grad school), I was told I needed to start over. I didn't plagiarize if you're thinking I deserved it, but it was supposed to be a historiography but came out a bibliographic essay, which apparently had been done by a prominent historian on my topic already. Anyways, it lead to me finding a new topic, but not having enough time to finish half way through the semester I had to take a W. Being a double major, I couldn't do it the following semester because I had to write it for my philosophy degree. Long story short, it prevented me from going down the academic route I had planned for my whole life. 

After a breakdown and questioning if I wanted that level of stress to be my life, I decided graduating late already looked bad to good programs I might as well travel. It would even let me pursue my dream of being a writer and I could finally have time to edit the novel I had written! So the day after Winter graduation a year ago I sold all my shit and moved to Europe. I came back with nothing. That's where I am now. With nothing. Everything I have done has been a failure thus far. I moved back in with my parents and it has been one failure after another. I interview for SO MANY FUCKING jobs, and they always seem to go well, I put on my happy face and I leave with them shaking my hand telling me if I bring that attitude to the work place I've really got a future. They never call back. What is so defective about me? I'm such a hard worker. I really am. I graduated at the top of my class with distinction in two degrees and it means nothing. I recently realized I do want to go down the academic route, but the applications are hard to get done because all I can think is, "You have consistently proven not to be good enough for anyone. Why will this be any different. No one wants you, why will they?" 

Yesterday was a big trigger. I haven't left my room because of it. It's also probably going to sound stupid that this goddamn website could bring me down so hard. But my novel has been donee for awhile, but I've been too scared to show it to anyone. I posted the first chapter on the writing sub reddit. I wasn't hoping for everyone to praise and cherish my work, I knew I would get criticism, but civil discussion and respect for me was non existent. The comments ranged from, "This is so bad I literally laughed out loud," to, "You might be the worst writer ever." There were good words and encouragement, but the vitriol was getting the upvotes. Fuck, I feel so stupid for letting something as trivial as that make me feel as bad as I do. But it hurt. I know my first work isn't going to be great or perfect, but why tear me down like that?

Lastly, I have no one to go to. I can't go to my parents because I see it in their eyes, they can't have another fuck up of a child. My brother was a heroin addict who stole so much from them. He's away though now, but every time I don't get a call back from a job, I get this look from my mom like, "What happened? You were so smart? Don't you know you're our only hope?" I know she means well, and she loves me to death, so please, no hate for her. I love my parents as they have always loved and supported me, but they won't understand. I know they see depression as a kind of weakness. So do my friends. That conversation would go something like, "Dude, stop being so melodramatic." And, fuck, maybe I am, but all I know is I want to slip into that painless nothingness I know wouldn't judge me. Sorry if this is long. Sorry if this isn't the right place. Sorry for run-ons and grammar errors but I typed this through wet eyes, and I don't feel like editing. I just want someone to hear me.
