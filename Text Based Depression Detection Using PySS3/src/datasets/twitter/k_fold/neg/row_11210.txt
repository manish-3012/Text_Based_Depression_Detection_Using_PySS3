Does anybody else put off their suicide?This might sound incredibly stupid and I'm just writing my thoughts as they come (also I'm on mobile sorry for formatting and typos)  but basically I always think logically - killing myself wont work. 

Like I think of all the little bits and pieces I'll have to do. Saying goodbye etc. I live with a roommate. I live away from my family and I want  to get rid of most of my stuff (because even in death I don't want to inconvenience my innocent roommate). Also I don't want my stuff thrown onto the street or in the garbage or something you know? I want to donate my clothes and shit.

I think about my family not being able to afford to support a funeral or whatever way they choose to dispose of my body.

I think about bills I need to pay. And I know in the long run it wont affect me, because I'll be dead. But I dont want people to suffer because of me. 
I think the main reason is I'm lazy and I dont want to put the work into putting the suicide into motion. 

I guess it's good because I'm not going to kill myself spontaneously. And it's good that I have enough positivity in life that some things keep me from dying. 
Anyway does that make sense does anybody else think that way?
