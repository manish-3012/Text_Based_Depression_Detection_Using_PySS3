I'm having a hard time tonightCan't seem to get a job, don't have any friends here, won't be able to fiancÃ© in lord knows how long, abusive family that I thankfully got away from but now worry constantly over my pets and everyone just seems so... Apathetic. I'm turning 24. I have a grade 10 education. All those years of bullying through school and home and work. I keep trying. I just can't get a leg up in life.
