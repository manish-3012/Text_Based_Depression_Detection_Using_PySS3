I keep thinking about it but canâ€™t bring myself to do itLike god damn, I had the perfect opportunity but I didnâ€™t, it was in head the whole time.

Dad was gone for 7 whole hours while I was here alone. I was ready to do it. I had the gun out of the case...

Why is it so damn hard to just fucking do it. Iâ€™m ready, I deleted all my socials that my family and friends follow me on, I reminded my parents and siblings how much I love them, thereâ€™s nothing left to do

I have to do it now before my dad pays for my tuition due in 3 days, and before my family wastes any more money on me. I canâ€™t think of anything to inspire me to keep going, so why is it so hard to end it
