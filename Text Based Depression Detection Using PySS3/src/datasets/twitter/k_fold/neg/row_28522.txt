Every night has been the sameEvery night for the last 3 days have been the same. I have the belt around my neck with the other end on my door knob. Every night I canâ€™t seem to just let my weight drop and let it strangle me. Every night I end up crying through the whole thing and end up going to bed and falling asleep. Now I have this stupid mark on my neck to remind me. Iâ€™m a coward.
