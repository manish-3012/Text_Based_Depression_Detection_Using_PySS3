Suicidal thoughts never leave.So I've had mental health issues for the majority of my life it seems, I can't remember the last time suicide want on my mind.... Whether at the front being an all consuming thought or background noise like radiation that slowly eats away.

On top of the anxiety and depression I also developed fibromyalgia and it seems now I have some other form of chronic illness where I can't stop vomiting. 

I've sought help numerous times in my life, the last time I was bounced between my GP and the mental health services because I was too suicidal for low maintenance CBT but not bad enough for clinical intervention. Eventually neither party responded and no one got back to me.

I dropped out of uni, twice. 
I had a sense of normalcy from my job as a Care Assistant but I've been on sick leave for about 3 months now. I don't know if it was stress/pressure from the job that has caused my current undiagnosed vomiting issue.

So now I do nothing, there's no respite from the ticking clock. For a while now it seems that I've just been quietly waiting for death but today the suicidal craving decided to creep back in.

I'm just so tired of being here. 

Sorry for the pity party I've got going on here.
