Bane of my existenceI am alive but I feel dead. Right now, I think that itâ€™s better to be dead than to be alive. Why? Because when youâ€™re dead, you wonâ€™t feel anything. No sadness, no anger, no negatives thoughts and feelings. Nothing.

I thought that I was mentally tough. I thought that I donâ€™t get sad but something clicked. Something just broke that wall and made me feel weak. Maybe I was never strong. Maybe I was just pretending to be strong.

When we die, we are not going to be remembered. We are nobody. We are insignificant. No one remembers that guy that was alive 200 years ago. Why would anyone remember me?

When someone loves you, you know that they notice your existence. You are in their mind. You know that they know that you exist. Knowing that someone knows youâ€™re alive is amazing but when that someone is gone and no longer there, you feel like youâ€™re nothing. The only difference between feeling dead and actually being dead is that you get to feel what itâ€™s like to be dead. 

I thought that killing yourself was stupid. Why would you do that? Now I know how they feel.
