Yesterday I turned 25 and I still wonder how I made it this far.I was the only thing that held their marriage or some sort together. Came to them today to have a family dinner tomorrow and they do nothing but arguing between each other over stupid shit. Guess they are so tired of each other they ainâ€™t even faking it.

Yesterday I had a birthday party with my friends. Of course it was great, but it was mainly an attempt for me to get some Dopamineâ„¢ï¸ through people I considered friends. We live together and I try to do shit that would bind me with them. Simple stuff, like cooking a bit, doing common household chores around the kitchen and common places, going to the drugstore when someoneâ€™s sick or stuff. But thereâ€™s no feedback. When I ask them something about where is something like a bag for cold food (donâ€™t know how itâ€™s called, a bag where you put frozen stuff when going to the grocery store) no one batted an eye and helped me to find it. Asked someone (by text) to get me instant ramen in store and them â€œWhoops, sorry, guess I forgotâ€. 

Same with my work. Iâ€™m treated like an everyman when almost everyone constantly forgets about shit I ask them to do and rely on. 

I feel completely alone. Not like *alone* but with no person I can rely to. My close ones make me sick. Social interaction makes me sick. My work makes me sick. My constant struggle with my mental complications make me sick. My corrupted country makes me sick. The whole world makes me sick. And now thereâ€™s some weird Chinese virus which literally makes people sick. 

I consider myself a pussy when it comes to the suicide. But I already have two attempts. Dunno when Iâ€™ll get the impulse for a third one, but I hope I would be lucky this time.
