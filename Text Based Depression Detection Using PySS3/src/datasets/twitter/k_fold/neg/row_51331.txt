I finished writing my suicide noteAs the title implies Iâ€™m going to kill myself, I set a date, may 20th, Iâ€™ve had enough who am I living for I just get in everyoneâ€™s way literally no one is going to miss me I guarantee it, I know my mom favours my other siblings over me itâ€™s obvious I canâ€™t remember a time where everything was going good and I was happy itâ€™s clear that Iâ€™ll never be happy so whatâ€™s the point. I hope thereâ€™s no after life so I can finally be happy
