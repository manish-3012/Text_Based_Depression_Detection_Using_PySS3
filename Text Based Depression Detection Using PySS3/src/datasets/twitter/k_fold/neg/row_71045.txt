Why shouldn't I?I love my job, and now I'm resigning from my job so they don't fire me for being an incompetent fuckup, again. I have no savings and a bunch of debt. I'm overweight, disgusting looking, and too annoying to date anyone at all. My place is a mess and I can't muster up the energy to clean or talk to my friends or do anything.

If I'll always be this way--a miserable, embarrassing screw-up--if I'll never be good enough for anyone or anything, why shouldn't I just lie down and put a bag over my head or overdose on pills? What's the point of dragging out the disappointment and shame and stupidity?

I'm so tired. I'm so tired of screwing up all the time and being worthless. I'm so tired of being anxious and feeling useless. I can't do this anymore.
