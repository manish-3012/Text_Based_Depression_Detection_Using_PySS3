Not feeling well. So sad. Can hardly think. I don't want to eat, I feel sick to my stomach and I think I might vomit. I can't pin point the exact thing that is getting me down. I have  dissociative disorder and major depression (or so they say.) things have been going really well . The sadness and reality hit me on Monday. It's lingering and to make things worse, my son and  have lice. So I am stressed out too. I had to shave my precious little guy's hair off because he is only 1 and can't sit still long enough for me to properly treat/comb his head. I can hardly recognize my son. I think in am tramatized because when I was 10 I got lice and my sister and I were infested for 5 months. My mom tired everything and nothing worked. She took me out side, cut my hair to my ears, and sprayed raid on my head. I'm scared. I'm scared. I can't stop crying. I have an interview today and I need to hold it together. This is my 5th interview and I still don't have a job. I'm too shy and awkward to interview. I think I'm done with trying to deal and I'm due for a complete breakdown soon.
