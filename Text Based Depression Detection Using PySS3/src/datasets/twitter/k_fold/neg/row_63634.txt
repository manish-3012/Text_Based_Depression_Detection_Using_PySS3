I feel so lostI feel so lost and kind of foolish. Like suicidal over a boy? Really at my big age? But that doesnâ€™t make it hurt any less. My boyfriend wasnâ€™t perfect; he cheated and he wasnâ€™t always the nicest. There was something about him though, I fell for him so hard and I remember being so scared of the day heâ€™d leave me. Over the past year, heâ€™s made me start to like myself, heâ€™s made me actually start to care for myself and seek things like therapy and a psychiatrist because I wanted to be a better person for him. I was so happy to be with him, I would wake up every morning next to him smiling and actually happy to be alive. He made me feel something and I had been so numb for so many years before I met him. It honestly felt like I wasnâ€™t even alive until I met him, I can barely remember much else before him. I just miss him so much and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll even have the will to function when I wake up tomorrow morning. I havenâ€™t felt this low in so long :(
