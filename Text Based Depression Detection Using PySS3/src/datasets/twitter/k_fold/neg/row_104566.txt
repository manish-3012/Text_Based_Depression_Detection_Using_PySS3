Tried to end it and now I bear the markI tried to end it about 2 days by slitting my left wrist. I could've cut deeper and truly ended it, but then I thought about my family and how much it would hurt them. When I showed them the cut, I could see that it hurt them and made them sad.

I thought I truly wanted to end it, but then I thought twice about it. Now I will have the scar for the rest of my life of what I tried to do on my left wrist. I guess I was just tired of life and that's why I wanted to end it. I'm not sure if I'll be so strong next time if I try to end it again.
