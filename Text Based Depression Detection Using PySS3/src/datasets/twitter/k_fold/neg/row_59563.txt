I tied a noose.Overdosing hasnâ€™t worked. For some reason, all 45kg of me can withstand a couple hundred grams of benzos and pain killers and booze. I woke up after the vomit pooled up my nose last time. 

The point is little agony but at this point I want a higher outcome probability. 

I donâ€™t want to live chronically ill in and out of the low income healthcare system because I physically canâ€™t withstand working more than 20-25 hours/week. 

I want to hang myself off of the terrace. I donâ€™t think anything in my home like the bathroom is stable enough. 

I thought I was out of the dark back in March. Iâ€™m there again. Iâ€™m tired of it. Not even scared anymore. I just want to stay in it, dead.
