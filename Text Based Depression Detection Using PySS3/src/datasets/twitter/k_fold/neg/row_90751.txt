I don't have anyone else to talk to so...I'm posting here because I don't really have anywhere else to go. I don't have any friends and I don't want my family to freak out. I go to a therapist, but I'm scared to tell him about this for some reason.

I've been thinking about killing myself for about two years and right now I'm thinking I might do it before the year is done. I've had a pretty bad phobia since I was 7-8 years old and because of this I am constantly afraid. I've also suffered from depression for years. I'm just so tired of never feeling good. It just doesn't seem worth it. There's so much bad stuff and so little good stuff. I don't know what to do.
