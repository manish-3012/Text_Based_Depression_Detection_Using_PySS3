been a fair whileI've actually been doing really well but no one is around and i dont know my therapist's email so i cant talk to anybody right now

im having a really, really bad panic attack and there have been some invasive suicidal thoughts because of it. 

my current girlfriend is ignoring me unfortunately (I think she's just busy is all) so that also adds to the anxiety a bit. i just dont know what to do right now honestly
