How can I prepare myself mentally?How can I get to the point when I can finally end it? I can't go on anymore. I have so much pain. The only thing that I want is to die. Life is a nightmare. I don't want to eat, or sleep, I don't want it anymore. Please God, let me die. How can I prepare myself mentally? I am scared I will faill.
The fact that nobody loves me, completely alone it's to much.
