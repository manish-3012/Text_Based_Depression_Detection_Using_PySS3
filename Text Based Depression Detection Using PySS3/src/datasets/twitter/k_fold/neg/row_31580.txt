All I want is to dieLast night my attempt at suicide failed. I've suffered severe psychotic depression for 7 years and it's only got worse over the years. For the past few months I had been seriously considering suicide as the only way out of the hell that is my life. I felt so relaxed last night thinking this was the end of it all, now I feel so defeated I'm lying in bed with the blinds shut. I need to die.
