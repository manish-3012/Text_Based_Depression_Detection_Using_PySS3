What needs to be done before I end my life?I have finally set the 31st December 2019 as the day I end it. Iâ€™ve been unhappy for over a decade but kept going for other people, even though itâ€™s not what I want. CBT, counseling and anti-depressants make no difference. 
Please donâ€™t try to change my mind. I have the method sorted and arranged. Iâ€™d like to know what admin I need to do before leaving - ie a will, leaving passwords to internet accounts and bank accounts etc. any advice?
