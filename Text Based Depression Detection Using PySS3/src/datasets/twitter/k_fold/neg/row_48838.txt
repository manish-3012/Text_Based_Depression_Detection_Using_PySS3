Udpate to 16 mg klonopin &amp; wineIt's the morning after and I finished the entire 45mg bottle (not all at once). I don't think any medication complications will arise but if it gets bad, I'd like someone to hep talk to me through this. I don't think calling the ER is necessarily as I have a pretty high benzo tolerance but you never know.
