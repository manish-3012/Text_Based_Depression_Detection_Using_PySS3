Climate Change makes me want to kill myselfI just don't feel like there's anything to live for anymore because of it. The entire human race and the planet are FUCKED out of our control and nobody is taking any of it seriously. There's nothing I nor you can do.

Any children I would have would live in an extremely fucked up world and would probably die horrible horrible deaths. Mass Migrations coupled with total economic collapse and horrible storms and complete collapse of our food chain means we are all going to die horrible horrible deaths in the near future.

I just don't see any point in living anymore since there's nothing anybody is or is willing to do.
