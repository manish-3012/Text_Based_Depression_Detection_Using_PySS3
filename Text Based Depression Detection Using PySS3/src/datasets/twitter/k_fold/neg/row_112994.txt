Taking baby steps to kill myselfHi, 25 yo male here.
I have started contemplating suicide back at last months of high school. Mostly due to upcoming exams and decisions after that (university, etc.). Thoughts about suicide has always been my shelter from any pressure. I would meet every challenge with thoughts like "ok, now I really have to kill myself".
Now I'm in my third try to graduate from university (6 years of university and still no bachelor's degree in sight). After first drop out I got depressed as shit. Lied to parents about how I will graduate and so on. I thought about suicide every single day. But those thoughts were really raw, like thoughts about breaking in some 20 story building and jumping off (I'm a coward, so it would be impossible to break in) or go out during winter and partially submerge into river and freeze to death. 
I would not be able to carry out these fantasies because I'm a pussy.
And this hurts me through my whole life - I can't put any effort in anything because it is hard, I can't hang myself because I'm afraid of pain and so on..
And this year I lied again to my parents about graduating university, because I was ready to kill myself this time. I had a plan. A simple and easy plan. I took few days of from work to try out one method to kill myself. I would spend those days finding out the right cord to strangle myself with (not hanging, because I'm a pussy and afraid to injure my neck). Every night I tighten this cord around my neck (it took me 3 nights to figure out the right way (at least I think it is the right way)). My face gets all red/purple, my head starts to tingle and blood vessels enlarge. But I only do this for few seconds - too much afraid to continue and see what happens if I keep it longer. Heck, I don't even know if this would be enough to kill myself or if it would just give me a terrible headache (please, pm me with the answer!). It doesn't even make me dizzy - I would be so happy if I could pass out and die from stopping  blood flow to brains (but again I don't know if this would be enough to kill me). This is my only way out and I don't even know if this will work. I feel trapped. I have no joy in living, I back stabbed my parents multiple times (for the same reason!) and I don't even know if my suicide method will work out.
