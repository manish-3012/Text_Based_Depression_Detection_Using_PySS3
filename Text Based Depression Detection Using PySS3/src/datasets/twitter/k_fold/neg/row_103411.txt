Domestic Abuse Situation, Suicidal, need advice.I live in Montreal with my boyfriend (gay couple) and I need to leave due to his abuse but am unsure how. I have about a thousand in savings, wanted to get on Welfare and Disability ( I have PTSD and general anxiety ) but since he and I are common law and he works I am not eligible. I would need to drain my savings account and also get a place of my own (but he would have to pay for me to get it and they would see that, or I could drain savings on a place then apply, but if denied I'd be broke and no way of leaving the city). I am thinking about Ottawa but it would be the same thing, need to drain savings to be eligible. 

I'm nervous to be homeless in the winter, so I was also thinking
about using the savings to fly to Edmonton or Vancouver, where it's warmer ( though I know Vancouver is really expensive, less now than Toronto ). 

Starting to lose my grip as the anxiety is wearing on me from the fear of being alone, homeless in winter (Montreal or Ottawa), losing my savings just to apply for assistance,..

Feel scared to choose between being homeless in the winter
or going to Vancouver or Edmonton but never being able to afford a place.

Any advice would be appreciated.
