Thereâ€™s no hopeI donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it in this world. I have no interest in working or talking to people and I feel empty everyday. I work so hard but still remain the same. I never had any goals because life never made any sense to me. Itâ€™s pointless busy work until the grave. Everyday I feel so hopeless and it never goes away. I feel so imprisoned in this life. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore.
