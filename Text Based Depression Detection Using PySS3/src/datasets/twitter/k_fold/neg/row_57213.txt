I'm so tired of this.I'll be turning 27 soon, and I'm officially too anxious to leave the house. I know so many people have it worse than me, and I'm just hating myself for honestly being too afraid now to kill myself because of who I am. I always remember being too anxious to go outside, being rejected by women/feeling unloved. Now I work a job I hate, and for real, I think I might be retarded or something. I just feel like if my family and friends kept me alive for 40 years it wouldn't be anything worth remembering because I'll just be working shitty jobs for the rest of my life. This is literally just anxiety typing. There are like 4-5 posts of people who seem like they are in a similar situation. Someone wrote that he is Peter Pan in Neverland. I feel the same. I'm just avoiding anything responsible and just wasting people's time. I tried to move away but this new town sucks for me. I'm constantly convincing myself not to jump out my window. I hope by 28 I'll have more courage to go through with suicide, as I've always just been too afraid. I guess people don't worry much about me because I'm just a white privilege, whiny little guy. I have it so easy but I hate myself for being on the computer all of the time and being so obsessive compulsive. If you read this, and you're like "dude. Be grateful. You have it made, and you're whining about just this bullshit." I understand and I deserve to hear that. But I hope you can see where I'm coming from too. People think I'm this little guy who hates women and people or something. It's not that. People are just so threatening to even see face-to-face, and talking is impossible. So yeah. That's me I guess. Just too afraid to die.
