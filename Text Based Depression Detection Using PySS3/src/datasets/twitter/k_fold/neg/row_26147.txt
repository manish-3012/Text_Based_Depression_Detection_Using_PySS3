Need to get it off my chestHey guys,
I'm not sure if this belongs here but for as long as I can remember I have never felt particularly strongly about anyone either in a positive or a negative way I just haven't felt anything.
Its not like this story is super sad or nearly as tragic as some of the stories I've read on here but to me they are big and I'm sick of having to pretend each and every day that I care about the people who surround me. Granted It's not like I hate these people its just that I have no feelings for them and its tough because if you cant laugh and have a good time in high school then you get socially excluded and that's not something I want to happen because then it will become more apparent that I'm different. I'm not sure what I'm asking for here I guess just to know if there is anyone else in the 12,023 people here that are like me.
