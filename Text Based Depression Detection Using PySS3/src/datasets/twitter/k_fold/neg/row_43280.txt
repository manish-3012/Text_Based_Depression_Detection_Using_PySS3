I'm just so bored.So for the past two years I've been putting between 40 hours on a good week to over 60 hours on a bad one at my job, which I fucking loved. It was engaging, I did good work, and was respected by my colleagues. 

Shortly prior to my country shutting down due to the virus, and with it my industry, I ended up leaving my job anticipating some time off which ended up doubling before I managed to find myself a dead end job to make ends meet amidst the crisis and it's just soulcrushingly boring.

I can't seem to find the balance between overworking myself to death and being able to afford to live, or working hardly fuck all and feeling trapped at home not being able to afford to do things.
