My friend just told me she tried to kill herself, how do I help her?My friend (18F) has PTSD due to being sexually assaulted at a young age and many other issues due to emotional abuse. She told me she almost killed herself tody and I talked to her but I'm not a therapist and I obviously not know what to do. I told her to call the suicide hotline or her therapist and she keeps telling me that it's not important and she's making it bigger etc. How can I help her?
