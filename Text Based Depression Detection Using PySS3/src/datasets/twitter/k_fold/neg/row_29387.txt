I don't want to commit suicide, but the thoughts flitter in my head every once and a while.Posting on an alt since someone is stalking me on /r/depression.

I don't want to die. Sometimes I wake up and think about my mortality and the fact that death will one choke the life from my bones and I get a minor panic attack. I definitely don't want to kill myself.

But...once in a while, the thought flits through my head. I wonder about it. I fantasize about going to one of the forums I frequent and making a truly final post where I declare that I've had enough. I wonder about the responses it would bring. Really, they're what I care about. Then I think about my few friends and my family, and my classmates even. The hope that people care about me is what keeps me going. I don't want to make anyone sad, even those I don't really like. 

But I still think about it.

I'm scared to tell my therapist this. I already told him that I've had suicidal thoughts a while back. I don't want to go to a mental institution or anything similar. And I don't want my parents to ever know. They already refuse to believe I'm depressed. I don't *want* to die. I try to remain optimistic, and think about all the things I'll miss if I give in. So much music, games, scientific discoveries, world events, technology breakthroughs, books...I don't want to miss them. So I refuse to give in.

But it's getting hard to remain optimistic, to stave off those suicide fantasies. It's getting *so* hard.
