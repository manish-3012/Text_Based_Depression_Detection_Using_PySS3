This is all just so pointlessI mean, what is the point of all of this? Why try to reach for your goals when there are so many obstacles in the way. Not to mention the MILLIONS of people that will always put you down, and constantly tell you that you're not good enough? Why struggle through this shit hole of a society to only be told that there is someone better than you? Why try and ignore that voice in your head that reminds you how worthless you are? Why take the risk of being heartbroken over and over and over again in the search to find your significant other? I don't even know why I'm typing this. It's not like the internet cares. Just a bunch of random strangers who will pretend to care for 2 seconds, then ditch me like everyone else. Everyone I know has their perfect little lives, and I'm just stuck here, willing to do anything for just a hug, or a pat on the back, or some sort of encouragement. Sometimes I don't even think I was meant to be on this planet. Maybe I should have been the one who got aborted. I just don't think I belong here... I'm in my 20's, and I know people will say that you have the rest of your life ahead of you, but why endure any more pain than I need to? Not every story can have a happy ending. Maybe my death can be a new opportunity for someone else? If I keep going, I'll probably just get in the way. I don't want to fuck up someone else's life story, so it's probably best that I'm not even here. My dreams have already been crushed along with my heart. And why is suicide so bad anyways? My physical energy won't be destroyed according to science? So why not just change my form? I know I'm selfish for thinking like this, I just wish someone could be on my side for once...
