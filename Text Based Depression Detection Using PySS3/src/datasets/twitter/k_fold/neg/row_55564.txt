why am I so extrovert yet on the inside im so lonelyFor the past few years ive felt really extroverted...atleast thats what people tell me. i know how to talk to anyone in terms of what they want to hear. its a weird social skill I have. but each year i feel so disconnected... I dont know what I am feeling right now but currently i feel what this sub says. I never ever want attention but i just need someone to telll to me im not going crazy. whole world before me but whole world agaisnt me.
