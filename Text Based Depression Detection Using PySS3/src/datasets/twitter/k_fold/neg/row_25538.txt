my brain feels like mushmy mind is becoming increasingly foggy, it's almost as if i can feel the gears in my brain have rusted, it feels like a pain im making up.

i cant absorb anything anymore, i cant keep focus on anything. i've been trying to be more disciplined, but i end up just not doing anything for hours on end.

sometimes, people stress out over thinking of too much and while ive been there, often, my problem is the lack of thoughts. my mind either is extrememly empty or i get stuck on one thought completely.

sigh.
