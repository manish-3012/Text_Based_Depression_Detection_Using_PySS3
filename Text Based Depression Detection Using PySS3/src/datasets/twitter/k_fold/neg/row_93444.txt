I don't have anyone to talk to I'm lonely and scared and sad and I just want to die. Idk I'm confused and I saw this sub and I need help. I don't know. I'm really confused and sad.

I just moved to a new city for school and I havent made a single friend. At my old university, I had so many friends. And i made them almost instantly. Now, here I am....been here at this school since August and not a single friend. I do't know what I'm doing wrong. I sit alone in my apartment every night, every weekend. The only time I go out is when I go to class or to work out.

 My bf is an ass...(yeah. I know, I know...dump the ass hole!) okay well it's not that easy. He treats me like shit a lot and makes me feel even worse about this whole situation. He's always saying oh shut up it's not that bad to not have friends...says someone who has tons of friends and goes out almost every night and every weekend, he has something to do. He doesn't know what it's like. Then he insults me, calls me clingy, and says I'm ruining his life because of one fucking text "hey what are you up to?" 

Those two things are just the icing on the cake though...I mean I feel so alone and that's why I want to die. I'm so alone and bored. I try to entertain myself. movies, video games, working out, cooking, reading, homework. But I'm alone. I don't like it. I don't understand why I can't make friends. i'm nice and friendly. I smile and say hi to people. I'm not awkward. Not standoffish. I make small talk in class. I join clubs at the university. Nothing. No solid friend group like I used to have. 

I cant imagine living like this forever. What will happen when I get married? I'll have no bridesmaids. I'll have no one sitting there as my guest. Just my parents, and then the  guys side is filled. wtf. I'll have no one to go out with for drinks after work...just forever friendless. That's not fucking okay with me; I can't do it. I just can't. Tears are coming to my eyes as I write this. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is that I don't have a solid way to do it. I want it to work. i dont want to end up in a hospital. I dont want to walk around living with scars on my arms, or be paralyzed from a failed attempt. No, I want to die. I want permanent relief from this. I've been dealing with this sadness for over a year, since I left my other university. Spent a year at home, my asshole father bitching at me for everything. Didn't make friends at work when I was home for that year. I'm friendly WITH people. I have acquaintances but people never invite me to stuff. They never seem to see me as anything more than an acquaintance. And here..here I dont even fucking have acquaintances. God I fucking hate this. I hate seeing people out having fun with friends because I want that so bad. I hate seeing girls with nice, loving boyfriends because I want that so bad. I hate seeing people happy within themselves because I want that so fucking bad. I can't do this. And to top it off, yeah, I've been seeking therapy. For  a good while now and it's not fucking working for me. I feel worse every time I exit that office

I'm tired of being sad. I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired of the fucking downhill spiral my life is taking. I dont want it anymore. I'm sick of it. I'm tired.
