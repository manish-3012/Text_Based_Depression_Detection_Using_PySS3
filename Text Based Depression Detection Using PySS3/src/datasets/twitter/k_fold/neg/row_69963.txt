What's your soundtrack?I know this is kinda morbid but music is a big part of my life.  I have been depressed for awhile now and lately have been getting closer to the edge and for some reason I keep wondering what music would be playing when they found me. I'm hoping reign on me would be the song. What's your top 10 pick suicide soundtrack?
