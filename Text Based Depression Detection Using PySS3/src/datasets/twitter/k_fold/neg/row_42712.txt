Why me?Living is painful indeed. I don't even get it why out in a trillion people on earth it must be me who diagnose with bipolar. I have a perfect life,perfect family, perfect lover, bless in talent and yet almost every night i went to bed with a crazy scrambled mind thinking how everything was painfully meaningless, its like there is no longer a purpose to live when your mind is the one who bring you down every time. I cant even focus on my work, i feel like im never good enough in everything. What is a purposed to live when you struggle to find happiness in everything is it?.
