really afraid of failing suicideI really do wish I were dead. I genuinely don't want to live any longer.

I've been in the hospital twice in the past MONTH for this shit and none of it is helped, as well as tons of outpatient stuff I'm doing now that is also NOT HELPING.

I'm costing my family (I'm only 20) SO much money and I have no way to repay them; I can't even repay them by getting better.

I'm too poor to have access to lethal means like guns and there aren't tall bridges or trains around me... and I'm afraid if I try I'll fail. That might not stop me from trying anyway but if I fail I'll be thrown back in some hospital and cost my family more money and it'll put a tiny bandaid on the problem ONCE AGAIN.

If I could get a lethal injection at this moment I would. And I think I have some pretty dangerous alcohol/med combos. I'm just worried I'll be found by my roommate (she's nosy, but not usually in a bad way) or my body will reject all the drugs. Fuck. I'm so scared either way, I don't know what to do.
