I should've died and spared everyone the troubleA little over a year ago I tried to kill myself. I was hospitalized and released thinking that things were going to get better. Over the past year, I've been able to control my suicidal thoughts but my depression has been spiraling out of control. I got in trouble at school this morning and am being hospitalized again. I just spent an hour in a room with my Mom listening to her cry about how all this is my fault. If I'd just died last year I could've saved everyone the trouble of going through this again.
