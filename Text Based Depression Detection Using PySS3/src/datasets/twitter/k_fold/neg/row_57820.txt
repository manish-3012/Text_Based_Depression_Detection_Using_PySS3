Running out of excusesBeen suicidal for over 6 years now. There's nothing I want more than to just put a bullet through my head.
 
I've been to University counseling, taken meds, but they don't help. It sucks, because my depression is not environmental, it's completely internal, complete coming from me.

I just want to end this. I'm running out of excuses not to. I need to do this for myself. I feel this is not living at all. Living a life with constant suicidal thoughts, dreaming about it when I'm sleeping.

For 6 years it's been the same. I haven't changed one bit. I just keep finding myself in this endless cycle of ruining myself, my life, and disappointing my friends and family.

I know it'd be selfish in some way to just suddenly leave those I care about and care about me, but I want to do this one selfish thing, because I can't bring myself to keep living anymore.

I just don't want to bring anyone the pain or blame on themselves, when I'm gone. Instead, I fantasize that there were some injection that would just give me a terminal illness, making it look like it weren't suicide. I just wish I got cancer or something and could die, that way it would seem inevitable, and no one would feel responsible. Just a bad stroke of luck.

Anyone else know what I'm babbling on about here?
