literally what'sâ€‹ the pointI've thought about suicide and not feeling anything for a while now, not even gonna lie to myself. But every time I think about actually planning and what not, I think about all the people I would hurt. All the people that would be left confused, all of the people that would be left in the dark because I bottle everything up inside. My face is literally my downfall. My side profile will forever be the death of me. I know not everyone thinks like me and my thoughts are largely to blame on my families nature of self hate, but I always question how some people are comfortable looking at me. I say some because I notice people that look down when I approach them. With all of my friendships, I'm such a chill person and I hide the fact that I'm hurting so well. **When people say depression has no face, they aren't lying.** It's amazing to me how well I pretend and am able to go through life without people thinking twice about how I really am. I don't think I would be writing this if it wasn't for a video my friend recorded of me. In the mirror I think I look decent, not my best but decent. But when someone records me everything looks so disfigured and I-...its a mess. Living like this makes me question my friendships and the people that take the time to have conversations with me. I feel so sorry for myself and wish I could slip into a coma.
