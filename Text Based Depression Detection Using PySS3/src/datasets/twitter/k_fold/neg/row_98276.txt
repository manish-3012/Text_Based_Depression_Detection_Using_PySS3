Life's not worth livingMy mind is haunted by depression.

My brain is wracked by anxiety.

My heart hurts from loneliness.

I am a hollow shell that has been cast aside. 

Unfit for purpose, much less existence.

Look for my silhouette along the bedroom wall.

And you shall find a ghost, suspended above the maw.
