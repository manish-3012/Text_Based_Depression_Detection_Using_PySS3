Lonely without my son and I now feel awful.For about a year now I've been without my son, who was the one who was there for me. I've been severely depressed since I was 10, crying all the time and never wanting to talk to others, along with being threatened by people and nobody there to defend me. My parents were strict and the only thing keeping me happy was my fantastic grades. But after my childhood and finally escaping the horrible people and can now get on with my life, I felt I missed so much when I was young. So much missed, and all the horrible things done to me by others. I ignored the depression and instead moved on with a very happy life and getting a job as a Lawyer. Stories would get to me but I knew that it was my job to help and keep on going. Amazing to meet so many new people, and to keep myself in a great financial position, which is why I had adopted a son. I never had a good childhood, so I was focused on him having an amazing one. That is what kept me happy: A young boy actually looking up to me. Good life throughout time, very interested in politics and always told me about how he will be a leader one day with everyone happy. He joined the military at 18 and before I knew it he was reminding me of how great of a person he'll become. But...disappointingly...with him gone I feel lonely. I get reminders of my past and he isn't there for me and nobody else is either. I can't sleep sometimes and will ball my eyes out thinking of the things I missed then and now. All I ask is for help. I don't know what it is, but surely someone would know what my problem is. I own a few firearms and am afraid I won't be able to stop myself and use it to end my life.
