Suicidal thoughts, but I won't act.Is this normal? I hate my life, have nothing to live for, no friends etc. I am constantly thinking of suicide and the perfect methods and how I could do it painlessly, the note I would leave, when I would do it etc. BUT I don't think I would ever do it (I have tried before half assed attempts when drunk), but when sober I wouldn't try it I'm pretty sure. Is this something to worry about or just normal?
