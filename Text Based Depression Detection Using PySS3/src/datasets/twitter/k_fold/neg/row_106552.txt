asdfWent out with some friends tonight, got kinda drunk and ended up so depressed I wandered home without telling anyone so I could burn myself. They were worried when I finally came back, but I made up an excuse about needing to charge my phone. I couldn't get the euphoric effects from it where I usually do it because I was drunk, so I did it on my arm instead. I have a blister now.

I did it because all I could think about was burning myself, and shooting myself. I don't have a gun and couldn't possibly buy one until tomorrow, and tomorrow I won't want to. So clearly I should drive (I'm sober now) to a bridge and throw myself off of it, right?

Went through my phone contacts earlier to try to find someone to talk to about it...but I'm definitely alone here. 

I also know that tomorrow, despite whatever I think needs doing tonight, I will not call a therapist and I'll just be back here in a month until I finally do throw myself off a bridge or something. And I come to reddit and just spew this shit and of course people think they should be fucking aggressive with me, like that's going to keep me around. Fuck. I suck.
