I have no oneI've been having such a rough time and the worst part is that I had no one there for me - no friends, family, nothing. Someone on reddit has been very nice and comforting to me the past few days, and I'm so grateful, but they cant always be there for me. I wish I didnt need other people for comfort, but I guess that's just the way it is. goodnight friends.
