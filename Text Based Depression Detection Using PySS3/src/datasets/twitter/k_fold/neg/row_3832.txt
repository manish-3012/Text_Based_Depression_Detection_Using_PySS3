Is it worth it to just leave everything behind? Is that better than suicide?I'm terrible everyday. I'm losing money, barely living, alone and only growing more lonely. I believe deep down that I'm not meant to be alive, only marginally better if I do, i deserve to be poor, homeless, disconnected, and miserable. It's all i know at this point.  
  
Sometimes i think, so what. I only get by day to day knowing this is my future and I'm just putting it off or just waiting for it to come to fruition.  
  
I think, maybe once I've lost it all, i can just head south. I'll go south as far as I can until someone or something kills me. Whatever any of that means though.   
  
Today though, i just feel lost. Utterly lost.
