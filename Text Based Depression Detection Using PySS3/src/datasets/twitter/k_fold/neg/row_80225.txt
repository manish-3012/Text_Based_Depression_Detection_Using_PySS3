I am screwed, Idk if I will be sued or go to prison or be homeless again. I might just end up killing myself very soon and not have to deal with it. i rent a bedroom in Texas, in a tax creditted low income apartment based on income when i moved in the first manager we had told me not to put my income down and so i didn't every year i had to fill out a new lease and put no income, and they just now found out after so many years i do get income. idk if im going to prison or what will happen. 
 
when i moved in the first manager we had told me not to put my income down because I am a cotenant and cotenants don't need to. I have never lived in apartment before I went by what she said. and just went by what she said every new lease signing, before that I was homeless off and on or bouncing from family to family or homeless.

idk what they will do, everything I look up online says I could be fined, go to prison kicked out or be sued for backpay. im freaking out here. Idk what to do anymore at this point and I can't go to prison, I have cptsd and severe chronic depression and severe social anxiety. men trigger my ptsd, esp aggressive men. and being ina  room with 3 or more people sets off my social anxiety so bad and sets off my paranoia where I just mentally lose it.
