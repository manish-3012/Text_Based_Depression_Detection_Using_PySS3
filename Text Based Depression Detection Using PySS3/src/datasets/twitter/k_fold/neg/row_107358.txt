Self harmI have been cutting and burning myself since the age of 8
I am so mad at myself, but its all i know.
I have anger issues... I wonder what life would be like without me and it makes me smile coz i know its a good place....
Im sitting on my bed with a metal needle over a candle flame.... the only thing going through my mind is what if i burn to death and set myself on fire... heh... I have to go...
