People ask â€œwhy didnâ€™t I see it coming?â€ Itâ€™s because we are most vulnerable when we are alone and they werenâ€™t there when we needed them the most.It maybe kind of hard to grasp for these people but sometimes they need to think not what we do when we are present, but what we do and think when we are absent. I really hope somebody realizes that.
