I tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 8My boyfriend broke up with me tonight. Honestly, I saw it coming. Im 17, he's in college. He has his own issues and I have a shit ton of mine. We didn't always click very well but he made me so happy. He broke up with me because I wouldnt communicate my issues I would just disappear or get mad at him. I pushed him to tell me something he really didn't want to tell anyone, something really personal. It's my fault, no one else's. I don't blame him for how I feel. He just spent four hours trying to keep me safe from myself until he finally couldn't handle it anymore. I feel really guilty about that. I don't want him to feel bad. I want him to be happy even if its not with me. I told him how I wanted to die, but he's known that for a long time. I've wanted to die for a long time. This is just the straw that broke the camel's back.

I tried to hang myself from a soccer net when I was 8. I tried to slit my wrists when I was 13 and was admitted into a psychiatric hospital. Eleven days after I got out, I tried again. I have a great best friend. She basically lives with me and my family. We do everything together. She came over tonight and sat with me until 1:30 in the morning and she held me while I cried and I could tell she was scared.

I was raped in 2017. I think about it so much. My childhood was a fucking disaster and everyone Ive ever loved has left me since I was little. I don't want to live in pain anymore.
