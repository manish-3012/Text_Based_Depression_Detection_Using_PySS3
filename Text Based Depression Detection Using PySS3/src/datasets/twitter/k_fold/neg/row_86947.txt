Hi.It's been 11 days since I last tried to end my life by carbon monoxide poisoning. (I'm still not certain how I'm alive. Car was turned off when I woke up 6 hours later.)

I used to think I just needed to hang out with people, talk, and interact with others, but I've been trying that for the past week, and well, whilst I'm smiling and having a bit of fun I still feel like "I want to take a hammer and beat myself to death."

What do? - Oh, and Cheers.
