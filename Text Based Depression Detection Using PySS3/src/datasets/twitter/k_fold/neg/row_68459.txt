I don't want to die..I don't want to die, but I really don't want to be here anymore. The past few days have been shit. I talked to my partner about my insecurities, and it's triggered him to practically ignore me the past 3 days. He's mad at *me* and making out like it's impossible for me to have these insecurities, that it's made up etc. 

I try so hard to make him happy, to give him all he wants, but I'm just still not good enough. My feelings are still not valid. 

For the first time ever all I want to do is impose physical pain on myself, because the emotional pain is just overwhelming. I can't stop crying. I can't stop thinking about just packing up my stuff and going. 

The reason I don't is 1) we have 2 kids and 2) I have nowhere to go. I think maybe I should just leave them behind too, but I just cannot do that. They are the I my reasons keeping me from wanting to die. Without them my life has no meaning so I may as well just die if I'm going to leave them behind. 

I just don't want to keep on breathing through this pain anymore. I feel so worthless. So invisible. So inconvenient.
