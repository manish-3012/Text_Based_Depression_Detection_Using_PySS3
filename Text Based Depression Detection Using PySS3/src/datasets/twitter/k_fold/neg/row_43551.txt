Is depression herditary?I just wanna know if depression is hereditary because i have such a great life but at the same time I hate it and wanna cut people off in my life because I dont want my suicide to be as traumatizing on them. Its like I cant find reasons to be happy and shit and just knowing that my depression is heredity would be so nice so I could ask my parents if they had it and maybe open up to them about my depression and shit and actually get a therapists and get better but  idek at this point. I just wanna switch off my life
