I am tired of thinking.I often tell my therapist that I am thinking of calling it quits but I never do. I really wish I had the courage to just to ahead and do it but I am so afraid. Not of dying but of accidentally surviving. I don't want to be that person that wakes up in the hospital surrounded by people who are just pretending to care to save face. 
I am also afraid of what will happen to my kid. I know, parents are supposed to live for their little ones but I can't.  Still I do not want my flaws to affect her as she ages. Honestly, I should have given her up when she was born but I was selfish. I listened to the people who told me that things would get better. And now it is to late. She is to old for people to want to adopt her. I refuse to live her in the hands of the people who aid in me hating myself. 

I am so very tired.
