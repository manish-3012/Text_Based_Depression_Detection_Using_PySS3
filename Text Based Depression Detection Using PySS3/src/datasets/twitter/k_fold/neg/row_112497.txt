I feel bad for my husband and I want to set him freeI'm 31, been together  5 years to a wonderful man who is my best friend and more than i deserve. Right before we got together I had an accident that caused nerve damage and severe chronic pain all over my body. He takes care of me alot and my constant health issues have made our relationship so miserable. I can't be an equal partner he has to do so much and I end up causing so many issues with what I deal with. I'm currently locked in the bathroom crying we just had a horrible fight and I was basically on my knees apologizing he's giving me the silent treatment. Looking straight ahead refusing to answer literally acting like I don't exist. I begged for him to just answer to even say -no I don't want to talk right now-and he just turned the t.v. on and didn't even look at me. He hates me. Just like everyone else has grown to hate me and what I deal with. I truly believe if he woke up one morning and found me dead in my sleep he would be relieved and not sad. That he would finally be free of someone so useless and miserable and broken. We have no marriage I feel he's with me out of pity. I want to set him free and just finally die already. My life doesn't mean anything anymore.
