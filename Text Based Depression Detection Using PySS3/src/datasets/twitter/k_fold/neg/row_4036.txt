Does it ever get easier?I wish it were easier to die, because I know it would be so simple and I could do it at any point, but the only thing stopping me is my little brother. He would be heartbroken, and i canâ€™t do that to him. And for some reason, iâ€™m terrified of what comes after. But at this point, itâ€™s so hard not to, and I donâ€™t trust myself around sharp things or near edges of tall places. itâ€™s so easy, but so hard
