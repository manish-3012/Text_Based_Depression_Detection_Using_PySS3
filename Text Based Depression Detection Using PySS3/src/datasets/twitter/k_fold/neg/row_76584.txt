Life is exhaustingIâ€™ve been struggling for months but no one sees. Iâ€™m taking care of my great grandpa with severe dementia and my grandpa with cancer on top of me being very ill. My girlfriend wonâ€™t even speak to me so Iâ€™m basically completely on my own. My relationship with my parents does not exist. Which neither here nor there, I havenâ€™t really been able to process that trauma because Iâ€™ve been in survival mode since running away. Iâ€™m just tired, and I donâ€™t see the point of trying anymore. Nobody cares, and neither do I.
