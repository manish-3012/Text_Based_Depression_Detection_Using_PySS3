How to survive your birthday?I know there are others who deal with it and will understand. 

I don't have to go anywhere and probably won't leave my bed, I just dont want to spend another year crying uncontrollably, with that panicked pull towards the end taunting me. 

I know I'll have it worse tomorrow, I just don't want it to be *as bad*, because I'm edging closer and closer to the end, and this year has been infinitely worse so days of significance hit much harder. 

Any suggestions of basic coping tactics when the anxiety/distress flairs would be appreciated. As well as any other advice -Maybe something on Netflix thats easy to watch (not filled with happy perfect people), but also something not too hard to follow. I've been watching a bit of sci-fi/crime stuff but find when I'm doing poorly and the thoughts are intrusive the shows are too much to keep up with/truly understand, then I get frustrated when I realise ive missed big plot points later on and give up on the show. 

I know there'll be no perfect answer, or likely perfect show. But I had to try.
