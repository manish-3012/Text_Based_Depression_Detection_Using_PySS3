I'm slipping through the cracksIt seems like with every good thing that happens, something terrible sweeps it away and leaves me even more desolate than where I started. I'll never be able to cope with the reality like a "normal person" should. I'll never be brave enough to face my demons and improve and my mental illnesses prevents me from even trying. I'm supposed to be an adult but I'm still dependent on everyone around me and I can never get a grip of my own. I do my best to try to cheer up everyone else even when I'm hurting. I do very little to ease my own pain besides venting and irritating people I care about, or self-harming. I even outright forget to tell my psychiatrist things because I've suppressed them so hard so that they come back later full strength. And I get accused of lying to her by my parents...

I just feel like I'm losing it slowly and I can't even express it all to my closest friends. They even told me they're afraid because I'm going to be the person who was happy one day and dead the next. I try. But it's never enough. I don't know what to do next.

I don't think I have long left.
