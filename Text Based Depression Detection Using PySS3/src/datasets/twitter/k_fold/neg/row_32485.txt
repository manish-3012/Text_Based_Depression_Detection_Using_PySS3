I think Iâ€™m ready to join my sister....Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet and perhaps so are you. But the roses have wilted, violets are dead, the sugar bowl's empty, your wrist are stained red. The sun isn't shining, the sky isn't clear; there's no silver lining cause you're no longer here. Rain keeps on pouring, there's no end in sight, your laying there frozen, so far from the light. Your beauty's unreal, your smile the sun, but time can't be turned nor your actions undone. The words that you wrote that only I read, "I love you so much; please don't cry when I'm dead." A bond that we formed, a love that ran deep, a pain that we shared; a friend I could keep. I wanted to hold you, wipe the tears from your eyes; been there the moment you said your goodbye. I want to forget but most times I don't. I want to let go, but I know that I wont. Tears on my face, memories burned in my head; the roses have wilted, the violets are dead.
