Suicide is an escape route...I'm 35 years old. I don't think I was supposed to live this long. I think I should have died years ago, but I have always felt guilt around suicide. Like I don't want to hurt people who care about me. But at what point should I say 'fuck it' and not worry about others? At what point should I give up? I'm so tired of fighting. I need to rest already. Suicide to me represents an escape route - from depression, from anxiety, from struggle, from traumatic memories, from myself. 

Lately I've been using alcohol to self-meditate - incredibly stupid I know since alcohol is a depressant. But it does numb the pain a bit and it lets me pretend to be someone who isn't me. But it just makes it worse and it interferes with my meds so I'm trying not to drink. I don't know what to do instead. I just wish someone would come along and kill me so I wouldn't have to contemplate killing myself.

*Edit* I just realized I typed meditate instead of medicate. That's hilarious. 
Thanks to everyone for the kind words and stuff. I'm exhausted, but I'm going to make it. 

**Edit again** I had a really bad dream last night. I think I give up.
