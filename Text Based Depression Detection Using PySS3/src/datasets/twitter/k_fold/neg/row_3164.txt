What the f is wrong with me?Im going to therapy, taking my medications regularly, but sometimes i can't control the void-like feeling inside me consuming every will to get up from the bed. It's been like 4 days I'm laying in bed, I just want to get up and do stuff and everything I can think about is ending this messy life I've put myself in. Why can't I be a regular guy with regular friends, job, college and be okay with all of it?!
