Looking for one last reason not to do it.TL;DR: I'm on the verge. Help me man up. Don't let me do it.

I have reached the point where everybody I know has left me, yesterday I was scolded by my older brother for being depressed, was told to "man up", "grow balls", "snap out of it" "think about what mom and dad would go through if "godforbid" something happened to me." my closest "friend" who actually knows of my condition is now mocking me for opening up with him. He laughs when I talk to him of suicide, he's not responding to my phone calls and been ignoring me. I'm pretty sure rest of my family's response would be something similar, since they do not believe such thing as depression exists. 

I'm listening to "Requiem" by Mozart. It sounds more beautiful than ever. 

I'm waiting for one last grain of hope, one last sign until tomorrow night... I still value life and don't want to do it, or probably I still give a shit about my loved ones' feelings. I'm probably scared of death. I'm weak and pathetic. I probably seek attention. Yes, pay attention to me.  (My brother is messaging me in viber right now, asking how I feel, pffft, ridiculous. he's relieved I'm feeling "better". I didn't lie. I AM feeling better. 

I feel as though I'm summoning courage to actually do it. I'm seriously considering it now. I need your help to dissuade me. Don't let me do it. I don't want to do it, but at the same time I'm feeling as though it's becoming necessary. I'm breaking under pressure. I'm weak, so to prove myself I feel the need to do it. Don't let me step forward.
