I know no one reads these or caresI know no one reads these or cares but I'm so close. I'm cold. I'm shivering. The only appealing thought to me is just to down a bottle of pills. There's no hope. No light. I wish I could just die. Please. Please if theres a god I hope I die tonight. Please Please Please
