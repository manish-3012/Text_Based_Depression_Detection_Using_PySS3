My life is getting worse and worse and I donâ€™t know how to deal with itIâ€™m 17 Iâ€™m not a very good student, I try to be but I never seem motivated to ever do school work given how far behind Iâ€™ve fallen. To add on to that Iâ€™ve lost all of my friends because they said Iâ€™m suicidal which I am Iâ€™ve been trying to get better and itâ€™s not working. The only friends I have are mutual friends and they only talk to me because we have the same classes. I had one friend left that Iâ€™ve known for about 7 months and in the last week Iâ€™ve ruined it, she was getting over her boyfriend and her friends told me that I could try to help her get over him, Iâ€™ve tried but she was still attached, she gave off the vibe that she was into me so I kept pushing I and yesterday I found out that she was going to have someone jump me to teach me a lesson about trying to get her to date me, I just wish she would be straight up to me and not lie about simple stuff. Besides that my parents have called me a failure because I donâ€™t put effort into school and only do things I like, I canâ€™t go a week without arguing with them. I feel like such a bad son, a bad person. I treat everyone like shit, I want people to like me and when I try I just fuck everything up. I just want to disappear so I canâ€™t hurt anyone and nobody will have to worry about me.
