crisis line hold for 2.5 hoursI have a very hard time calling the crisis line, and I find the chat service much easier. It goes until 1 am here and it's about 5 to 1 now. I've been trying to connect for the last 2 and a half hours. I know they're busy and can't get to everyone and I'm not complaining, I'm just not sure what to do. I get horrendous anxiety even thinking about dialing the crisis line.
