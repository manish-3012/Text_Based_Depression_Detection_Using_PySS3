Itâ€™s 2 AM here, I think this will be my last post here on reddit.I have 20 scars, 15 on my arm and 5 that i cut on my shoulder. I have no idea why but I just break down, it always starts as a self guilt trip to existentialism to cutting and thatâ€™s where I leave it at with the cutting, Iâ€™ve attempted suicide before, I took some sleeping pills I got from a friend and was planning on taping a plastic bag around my head, but I unfortunately fell asleep before I was done with the bag so I obviously didnâ€™t suffocate.   
That has been my only obvious suicide attempt, I guess you could call this incognito suicide but i cross the street without looking, be it at a green light Iâ€™ll cross it, so far not a single driver has been on their fucking phones like I always see them, they either swerve off to the side or brake and coming ever so close.    
I connected my charger while Iâ€™m taking a shower in hopes of getting shocked but nothing happened, so I stopped doing that.   
I have taken 6 Xanax at once but i survived that as well after I was forced salt water and threw it all up.   
Now that Iâ€™m alone, Iâ€™ve decided it may be time. Iâ€™m thinking of going straight down on both arms if possible and slashing my neck if I still have the strength, razor is brand new so it shouldnâ€™t take much effort to rip right through the skin and into the fat.    
I guess this is my goodbye, but if not then it just goes to show I donâ€™t even have the balls to go through with this.
