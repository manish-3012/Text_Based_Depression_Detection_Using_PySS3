Any regrets?So huh, just curious, of the folks who've tried and failed, and I mean seriously tried and failed, not the attention seeking type, rather, the ones who were either already past brink of death but somehow were yanked back through resuscitation or through any other involuntary means and lived to tell about it, how was it? 

I mean, sure, the initial unimaginable pain would certainly make one have second thoughts but really though, was it really as bad as they describe, especially one of having regret for the preceding actions taken, be it jumping or whatever? 

I'm sure I'm not the only one who has noticed this but from the bits of info I've come across, be they documentaries, word of mouth, prevention ads, etc. always recount how once they took their actions, they immediately remembered not only the unimaginable pain they had experienced but also being filled with complete regret and dread. 

... It's baloney isn't it?

Seriously, is this really so? I suspect not as their seems to be an incredible disconnect between those who've made serious multiple attempts yet still failing nonetheless and then finally succeeding while on the other camp we see them recounting their stories in documentaries and prevention ads sticking to their predictable pro-life scripts of it 'getting better' as it were . Something doesn't add up.

The cases where we have individuals seriously determined to take their own life, multiple times in fact yet due to some external menacing force, prevented from completing their goal speaks volume. 
Making more than one unspoken and serious attempts seems to answer this question but I hold out for some actual responses nonetheless. 

Again, is the last few moment of consciousness you remember filled with thought of regrets? 

If not, what do you really recall? And while here, how much pain do you recall experiencing? 

Your honesty and impartiality in responses is very much welcomed and appreciated.
