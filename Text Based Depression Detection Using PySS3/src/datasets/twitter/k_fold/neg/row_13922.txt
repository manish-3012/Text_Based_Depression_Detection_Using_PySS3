Why am I like thisSo Iâ€™m 18 years old, grew up in a pretty nice neighborhood in a family that does in fact care if Iâ€™m alive, yet I still want to die

Let me start this by saying that my problems are not even close to as bad as some other peoples on here and Iâ€™m sorry for complaining so much when some of you guys have been through much much worse

Because I have adhd and itâ€™s pretty awful, Iâ€™ve never done particularly well in school, which landed me in my local community college. In said community college, I havenâ€™t been going to some of my classes in way too long, just not caring about the consequences. I know that I will never be able to actually do well in school or at an actual job that makes a decent amount of money, and Iâ€™m just kind of tired of being a failure all the time, so I really have been thinking about killing myself. My family I know would be devastated but that doesnâ€™t do anything to help me. Reading this through again just sounds silly and I really donâ€™t feel like posting it anymore because it sounds so trivial but I guess I will
