So tired of lifeI dont see any good in life. I dont want to be a mom, I dont want to get out of bed, I dont want to feel this pain anymore. I looked for hours last night of successful and easy ways to kill myself, and I think I have it figured out. Even typing this it feels like im just being a pathetic whiny brat. I told my ex who is going through a hard time and he just said dont put your life in my hands. He opened up about being suicidal and lost and has done so many hurtful and wrong things to me. His mind changes daily. Im fucked in the head and not deserving of anything. Anytime I think I have something good, it goes from one extreme to the next. My body feels heavy. My soul feels empty. This Friday, i want to do it and I wish it was today.
