Hey guys This is my first post. I'm a 21 year old male struggling with depression with the last few years. Even though i don't want to kill myself i still think about it almost daily. I've decided to write this because maybe it would clear my head a little. I can't remember the last time i had some proper sleep without drugs or alcohol. I had moments of happiness since i got these thoughts but they really don't last long as when i achieve something and start getting my hopes up, life finds a way to fuck me over. The real reason of why i don't want to kill myself isn't because i'm afraid. It's because i want to give a big fuck you to life. Bring it on motherfucker. I'll see you in hell.
