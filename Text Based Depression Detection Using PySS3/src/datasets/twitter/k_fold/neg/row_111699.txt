When you're a failure what's the point?At 30 all I do is let people down. I can't find a job, my time in the military means nothing. I am a waste of space. My wife is constantly getting let down, I can't seem to succeed at anything. What's the point in continuing when the future looks like more failure and hardship? I've been trying to deal and make the best of things for 13 years and it always gets worse. I see all the comments about looking to the future and having so much to live for...but why should I when I see no future? When there is nothing down the road but unhappiness and misery?
