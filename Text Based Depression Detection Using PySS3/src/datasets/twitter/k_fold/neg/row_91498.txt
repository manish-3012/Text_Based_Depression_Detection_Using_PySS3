I suddenly have the means to do itIt's rather sudden...I just came back from the doctor and he carelessly prescribed me several lethal dosages of painkillers. I still have a few boxes of sleeping pills at home that lower my inhibitions so much that I've attempted suicide several times just because of the sleeping pills...but now..? It scares me a little bit. I know I can't control my actions once I take the sleeping pills, who knows what I'll do with the painkillers in that state..
