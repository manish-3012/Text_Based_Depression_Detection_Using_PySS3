I'm in a psych ward but I have had enough.I've been in the psych ward for about 2ish weeks now. I'm receiving rTMS for like the 4th time. I've had ECT multiple times. I've done all the therapies. I've had all the drugs. I'm fucking over it man. I just want to be dead. No one gives a fuck about me anyway. They're too wrapped up in their own shit. It's just real fucking hard to kill yourself in here.
