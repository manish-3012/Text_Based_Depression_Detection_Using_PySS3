Self-inflicted chronic pain is making me want to kill myselfI've lost count of how many times I've said "I fucking hate myself and want to fucking die" this past week. I've screwed up my hands so bad because of intentional self-injury without care or stupid choices that I've lost all care about my life. My ulnar nerve in my right arm is messed up and the outside of my wrist and hand always hurts. My pinky isn't aligned correctly either. I have numbness going through the nerves of all of my fingers on both hands. My thumbs hurt a lot and the inside of my wrist feels compressed. Literally all of these were my own stupid fault and could have been prevented. Every single one.

I'm trying to pour myself into physical therapy and everything I used to do (music and video games) but nothing feels right. Nothing feels good in the way that it used to and I don't think it ever will. I just want to feel normal again. I just want things to feel like how they did. But I fucked it up and failed to take care of myself, and now I've just made my life and the lives of others so much harder. I feel no hope for the rest of my life. Everything that brought me so much joy feels different and not in a good way.

None of this was supposed to happen. I was supposed to become a successful drummer and musician and have a room dedicated to music when I became independent. I was supposed to have a wonderful women to share a passionate relationship with. I was supposed to be a computer nerd and built systems for people and embrace technology and spend many years working through my Steam library. But no, I screwed it all up, I can't fix it, and I have no desire to continue. I've learned the importance of self-preservation, playing it safe, and taking care of yourself, but I learned it far too late. I seriously considered stabbing myself in the throat last night. I doubt things will ever be the way I want them to be.
