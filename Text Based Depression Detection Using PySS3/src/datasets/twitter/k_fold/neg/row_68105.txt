I think im gonna dissappear after my shift today.Life is a nightmare. I have been unemployed for 6 months now, and it has been the worst six months of my entire life. I am such a failure, and whenever I try to vent, people tell me they hate me or that others have it so much worse than me.

I'm tired of having to work in order to survive. Its the middle of a pandemic, and all I can be worried about is the possibility of being evicted. I have a shit home life, where my father hates me and my mother is emotionally distant. The only person I talk to is my significant other, who I don't deserve and is probably going to break up with me.

So yeah. I start at 430 today and end at 930. I think im just gonna keep driving until I fall asleep at the wheel and kill myself that way. I'm scared of hurting people, so I might just go 100 on the highway and ram into a divider. Any way, I see no point in living to see another day if another day will only bring me more shame, humiliation, and pain. But I don't want my partner or a roommate to find me, as I know that will be traumatic.
