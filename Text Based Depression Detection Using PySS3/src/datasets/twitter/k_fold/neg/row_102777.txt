Is there really no other way?I feel like there's genuinely no way out of this. I'm plagued by the urge to self harm and to kill myself, but there's apparently nothing anyone can do about it. I take meds, see a therapist, talk to my family about it but... I'm still getting worse. I went to A&amp;E and all they said was "it gets better". I don't qualify for inpatient because I'm not psychotic enough.

What the hell am I supposed to do? I feel like there's only one way out of this - to just finally kill myself.
