I don't know how to liveBasically, I grew up a very sheltered kid in India and moved to Canada four years ago as a 17 year old to live with my grandparents. Because of social phobia, I never ventured out of the house for anything other than college. My grandparents paid for college and everything, so I didn't have to work. I have no friends and no social life. It's a massive chore for me to get a word out of my mouth when I talk with someone and because of depression I can't concentrate on anything. I totally understand that I am fully responsible for the situation I am in. I want to be a normal human being like everyone else but I just don't see that happening. My family love me and are very supportive but I don't want to be an embarrassment and a burden.
