My planI'm going to college in september. I don't care about my grades, I'm only going to try to make my last few years as "fun" as possible. I'm killing myself after college, I'm not responsible, I'm a lazy piece of shit who'll never be fit for the world, I won't last on my own, and i'm always on my own so thats how its gotta end. I'm gonna cut people out of my life, I need to be alone so I don't have guilt about doing it. It isnt about them its about me and I need to be alone when I kill myself so it doesnt hurt anybody else. I've been waiting to kill myself for years. It's going to really suck losing my friends but im not good for them its what needs to be done. i wish i was better and i wish things were different. i wish i didnt have this emptiness in my heart but its there, its not going anywhere and nothing fills it. fuck it none of this shit matters anyway
