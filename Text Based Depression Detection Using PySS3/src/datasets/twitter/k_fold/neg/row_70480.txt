I don't want to be a father15 minutes of pleasure for a lifetime of suffering, I already wasn't doing very well before I got this news, but this is the straw to break the camels back. I can't be a father, I can barely handle my own life let alone a child and a girlfriend that drives me nuts.

My parents will disown me, I won't be able to finish uni, just living cheque to cheque for the rest of my misrable existence, fuck that, I'm already misrable enough, I can't take anymore pain.

Before any of you ask she won't even consider abortion or adoption so this is just a completely terrible situation, I have no escape other than death, I'm not going to live that life, even if I try to I won't make it very long, it's better I just leave the picture now, rather than causing more pain in the future.
