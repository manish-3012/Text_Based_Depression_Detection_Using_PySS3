I need to be put down.I fucked up my back and now everything hurts. Everything hurts so god damm much. Why the hell do people expect me to keep suffering through this? If my dog was in this kind of pain they would be telling me it's time to let go. Worst is I can't even do it at this point, I can't even phisically move far enough to stop my own pain.
