Iâ€™M LYING TO EVERYONEI have been struggling with depression for the last six years. My depression ended my marriage and makes it difficult to maintain friendships. Iâ€™m, yet again, taking an SSRI. Itâ€™s strange; I feel as though the antidepressants make me tolerable to be around-for family and coworkers-but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m any less depressed. I think about suicide every single day. I have a plan. Iâ€™ve been asked about suicidal ideation, by my primary healthcare provider, by my partner, my boss. I always deny wanting to end my life because I know what such an admission would yield. I worked as a behavioral health RN; I know how inadequate the mental health system is and an involuntary admission to a local psych unit isnâ€™t going to help me any.  

Iâ€™ve tried making positive life changes. I left my job as a registered nurse to work in a more creative field. I quit drinking alcohol-March 25 marked a year sober. I took up yoga. I left the city and relocated to a quiet suburb. I got a dog and started tending plants. None of it matters.

I feel so hopeless, like thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to. It all just keeps getting worse and worse.
