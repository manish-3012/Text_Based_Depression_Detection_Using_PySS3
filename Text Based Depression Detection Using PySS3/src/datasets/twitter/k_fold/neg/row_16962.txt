Not really sure if I belong here... Need someone to talk toMy boyfriend of two years left me last Saturday. I thought for the most part that we ended things on good terms. I try to call him or text him, he wont even respond. When I did reach him on the phone he said we couldn't talk anymore. I never thought that he would do something like this to me. Treat me like a complete stranger. He even told me he still loves me but just can't be my friend anymore. I loved him more than anything and now he's gone. 

Maybe I'm taking it too hard but this just tears me apart. The breakup truly was out of nowhere. I would have never expected it. I feel so lost. I feel so alone. I focused on our relationship more than anything This pushed many of my friends away. I wish I could tell them I'm sorry for this. I have no one I can turn to. 

I've been through a lot on my life and nothing ever seems to get better. I've lost both my parents and I'm not even 24. I can't ever have anyone want to stay with me. It's always just more pain. Even if I'm happy for a period of time, somehow something happens and more pain comes along. 

I know I have reasons to live. I know there are things to look forward to. I know my life is worth something but I am so tired of feeling this pain. The pain never goes away. I just don't want to feel it anymore.
