I took a bunch of pills last night while drinkingI don't know what happened. But I just started taking them. I couldn't stop myself. I was drinking grey goose and I went to my medicine and I started taking anything I could. My heart meds, anti depressants, mood stabilizer...everything. I just started taking them. Like 30 minutes later I started throwing up and I think I threw up some of the pills.
I don't know how I ended up surviving this. But I feel so ashamed.
