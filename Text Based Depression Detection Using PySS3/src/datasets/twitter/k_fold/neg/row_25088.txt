I canâ€™t take my brain anymore :/Ive been fighting depression and suicidal thoughts for many many years. but over that past 5 years Iâ€™ve actually felt a lot better, more hope and honestly thought that Iâ€™d never think of Suicide again....well this year Iâ€™ve gone back to my same old thinking :/ and I just canâ€™t handle it any longer, I donâ€™t want to have this brain anymore I donâ€™t want to do this.. thereâ€™s no more hope for me I donâ€™t see a future ... Iâ€™m done.
