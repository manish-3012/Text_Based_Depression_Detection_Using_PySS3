It's weird to still be aliveI was never supposed to make it this far, yet here I am. I was going to end it all a little over half a year ago, I was convinced it was going to happen and I didn't look beyond the date I had set for myself.

I just don't know what to do with myself or with my life at all. I can't go to school, I can't work, all I have is therapy. But the problem is that I'm still struggling to find the motivation to try and get better, it's so much easier to give up.  I'm expected to do things and to want to improve but I just don't have it in me. I'm still here for pretty much no reason at all other than to waste people's time. The time and recources that are spent on trying to help me or fix me should be given to someone who has more worth than I do and could actually give something back to the world. I just don't know anymore. 

Does anyone feel the same?
