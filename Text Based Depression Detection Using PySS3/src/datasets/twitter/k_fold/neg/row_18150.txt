To be happy or sad is irrelevantTo be okay or bad is irrelevant. These are phases that mix together all the time, until it gets impossible to recognize them. Until we get into a catatonic state of living. When things happen around us, and to us, in our lives, and they become irrelevant, they dont affect us anymore. People kill the humanity in themselves.
