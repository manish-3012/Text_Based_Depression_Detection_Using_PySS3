I need to help a friend and I don't know how...My friend is: Older, depressed, in pain, tired and has no hope. He won't call a suicide hot-line, but as he been in politics for 30 years, he understands the law well enough to know that as long as he doesn't tell the cops that he is contemplating suicide, they can't do anything to detain him.

I wasn't worried for a while, but he has begun operationalizing his end-of-life: packing his shit into boxes, looking for a home for his beloved dog.l

I don't know what to do or how to help. Any advice appreciated.
