Will this even get readMy family finally showed their true colors, they feel as I had been suspecting for a long time. They resent me. My mother sees me as the â€œthe biggest failure of her life.â€ Bc â€œI can never do anything right.â€ I have to live here all summer. Live in the house I was verbally abused all my life, physically beaten every day as kid, scarred. Every day I am greeted with hostile looks of such hatred, screamed at for things I â€œdo wrongâ€ or things I donâ€™t even do, such as  â€œhaving my hands in my pockets.â€ Despite these facts, I have never laid a hand on her (with exception of a hug or occasional kiss or incidental contact), yet she feels â€œunsafeâ€ with me living there Bc I am tall and kinda strong. She feels I have wasted her life away.

My father left on my tenth birthday, and somehow he is the only one who I feel doesnâ€™t hate me, he barely even knows me. 
My brother criminalizes me for leaving to go to college in another state while he studied here commuting from home. He thinks I am the reason his life is â€œdifficult.â€ Difficult as in He stays home and does some chores. He thinks â€œthe reason for family is to use them.â€ He thinks I think Iâ€™m better than him, and has many times said that he trusts his friends more than me. He thinks that he is always in the right and I am so fucking delusional with every thought I have.

Then thereâ€™s me. Iâ€™m so fucked up I canâ€™t even hold a normal relationship. I ignore my friends and they know nothing about me. Romantically, I donâ€™t open up either. If someone is interested in me as a person I canâ€™t help but think that there must be something extremely wrong with them to the point I fixate on the smallest of things and that makes them â€œimperfectâ€ to me. I  often times find myself thinking that they are so much better than me, and leave my relationships before they even have a chance to bloom. I have a skin disease which is so itchy it honestly makes me hate every second. I donâ€™t require any help or treatment or anything tho, I just suffer. I get panic attacks so often at home. But to my family itâ€™s just a matter of â€œdonâ€™t sigh/yawn/breathe like that in front of me.â€ They think Iâ€™m a nuisance. After everyone close thinks youâ€™re a monster, honestly, you start to believe so too. Am I so fucked up? Such a bad person I will never be loved in any capacity? Honestly I wonder this all the time. Whatâ€™s even the point if things will always end the same way? For the longest time Iâ€™ve felt â€œI donâ€™t want to be here anymore,â€ but Iâ€™d always tell myself that itâ€™ll get better. Now I see that it really doesnâ€™t, and maybe there just is no point. Oddly enough for the first time in a long time I feel at peace.

I have never shared this with someone and if you read this far, thank you. I just need someone in the world to know this, even if itâ€™s just one person. Maybe someone will find the perspective of an eternal fuckup somewhat enlightening. Sorry for the essay.
