I have no optionsmy father tried to rape me while high on mushrooms about a month and a half ago. I now live with my mom who I hadn't seen in six years because she was emotionally abusive to me as a child (I'm 17). I found out I have a four year old sister. My mom is now trying to kick me out because I don't treat my sister well enough and keeps telling me I have no where else to go unless I want to get raped by my dad. I don't want to end up in a foster house if there even are those where I live.
