The online school system is stupidIâ€™m a 15 yr, so no one takes me seriously irl. Iâ€™m an Asian so Iâ€™m applied to the stereotypical busy learning. Now that online class started, I have very good grades in school but the amount of work my parents put on me also increased. (Debate, Public speaking, Spanish, reading, Soccer, teaching a class for volunteering, coding, cello are all the extra things I have to do.) Iâ€™m usually fine with this even though it means more things to do. So on online advisory, I have to use the time to do work. Because I have so much, I usually try to start right after the previous class ends. But that means I sometimes forget the attendance form for advisory. At first, I thought it would be fine since I did attendance for all my other classes and itâ€™s just advisory. But after a while, my parents exploded on me. Because I accumulated about 9 unexcused absence from not filling the form for advisory, the school warned my parents the 10th one would be a court warning and my parents would become criminals. Iâ€™m devastated to see my parents be so scared but at the same time I donâ€™t know wtf anymore. I do so much work to satisfy my parents and be good but now itâ€™s fucking leading my parents on the path to being a criminal. I feel like such a disappointment but at the same time I want to blame the school.
