Need to talk and feel like I have at least ONE friend before I leave tonight.I really need someone to talk to. I have no one and haven't talked to another human in months. I have posted before but no one ever really talks to me. once last chance. I'm staring at over 200 sleeping pills and I want to take them tonight because at least I'd have something to eat. I'm literally dying to just have ONE friend tonight before I go.
