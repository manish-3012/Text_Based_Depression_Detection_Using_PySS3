Iâ€™m pretty sure sheâ€™s going to break up with me on FridayWithout her Iâ€™ll have no reason to live besides my mum and dad, and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to live just for them. The idea of doing this to them pains me more than words can express but Iâ€™m so exhausted. I was barely surviving WITH her, but without her, I have nothing. Iâ€™ve gotten ugly and disgusting over the past few months because Iâ€™m too miserable to keep up with hygiene. Iâ€™m failing school because I have no motivation. I have no real talents anymore - everyoneâ€™s caught up to me in the things I used to excel at. I feel like everyone at school laughs at me behind my back for being weird. I donâ€™t have a dream job. I donâ€™t have a dream life. All I want is peace - to not have to do this anymore. I canâ€™t seem to give a single shit about anything anymore - except her. If I was guaranteed to win the lottery next week, I doubt Iâ€™d stick around for it. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it this time.
