Feeling really suicidal nglItâ€™s 4 am and Iâ€™m thinking about just ending it all right now, but ofc I overthink everything and I just wonder like, what if I survive, would I still go to school, would I be in a mental hospital, would they notice anything wrong, would I just have to act like everythingâ€™s ok if I wake up and nothing happens? Or like, what if 200 pills isnâ€™t enough, will the death be painful, etc etc. Like Iâ€™ve been wanting to die for awhile now and like I have the chance but Iâ€™m hesitan t???  Like if I died today would anyone even notice Â¿Â¿ Aaa
