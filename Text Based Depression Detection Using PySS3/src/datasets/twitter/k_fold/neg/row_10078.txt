[Serious] Is there a point to saving someone or yourself?A genuine question. Flame if you'd like, but I guess it is just my current state of mind.
I am questioning why it is better to stay alive. I mean, shit, in life we experience many physical things and emotions; pain, love, happiness, hurt, sorrow, joy, numbness, apathy, empathy, there's a whole fucking DSM full of these buzz words categorically describing how people should feel.
I guess my question is, why tell people not to do it when it comes to suicide? Some may see it as the cowards way out, some may see it as weak, or some may see it as plain old sad but in reality, who are we to say it isn't the better option?
We, as the dead, don't see the mess left behind, hell, we don't care.
I am not a religious person. I assume death is much like what it was like before I was born. That being the case, what is the point of prolonging the inevitable? For a little bit more happy? For a little bit more sad?
Why is it I feel comfortable about killing myself even though I am married with a beautify 3 year old daughter, and a 7 month old son who I both adore?  I don't understand...
What's the point?
