Another tearful night, yayJust another one those days, itâ€™s so much fun, blissful even, and nothing could ruin your mood. Then you feel the slight dread of knowing the day wonâ€™t last forever. Then before you know it, back to a miserable and pointless existence. I really donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep this shit going. I can only put this mask on so many times before the cracks show through. Actually no, Iâ€™m already too late, just cry myself to sleep and kill myself later when I can get the strength to throw the rest of my life away.
