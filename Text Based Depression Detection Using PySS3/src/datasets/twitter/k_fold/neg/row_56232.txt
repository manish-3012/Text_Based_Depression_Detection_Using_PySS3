I feel like I'm spiraling out of controlI've been depressed for a while now, for some time it was something that I could push down and get over, but since the sudden death of my mother two years ago it feels like everything is getting more uncontrollable.  I'm fairly decent at putting on a show and not letting it out, or so I'm told.  Recently it's getting harder to put on that face every day, especially when deep down I have thoughts of just ending it all, they used to only pop into my head occasionally, but the time span between them is increasingly getting shorter, I'm having a hard time keeping my emotions in check, I'm starting to fear I may be more than just depressed with how quickly my mood can change.  I've harmed myself to the point of nearly breaking my hand, and the thoughts have turned from "I could do it" to "I could do it like (this)".  I feel like no one would really be bothered if I were to do it, and those that would be would only be bothered because they feel like they should, not because they actually would be.  I have very few friends, I'm stuck in a dead end job where I don't even get half the recognition I deserve, I'm quickly reaching the point to where I will just be a burden on my entire family, and I just want it to be over before it can get to that.  I don't know what to do, I don't have anyone to talk to, I'm completely lost.
