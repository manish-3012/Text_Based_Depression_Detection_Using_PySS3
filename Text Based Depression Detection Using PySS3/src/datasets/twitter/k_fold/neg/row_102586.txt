Iâ€™m sorry to my dog for choosing to end my lifeThank you for being a part of my life, your a good companion that deserves to be loved by the next group of owners. I know it might be hard, seeing as Iâ€™m your second owner. I canâ€™t take this anymore, I can obtain peace when Iâ€™m dead. Even though I love you, I wish I was more mentally well
