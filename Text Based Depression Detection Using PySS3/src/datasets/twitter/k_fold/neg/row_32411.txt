Just want to talk.Pardon the rant. The only way I could make a post is by not letting myself go back and delete it. This may not make sense, but whatever.

I feel like the only option I'm allowing myself is suicide. I don't particularly want to kill myself, but I don't really want to live either. I have absolutely no ambition to do anything, especially in relation to my future. I feel like such a little bitch because I have the capability and support to do whatever I set my mind to, but I don't WANT to do anything. I honestly don't enjoy life. I don't understand what's so damned great about it. It leads to nothing, and while I understand that you're supposed to enjoy it for the journey, I'm tired of it. I hate dealing with people and it's always been clear that people don't particularly enjoy dealing with me. No matter how I try, I always come off as arrogant or condescending because of my tone of voice, and I always look angry because my face naturally defaults to that expression. I've never been very expressive, and I guess people have told me I'm a robot for so long that I've become one. I've had people open up to me, and I've tried to reciprocate and offer support and be a closer friend, but I guess I'm doing it wrong because it never happens again. Because of this, I have plenty of friends who tolerate my presence, but nobody ever invites me to do things or wants me around. I'd like to say that none of them care about me or would miss me if I died, but I know that's not true. 

I have shit to do now. I have more I'd like to write, but I've mind-dumped onto this page enough for now. I'm not going to do anything drastic anytime soon, so there's no urgency, but I'd like to talk. I've gone 7 years without talking about any of this, and I think it's time.
