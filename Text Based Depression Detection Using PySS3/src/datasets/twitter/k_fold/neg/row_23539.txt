I can't find my way out of my mindI've become dangerously nihilistic. 
I suffer from bipolar/manic depression - but I do have medication and attend psychology sessions. 
A month ago my 3 year relationship ended because we've become somewhat incompatible. 

I'm at the point where I imagine what I'd say in each letter to each of my loved ones. I imagine what my funeral will be like. I don't see the point in the effort I put into work. 

I'm just caught in this sense-depriving abyss and I can't hear anything else, I can't fumble my way out. 

I have to carry on. I know that. I just don't know why.
