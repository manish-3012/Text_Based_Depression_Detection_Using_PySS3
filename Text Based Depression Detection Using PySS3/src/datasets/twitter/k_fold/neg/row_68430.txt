My cat is dying, and I don't know yMy cat is dying, she has a cancer and she won't survive for a lot of time(maybe for a week, maybe for a day, maybe for a month). She lost 5kg, she isn't meowing anymore and she always sleeps. I'm scared about living without her. I'm 15 and she stayed with me since I was 5. She's a part of my life, and I know it's selfish but I'm not ready to let the vet kill her, she "saved" me several times when I had suicidal thoughts.  What should I do?
