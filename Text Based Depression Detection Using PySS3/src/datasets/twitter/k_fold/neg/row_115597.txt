Looking for a reason to go onI've juggled the idea around in my head for a long time but never have I been so close to actually ending it. It started back when I was in high school. Sophomore year I was diagnosed with depression but for reasons unbeknownst to me I wasn't able to take any sort of medication. The first couple of years the thought occasionally popped into my head but I dismissed it as just part of being an "angsty teen".

Senior year was different for me, though. It was college admissions time and I was looking to enroll at the honors program at my stage college, so I needed an edge that made me seem better than the standard applicant. That's when my parents revealed that I was diagnosed as autistic (Asperger's syndrome to be more specific). I was actually diagnosed as a kid and they did everything they could to make sure that I could try and live a normal life, and for elementary school I felt like I was just a kid, no mental disorders or anything despite a few odd quirks I had. Once high school rolled around that all changed as I found it increasingly harder to socialize and "fit in", finding that some of my "quirks" became a lot more amplified and prominent than I remember them being and finding that I had a genuine fear and inability of being social outside of my comfort zone. The more I thought about it the more a lot of my earlier life made sense, and the more I started to hate myself and see myself as some sort of mistake or genetic freak. I feel like I should be counting myself lucky that I was part of the "fortunate few" who are diagnosed with autism and actually have some sort of intellectual "benefit", but there are still too many drawbacks to this curse to even make me consider myself lucky. With the combination of depression and autism (and with it the increased self-loathing) I felt myself much closer to the edge than ever before, but I still found some happiness in the world and had a few reasons to keep moving on, so I powered through until college.

At this point things weren't great for me, but they could have been worse. Due to my "condition" I had unintentionally pushed away a lot of my friends before-hand and the few I had were usually preoccupied with their own lives, so when it came to college I was on my own for the most part. I tried my best to make new friends and actually made a couple (although I feel like they all just stayed around me because they knew something was wrong with me and they felt bad). I also had 3 "motivators" that kept me going when things got rough: video games, alcohol (something I had recently discovered) and a dog that I had loved since childhood. The year started off fine, classes weren't too hard and I was actually enjoying myself for awhile, where any sort of "bad thoughts" seldom drifted through my mind. 

Mid year though, things took a drastic turn for the worst. When I was visiting home one weekend I woke up to my parents telling me that my dog had to be put down last night and they didn't want to wake me beforehand. I was absolutely devestated. I had never really dealt with death beforehand so to know that my favorite pet was just gone, with no chance to say any goodbyes crushed me. After that things got worse to me. I turned to my other two "vices" to try and get my mind off of things (at this point my dog dying was only one of many concerns, including some of my "friends" trading me out for the latest model as well as failing my first class) so I started drinking more heavily and playing more games, which in turn hurt school more. At one point my friends cut me off of the sauce, not out of concern but because I "wasn't worth it" to supply anymore, so now I was down to games. Things kept getting worse, home life became much more tense, and I felt my friends slowly dropping off one by one. 

Two things happened this week that finally pushed me past my breaking point. I played one game in particular (Runescape) that I poured most of my time into for the past few years. With a double xp weekend, I was actually happy to get on and have some fun. I got on last night to find that my account was banned because of a supposed "bot" (I never used a bot in my life, it was never worth the risk) and that there was no way for my account to be recovered. Everything that I had worked so hard for was just gone in an instant, and I had lost my last escape from reality. The other thing was a realization that had just occurred to me. My high school dating life was practically nonexistent, and my knowledge of my "condition" only made things harder in college. Any attempts I made for any sort of relationship were either met with brutal rejections or unenthusiastic "No"s. One of the only things I really wanted in life was some sort of relationship, someone else who really cared about me. Valentine's Day week (and all the happy couples making their happiness as obvious as possible) made me feel like I'm going to be forced to live the rest of my life alone and die the same way.

I can't take it anymore. I feel like an outcast and a freak who will never know what it's like to feel love or any sort of happiness. I feel like my mind is continuously slipping and my mental state is only getting worse. I can't find enough happy moments in my life to outweigh all the lows. I feel like I have nothing left for me to live for, and the only reason I haven't gone ahead and pulled the trigger is because I know how devastated the few people who care about me would feel. I just need some reason, any sort of reason or motivation to keep living.
