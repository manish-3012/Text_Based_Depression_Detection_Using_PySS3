Anyone else have fantasies of killing yourself in the 3rd person?I feel a lot of happiness in thinking of killing myself in the 3rd person, almost as a time traveler. My target bring me at various ages. Then, teleporting out of that scenario, and then reality would ensure and Iâ€™d cease to exist.

Hope this doesnâ€™t break any community guidelines. Of course, I donâ€™t have ANY homicidal tendencies - I donâ€™t see a point in that. Though, I get joy in thinking about this weird self harm fantasy...probably because I have quite a bit of guilt thinking about suicide, so putting myself in a scenario where itâ€™s not my fault is a nice fantasy that alleviated myself of that guilt.

Maybe this is in line with the thought of being diagnosed with cancer or being in a freak accident. Just curious if people have the same thought.
