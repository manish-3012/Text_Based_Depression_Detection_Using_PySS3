Still aliveI made a post some time ago about how I was ready to go. I got a bunch of comments trying to convince me I was wrong about myself, that I deserved to live... and I apologize for how confrontational I was about it then. It turns out I have a major depressive disorder, and it turned me into an asshole who couldnâ€™t see anything good in the world. Iâ€™m now on antidepressants and while Iâ€™ve had better times (I mean look at the world right now come on) I am grateful for the people who kept me alive. So I just wanted to let everyone know that Iâ€™m okay now.
