Worried for a breakupsuspended from school, have to tell GF's mom. she's likely gonna freak and make us break up. I only know life with this girl she's literally my best friend and the only reason I haven't followed through with past attempts. if we break it'll be Thursday so I want to do it Saturday after work; grab some pot and a handle of vodka and end my life. I can't be without her but I don't want her to suffer because of that action. Help me. I can't help myself
