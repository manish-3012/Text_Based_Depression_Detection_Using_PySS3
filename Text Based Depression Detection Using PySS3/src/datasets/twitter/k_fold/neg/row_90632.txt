I've tried everything.They tell you, get rid of the toxic people. I've done that. It just sucks when it's your immediate family.

They tell you, change your environment. I've done that. But living in another part of the country made me feel more of an outsider. 

They tell you reach out to your loved ones. I've done that. They don't reach back out to me, they have been thriving without me. 

They tell you change your lifestyle. I've done that. Lost and kept off a lot of weight for years. Home is organized.

They tell you go out and meet people. I've done that. But I feel like a fraud nowadays, hiding my misery.

They tell you change your job. I've done that. But I feel stuck at a company that doesn't care about me. I've been applying to other companies for years to no avail.

Most days I don't smile, so most days I get snickers and unwanted comments on what I look like. 

On the outside they may wonder why. But I've over thought this long enough. I'm tired..
