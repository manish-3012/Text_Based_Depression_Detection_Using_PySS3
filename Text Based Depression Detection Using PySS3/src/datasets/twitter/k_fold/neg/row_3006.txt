Just have way too many things going against me and almost nothing going for meIâ€™ve been miserable for a long time. Iâ€™m 26 years old and this should be the best time of my life but itâ€™s the worst. Where do I begin? Iâ€™m gay, short, balding, unattractive, have a tiny dick, and as if all that wasnâ€™t enough I have a fucking colostomy bag. I have absolutely no hobbies or interests besides getting high on dope. And I canâ€™t even do that anymore because I lost my plug. I live with my parents and work a low paying dead end job. I have no motivation whatsoever to do anything. The only things stopping me from ending it are the pain it would cause my family and simply not knowing what awaits me on the other side. Honestly moreso the latter. Nothing can help me besides and endless supply of drugs, I just wanted to get all this off my chest.
