Your suicide attempt and experienceIf you've attempted suicide, how do you feel now? Did anything surprise you (family, friends, thoughts, life etc..)? Do you still want to commit suicide? If not, do you  struggle with the thought? What changed your mind? And lastly if you want, how old where you and/or what made you do it? What helped you?
