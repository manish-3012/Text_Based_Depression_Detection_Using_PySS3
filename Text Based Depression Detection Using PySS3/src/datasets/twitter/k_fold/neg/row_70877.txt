I rather be ran over by a carI have 0% hope.
Things donâ€™t get better,not for everyone.
Iâ€™ll just wait for an accident to happen.
Feeling suicidal makes you feel so guilty for everything and in every aspect.
I was born a rat,and I will die like a stupid rat.I exist just to suffer.I envy but love to watch people that everything goes well for them,I wonder how pure their souls are...
