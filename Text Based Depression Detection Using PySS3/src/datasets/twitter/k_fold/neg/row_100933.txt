I'm so downLittle background: I (26F) have depression for almost all my life. I wanted to kill myself for the first time when I was 9.  I tried a couple of times in my teens, but didn't go through for some reasons. When I became an adult, it became worse. Lot's of try and miss with medication
.. I have been hospitalized thrice, last time being last year. I had been diagnozed with bpd at that moment. Since then, I'm followed by a therapist, I tried everything... I'm so exausted... I just want it to end. Last night, I hurt myself and now, I'm through it. I really want to die and I want to do it now. Please, let me be done now...
