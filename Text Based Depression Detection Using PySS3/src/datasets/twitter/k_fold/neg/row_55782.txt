I no longer desire to go onBecause I no longer have hope. It's hard to explain to anyone who hasn't been in that situation. But I have nothing to go on for, no reason to wake up in the morning. Believe me, I'm trying. I force myself to be social, I exercise regularly, eat right, all those things that people alway harp on about "curing" depression. They don't help, if anything they make it worse because it makes me feel even more hopeless. I don't want to be dead. But I just wish I hadn't had to have been born. That's what would be best, I think, for everyone. 
And that's the truth too, because I only try to help, but I always seem to push everyone I care about away, and hurt them. I don't mean to. I'm fucking hopeless.
