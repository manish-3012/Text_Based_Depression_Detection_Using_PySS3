Best thing to happen to me would be for me to go to sleep and never wake up again.You guys have no idea how painful it is to feel so unwanted in this world. To feel as if you seriously have no reason being here. This what happened: basically Iâ€™ve experienced a lot of bullying in my life because of my dark skin complexion. Been called ugly numerous times and laughed at by people. Because of this, I felt like an alien and like I didnâ€™t belong in this world so I wanted a girlfriend really badly. Well Iâ€™m 18 now and still never had a girlfriend and it hurts me so fucking badly because not only does it make me feel unwante On this earth, it also makes me realize that everything people have said about me in the past must be true. All the people that have laughed at me and called me ugly and called me names like burnt toast are right because Iâ€™ve still yet to have a girlfriend.
