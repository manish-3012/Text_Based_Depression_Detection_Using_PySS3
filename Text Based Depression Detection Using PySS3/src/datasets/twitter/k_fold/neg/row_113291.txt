Old FWB has told me she's SuicidalA friend of mine has outright told me she wants to kill herself.

A brief history:

We met at a retail job and dated for a month or so, then stopped and didn't talk for a while. Eventually we reconnected and realised that being Friends with Benefits would suit us more. We've been on and off FWB over the years as either of us has entered and exited relationships. Right now we both have girlfriends and are just friends.

A hour or so ago she has told me she wants to die. I know she's been suicidal before, is generally depressed and on some kind of medication that she claims isn't helping her at all.

She is very poor and can't afford professional help, despite how much as she wants it.

We're both 25 and live in Australia.

What can I do to help her?
