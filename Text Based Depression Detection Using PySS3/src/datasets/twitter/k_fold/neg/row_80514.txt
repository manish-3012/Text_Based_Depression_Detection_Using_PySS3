Would love some assurance this will get better, so far I don't enjoy life.Throwaway, I really don't want to draw attention to myself but I'd be lying if I said I didn't need attention. Basically I've been unhappy since as long as I can remember, I'm only 20 but I've been considering suicide since as early as middle school. I've always been popular, girls like me, I play sports and succeed at them (sometimes) but I am never proud of what I've done for long. I feel like I can't and shouldn't trust anyone and I keep losing anyone I try to keep... Has anyone else felt this, anyone else who maybe didn't grow up with a father as well? I just want to be happy like I feel everyone else is, if I don't think I will be I might just end it so I don't have to put up with this stupid unrelenting depression.
