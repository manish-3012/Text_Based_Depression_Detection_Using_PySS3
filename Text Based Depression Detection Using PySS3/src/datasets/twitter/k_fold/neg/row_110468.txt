Everything is prepared and done. Less than an hour left of my lifeAll the letters are written. Will written. Money transfered to help those I want to help. A good quality 4meter rope is bought and a noose is already made. Location is chosen. Just waiting for everyone to go to sleep and I'll finally be free. Goodbye.
