how to (somewhat) ethically commit hotel suicide??so. iâ€™m going to OD in a hotel. iâ€™m honestly so happy about it and Iâ€™m looking forward to it more than anything (lol)

I know itâ€™s undeniably fucked up but the alternative is doing it at home which would mean my family finds me + greater chance of interruption. 

iâ€™m thinking I could OD in the bathroom and leave a small post it on the door or something and have it kind of blocked off to signal that something is wrong so that police are called and the person that sees my body is someone equipped to deal with it, and not some poor housekeeper?

really not looking for people asking me why I want to commit suicide or people telling me I should fix my life
