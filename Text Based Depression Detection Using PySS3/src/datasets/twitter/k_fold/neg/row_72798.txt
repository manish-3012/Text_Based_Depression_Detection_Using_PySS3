Fuck this.I'm really not okay right now. My girlfriend, who I love with every fibre of my being told me that she "just wants to be friends" while she contemplates going back to her ex. I was just a rebound it seems. That's all I had going for me, now that that's gone, so am I. Its over.

Edit: if anyone has any advice to help get over it... that's what I need right now. I'm not angry, just very hurt and tired of feeling like shit and cutting myself... not just because of this, but life in general. I may need another hospital visit... /:
