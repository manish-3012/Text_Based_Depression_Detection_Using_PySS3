Am I autistic, have bad social skills or just unlikeable?I really canâ€™t figure it out, every time I speak to someone it goes badly, Iâ€™ve had a horrible childhood and havenâ€™t been shown love by anyone for most of my life, I cannot make or keep a friendship for the life of me, when I talk to people they usually get weirded out so I just sit alone in the back of the class for the with my hood on, Iâ€™m 22 in college and still I do this, looking back at my life I only maybe had 3 friends and all stopped talking to me all of the sudden even when things seemed ok, never been invited to a party, a birthday or even just to hangout, if only I knew the problem Iâ€™d work on fixing it because itâ€™s getting really hard to keep going.
