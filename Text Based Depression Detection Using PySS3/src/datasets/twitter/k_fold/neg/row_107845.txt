What do you do when you can't live without the only person you don't deserve to be with?This is just my little rant, you may skip this and put your rant relating to the question in the title, in the comments.

I just read this (small) article:

The line:
*Some people will suck you into their hellish world if you let them. They will keep you there forever, for drama after drama, as their emotional support â€” as their prisoner.*

It made me think if I was the poison in her life. She left me after 3+ years of relationship and just said "it's not your fault, it's about me". Whenever she asked me, when we were together, why I needed her; the first thing I said was that she was my emotional support. She was the only person I could sharr everything to and be with without worrying about anything.

Maybe I was just sucking her into my hell. She had to get rid of the poison, she did what she had to do to survive. She was not wrong in her actions. But I definitely didn't deserve her nor do I deserve her now.

But when I met her, after a couple months into the relationship, I could see she was more than just my dream girl. She had all the qualities of a nice human being and also supported me at every step. I was only of use to her when she wanted some technical expertise. I was very much the geek/nerd of the college. And she was the outdoor loving, singer/dancer/beautiful girl of our batch. We were polar opposites in some sense. But still I forced her to come with me. I kept on perusing her for 1.5 years untill she finally said yes to being in relationship with me. I didn't deserve her because she was the super outgoing person who had to enjoy her life. She always said she didn't deserve me because she somehow felt I wanted someone with some weird type of intellect. I always tried to tell her she was more than just intelligent. That she was the most awesomest person I ever met. But it finally didn't work out.

Our last 10 months were in long distance. She was too kind a person to just break up out of the blue. Or to just tell me that I was a poison in her life. She let me know she had feelings for someone else and gave me some time to convince her. I failed in even that.

I am crazy for her. Last few months I've cried atleast every other day, just thinking about how I failed her. Reading the article just consolidated my view of me being the one who deserves to writhe in pain. I wish for her happy life. But more than that I wish if somehow magically I could get back with her. To make sure to give her every possible happiness of her life. And to not commit the same mistake again...

But when I look at it with a little more practicality, I am sure I won't get her ever. What's left in life at this point..... I just want an end to all this. It's too much to take. Everyday, thinking about her, about how she, who promised me to be together "always and forever", couldn't take being with me for a few more months untill we met again.

Maybe it's better to end this life now than to wait for more failures, destriy more lives. I habe tried reddit, I've even tried the dark web, but I could not find anyone willing to help me to find a way to die from some terminal disease like cancer or the likes... Because I don't want my family to be judged by the "society" for my actions. If anyone here can help me, please DM me or post here.. Although I'm not sure if this post itself violates any of the rules of this subreddit, in case it does, sorry for that. What else could you expect from a failure anyway?
