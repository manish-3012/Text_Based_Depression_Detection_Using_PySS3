I'll never be lovedI'm a 31 year old man who's never been in a real relationship. The closest I've come were a 2 year middle school relationship and a boss who forced me have a relationship with her under threat of being fired (another story).

My problem is that I'm asexual. Well, that's what I tell friends. In reality I also have fetishes, namely femdom. Since I'm only aroused by a fetish, especially one so rare, it obviously makes finding a partner who I'm compatible with borderline impossible.

I've still tried to date, but with little success. I never make it past the third date, and even that's rare. Lately I can't get dates at all. I guess I'm not a very exciting person, especially since I have no sexual motivation going on.

At my age it also occurred to me that many people won't want to deal with a guy who's never had a real, adult relationship. Who wants that level of inexperience in a 30-something?

Today it hit me truly hopeless my situation is. How I'm never going to experience love. I got so little of it as a kid (I avoided it after my dad had molested me starting as a toddler), I've never had it as an adult, and I never will. It hurts so much, knowing that's my life. And I know that pain will only get worse the older I get. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but never this serious and intense. I'm honestly not sure my life is worth living. We all need love; how am I supposed to live if I'll never experience it?
