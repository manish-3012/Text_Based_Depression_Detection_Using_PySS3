I think you could say I attempted suicide for the first time tonight. Almost feels like a right of passage?I don't have much time to type, so I'll cut to the chase: I'm feeling depressed tonight and sketched a drawing of me strangling someone (no one in particular so I just labeled the victim as "everyone"). After that I thought about strangling myself so I took a towel and strangled myself with it. It felt great so I pulled tighter until I felt lightheaded and immediately needed to lie down, so I fell down on my bed. After that, my body just started shaking uncontrollably for a little bit. I attempted to strangle myself again but hated that vibration that I was feeling so I stopped. I feel stupid but also kinda laugh at myself for attempting it. I never attempted suicide before, so I guess I feel kinda...proud of myself? I know that sounds really messed up but strangling myself somehow made me calm down.

I don't plan on telling anyone irl. I messaged my friends on GroupMe about an hour ago telling them that I'm feeling depressed, and I almost didn't send it because Christmas. There's no way I want to ruin everyone's Christmas by telling them that I strangled myself. I might tell them in January, or maybe not.
