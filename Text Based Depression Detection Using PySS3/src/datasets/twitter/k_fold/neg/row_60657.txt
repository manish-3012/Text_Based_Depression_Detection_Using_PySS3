I got a note. I got a plan.Depression. Anxiety. Insomnia. I'm on medication. I've been in therapy. Nothing has really changed in 6 years. (Or the ten before that as undiagnosed and under medicated) I get so depressed at night. Almost every night I think about it. Tonight, I wrote the note because I feel like it is inevitable. 

My boyfriend of 6 years has his own problems. Can't be bothered with mine. My friends have been pushed away by my isolation. Only my internet friends still speak to me. Even then, I pushed one away with my utter batshit insanity. It's only a matter of time.

Nothing feels good. No amount of medicine. Nothing I used to do. I'm scared to leave the house now. I can't leave.

I want to die. I want to fall sleep and never wait up again and I have enough medicine to do it. I just need the guts. And every night that passes like this, I am a little closer.

The things that used to stop me no longer matter. My mother finding me. My dog missing me. The bills left behind...nothing. Only thing between me and my pills is one good breakdown. I'm getting close.
