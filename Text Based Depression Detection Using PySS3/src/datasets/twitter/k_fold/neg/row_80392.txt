tried to strangle self now throat hurtsI tried to strangle myself last night using a tourniquet. I did not lose consciousness so gave up after some time (not sure... less than 15 minutes). I felt headachy and weird afterward and feel headachy and weird today. Also my throat hurts a lot and it hurts to swallow. I am a 30-year-old adult. I am wondering whether I should seek medical attention for my throat. I do not want to be placed into a psychiatric hospital involuntarily. Any supportive words that things will probably be okay would help.
