Grave yardI have severe memory problems and I don't know why.
For as long as I can remember (about 1 week besides maybe 4-5 memories I can recall off hand) I've wanted to die. I'm sad. I don't have the effort to write this. I used to like writing. This place feels like a grave yard. I feel insane. I wish I could write poetry. Why do people do the things they do? Why did E kill himself? Why did Aunt ME die? Why does everything hurt so much. I want an angle to come and take my hand and lead me out of this world. Oh god please? Grandmas going mad and mom is doing her best but idk how good that is. I sorta hate myself sorta think I'm kinda cool. Idk
