People perpetuate the suffering.I am almost 22 years old yet I feel as if I have lived a thousand years.

I have seen therapists. More than five of them have been ones I have seen since I turned 18 years old. My youth was spent seeing school counselors who did nothing about the abuse at home.

I have no one I can genuinely speak with about my cocktail of personality disorders, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. The one person I am closest to lectures me about who I am, although I already who what is wrong with me. They go on and on about how I am refusing to cope, refusing to get help, refusing to face my life. And yet here I am, seeing three therapists (all with differing therapy styles) and taking medication. 

Unknowingly, every person in my life who lectures me to "just stop thinking about it", "have you tried eating healthier?", "well just stop being so negative", "you're not going to get anywhere with how you live and how you act you don't have any direction or hope".

It's all short term help. I feel good for a few days before my methods of positivism run dry and useless.

I have no use in this world. Some people aren't meant to be here. We fix that mistake by removing ourselves.

I am not meant to be free from this prison of my fucked up mentality. I want it to go away. 

Oh, but what will people say? Even in death I fear other's opinions.

What pain will I cause to those who find my body and have to deal with it? How many people will be pained because they thought I had something to live for? 

I do not want them to think I had anything to live for. Those are lies.

The only difference in this world I make is being a number to an employer. Do you know how easily I will be replaced? How easily we are all replaced?

How do I live when I am not meant to live?
