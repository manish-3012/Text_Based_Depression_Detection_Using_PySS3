I don't know what to do with my lifeI'm 18 and right after I graduated high school (literally graduation night) I was kicked out of my house which I was being emotionally abused in and now I'm living over 100 kilometres away from my friends and anyone I care about, she held all the stuff I owned there hostage and it took all my saving I had to get it back, I'm sleeping on a cot in my grandfathers basement with 2 other siblings and my stuff gets taken by them daily to the point where I have no socks and no money to buy more. My mom being the manipulative person she is managed to pin all my friends parents against me and I lost a few friends from that and now I couldn't feel more alone, I have no one to talk to and all this built up anger, I know it's not healthy but it's getting to me and I just really want this to be over.
