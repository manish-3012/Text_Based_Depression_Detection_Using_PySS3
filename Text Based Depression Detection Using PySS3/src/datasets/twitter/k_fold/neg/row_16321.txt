Everything is shitI'm going through a lot right now. My parents are abusive, my depression is getting worse, I fucked up and won't be able to get into college, my memory is so bad that I can't remember anything past a few days, and being trans is just fucking up all the rest.

I have nobody to talk to. I cut off contact with the one friend I had because she was being abusive, but I can't even remember if she actually was abusive or if I just convinced myself that she was.

I know I should see a therapist, but every therapist I've seen has ended up treating me like shit or tried to commit me to an extremely abusive mental institution. I can't even talk to anybody I know because I'm scared they'll tell my parents and my parents will have me committed for the 72 hour holding period bullshit that turns into a 2 week stay.

I have nobody to talk to, and it just feels like my life has hit a brick wall. Everything I've been planning, everything I've done to try and get better, none of it's worked out. It really seems like suicide is the only way to stop all this.
