I'm terrible at titles. SorrySo, one of my favorite movies is Constantine(2005) and I remember watching it and I've read some of the comics so I know hes basically nothing like the character from the comics, but the storyline is imo perfect. I remember how disappointed I was that there was a sequel planned, but it never got the green light and I read the plot for the sequel and it also sounded amazing. Well, for all you fellow fans this will be good news for you.


 A sequel is coming after all these years. I was happy for about 10 minutes, before I realized I dont think I can wait that long. I dont think I'll be around for another year let alone 2 or 3. I used to be able to get excited and use reasons like these to continue trucking on, but alot of times my excitement is met with disappointment and now I'm being painfully real. I'm not gonna be around for it
