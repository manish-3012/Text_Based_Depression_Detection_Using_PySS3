The ironyIâ€™m sitting on the floor in my bathroom me and my SO just had a blow out argument, my daughters crying and Iâ€™m ready to just end it all. I love my little girl sheâ€™s so beautiful 2 months old my world but my SO is right. Iâ€™m stupid , I dont contribute much, I dont do enough and I complain way to much. Idk why I dont mean to but heâ€™s made it clear Iâ€™m a burden to him and everyone else. The irony is my greatest fear is dying my 2nd loosing the ones I love but hear I am on the floor ready to end it all and die and leave everyone behind. But I felt maybe if I got It off my chest told someone anyone Iâ€™d realize that heâ€™s right Iâ€™m stupid and this is just another time Iâ€™m just being stupid and Iâ€™ll feel better. I dont have any friends or family to talk to so I came here and now I feel even more stupid as Iâ€™m typing this. Why donâ€™t I just do it why am I taking the time to do this ? I know why because Iâ€™m terrified and a coward and hoping Iâ€™ll change my mind before Iâ€™m finished.
