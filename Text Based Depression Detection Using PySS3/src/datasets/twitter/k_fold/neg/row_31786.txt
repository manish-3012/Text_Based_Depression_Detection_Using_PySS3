Depressed but won't kill myselfI just want to share here since at least nobody whom I know personally will be inconvenienced knowing about my troubles. Dying not visited by anybody and not cared about by anyone has been my lifelong wish. To know that my disappearance would just be nothing to anybody is my fantasy.
