should i kill myself ?hi i'm 16 at the moment of writing this and i know that 16 year olds can't have problems because of the influence of internet culture, but please answer in a serious manner and don't ban me from this.

i'm 16 and i was questioning if i should kill myself,  since a very early age i was inferior to anyone else, worse results worse handwriting and worse in everything when compared to anyone, this caused me at school to be a laughing stock and left completely alone for most of my school years with the rock bottom being middle school where i was regularly beaten up by my classmates because i wasn't able to achieve similar results resulting always inferior, now in high school the site hasn't changed at all except for the fact that i'm not beated up by anyone, the situations might seem great at first but i'm pitied by everyone around me causing me to feel inferior to everyone else, 
( i feel like it but its how things are i'm objectively inferior to anyone included the commenters)

at home the situation isn't much better since everytime i talk or try do to some interests my parents would always make fun of me, since i love videogames and books they never miss a chance to make fun of me by calling me moron and violent for liking videogames and tell me to wipe my ass with books since reading is such a waste of money that they call them overpriced toilet paper, after a traumatic divorce between my parents now a man that is engaged with my mother lives with us, sadly he never did something that make the situation better since he also makes fun of me for my interests with more offensive words compared to my mother.

i don't know what to i feel like a failure and everyday for the last several months i'm scared of anything that i once enjoyed with the happiness of my parent and "stepfather" that laughed at my interests for so long while i fall even more in despair,because of covid-19 i won't be able to find a job especially since i'm inferior to everyone else around me and since i'm a failure who life gave the worst hand possible i feel like i would rather kill myself instead of keep living, 

i've always been on therapy since i was merely 6 years old and now without it the situation became so bad that everytime i'm reminded of what i enjoy i want to cry and start having phisical pain like when they revelead the dualsense and the gameplay of granblue fantasy relink, 
the pain was so bad that for hours i was unable to move because of the great pain since it felt like i was being stabbed at the stomach.
(no joke)

so yeah i should take my own life since i'm a human failure that was inferior to everyone else since he was a little retarded kid ?
