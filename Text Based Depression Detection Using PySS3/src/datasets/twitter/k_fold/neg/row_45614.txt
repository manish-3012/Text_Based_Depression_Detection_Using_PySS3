Not everyone deserves to get betterEvery time I seek out suicide prevention help thereâ€™s always these messages of â€œyou DESERVE to feel betterâ€ and stuff and that just canâ€™t be true. I truly am just feeding off peopleâ€™s time and energy and there is no way they donâ€™t also hope I die. There is no way that the crisis line people, the counselors, psychiatrists, and hospital staff donâ€™t wish I had just killed myself so they wouldnâ€™t have to deal with me. My family, friends, and SO have seen me depressed for years, and thereâ€™s no way they wouldnâ€™t rather just mourn instead of put up with my shit. I honestly am an utter waste of space. I feel lower than a human being and feel like killing myself would be like taking out the trash.
