I have no reason to die but I want to.Itâ€™s kind of funny to think about. Iâ€™m not depressed or anything, thereâ€™s no problems in my life, I havenâ€™t gotten my heart broken, Iâ€™m not in debt. I live a pretty good life and I realise that but Iâ€™m honestly just bored of living.
I never really saw the point of life so I just kept going along with it, but itâ€™s still really boring. And I hate hearing that â€˜youâ€™ll miss out on so many new experiencesâ€™ crap, like I know.. Thatâ€™s the point. Anyway I think if I werenâ€™t so lazy, Iâ€™d be dead by now. Committing suicide seems so complicated, I want to do it, but I cant be bothered.
