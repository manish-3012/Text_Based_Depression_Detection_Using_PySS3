On the edgeSo this has been one horrible year. After almost six years of fighting a rare and aggressive prostate cancer that metastasized to his liver my father passed away three months ago. Also his brother (my uncle) died two months before him with the same type of cancer unknown to him and our family. Both at the age of 52. I've spent the last two years taking care of my Father and it has been a heartbreaking journey to see him decline and undergo chemo. I was there during his last moments seeing him during the dying process still haunts me. I've struggled with bipolar II the more depressed side since I was 14-15. My Dad was everything to me, best friend/mentor/support during my long depression episodes. My family almost expected me to kill myself after he died and I'm surprised I haven't even tried yet myself. I've been sober since he died. Well that will change tonight. I bought two six packs of my favorite beer with the intention of getting drunk and making a noose. I'm only 26 with no friends living in a state away from the rest of my family. I have been keeping up with my meds and it has helped but the loneliness is eating away at what little hope I'm holding on too. I now have more finical responsibilities that basically leaves me broke until my next pay check so I feel almost stuck in a house playing video games. I realize I can change that but I have no motivation to find new friends or even try to be happy. The pain of loosing him hurts everyday and its been hitting me real hard this past week or so. IDK why Im posting this. Humans have a biological instinct to survive which I know from previous suicide attempts. I just have no desire to live this sad lonely life or to change it.
