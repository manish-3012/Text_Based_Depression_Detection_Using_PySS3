I don't need help. I'm already dead.Well, you see, I don't have friends, nor family, nor significant other, hell, I've never been in a relationship to start with. I don't know what  it means to love someone. And at this point I don't even care anymore.

From the past 4 years the only thing that kept me going was my job, and soon I'm afraid I will lose it, I was stabbed in the back and my bosses are thinking of replacing me. I'm just another cog in the machine...

Can you be really human without a job?, without friends?, without family? without love?. That's not a human, that's a frikking drone, a soulless machine. And yet, that is what I am. I Realized that I don't need to commit suicide. I'm already dead. 

You know, when you don't have anything. You're no longer afraid of death. No family to mourn you, no significant other to leave behind, not disappointing any friend. Death becomes your friend.  I wish I had tears, but I don't have feelings anymore.
