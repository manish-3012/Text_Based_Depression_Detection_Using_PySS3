do not do iti have been reading some text from holy book (quran) and it says with certainty that no matter how much you are suffering you must not kill yourself cuz the details and time of that is to be decided by god and by doing this you sort of injustice god 
and it also been said that the heaven gates will shut from them and they are to remain in hell 

you should start reading the book right now you would see that it is the ultimate truth and the last word the last sign and miracle that is to remain forever so you dont het lost or tell god that if you sent us a way we would be trynt s in the next life and that it is too late to say anything THEN 
read it right though 
the same way angels would worship god you must be in that state (try to) and learn how the prophets prayed 
the redemtion is the promise of this book for those who would listen and are not yet deaf by their vanity and their ego 
so being self less is the key to being then to repent and do everything exactly the way it says , for your own good
