Itâ€™s like they all know itâ€™s my last day.In the last 24 hrs, almost all of my friends and close family have reached out to me. I never said a word to any of them about what I have planned, never let on any hints that I wasnâ€™t okay, anything.

Telling me they love me. Telling me to spend time with them or inviting me to go places. My best friend and roommate invited me to a concert tonight because he bought an extra ticket, but I told him to invite someone else because I know I wonâ€™t make it.

Iâ€™m crying because Iâ€™m scared it wonâ€™t work. Iâ€™ve tried three times in the past, twice within just the last year. Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s going to fail and everyone is going to hate me. I just want all of this to end. 

Iâ€™m about to get out of bed and set up the final pieces. I have my note written, an outfit laid out for my funeral, and a playlist for each event. I pray to any god out there, if they exist, that this works.
