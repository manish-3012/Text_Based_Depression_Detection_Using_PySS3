How do I help my little sister.Iâ€™m 20, Iâ€™ve wanted to eat a bullet for the last 5 years but here I am, existing only to keep my mothers guilt intact. 

Forget me and my worthless fucking existence in this world, my question here is what the fuck am I supposed to do about my sister. 

Sheâ€™s 16, and I can see it. Sheâ€™s sleeping throughout the whole day on the weekends, only leaving her room to eat, she never leaves the house unless itâ€™s for school and she only has like 2 friends. She sends me suicide memes all the time and only seems to listen to sad music now. When I asked her to go get food together this weekend she just said, â€œNoâ€. 

I know the path sheâ€™s going down, luckily she has no interest in drugs like I did. I donâ€™t know what to do or how to help her, are parents are fucking clueless acting like nothing is ever wrong and never gaf. 

I donâ€™t want to see her end up like me, dead inside with no reason to wake up in the morning other than to get to work.
