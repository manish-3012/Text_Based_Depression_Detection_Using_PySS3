Share your story (anon) to help volunteers build an anti-suicide appHi r/suicidewatch. I'm part of a group of volunteers who are working on an app to help with chronic suicidal ideation (*not* emergency suicidal crisises). The app was my idea; it was inspired when a close friend died of suicide. I didn't know how to tell the difference between what happened with her and the chronic suicidal ideation that I have had since an adolescent, and I think if I could have, it might have made me better able to help her.

So, as part of the design process for making the app, we need to hear the stories of more than just me and my friend. We are looking for:

-people who know someone who died of suicide
-people who have made suicide attempts
-people who have had ideation and not attempted.

What we need to know:

-if you haven't attempted, what you do to prevent yourself? when and/or why your ideation started (if you know) and what causes it to get worse or better.
-if you have attempted, how did the ideation start, and what made it cross over into an attempt
-if you know someone who died, how did the situation leading up to their death begin, what was it like, and what do you think brought it to that conclusion.

you could answer in this thread or DM me. i didn't make a survey because i sure as hell wouldn't want to fill one out.
