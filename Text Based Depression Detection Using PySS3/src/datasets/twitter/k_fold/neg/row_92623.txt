by the time you read thisby the time you read this, i will have attempted for the third time this year, hopefully this one was successful. i hope that it makes me feel what i have always wanted to feel...nothing. i have not left my bed for days, i cant even get up to pee. i have no one here. my friends have all given up on me, though i will never give up on them. i just wanted someone to call, to tell me that they love me and that its gonna be okay, that they will be here. instead, i am cuddling with a shirt from a former love that i sprayed with a cologne he left behind praying he comes back. i have lost everything i have owned and loved in the past two years. i have nothing. i am a bother. i just wanted to make people happy. and by being sad, i have hurt everything around me. i truly cannot take this pain anymore. im sorry.
