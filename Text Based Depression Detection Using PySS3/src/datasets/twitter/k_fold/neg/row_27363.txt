Your whole life leads to death. Why prolong?I guess this is my cry for help...right? 
My situation is that Iâ€™m 40. My wife is leaving me. Sheâ€™s mostly without emotion. I donâ€™t know how else to say it. Itâ€™s how she deals. 
Iâ€™m unemployable and jobless. 
Iâ€™m massively obese. Truly beyond help. 
I hate myself. 
I have no way to provide for my daughter(9) 
Her step mother does that. I leech. 
I havenâ€™t got one friend to call. Not a single one, not in this state. California. Not mental state. 
Iâ€™ve written a letter to my child. I made it positive. As positive as I can. 
I have $10 in my bank account. 
I have a nice car with 1/8 of a gallon. 
I have my 9mm Springfield Xd-9. 
I have 10 mg of Xanax. 
I have three beers. 
Oh...Iâ€™m an alcoholic. 
 

So stop me I guess? Prolong my suffering? 
Tell me how being depressed and useless around my child is better for her? Tell me how itâ€™s better for her that Iâ€™m around? Tell me not to?
