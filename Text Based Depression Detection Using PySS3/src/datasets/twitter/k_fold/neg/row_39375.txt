Just another asshole who need help.I'm not in immediate danger of killing myself. But i still need help.

I have a great life, first off. No history of abuse or trauma (at least not anything worth talking about). A few months ago i drunkenly messed about with a girl and my girlfriend got upset and we broke up. We'd been miserable together for a while and it was inevitable but it still sucks. She now never hangs out or talks to me or acts like she cares. 

My "friends" don't give a shit because i never can get out of the house. They never call text or talk to me. Never ask me how I am. Never invite me anywhere. Never let me know if anything's going on. I could die and they wouldn't know. 

Ex had a party last night that I couldn't attend. Ignored me as usual for most of the night. I guess she was having a lot of fun being drunk with our friends. This morning she tells me she got caught by her mom passed out on a bed between two of my friends ( they didn't do anything but idk why she wouldtell me this). I freak out and tell her that Ican't deal with her and she makes me wantto commit suicide when she tells me stuff like that but "we're not together so what does it matter if i sleep with our friends". I wish i was dead. I have a lot going for me but mo friends and no life. I don't write anymore i just listen to depressing music and wait for death. What do I do.
