Pandemic triggering old trauma responses + I can barely functionI'm nearly a decade sober, but the past 3-4 years have been trauma after trauma. Emotional abuse, multiple job losses, incorrect mental health diagnosis &amp; medication (which I haven't been on for 8 months now), multiple failed relationships, etc. I understand this is life, and I've had a mental/emotional/spiritual practice for many years to get me through these things, as well as friends inside and outside the substance abuse recovery world. But the pandemic is triggering otherwise dormant trauma responses and memories, and my body is reacting accordingly. I don't want to eat, work, or respond to anyone. I don't care what happens to me,  except when I really do care and I have a panic attack that feels like I'm suffocating. I feel completely alone despite constantly being pestered to talk with my roommate or friends on the phone or on Zoom. I feel more trapped then I ever did when I chose to be home on my own. I don't know what to do without feeling guilt for not doing it "right" since I technically DO know what I need to do. It feels impossible to fix this right now, and I feel guilty for feeling this way when so many people are fighting for their lives or the lives of others. I'm sorry. Thank you for reading.
