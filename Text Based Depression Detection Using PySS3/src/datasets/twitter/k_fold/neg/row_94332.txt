Still in SchoolBeen in a pretty bad place the past few years. College has been pretty shitty; I've almost failed out, taken a semester off, depression, etc. Not just academic problems, general life shit. Seriously suicidal at least twice. You get it. Well this semester I was on a 2.5 gpa probation, and after finals I honestly thought I was done. Had I gotten dropped I would have done it. But I didn't, I swung a 3.0 and am primed to finish my last year. I should have had more faith in myself and the work I put in.


I'm not sure what really else I have to share. Even when everything else is really, really fucking shitty, if there's there's some sort of light still at the end of your tunnel it's worth putting in the hours to get there
