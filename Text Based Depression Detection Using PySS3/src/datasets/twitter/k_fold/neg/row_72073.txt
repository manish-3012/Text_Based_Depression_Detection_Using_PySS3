Wishing I was someone elseI don't know how to break this cycle. I'm desperate for someone to tell me that I'm not an awful person but I can't tell anyone because that's exactly what they would think of me. So then why am I even bothering to write here? Utter desperation, I feel alone in this to my very core and I will to the day I die. The thought of that is just, well I can't put it into words.

I'm sorry, I'll stop posting now.
