All signs point to me killing myselfI was willing to try but fuck it. I want my life to get better, I really do, but it just seems like everything is going against me and everyday is becoming more unbearable and pointless.

Every solution is met by a road block and I'm running out of ideas. 

It was my own stupidity that got me here in the first place. So many opportunities that I wasted and now I'm fucked. 

No social life. At all. Only have 4 friends who I can't even bear to talk to because of my situation. 20 years old never been to a party, out past 1:00, drunk, nothing. I've done fuck all. 

No self esteem due to years of bullying on and off, leading to me thinking I'm a disgusting ugly piece of shit which causes a plethora of issues. 

No money. 

No job. 

Fail most job interviews that I do manage to get because of my depression and social anxiety. And whenever I do by some miracle manage to get into employment my depression/anxiety fucks it up and I end up on the brink of being fired or I leave due to the stress. 

Failing education because I'm so depressed with my shit empty life that I can't think straight. 

Family think I'm a scrounging, lazy burden. 

So fuck it. What am I staying here for?
