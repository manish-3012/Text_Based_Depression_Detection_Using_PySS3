Am I as bad as I think?So...I accidentally broke up with my GF and she hates me now and won't take me back which is fair.

I broke up because she didn't text for a day and my sick twisted brain thought she hates me and I need to break up before I get hurt.

Joke's on me I'm the hurt one now. I bet she's too but I'm crying every day and tried to end it all at least five times now.

I thought I still have a chance of getting her back but she hates me a lot now. (can I get her back somehow?).

The thing is I've driven my other two relationships into depression as well without me wanting to.

How can I stop that?
