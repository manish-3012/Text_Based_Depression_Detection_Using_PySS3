I feel almost nothing but pain everyday. The only reason Iâ€™m alive is empty hope.Iâ€™ve always read and seen people who went through sometime similar and they make it out in the end. Even though I utterly hate myself and everything I stand for I canâ€™t help but want to try to stick it out because a small part of me is hoping itâ€™ll get better. But itâ€™s been 10 years and itâ€™s only gotten worse.

Iâ€™m perpetually terrified to wake up and confront my family and colleagues and always feel unwelcome and hated even with my friends. I canâ€™t feel happiness and drown my emotions in video games and sleeping. The only moments I feel content and not wanting to off myself are when Iâ€™m with my best friend. Although she makes me feel like me and we get along so well and are practically the same person, I canâ€™t help but feel like Iâ€™m just a bother to her and sheâ€™s just faking it all to make me happy, even though she noticed I was becoming more distant and assured me she likes to be around me. It still wonâ€™t go away. 

Itâ€™s the same deal with everybody else. Iâ€™m at a point where I feel completely alone and I have no option. Iâ€™m a failure to everybody. Although I try many new things, I canâ€™t seem to develop a talent in any one of them. I find it impossible to believe that people would want me around. Iâ€™m thought about suicide for about a year now and have written a note and planned it out as well. But Iâ€™m at a loss here. I want to be happy and I want to live MY life I want to be ME I donâ€™t want to be anybody else but I just canâ€™t do this. 

But thatâ€™s my rant. I just had the spill it out somewhere since I have nobody to talk to about it. Thank you reader.
