My friend with anorexiaHi,

So I have a friend that's lesbian and really dislikes her self because of this. That's why she got anorexia because she only can control eating. I am depressed my self and we've talked a lot about her problems and mine problems like the will to die (don't worry about me though I have a psychologist). I've told her to promise not to hunger her self. And she replied with that she forbids me to kill my self. Idk how to help her, I am not saying things like "go eat something" because I understand her she just has a different method of hurting her self. And every time I want to help her she resists. So how can I help her I don't want her to die and I also have heard about how they cure people like her. I don't want all this happen to her. Please help I am really worrying about her and everything is so hard. Because I am trying to save someone while planning suicides and cutting myself. Fml

Edit: idk if psycholgist is a good word maybe therapist fits beter idk what the difference is.
