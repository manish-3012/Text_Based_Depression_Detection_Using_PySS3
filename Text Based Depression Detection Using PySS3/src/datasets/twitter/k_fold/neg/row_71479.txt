I want to die in my sleep.Some nights I go to sleep hoping I won't wake up. It would be so much easier. No wife or family to scar with a suicide. Easy for me too. Tonight is one of those nights. I don't think I would ever kill myself, but I would gladly accept a quick and painless death in my sleep. I face a big challenge tomorrow and I just don't want to be here anymore. I had the most stressful year of my life, and things were just settling down. Now we have something major wrong with our house, I'm sure of it. A contractor will confirm it in morning. Is it just a material object? Yes. But it's the last straw. I can't handle any more financial problems. I'm tired of problems. Tired of struggling with mental health issues. I have a wife and dog who loves me. I have a wider family who love me too. We both have jobs. No corona. But my life has been really fucked up by addiction and it seems like problems other people can deal with push me to the edge so easily. This is one more thing that will weigh us down financially for years. I hate being alive more and more. It just feels...pointless. I've a lot to live for if I view it as a third party. As plain old me, I just want out in a way that doesn't devastate beyond a normal death. Thanks for reading.
