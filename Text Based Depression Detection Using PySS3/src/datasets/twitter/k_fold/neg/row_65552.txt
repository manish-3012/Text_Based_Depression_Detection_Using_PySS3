it will all be okayI am being institutionalised in a few hours, I am currently meant to be under strict supervision but I'll be fine. I avoided a 1013 which I am proud of. Everyone is calm. I am residing. Soon everything will be okay but I don't know how or which form it will be as. Hopefully I can say goodbye again without my life ending; but that won't change the fact that I am ready and still wanting to die. Thank you for listening, I truly appreciate it all. Goodbye.
