These are my last daysToday is my eviction day. Iâ€™ve spent my whole life suffering and trying all I can to keep my head above water and not kill myself. I grew up suicidal, Iâ€™m barely entering my 20s now and Iâ€™m worse than Iâ€™ve ever been. But this is it. I know that acetaminophen overdose is one of the most painful ways to go, so thatâ€™s the way I chose. Iâ€™m here, most of my belongings packed in bags and boxes. Everyone thinks Iâ€™m moving out, but Iâ€™m just taking it all up to the garbage. Iâ€™ll be dead in a few days. Every few minutes I consider calling 911, calling an ambulance to take me to the ER. But Iâ€™ll be homeless by tomorrow anyway, and all it will cause me is embarrassment. A small part of me wishes that someone would notice and report me, call an ambulance for me, force me to stay alive. But no one in my life comes close to caring that much. I have nothing left to hold on to. This is it. I think these are my last days.
