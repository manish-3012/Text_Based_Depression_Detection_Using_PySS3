I hate myself so much...I hate myself everyday. Iâ€˜m really the biggest piece of shit on this earth, no doubt about it. I really donâ€˜t know why I continue living. I have no aims in life, there is really nothing I look forward to anymore. Honestly the only thing that prevents me from doing it is that Iâ€˜m way too scared. Iâ€˜m such a failure and I wouldnâ€˜t be a loss to society and anyone else.
