I now have a method.I'm not going to name or discuss what it is because although I have no reason to live, most of you reading this do.  I've decided to take my exit Christmas Day because that will ruin the most lives.  It makes me sad though because I would love to just finish things today.  I have now written out my will and last testament, I am calling family and friends and clearing up "unfinished business" with them.  Not one suspects.

In fact, forget Christmas.  I figure Monday.
