The Stigma of Suicidal IdeationI go down the posts, and I see people who think like me. People who may understand how I feel.

But I still have repressed these thoughts and urges so much, because I feel like nobody wants to deal with that part of me, that even as I see all these people who would probably understand: I'm terrified to actually post.

It's like outing myself as not the person I portray myself to be to most people. It's putting forth evidence that I am vulnerable, and people can come down on me for it, and make me push it down even further.

I already posted once, and I near hyperventilated as I actually had to hit the 'post' button. 

But I'm making myself do this. I can't run from how I think or feel anymore. It's been a part of me for so long, pushed down by a world that would rather pretend it didn't exist. I want to have a place with people who understand whilst not making me feel bad about thoughts and feelings I can't control. 

I'm glad this sub exists. I can see it has provided a little support to people like me.
