I felt like I still had something stable and someone who would be there for me. Now I feel like there's nothing. I can't eat or get out of bed. I know this sounds stupid and over dramatic, I've been through break-ups before. I just feels like there's no one who loves me or even likes me. i tried so hard to keep this going because he was so important to me, I kind of threw everything in there I had, put in so much effort. He said he couldn't be with someone who didn't want him taking drugs, I didn't know it was coming, he said he hadn't realised until that day . I'm alone, physically and mentally and so scared. There's literally no one in my life I can feel like I can talk to about this. I just want to die everything hurts so much, I don't know how I can trust anyone. I feel like im an awful person
