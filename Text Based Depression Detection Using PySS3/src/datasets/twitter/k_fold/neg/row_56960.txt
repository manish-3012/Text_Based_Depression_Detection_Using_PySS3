Im a failure in all aspectsI feel like i was born just to fail and be miserable.
My mother is abusive. I was the peacemaker in my stupid dysfunctional family. I am always in corner silent trying not to exist. I am a failure socially i don't know how to talk to people. I isolate a lot. My life is all about fear. On top of that i stopped being religious and i have to keep in the closet about it because if my parents knew it won't be nice for anyone. 
I wish i could die. I want to kill myself but i can't do it. Why am i even here.
