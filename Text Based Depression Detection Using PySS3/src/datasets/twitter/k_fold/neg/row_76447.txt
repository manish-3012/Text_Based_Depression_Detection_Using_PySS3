I am so weak...I want to die.


But I love my boyfriend dearly...

... and unfortunately he loves me as well...



How on earth could I find the power to make him hate me... To make my memory misserable so my death won't touch him?

... anyway I do it, I'll hurt him... If I end it before breaking his heart he will grieve... If I end it after I break his heart... Well he will be in pain as well... 

But maybe my death will make him feel avenged... But at the same time the damage would be already done... 


I'm too weak to hurt him in any way.... 


....and I'm too weak to cut him off

Why am I so weak...?
