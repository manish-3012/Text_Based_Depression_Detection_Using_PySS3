A Sudden Downhill SpiralI donâ€™t know what good this will do, but I have nobody but the abyss of the internet at this point. I have no support system or friends now. My best friend and I got into a fight over the weekend, and Iâ€™ve been slowly spiraling towards the desperation of suicide since. Thinking of the fight, the things that were said, how things were handled make me utterly nauseous. 

I wanted so badly for my life to be different, to make and keep just one friend who I felt was valuable and worthwhile. I canâ€™t connect with people no matter how hard I try, so when I met my best friend I thought this was mu chance to be a normal functioning human being. We connected so immaculately. And then I went and fucked it all to high hell. I walked away that night just on a whim, but it blew out of proportion. He screamed such nasty things at me, I screamed back things just as nasty. Even though they eat me alive, I could forgive the words eventually, Iâ€™m sure I could, but now we donâ€™t talk at all.

He said everything was going to be fine after we both cooled down but itâ€™s not. It positively nauseates me that he called her to help him out of his situation while I was standing right there offering to help. Of all people, it had to be her. Itâ€™s pathetic, but this is what I canâ€™t get passed. That and the complete 180 in communication now. We used to text all throughout the day, and now itâ€™s nothing but radio silence. Iâ€™m spiraling down into this insanity where the only way out is to walk out into the woods and blow a hole through my head to get rid of this torrent of chaos in my skull. 

I fucked up, and Iâ€™ll always keep fucking up. I canâ€™t even maintain one single friendship that meant the world to me. I donâ€™t have it in me to start over again, and thereâ€™s nothing more worthwhile to keep me around. Iâ€™m not lonely or anything, but Iâ€™ve always felt so dead inside. He made me feel like there was some point to all this, this great human interconnection that so many people seemed so lucky to enjoy. I donâ€™t want to go back to just feeling dead. The outside might as well finally match the inside.
