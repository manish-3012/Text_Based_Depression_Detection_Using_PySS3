Is this the place to vent? Because I need to ventA family member of mine committed suicide 5 years ago. He was an active member of a suicide prevention charity locally. So naturally people were shocked. I was 15 when that happened (I've been suicidal since I was 13) and it really got me thinking

Theres really 3 types of people -

 the self aware mentally ill

The non self aware mentally ill

The non mentally ill

Self aware people know they're ill, and know life isn't getting better - the vices they use to escape like drugs and alcohol are just small versions of the true escape. They know what they have to do to be free of the pain

The non self aware might know their ill, but refuse to accept reality. They use non destructive means to escape (functional alcoholism, movies, weed, video games) to escape. They lie to themselves and others about getting better and use distractions to escape. Some of them get so wrapped up in their fear of true escape that they become suicide prevention advocates, because they can't face reality

The non mentally ill are self explanatory. They aren't ill, they can't understand those who are, no matter how they try. They're a rare breed
