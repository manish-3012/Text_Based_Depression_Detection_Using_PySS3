Nothing really mattersWhatever you do, nothing really changes. Nothing will make your loved ones come back to you, nor will it make you feel better about yourself. You will hate yourself till your last day, you will suffer till the last day, so why can't you make this day your last? There's nothing to wait for. There was a hope maybe 2 years ago, but now it's gone. You just continue nonsense existence, day by day. It's time to break the circle, or wait for the day when things will become worse.
