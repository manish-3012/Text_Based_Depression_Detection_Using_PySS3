Everything seems hopeless and all I do is hurt peopleI feel like all I ever do is hurt people I care about. Iâ€™ll say things and they always seem to come out wrong. Like I was talking with my roommate and suitemates earlier and I said something about how One of them was the other suite mate who got overshadowed by their roommate and I just meant it like there personality was just harder to explain but thatâ€™s not what came out and thereâ€™s so many times this happens and I feel terrible about it. I donâ€™t want to hurt the people I care about because they mean a lot to me and I hate seeing them hurting I just want to help them and be there for them but I always just end up hurting people anytime I say or do anything. Itâ€™s like o just canâ€™t get it right. I feel like I would do less harm if I just died. I donâ€™t want to die and I donâ€™t have the guts to kill myself but I wish I did.  I want to cut so badly right now or snap myself with a rubberband. Iâ€™ve talked to my school counselor some about other stuff and I want to get ask him to help me with this but I donâ€™t want him to judge me or think of me as a terrible person. I also know though that he canâ€™t help me with the other stuff when Iâ€™m lying to shield the truth of just how bad Iâ€™ve gotten. But I canâ€™t risk him having to tell my parents of me getting kicked out because of this. Everything just feels so hopeless and Iâ€™m lost and am ready to just be done I guess. I just donâ€™t wanna hurt myself or anyone else anymore. I wanna do stuff right. I hate the person I am.
