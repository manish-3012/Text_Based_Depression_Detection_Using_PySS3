Summertime SuicideI want to end my life before this summer ends, or at the absolute latest before next summer because that would give me more time to sort everything out. 
A lot has happened to drive me to this point, but I think the final nail in the coffin is losing my last true friend last night. Heâ€™d been distant and avoiding me for a while, but now that I know he hates me, I donâ€™t see the point in living anymore. My partner broke up with me last year too, and our anniversary is next month, so I know for a fact Iâ€™m gonna be a wreck next month. But I think the big reason why it matters that I lost them is bc I canâ€™t make friends. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, but I canâ€™t make friends. I want to, and I try so hard. Am I not trying hard enough? If I were normal I wouldnâ€™t have this problem, but honestly whatever. I think I might stop trying, because I donâ€™t want to leave too many people behind when I die. Iâ€™m just a waste of everyoneâ€™s time, including my own. I hope Iâ€™ll be a better person in my next life if I manage to end my current one.
