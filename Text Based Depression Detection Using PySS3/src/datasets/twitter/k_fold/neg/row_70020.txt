If love was real, then I wouldn't be alone right now.It is really difficult to escape love.

I watched a stream of the Ravens-Patriots game a couple of weeks ago, and there was a literal marriage proposal in the chat. The day after that, I found out that my crush was engaged. Not just taken, engaged.

Congratulations, I can't even imagine the feeling.

It really hurts seeing people talk about how sweet and kind their partners are. 

I would like to think I am a good person, but the best I can do is convince myself that I'll never, ever need anyone. With the greatest of respect, FUCK THAT. 

I am alone, because I am ugly, and hurt. 

So don't tell me you love his personality. If he wasn't attractive, you wouldn't give him a second of the day.

It's great to know everyone around me is fucking each other's personalities and I should maybe join a dating site or something.

I could "improve myself" and look like a fucking Instagram model, so someone can fall in love with my personality, or wait sixty years.

I'd rather die now.
