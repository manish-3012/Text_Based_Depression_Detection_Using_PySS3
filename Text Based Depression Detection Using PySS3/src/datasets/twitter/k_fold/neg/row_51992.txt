Â¿Why am I here?01FEB17

To begin, I do not understand why I was born. My anxiety and depression prevent me from doing what I really want, and at this point, I have given up. I am never good enough. My personality is not wanted in this world. I can not change who I am, so it is better that I take my own life and stop my pain and not go through the pain of the future. 

Additionally, I have three different ways of killing myself, and I plan to go through all of them until I am at peace. 

Moreover, the reason for wanting out of this world is because it is not for me. I have tried and quit a couple of jobs, and in the end, they are not fulfilling what I want. I have changed majors for the not knowing what I want and because of the fear of making a speech and if I will fail. I have never been in a relationship or have friends because of the anxiety I get from people. I have tried to get a better job, but I am never good enough; I can't even get a minimum wage job now. 

Finally, I see myself being a failure and homeless in the future, and I cannot live through that; therefore, it is better I leave this world now, so I can get it over with. I still have to plan everything, so I am still giving life a chance, but sooner or later, I have to go.  

I will update as I go through this.
