I'm tired of trying.I can't make friends for the life of me. I've got buddies I hang around with at uni and thats it. I guess my dumb trigger today was those buddies talking about how they went to a hip hip party the other night with buddy A's friends. Buddy B doesn't even like hip hop, I do and live 10 minutes away from buddy A but they like each other. I don't have that with anyone.

"Get hobbies" I have multiple social and socialish hobbies

"volunteer" I have done in the past but with my hobbies, university and work I don't have time at the moment

It doesn't make a difference because I'm still the same boring old me no matter where I go.

I've been to social skills classes, I've tried to invite people out only to receive silence or rejection. I've read book after book and watched Ted talk after Ted talk. I suck at conversations, thinking of things to say. I'm probably an energy drain without realising it. I don't want to wait for "ThE OnE" in a romantic sense. I'm lonely and don't want to live like this anymore. What's the point of working hard for money and then Is suicide only a depression thing? Why can't it be a logical choice?

Maybe I'm a damn alien I can't connect with people. Even when I think I've clicked with a person it means nothing to them.

Maybe people can smell desperation but i don't know what else to do. I'm normally one to try to fix an issue instead of complain but I'm done.  I want to spend time with people. I'll probably end it after university so I wouldn't have failed college twice. I want to at least get a 1st/A, go out on a high.
