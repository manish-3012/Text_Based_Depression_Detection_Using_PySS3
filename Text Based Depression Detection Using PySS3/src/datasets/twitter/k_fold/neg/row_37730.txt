I have just been beratedMy academic adviser said that my presentation is a complete waste or something like that. And that he refuses to talk about it until I make it in accordance with his plan. But I already did that! I FUCKING DID THAT! I just don't know what else he wants me to do. 

My final thesis is in 4 days or so (on 30th). I'm fucked up both emotionally and physically. I'm absolutely empty from inside and want to cry so much. I'm sick of people who are around me. Sick of all the things I do. 

My mother just arrived. I heard her saying that I'm dumb and amorphous and cannot concentrate on anything. Nothing special, huh. She often tells me these things when I'm failing something. 

I want to cry but I cant. I just want to be dead. To forget everything that was happening for last 4 years. 

Take my life and give it to somebody who really needs it.
