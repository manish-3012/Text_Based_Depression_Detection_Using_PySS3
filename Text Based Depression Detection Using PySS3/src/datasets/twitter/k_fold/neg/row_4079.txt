My Father Killed Himself Last Week And Something Tells Me I Won't Be Far Behind HimI don't really know what to say here. My soul is aching in ways I have never felt. It pains me to know i allowed a dark period in my life to cloud my vision and keep me from being there for someone I love that was clearly experiencing the same things. It pains me to think about the way he must've felt leading up to it. The anger, the sadness, the misery, all compounded over years. I honestly see no point in really being here anymore. I have tons of people that love me and care for me, but I just don't wanna be here anymore. They are the only thing keeping me here. If I didn't know it would crush so many people, I would've killed myself a long time ago. Part of me hopes one of them reads this and helps me. I don't know what to do. I am scared.
