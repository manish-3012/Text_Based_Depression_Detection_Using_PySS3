No one outside of my family would care if I killed myself.I thought at least one person would maybe care a little but the one person who I thought would would wonâ€™t even respond to my text when I ask her how she is. I frankly shouldnâ€™t expect her to care. She has never contacted me first in years. Itâ€™s always me asking her how she is. She knows Iâ€™m suicidal too. Yeah she doesnâ€™t care. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m surprised by it. 

No one else would either. That or they would be over in a day to several days.
