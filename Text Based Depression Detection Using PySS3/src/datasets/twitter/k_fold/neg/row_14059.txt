Knocked a girl up and feel like killing myselfI got a girl pregnant and for her an abortion is out of the question. We were dating for around 6 months and broke up just before Thanksgiving. Once I found out about the kid I tried to push for an abortion. Neither of us are ready for a child and I feel like my future has been snuffed out. Ive been thinking about killing myself nonstop since I found out and it's the only thing that's helped my calm down even remotely. I already feel pent up resentment and I know how fucked up it all is but it's how I feel. 

I had a whole future planned that strongly and specifically didn't involve kids for a long time but now I'm going to have one before my 25th birthday. I hate every waking minute of my life and feel like it's a hopeless situation. I don't want this and I don't think I ever will. I've never felt this way before and suicide is something I've never remotely considered but now it consumes my thoughts. We're both poor, straddled with debt and I don't love her and I don't want a child but now my life has been determined for me. I've always hated children and I'm not a very emotionally capable person and I'm so fucking sad and scared that I just want to end my life for the first time ever.
