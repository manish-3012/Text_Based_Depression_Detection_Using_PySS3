I feel like I should push away everyone so I can kill myselfI have an amazing boyfriend who I've been with for a year and a half. He is the most gentle and caring guys I have ever met, but I don't deserve him. He doesn't deserve a cheating and crazy person like me... I always depress him and I refuse to get mental help. I just relapsed and cut myself after a year of not cutting. I feel like if I killed myself now, then I would break his heart and he'll kill himself too. I don't want this. I want to make him hate me so bad that he would be the one to pull the trigger himself. I want my friends to feel that way too. The friends that I have left I mean.... I don't have many people to remember me already. I might just do it now without going through all that work and make people hate me...... My boyfriend will find a better girl, I hate that he already proposed to me and wants to spend the rest of his life with an ugly whore... At least I'll be engaged when I kill myself, that'll be an accomplishment.. I don't know how I'm going to do it though, I just want to go silently. I don't want any screams or to be saved, actually, I could be okay with being saved by someone, it would show they actually care. But that won't happen, no one cares about me but my boyfriend and he doesn't care that much either. I want it to be quiet but long, for I don't deserve a short and quick death. I want it to be long enough to write 2 suicide notes..... Anyone know of a long and painful death that you'll be able to write before writhing in pain and finally dying? I want to go that way.
