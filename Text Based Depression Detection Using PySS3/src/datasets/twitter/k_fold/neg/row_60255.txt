When my parents pass, im ending it all...So ive had girlfriends, have a loving family, im mentally stable, have a job, provide for myself, but coonstantly want to end my life i hate being alive and i dont get why at all....ive been to therapy a lot about the subject and nothing has worked..i dont get why i want to kill myself but i dont do it because of my parents they wouldnt be able to take it.. so basically when they pass on their own, im going to do a lot of heroin and slip away i dont do drugs but i already have it my ex roomate sold it and i have enough to end it im sure...i think about it daily, i cry myself asleep everynight because i want to die but i cant because my parents couldnt handle it ive even talked to them about it and im fine around them and family but when i get into bed at night i want to die my girlfriends have even caught me crying about it it has always been an issue...only reason i havent done it is because of my parents it unrelently torture that terrizes me on a daily basis, to the point where i (not to sound like a peace of shit) cant wait to they pass...even though i love them beyond understanding!!! Please help!!!
