Cut off circulationSo I cut off my circulation for 3 hours last night and a half a hour today and now my hand is screwed up.It feels kind of cold and is sensitive when I touch it. Plus there is restricted motion. I cut it off as a suicide attempt. my best friend says it could be because I have nerve damage. I hope not. I'm trying to figure out how to get it so its okay again
