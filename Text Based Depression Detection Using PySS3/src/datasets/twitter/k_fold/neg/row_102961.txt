notes for myself mainly read if you want lulnot really a cry out for help more or less for myself but damn im really thinking of a good way to just slip out of life and pass i feel like a few games have kept me here same with some people but i dont feel great i feel like i should stay here long enough so they dont judge me i want everyone and everything to forget about me but i feel like i got to close to some people i dont know i just want to leave and dont want to bring it up to anyone i like being anonymous easier that way because being found out is shit dunno i just dont like myself or life and being myself to someone else and them talking about themselfs just kills me everytime just felt not accepted and i want to leave and pass but i have a friend that somewhat likes me around and i think its the only reason im here but i want to find a way out soon because i dont want to hurt him hard to explain i just would never tell him or want him to find out about this dark side because it would hurt him and i dont want anyone to miss because im just such a loser that doesnt deserve anything in life the way i think and look i just need to be killed
