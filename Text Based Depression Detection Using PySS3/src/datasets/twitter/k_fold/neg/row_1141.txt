Lost for how to continueToday was the last day of my current job. Itâ€™s upset me more than I thought. My new job starts in a week but Iâ€™ve got lots of hoops to jump through for it and not fully confident Iâ€™ll be able to cope. 

Itâ€™s at a point I have to hide my feelings from my boyfriend. I used to be able to tell him when I felt like this but Iâ€™m an emotional burden on him. I cut myself off from a lot of people for him and itâ€™s my fault I donâ€™t have anybody to turn to now. Iâ€™ve got no family here or friends. We live together and I have to hide how I feel or itâ€™s all anger and not perfect and â€œyouâ€™re not who you were six months ago.â€ 

I felt like Iâ€™ve come so far though, I had such a bad self harming problem among other things and Iâ€™ve not gone back there, mostly due to the guilt he will give me but surely thatâ€™s still good 

I compare myself to people my age who have went to uni and are succeeding and I have nothing.

Iâ€™m genuinely considering ending it. I just want to talk. Iâ€™ve tried all the helplines , anybody I can think of really. I live right by the subway and think about it all the time. I know itâ€™s selfish to do it that way but I canâ€™t help it 

The only thing keeping me here are our cats as pathetic as that is

I donâ€™t know. Everyone at my work was so supportive of me leaving and I miss them and I know Iâ€™m not important to them I just want it over
