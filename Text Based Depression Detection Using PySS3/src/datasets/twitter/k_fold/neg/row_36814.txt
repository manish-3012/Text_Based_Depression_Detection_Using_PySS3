There is seriously no fucking point.I seriously see no point in going on. There is nothing exciting about life. I don't have many friends, and the few I do have I don't want to talk to or be around. The only person I want any contact with is out of my fucking life. I'm fucking sitting here crying my ass off about him and I know he's at home getting off to it. It's what he fucking does. He gets people to love him with no intent of returning the feelings. I fucking hate this. I'm NEVER like this. I get over guys like nobody's business. But not this one. I just *had* to fucking fall in love with this asshole. Lucky me. I've tried moving on. I can't. Everyone and everything bores the shit out of me. I'm terrified that I won't find a job for the summer. Then I will be in deep shit. I hate where I'm living. It's not home and I don't feel welcome. I hate this town. I hate our society. I hate being a girl. I hate having to bleed every month when I don't even want fucking kids. It's all fucking pointless. And what would it matter if I left? I'm not important to anyone so it wouldn't be a big loss. I've already lost the only two people I care about. One of them to death. I might as well join her. It would be easy. And I would be put out of this god awful misery.
