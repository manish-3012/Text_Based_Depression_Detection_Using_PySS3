Will I reach my end, or will I reach my happiness?The beginning of the day was very beautiful but now I write this and I am afraid, very afraid, sad and tired, I do not think that anyone can help me, but I believe in a small percentage that I can help myself, the mistakes of the past chasing me and my fear of the future is killing me, and today .. Now I decided that I will not Ignore all of this and I will not give up, either to reach my end or to reach my happiness and My success, there is no other solution, 3 years of waiting and now  I'm tired of talking, it is time for action (Every day I will write what happens to me and what I have reached .. to see what I can do)
