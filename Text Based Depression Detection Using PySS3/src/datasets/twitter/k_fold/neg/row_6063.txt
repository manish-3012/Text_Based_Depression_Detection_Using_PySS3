My life sucks and I know it won't get any better as I get olderI'm socially awkward, dyslexic and my parents don't care about me. I've told them multiple times that I want to die / stop existing. Dad just said to do it and mum laughed at me together with my brother. I have no energy to study or do anything and everyone just says I'm lazy. I have no goal in life other than wanting to not exist, stop thinking and not feel this way anymore.
