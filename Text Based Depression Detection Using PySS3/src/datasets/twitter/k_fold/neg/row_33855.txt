Barely hanging onThis year has been incredibly tough for me. I'm a freshman in college who has no fucking clue who he is. I'm pretty sure I have some sort of depersonalization disorder going on. There's been so much bullshit going on lately and I can't take anymore. I've been suicidal for a few years but it's never been this unbearable. Yesterday I think I killed my relationship with an amazing girl. I hate it and thinking about it kills me. I didn't sleep last night and I haven't eaten anything since breakfast yesterday. I'm so worried for her as well :( I have no one to talk to besides her
