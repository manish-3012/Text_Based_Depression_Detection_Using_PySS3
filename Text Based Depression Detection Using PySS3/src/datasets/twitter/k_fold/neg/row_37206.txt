What do dead people do?I hate my life and wish I was dead. Any time I try telling anyone that I'm in pain, they tell me its my own fault. It pisses me off to the point that I want revenge. I've been called a manipulative liar, and according to people I've talked to, my symptoms add up to straight up psychosis. I'm losing my job and everything is just gone, fucking gone, I have a terrible drug problem, I don't know if when you die, its like it was before you were born, but I don't really care. We're all just decaying organic matter. I'm such a damn piece of shit I deserve to die. I'm a okay girl, smart, but I'm never going to find happiness. I have multiple personalities. Everyone who knows me hates me. I am nothing. I don't belong here and I'm on the low end of autism spectrum. I'm afraid if I stay too long I'll end up hurting people who don't deserve it. My love affair with drugs is out of hand. If I'm sober, mentally, the pain just fucking leaves me unable to walk. There isn't a point to this anymore. The world is for the rest of you.
Thanks for reading this, if anyone does. I'd like for someone, anyone, to remember me. I can't help myself and no one else can help me either. I just don't have the strength anymore.
