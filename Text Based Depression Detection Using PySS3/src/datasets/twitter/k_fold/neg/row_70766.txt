I feel better knowing I may be the only mind in the universeI feel this way because if I am the only actual mind in this universe and everything is an illusion of my mind, none of the shit that media bashes me about is true, none of the hate I get on my feed is true, nothing that is in the popular part of Reddit talking shit about people like me is real, none of the bullying I got was real, none of the parental abuse I got was real, none of the fucking loniliness and isolation I feel everyday is real, being told to â€œman upâ€ isnâ€™t real, and worrying about stupid fucking school is real.
