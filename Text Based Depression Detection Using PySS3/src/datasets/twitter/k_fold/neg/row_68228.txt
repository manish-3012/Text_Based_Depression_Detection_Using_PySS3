dont know what else to dobank account is overdrawn. havent eaten in 4 days. not paid again for 2 weeks.  no friends to turn to. family doesnt give a shit (why help your son when you can buy a second 40k car).  

i mean no friends at all. ive never had friends.  i did for a while in high school but quickly realized i was forcing my way in and none of them really wanted me there.  10 years later i havent left the house for anything other than work. made no friends. coworkers hate me. 

i hate everything about myself and my life. i think im going to opt out tomorrow. im so tired of living like this.
