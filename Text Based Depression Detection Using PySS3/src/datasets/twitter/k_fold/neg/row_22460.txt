depression never goes awayI was 12 the first time i tried to kill myself and depression has never gone away, not even with therapy and i'm sick of it. People are always so quick to tell you it gets better - and it does - for a short while and then it comes back again and hits me hard, like it's just lurking in my mind all the time waiting for a trigger so it can come back full force. I'm sick of it.
