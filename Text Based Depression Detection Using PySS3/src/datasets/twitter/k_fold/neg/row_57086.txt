Why? (Small wall of text incoming)Why does society as a whole, seem so desperate to keep people who want to die alive? Sure, they are a potential worker in the future, but the economic strain would be larger due to keeping them alive during the time it takes for them to get treated, and in the end, there is no guarantee they will become better. Also, aren't pretty much everyone expendable when you look at the big picture? Wouldn't it be far better to just let those who want to die, die? I am aware that making assisted suicide legal, or something along those lines, would give criminals lots of new ways to get away with murder, so that is largely out of the question. However, I can't help but think, even though assisted suicide is illegal, why is keeping people alive and suffering so widely accepted? Helping people who want to die die is illegal, but torturing them by keeping them alive in their suffering is considered a good thing? Plus, they're also a drain on society in times like that. So, why?  

EDIT:  
In hindsight, I am unsure if this is the right subreddit...
