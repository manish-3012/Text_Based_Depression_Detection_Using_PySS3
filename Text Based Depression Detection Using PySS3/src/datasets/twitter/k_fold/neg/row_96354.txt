I wish that anybody could tell me for what purpose we are here.Why do we exist and live as a species?

Why do I exist and live as an individual human?

Nobody knows. Anyone who claims to know has no evidence to show for it. It is driving me mad, moreso than I am.

I often ask God, hoping that somewhere in or out of this huge universe there is a powerful, personal entity able and willing to throw me a bone. So far, no success.
