I feel completely numb.I'm not quite sure how to do one of these, but figured i have nothing else going on in my life (as usual) so might as well give it a shot.  I've been clinically depressed since my freshman year of high school.  I am now 24 still living with both of my alcoholic parents.  When I was 18 i was diagnosed with lymphoma, it got to the point that i couldn't even walk without excruciating pain.  Seeing as my parents are alcoholics they took this as a good excuse to hit the bottle even harder.  I felt that i had to be strong for my family so i completely took care of myself throughout chemo and radiation therapy.  Throughout this whole process which lasted 9 months i never had a single person to talk to.  I have never had a semi-meaningful relationship with anyone in my life.  There are a few people who i thought were friends, but at some point i realized the only "friends" i had were taking advantage of me for a place to stay, food, or a ride somewhere.  I've been through so much pain to hope that one day i could eventually feel a slight glimpse of happiness, but i've come to realize that in this giant shopping mall of a country, i can't even go into a store without feeling sick to my stomach.  I have nobody, the few material posessions that i do have, appear to me more shallow everyday.  I don't know what to do but I do know that life isn't for everybody.  Someone much wiser than i said, "life is like animal porn, it's just not for everybody" I don't know why im still typing as i realize i don't care if anyone takes the time to read this or not, i just need the pain to come to an end.

EDIT: Just wanted to add that i have become a hypochondriac, i don't know if this has anything to do with the cancer, or struggling through it alone but.  On top of everything else i constantly have to tell myself that i'm not dying or seriously ill anymore.
