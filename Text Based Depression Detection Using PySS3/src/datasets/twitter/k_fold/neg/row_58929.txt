Today was a rough dayI can't maintain relationships, I can't study, I can't do anything other than fuck up my life more. 

I daydream about what it would be like to jump off a skyscraper and just end 20 years of failure nearly daily. To end all of the pain and suffering, to finally be in peace. 

The only thing holding me back is my parents, since they've invested so much into me, and me killing myself would cement how much of a failure I actually am in their minds. Even that though, is waning, since I'm going to have to show them my grades eventually, and then they'll know how shitty I am regardless. 

Today was particularly bad for no reason. I spent most of my day in class, thinking about killing myself rather than the subject. I feel like any progress I make is for nothing since days like today just bring me back to square one. Even if I have a good day or week, whats the point if I'm just going to go back to feeling like this?
