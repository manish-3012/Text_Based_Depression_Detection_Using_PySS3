I'm a coward who has squandered my chancesI'm a coward. I've squandered the chances I've been given because I'm too fearful to put in the work and put myself out there. The position i'm in now is almost entirely my own fault. I should be so much further in my career and in my relationships than I am. I'm just so afraid of rejection and failure. Rejection bothers me much more than it does the average person. So i've lived my life as safely and with the least risk possible. And that  is how I ended up here.

Even after realizing that I shot myself in the foot, I'm still too scared to keep pushing on and put myself out there. This is what kills me. I've realized that i'm a coward, that I need to move forward, but i'm just so scared all the time that I can't bring myself to do anything. My cowardice bothers me to no end. I see opportunities everyday to improve my life. I see them and acknowledge that they're there, but then I let them slip by. I'm left feeling furious at myself and my cowardice.

I deserve what I've made my life into. I don't think i'll ever be brave enough to change. And every lost opportunity haunts me. I remember the times I was brave and wonderful things happened in my life, but I don't think I can ever get back to the person I was then. Each time I run away from opportunity, I feel like I lose a little bit of my soul. 

I feel condemned, by my own doing and weakness, to live the rest of my life out the way I have been doing for so long. Rather than suffer by my own devices, I am beginning to think that suicide is the better option. I've lived for years like this, suffering quietly but doing nothing about it. If I can't change how I live my life, I can at least choose to die and be free of all of this.
