I wish I could just stop breathingI don't think I can do it anymore. Everything's pointless, I dropped out of uni and I just see all my friends around me graduating and looking to the future. I'm stuck in a boring job on low pay &amp; I feel as though I'll just be stuck like that. I've messed up every good opportunity I've ever had. I'm so skint I can't afford to do anything- all my money goes on my car, rent, food and bills. I'm permanently in my overdraft. I just feel so lonely and cut off from everyone, but I don't even want to talk to my friends because my life is so shit it's almost embarrassing.
I can't even pretend to be happy so it's easier to not see anyone. I've been suicidal before and tried before but I think I've had enough now. 
I live with my boyfriend and he doesn't care about me anymore. He wants me to leave, to move back in with my parents but I know they don't really want me there and he doesn't want me here so nobody really wants me anywhere. I'm so sick of being sad and alone and bored and jealous of everyone around me.
I can't do it anymore. I just wish I could stop breathing.
