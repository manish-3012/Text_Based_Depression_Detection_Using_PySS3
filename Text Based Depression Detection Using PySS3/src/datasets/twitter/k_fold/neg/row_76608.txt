I'm a sociopath.... Shouldn't I kill myself before I continue to hurt other people... and destroy them...Let's just face the facts and admit one truth... Some people seriously do not deserve to be on this planet and should be killed off. People the likes of Hitler, for instance. We can admit that, right? Other people who are sociopaths/psychopaths, suffer from serious mental disorders that causes harm to others... The person behind 9/11.... Etc. Some people simply should be killed off.

If that's true, then shouldn't I be categorized as one of those people, and... Shouldn't I just kill myself to save others?

Sorry for the long wall of text but... I need to get something off my chest and... I just.. Idk... I just can't handle this anymore...... I'm going to start from recently and go back... And just... idk... At the end... if anybody actually reads this all the way... guess ... Idk... Shouldn't I just kill myself after everything I've done in my past? I know there's rules against being mean to people on here... But I need a person's honest opinion... Like legitimately if you feel like I'm a horrible person.. Tell me... So I know.. (People keep telling me I'm not that horrible... but I just feel so horrible....) I'm not even going to defend my actions.... Just list them.. Because honestly my actions are unforgiveable no matter what my excuse was....

Very recently.. I did something extremely badly.... And... Well... My grandma... had cancer... no longer does... extremely bad news...Uh... I still can't admit it to myself what happened... as far as I believe she's still in some hospital I refuse to visit because I just can't see her.... Yeah... Uh. Yeh. She's in a hopsital... Yeah... 

Anyways... Ever since then... my fiance and I drifted apart drastically... we talked every day... then we talked once a day... then once every other day... to like once a week... to like... weeks without talking... On top of that... she would throw a huge tamper tantrum whenever I talked to anybody at all... So past 2 and a half years I haven't had anybody to talk to. (except very recently I posted to /r4r a lot) I worked nonstop doing delivery services, picking up food, and delivering to customers only saying "enjoy" once they open the door. Extent of my human interaction... So... I mean logically I'm pretty messed up.. humans need human interaction... right? 

I begged my fiance to talk to me..... Begged her, yelled at her, demanded her attention... Not all at once... but it just kept getting worse with her ignoring me... so I became more and more demanding. 

It got so bad.... I... I... We spent 8 days without talking to each other... My grandma's funeral.... was coming up next week....... I... Needed her attention.... Badly.... She refused.... So I told her... I'd post her nudes online  if she continues treating me this way... continues ignoring me... Spent the 2 days threatening her... then finally posted the nudes online... I eventually deleted the nudes, and deleted everything but.... Still. She's a teacher and that could've lost her her job.  I told her "Just... say.. 'h...i... then press send....' and I won't post your nudes online..." and she couldn't even do that.... That was too much for her apparently... So I posted the nudes... And.... She went to the police with everything... wanted a restraining order against me just to stop me from posting nudes.... I honestly thought she didn't care for me anymore... I mean she couldn't even say hi to me... So... I did what I had in order to push her away... in order for us to break up... in order for me to have somebody be there for me when my grandma's... funeral.... date... is coming up... I desperately either needed us to break up so I can seek somebody else to be there (just platonic friendship... which I found)... or she needs to start being there for me... Which she couldn't even be there for me.... So... I had to break us up by posting.... Only way I could get her to hate me enough to break up with me.... Very manipulative, very sociopathic... wouldn't you say? I told somebody in jail this... and... They called me a sociopath. He was all like "Woooah woooah dude holy fuck remind me not to mess with you you fucking sociopath" I don't know if he was kidding but... I think he was serious about thinking I'm a sociopath... 

Well... now I'm facing extortion, revenge porn, and a lot of misdeameners and I think the DA is pressing charges. 

I know we both did not wanted it to go this far.... I know I didn't... All I wanted was her to just say hi to me...... Give me some human interaction.... I know if we talk... And talk it out... She can send a letter to the DA and have them drop the charges.... But.... With the restraining order in place... there's nothing I can do. So I'm fucked. 

So that happened... and now I feel extremely horrible because... I spent time in jail just thinking of the past and how it all came to be... her friend committed suicide around the time my grandma.... so we both have been grieving.... And... We just needed each other... I begged her to talk... She drifted away...

So now... Here's why I'm suicidal...I'm just gonna list things....

One... I was abused really badly... all the abuse you can imagine.. I'd probably suffered through it. or similar... 

Two... Abused people often become abusers....

Three.. I'm a pretty attractive guy - but I never got into a relationship because I feared becoming an abuser... I have to be ready for a relatioship before I even think about getting into one... otherwise I'd abuse them.... And hurt them... 

Four... I dated my first girlfriend... I thought I was ready for a relationship... been through counseling enough....Nope. She broke up because I"m abusive. Her words, not mine.

Five... Spent the next 5 years single because I wasn't going to abuse another person... Not going to risk it.... My fiance entered my life... My abuser's name was brought up... I was extremely pissed... my fiance hugged me and calmed me down... I thought I was ready for a relationship... If she could do that... then I'm ready. But I wasn't... I shouldn't rely on somebody else to calm me down... I need to calm myself down.

Six... I spent years in counseling... Years trying to get better.. Yet here I am 26 years old and still abusing the love of my life... I betrayed her in such a way... she's never going to recover from.... I hadn't realized how vulnerable she was... There's nothign I can do to become better.... I've tried for years... been in counseling since 7....And I'm still a piece of shit person....

seven...And all of this.... I don't... think... I care about how much I hurt her... Because of how much she hurt me... Abandoning me.. forcing me into solitude for years... Not hearing how desperately I needed her... I don't really care she's hurting... What I care about is... That I hurt her. I promised myself I would never abuse another person... and here I am abusing her... And... I hate myself for it.. It doesn't matter who the person is - I don't care they're getting hurt.... All I care about is that I'm the one doing the abuse... And I hate myself for turning into my step father... 

Eight... Doesn't that make me a sociopath? How I don't care she's hurt? She put herself into this situation... I begged her to just.. say.. hi.. to me... and I'll stop being so demanding... Just say hi.. How difficult is that.... Just talk to me... 

Nine... I have serious anger issues.... I suppose..... I posted nudes and betrayed her trust all because she wouldn't talk to me? For reals? 

Ten... I'm scared of what I can do when I'm angry... legitimately scared... I black out.. I don't remember a single thing when I'm pushed to my limit... And I do... things.. 

Eleven..I haven't gotten pushed to my limit for over 10 years... But I'm still scared of what I can do... Last time... I was a sophomore in high school.. and this senior football player threw a football at my face... and it hurt... just the way my step dad would slap my face... PTSD kicked in... rampage ensured... I got the ball and threw it at him as hard as i could aimed at his balls... I remember this.. wasn't pushed to my limit just yet... Then I ran off... went to fifth period... completely shaking the entire period... went to sixth period and the guy was there... he pushed me into a corner.. And I had no escape... No way out.. And he was pissing me off..So... I lost it... He pushed me to my limit.. I don't remember what happened. Next thing I knew.. I was hiding at the corner of the school crying so much... and my teacher found me... calmed me down... and brought me back. Next thing I know, I'm facing some serious charges which didn't stick. And they wanted to sue me.  Again, I don't care about the dude... all I care about is the fact that.. I lost control of my own anger and hurt another person... I don't care I hurt him, I care that I did something that was wrong...

Twelve... I used to play RuneScape... A lot.... 'twas addicted... my grandpa works on the computer... he lets me use his work computer to play... I usually get on 2-3 hours after school... And.. play as long as possible.... He's losing money...Anyways.. He wants me to go to bed at 11pm... I stay till 1am... Keep bitching at him.. He can't do anything.. Then he's had it and told me to go to bed.. I lost it... blacked out... And my own grandpa is laying on the stairs completely unconscious... his head is bleeding... I.... ... I ALMOST KILLED HIM!!! I COULD'VE KILLED HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Just for that alone I should be dead.... right? He fell down the stairs... could've been exxtremely bad... but luckily he didn't die...  ... And guess what.. I still don't care if he died... I cared that... I lost control of my anger... became just like my step dad.. and abused another person.... Such a sociopathic thought... right? 

Thirdteen... Uh.. Backtrack to last year... My grandma had cancer... she was in the hospitall on... on.. her.. on. her bed... uh.. bed bed.. And I never came by. I couldn't bear to see her in such a state..Ever since I foudn her she had cancer... I've been distancing myself from her... I didn't even attend the funeral... Why should I when I can work? I didn't care enough to go... I wanted to work... 

Fourteen.. My baby sister... I have two... one I'm attached to and would do anything to protect.. I saw her grow up... I was there... I love her. But I haven't been around... at all... for years... Because... Idk how to do family.. They never asked me over... So I never came over... I mean they'd ask my other sister over... So why couldn't they ask me too? Anyways.. my other baby sister.. who I'm not attached to almost died.... she was in the ER.. ICC.. everything and... I never came by. I wanted to work instead. I need money.... Deliveries don't pay that much... I'm barely surviving being homeless living in the van... So I have to work..  Same with my father.. he just came out of the ER a couple weeks ago.. and I haven't cared enough to visit... So.. I'm a sociopath right? 

Fifteen... Unless somebody benefits me.. Like gives me something.. Free rent... Or food... or money... Or if I expect something from them, then I'll talk to them... Otherwise I don't, even if they talk to me. That's super selfish, isn't it? My grandpa bought me a motorcycle... And I talked to him every day before I got it... Once I got it... I stopped talking to him. A lot has been going on recently so maybe that's why I haven't talked to him... but...  part of me thinks I stopped talking to him because I no longer expect him to give me anything... 

Sixteen... I went to jail.... I talked to my mom and dad for the first time in 2+ years... Because I needed them to bail me out or something... 

Seventeen.. Literally going through this right now... I finally got a job... a career... Three months working.. I no longer have to be homeless... I can finally get my life together... I can finally make something out of my life... And my grandpa had a stroke... He needs me to come up visit him and stay with him for a couple weeks... I simply don't want to. I want to stay here and show my worth to the company so they can keep me on for years to come... I love it here.. And I don't want to lose my job... lose my career... lose my life all to go support my grandpa... Like that's truly socipathic, isn't it...

Eighteen... I honestly feel the only way I haven't turned to killing people is because... I've never crossed any lines... My grandpa gave me a set moral compass once upon a time... And... I haven't blurred the lines or crossed the lines or anything... until very recently. I haven't even jaywalked... because I'd be scared of the outcome... Anyways... one day I was sitting home alone and everybody was supposed to be gone for the entire night... My cat came to my... and I so badly wanted to choke the cat... Had my hands around his neck... etc.. then somebody came home... and I let the cat go. If I crossed that line.... Idk... I feel like i could've easily moved on to humans. 

I just....

Everybody keeps telling me life will get better... Etc. You'll move past this.. You'll move on... 

But nobody understands....

It's not something I can just... move on... Or move past... Yes breaking up with my fiance... having my heart broken by her... All of this... is making me extremely suicidal.... But... I'm suicidal because... of how I treat people... Of the way I behave... of how I act.. Of how I think... of how I don't have emotions.. or empathy... or care... or anything...

I know enough about sociopaths and shit like that... ever since I was a child... I mean... My dog hated me. That's a red flag, isn't it? When a dog is scared of a sociopathic child.... that's.. Idk. Our dog never liked me. Probably because I kept doing things to it. When our cat died, I wanted to see the body and... Just play with it. 

Anybody seen Dexter? I feel exactly like Dexter. Hell.. I even love Blood like he does.. And I'd love to cut up a live human being just to see how they react... I'd love to see how they scream... How much pain I can inflict...  I'd love to see how much I can make them react.. Just the mere thought of it brings excitement... Lots of excitement... And... I've never done anything to... Try and... Do anything like it.. I wouldn't get a pet because I'd be scared of how I'd treat the pet... Maybe if I had the opportunity to kill my dog or cat as a child...  I swear I would've became just like Dexter... I'm serious scared of what I can do if I continue down a dark path... Because I know.. I know I can become a serial killer... So I've been scared to pass any lines... always sticking to some moral guideline my grandpa instilled in me...Follow the law... to the letter.. Don't even jaywalk otherwise you're putting yourself in a situation where the lines will get blurred and you'll seriously hurt somebody... (e.i. release nudes to the internet...)WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I DID!!!! The lines were blurred... And that's how I got this far.... 

I'm a sociopath.......
