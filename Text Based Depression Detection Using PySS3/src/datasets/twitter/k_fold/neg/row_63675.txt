Suicide is the only way to escape myselfIâ€™m going to kill myself. I canâ€™t change and I canâ€™t live with myself

It sounds dramatic but if you could see the things I see about myself you would understand. I am simply a disgusting rotten human at my core and there is no hope for me. Like Satan in Paradise Lost, Iâ€™ve used my free will to strip myself of free will. Iâ€™m past the point of return and Iâ€™ve chosen a life of tragedy, suffering, selfishness and despair. Now itâ€™s who I am. Iâ€™m just being honest.  


There is no hope, because I am addicted to suffering and donâ€™t believe I can change, donâ€™t even know if I want to change or want things to get better, which makes me deserving of death and nothing more. 

If wish I could kill myself without my mother or friends knowing. It is the ultimate act of selfishness and proof of my rottenness. But it is bound to happen.
