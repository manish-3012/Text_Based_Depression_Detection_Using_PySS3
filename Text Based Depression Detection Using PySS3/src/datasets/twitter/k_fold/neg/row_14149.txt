I want to die but I donâ€™t want to make my parents sad.I donâ€™t care what friends think, but for my dad I am his only son. If I die I wonâ€™t take heritage in his genes and he will of course be devastated. 
My mother has another daughter but still it would be devastating for her too if I died. 
What would you do in my situation?
