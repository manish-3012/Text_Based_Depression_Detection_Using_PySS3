Bad luckThis is my first post on Reddit ever. I've had many concussions resulting from different sports and also very bad luck. I can't really complain about the life I had: I had pretty much straight A's in building engineering, I have a large group of friends, my family is very supportive and loving, I have a good relationship with my girlfriend and financially, I'm very at ease. The thing is, I keep getting head injuries in the worst ways possible. I got one 3 months ago and it was my seventh one.after it, I had a period with very dark thoughts, cause it seemed like it was never healing. I love sports more than anything and I couldn't do them. I couldn't even hang out with friends without getting headaches and neck pain. In the last week, it was the first time I actually felt like I was getting better. So much so, I decided to go pick nicking with friends today. When I arrived at the park, I go struck in the head by a frisbee. As dumb as it seems, the impact made me lose consciousness and when I finally got back from my apartment, all my concussion symptoms are back. It just seems that every time it starts getting better, everything just goes back to shit. I don't feel like I have any strength left to go trough recovery once again. University starts tomorrow and I'm so fucking scared that I won't be able to concentraee. I feel helpless, like I'm in an endless cycle and shit goes bad each time I start seeing hope. Almost like life itself wants me to out myself. Sorry for the long post, I just have so much anger rage and sadness
