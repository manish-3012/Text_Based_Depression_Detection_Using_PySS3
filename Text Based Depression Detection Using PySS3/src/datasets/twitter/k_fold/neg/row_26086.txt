I want to shoot myself so I wonâ€™t have to think anymore.I ruminate constantly over past mistakes. I canâ€™t stop thinking about how pathetic/stupid/ugly/talentless I am. I desperately want to go back in time and redo my life. I feel like Iâ€™ll never be happy and I honestly want to kill myself just so my brain will shut the fuck up. I canâ€™t do this anymore
