CowardiceI've wanted to kill myself for so long that it's impossible to even imagine what it's like to want to live. I've got nothing to live for, I can't even think of anything potentially worth living for. I would definitely be doing the world a favor if I killed myself, but I don't really give a fuck about anyone else. I still know I should kill myself just to make things easier for me and end this miserable existence, but my fucking cowardice has me trapped in this worthless life. 

Honestly, my life is way better than I deserve, and I still hate it. A painless death is way better than I deserve, but I just can't pull it off. I've known for over a decade that I needed to kill myself, and I haven't wavered in that belief for a second, yet I'm still alive just because of what a little bitch I am. I haven't even been able to make an actual attempt. Imagine being that pathetic. There are literally children that are able to kill themselves, but I'm a grown man and I can't do shit.
