I might be gone tonight.As the title says, I might die tonight, either by gun, or by knife through my arm. I will not leave any knowledge as to why I'll be going, just a sticky note that says "Sorry for the mess." I am just a burden, I put my problems on everyone else, and I can't take the sadness anymore. People have tried to help me before, I thank them for trying, and I'm sorry they couldn't help..
