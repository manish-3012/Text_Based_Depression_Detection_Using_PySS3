If you're feeling suicidal this Christmas...I, nor anybody else is able to be there when you need us. You might be feeling alone and like you wouldn't be remembered. This may be true, this may be not.

There isn't a fairytale version where everything has a deeper, positive meaning. Its quite literally true that this world can eat people up and spit them out. Nobody can offer an easy way, and that might be why you'd take your own path instead. 

However, realising a problem is the first step to solving it. I don't know you and you don't know me, but I personally believe every one of us has it within us to fight this horrible disease in our minds. That means you, too.

I love you, for trying and for still being here, despite everything.

Merry Christmas :)
