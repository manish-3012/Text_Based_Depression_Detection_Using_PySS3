i'm about to lose everything.long story short: my dad left us 6 years ago and we've been struggling ever since. left my mom, little brother and sister and me to ourselves. he refused to pay the rest of the family anything, nor the mortgage, so we lost our house. then we got an apartment, still wasn't getting any money from him, I was working full time at 19 but it still wasn't enough. we lost that apartment too. stayed with a family fried then got a new, cheap-ass place in backtown shitsville, once the court ruled he now had to pay alimony/child support. but my sister took my dad's side and wants nothing to do with us. 

fast forward to now. i haven't had a job or any income in 6 weeks. my mom is disabled and can't work and my brother's too young. so i'm behind on rent. now that the lockdown's ending, we were given a 2 weeks notice to pay or gtfo. unless i can cough up 3.200 $ i'm fucked. mom's been trying to find some place to help but because of fucking corona no one can. so pretty much i'm about to be homeless. we've got nowhere to go. i've been crying for days straight. i'm shaking, i don't know what to do. 

my life has been nothing but misery and pain. i try to have hope it'll be better tomorrow but it never is! i shouldn't have hope for anything, because i always end up dissapointed when i inevitably fail. now, what little i have left is about to be taken away. nothing matters anymore. i don't know how much longer i will survive.

 i doubt it, but if anyone cares, here's what's happening.
