An interesting titleIâ€™m not killing myself tonight. The rules for this sub wonâ€™t load on my phone. I feel nothing nowadays but often when this happens I have odd flashbacks to doing cartwheels and bridges and handsprings in the front lawn of my fathers house and I loved it and everything else. Pointless story, but everything is awful and for the first tome in my life I truly understand that nobody does love me. I likely wonâ€™t die tonight unfortunately and definitely donâ€™t want anybodyâ€™s help but am posting this rant because Iâ€™m out of journal space. Itâ€™s pills oâ€™clock and forever an impelling night to everyone out there.
