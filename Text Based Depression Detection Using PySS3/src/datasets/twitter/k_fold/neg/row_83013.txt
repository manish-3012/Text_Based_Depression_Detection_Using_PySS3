My friend living in another city may die todayUsually I'm the one needing help, or even refusing it because I've been so far gone. 3 attempts and more crises than I can count.

My ex boyfriend, currently my best friend, may die today. And I feel helpless. I know I called and talked and did everything I could and I know it probably barely helped. I fucking know. Because I've been there and I doesn't matter how people will feel, it doesn't matter the aftermath, the pain of carrying on is unbearable and I believe everyone has a right to choose whether they live or die.

But it still hurts. And I feel selfish for it hurting me. Because he's hurting. He's hurting so much more. I know and told him that I can't imagine how he feels, I'm not living his life. He feels he has nothing going for him, nothing he loves, and hates how he's living. He's trying so hard, and I've been seeing it--he tries harder than anyone I know--so I know there's nothing I could do to change that. 

I told him I and we all love him and that despite what he thinks, everything he's done was worth it. His essence and legacy will carry on. His reason was living was to help people, that's all he wanted to do, but he feels it was worthless and has nothing else. I just wish I could do more, or show him that there's more, even did more... But I did as much as I could. 

There's only so much the outside world can do when someone is suicidal. Some people don't understand that but I guess being there makes me get it. I don't have a right to decide if he lives or dies. But I'm just so scared still. And I feel selfish for being upset because he's the one upset.

Fuck, I don't even know why I'm posting this. I'm not the one who's suicidal and I did all I could. I just don't know... Sorry if this was a useless post.
