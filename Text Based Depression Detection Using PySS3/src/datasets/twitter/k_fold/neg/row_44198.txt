Scary thoughtsI have been having thoughts that feel more real than ever before in my life. And trust me I think about killing myself often. I canâ€™t explain it, this doesnâ€™t feel like a fantasy anymore. Iâ€™m between hanging and overdosing but this just feels very very real. I donâ€™t know when to do it but I feel like Iâ€™m actually going to go through with it all the way this time.
