I want to let go.I feel so alone. I know people love me and I have friends. I just can't feel loved anymore. I guess you could say I hate myself so much it doesn't let me be lovable. It's like therea a hole in the middle ofy chest and its killing me. It hurts so goddamn much just to get up and know I've got another day of hell ahead of me. It cold, and its hard, and its every single day and Im so tired. I just want to lie down and let myself slip away. Nothing violent or painful. Just drifting away.
