How i feel.God i feel shitty right now. Of course when i mean right now i mean everyday it seems even if just for an hour i feel like a total train wreak every single god dam day. Full of regrets and stresses all of it mostly pointless to even think about. I watched a video recently and it brought up a feeling i feel everyday that feeling being wanting to die. Of course i dont want to die i just dont want to exist...and of course i dont plan on taking my own life but i know its always an option and like id totally never do it but its always there as an out...but id never do it...but sometimes ill linger over the idea for a while and that scares me because maybe the guy was right the very fact it is a zero sum complete end to it all no win no progress just a full stop...means i hopefully never will do it...but its always there. He also said how you should never fall in love with depression...how you can be depressed without it being who you are...and it gives me hope but im in a dark place right now and i feel sometimes like its all i got...it doesn't help me it doesnt give me insight maybe empathy thats it...i want to die but i dont want to die...thats definitely the game im playing in my head at least once a day. So its killing me and i know i should be smart enough to do what i need to in order to end it...but a part of me really thinks i deserve it.
