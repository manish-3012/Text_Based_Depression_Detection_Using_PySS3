Hey this is a little unrelated but I donâ€™t know where to goIn July I overdosed on Ibuprofen and had a pretty tough experience. I am feeling very sick tonight with a huge headache and I want to take Advil to help but Iâ€™m just getting an uncomfortable feeling when holding it up to my mouth. Iâ€™m going to try to ignore that feeling and use it, but first will my body react poorly to it if my minds refusing it? Has anyone have this type of experience? It might seem like a stupid problem and it is but I just need some reassurance I guess.
