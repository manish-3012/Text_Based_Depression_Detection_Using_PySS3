I'm starting to feel it would be easier if I was gone...I am so sick of all the stress from work, having bills that just don't seem to be getting easier to handle, faking a smile when I want to break down and give up, trying do hard to please others but failing...

I just want to be gone... if I was dead I'd never have to worry about anything ever again. I'd no longer be a sentient being... I'd be nothing. I want to be nothing and worry about nothing.

I'm so tired of life. I'm just so done failing. Nothing makes me happy anymore...
