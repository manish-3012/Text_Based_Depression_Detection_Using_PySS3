Alone at midnight and feeling absolutely terrible againStupid fucking BPD. I wish I was normal or I actually had the guts to attempt suicide but I'd just fail again like all the other times. I wish people weren't asleep so I could have someone to talk to. Right now I really feel like jumping in front of a car, or hanging myself. I just don't want to be here especially when I'm reminded of everything I have to do
