How can I help others before offing myself?Hey,

I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask, I couldn't think of any other subreddit but if you have any suggestions let me know. I plan to off myself in a couple of years time (this thread is not to discuss this) and before I do, I'd like to help as many people (and animals) as I can. Apart from volunteering, giving money, organ donation - is there anything else I can do to help others? Please keep in mind this is only for a couple of years and I'm not rich, so I wouldn't be able to do anything that requires long term commitment (like investment or adoption for example).
