I don't want to exist and felt like talking to someone. [17]I don't want to die, but I want to phase out of existence. Dying is the closest I can get to that, though, so you know.

My life isn't a bad one, though. My family is a bit dysfunctional, but they're not as bad as a lot of families. My friends can make me feel like shit, but they keep me around so I can only assume they care about me to some extent. My love life leaves a bit to be desired (not that it's particularly sparse, it's just really unstable,) but I don't think I'm quite hopeless there. I'm smart enough to have a good shot at a good future, I think. None of this matters to me, though. I still feel totally hopeless.

I feel defective, or like I don't count as a human being. Like I don't have any hope for a happy life because I'm somehow undeserving of good things. I feel like out of all of my possible futures, the vast majority of them end with me being a deeply unhappy individual. I feel like I'm undeserving of being loved or cared about. I feel like I shouldn't be allowed to forge personal relationships or let people into my life. I feel like I don't deserve to exist. I don't really know why.

So. I don't think of myself as being in immediate danger of suicide, but my plan is that if I'm not any better by my 18th birthday in October, I probably will do it. At least that's how I'm trying to think. I'm sort of eliminating my future in hopes that I become more comfortable in the present, and then can face the future regardless.

So yeah. Sorry. Just needed to put all of that somewhere.
