I donâ€™t have any emotions. I feel numb.I donâ€™t fit in anywhere, no one loves me. No one ever will. I can see it on their fake smiles. My whole life I thought I was better than everyone but I was so wrong. Sooo wrong. No one will ever love me. I donâ€™t have any interests &amp; I donâ€™t have my own opinions &amp; Iâ€™m ugly. Iâ€™m so so ugly. Iâ€™m selfish and Iâ€™m ugly and Iâ€™m stupid. I was given all the potential to build an amazing life for myself and I couldnâ€™t even do that. I couldnâ€™t. Why? I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m now left with no friends (no true friends anyways) no hobbies, but I do have a family that just wants to see me happy. So so happy. But Iâ€™m not. I never will be. I wonâ€™t be happy. Because I messed it all up. Every time I try to start a new hobby, become a new version of myself I fail. I fail so hard. I fail so so hard. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m failing at life. Iâ€™m 19F &amp; Iâ€™m ready to kill myself but I know I wonâ€™t ever do it, Iâ€™ll just keep comparing myself to my successful friends &amp; my beautiful sisters. Because I can see them doing so so well in life where I canâ€™t even see myself being the slightest bit happy.
