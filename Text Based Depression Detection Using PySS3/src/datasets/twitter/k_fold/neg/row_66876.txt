My mind started shutting down and I started cutting myselfI used the same object I used to cut myself when I was younger. I stopped cutting when I was 17, Iâ€™m 22 now and I just tried to do it again. The object wasnâ€™t as sharp as it was back then so I only left two red ass lines across my forearm.



Some context is I essentially lie to myself every single day in order to stay sane. My parents still treat me like Iâ€™m a child, I work a shit job where I get treated like shit for minimum wage, I have absolutely zero friends, Iâ€™m short, Iâ€™m below average in the looks department.



What brought on this breakdown today is my father reminding me of why I first became depressed. Living in a household devoid of love and understanding. Like shit, is it too much to ask for a teeny bit of respect, I mean, for fucks sake I pay rent to them to live here and itâ€™s only slightly cheaper then if I were to move out.



Why I donâ€™t move out? Iâ€™m barely keeping my mind in tact as it is, I donâ€™t even have a friend so Iâ€™d have to find someone looking for a roommate and hope to god they arenâ€™t a complete shit.



All of this is just rambling at this point so TLDR is, I started losing grip a few minutes ago, thought about how was it would be to end my life, and instead started trying to cut myself. Iâ€™m stable now and Iâ€™ll probably stable for the next couple of months, but fuck me dude. I hope something good happens otherwise next time I breakdown I might actually attempt suicide for a second time and hope I succeed this time.
