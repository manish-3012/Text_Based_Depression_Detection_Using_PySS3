Advice on how to help someone planning suicide?Hi there everyone, I'm a moderator for a small IO game (https://hordes.io) and just 30 minutes or so ago one of the players of this game messaged me over Discord telling me that another player had told him that he plans to kill himself tonight. 

How do I go about helping this person that I don't know very well, without pushing them in the wrong decision?

(And let it be known that the person who told me also does not know this suicidal person very well)
(And one last thing, the only current way for me to contact this person would be through Discord)
