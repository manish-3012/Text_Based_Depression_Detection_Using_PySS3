I have lost all passions to do anything. What was once fun is now just a hassle.All of my passions and hobbies do nothing for me now. Everything I once loved to do just bores me and just isnâ€™t fun anymore. My favorite activity is to lay in bed. 

Just so fucking lonely and bored with my existence. Thereâ€™s not a thing I can think of that can get my gears going. Videos games, fucking trash and does nothing for my life. Football, I waisted away my years being stupid and not even trying in high school and will obviously never be able to play the game again. Canâ€™t even watch a game of football without feeling embarrassed because of how disappointing and stupid I played. 

 Been playing guitar for several years but I canâ€™t pick it up without just putting it back down. My favorite music and inspirations like Nirvana, the Beatles, and Marilyn Manson just sound bland and boring to me. I lost my athletic figure because of anorexia and now that I have gained back weight Iâ€™m now fat with stretch marks from my stomach to my man boobs. 

My ex fiancÃ© is a sack of shit, has serious bipolar and mantic depression. Hope that bitch dies.

I just feel like Iâ€™m getting to the point I donâ€™t give a fuck and I might just say fuck it and live on heroin. Or rob a house, hell maybe a store. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ve never done heroin or robbed anybody, but at this point what do I got to lose. 

Maybe joining in the military and forcing my way into combat some how just to go out guns ablazing, if I die fuck it, at least it was for you all, at least it was for bettering the illusion/fake world that we live in. Doing those things seems more right than anything else I can think of. 

Besides my 90 year old grandma I donâ€™t really care for anybody else. Fuck the rest of my family for all I care. They arenâ€™t the worst in the world but at this point Idgaf. They make me feel like a Ni****(iâ€™m Black) and utter worthless trash, like Iâ€™m scum of the earth. But in reality Iâ€™m not even a bad guy. 

I ran a multi million dollar restaurant. And my family respected me and cared about me then, but I quit because I was helping this guy make millions in profits while he did nothing and I was only being paid a salary of 20,000 a year while working 7 days a week 14-15 hours a day. Now my family thinks Iâ€™m just a bum again. Donâ€™t get me wrong thatâ€™s a decent chunk of change, but when Iâ€™m crunching numbers, paying yoursll of your day to day bills and businesses bills, overseeing your other companies FOR YOU and running your main franchise business, while working 14 hours a day 7 days a week, and Iâ€™m basically only getting paid $4-$5 an hour, god damn it dude I should have fucking stole his money and murdered his sorry ass. Guy couldnâ€™t even give me a day off when I asked for one. After I left I come to find out my replacement is making close to 6 figures, does only a quarter of what I did and has 4 days off. FUCKING KILL ME NOW!!!!!!

Now, I work at a fucking Taco Bell. What is sad is Iâ€™m happier at work than Iâ€™ve ever been, pretending to be the nice guy who makes sure everyone is okay and doing an amazing job. Now I actually have a life, and only work till 2pm everyday with 3 days off. But to be honest I think working sucks and to be honest I donâ€™t give a fuck about those people either. Just something about being in front of others, being a leader, and being scared to act how I really feel.... which is to get in my car, drive off a cliff and blow out my fucking skull with my gloc mid fall. 

I just donâ€™t know how to deal with this. And to be quite honest I donâ€™t even want to fix it. I just wish the news would come out tomorrow and say theyâ€™ve found out there is no god and when you die you become nothing. Iâ€™d be the first recorded suicide.

Iâ€™d do anything in the world to be able to Talk to Kurt Cobain and see how he truly felt about life and everything. I just relate so much with the guy, and now Iâ€™m thinking about ending myself the same way he did.
