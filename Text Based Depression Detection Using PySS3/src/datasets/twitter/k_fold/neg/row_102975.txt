I just really need someone to talk to.I'm to much of a coward to come out to my family. I'm afraid if they found out everyone would hate me and I get too embarrassed or prideful to talk to my friends about it. I would just feel like I'm complaining. I've thought about suicide and my death a lot lately. I don't think I would ever actually do it but the thought is still there whatever that means.
