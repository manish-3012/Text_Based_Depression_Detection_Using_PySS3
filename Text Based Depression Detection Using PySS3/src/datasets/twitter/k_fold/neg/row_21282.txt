My brother tried to kill himself last night.He took a knife from the kitchen and attempted to cut his own throat. He succeded, and required ten stitches. Luckily he missed his carotid arteries by a millimeter or two...

The combination of happiness that he didn't die and sadness that he attempted to is overwhelming. I just thought I'd mention it here I guess. Suicide sucks.
