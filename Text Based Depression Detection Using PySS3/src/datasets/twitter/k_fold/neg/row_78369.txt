When my dog dies I'm going to kill myselfJust over 2 years ago my family adopted a dog that was rescued from a kill shelter in Romania. She's beautiful, funny, friendly and delicate and I fell in love with her the day I met her. She was my first dog and she saved me from killing myself and I've always thought that I would kill myself when she dies, or hopefully at that point we could've had her for so long that my depression would have lessened and I would be able to live without her. Two months ago we noticed a swelling on her gum that had started to grow over the top of one of her teeth. We couldn't take her to a vet because of coronavirus, but we managed to get a video call appointment with a vet who told us just to keep an eye on it, but to book a face-to-face appointment if it started to grow or affect her. Since then it's started to cover another of her teeth and in the past few days she's started to find it harder to eat, so the face-to-face appointment finally came yesterday and the lump was inspected and they think it's a tumour, but we have to wait a week for the biopsy to reveal if it's cancerous and if it's spreading. if it's benign they may be able to remove it along with a part of her lower jaw, and she might be able to make a full recovery, but if it's spreading we may only have a few months left with her before she has to be put to sleep. I'm heartbroken, my only reason to live is slipping away from me right in front of my eyes and if this stupid virus hadn't happened we might've been able to get her treated sooner so it wouldn't have progressed as much. She's only 5 years old and its breaking my heart to think we originally could've had 10 more years with her, and now we might only have a few months. As soon as she passes away I can't see myself staying alive more than a few days before I kill myself. She's the most beautiful and delicate dog and she doesn't deserve this after the trauma and abuse from her life in the shelter
