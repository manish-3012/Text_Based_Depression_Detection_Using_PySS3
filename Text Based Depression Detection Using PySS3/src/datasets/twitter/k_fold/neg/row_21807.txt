Life is so meaningless.I don't know what to do. I'm not getting anywhere in life; I honestly don't know what I'm wating for. There is no real change. I'll always have the same problems the same thoughts &amp; feeelings. It'll never change. idk. 

It's not that I can't do it, I just don't want to do it. I'm tired. I hate how the world works and I hate where my life is going. I'm stuck and can't get over this heartache. MY heart aches because of the world. There is only suffering.

  The good does not out weigh the bad. There is no balance of good and evil. There is more evil things and people than good things and people. Greed and selfishness rule this world. No compassion for one another. Only compassion for the dollar. I'm done being apart of this corrupt and cruel world.
