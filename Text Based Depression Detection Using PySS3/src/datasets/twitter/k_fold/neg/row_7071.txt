I canâ€™t stop feeling this way but i WANT to so badlyI moved for work. Got a great job with nice coworkers right out of college. I have a great apartment in a great community. I have little student debt, I have my own personal vehicle with no payments and I can afford the essentials and quite a lot of entertainment on the side. 

If you saw my life from the outside youâ€™d think how the hell is this guy slipping down the slope, and the answer is i donâ€™t know and I donâ€™t want to but I am.

I lost most of my friends when I moved, the girl I loved as a friend and a little more. Iâ€™ve been here for months and I donâ€™t have a single friend. My job has prevented me from being able to have any free time during the week. I hate this part of my job. I just lost my voice screaming fuck this shit at the top of my lungs and I have to get up and do it again tomorrow. My family doesnâ€™t understand how I could possibly be upset given my circumstances. 

I feel like Iâ€™m drowning and every day I get a little closer to going under. Today I got to the point where actually having everything turn off sounded so relaxing and calm and I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
