BreakI am so close to breaking. I am in love but it's not enough, I have passions but they aren't respected, I have dreams but I am too exhausted to get out of my bed. I am missing college and I am missing who I can be. I want to go to the doctor but all I want is drugs, I don't want a shitty councillor who doesn't give a shit, I was to come out of my head for a few years. I want to be dependent on something other than hurting myself, the pain isn't even relieving anymore I only do it out of hate. I do not want to be alive, this is a cry for help but I don't even want anybody to read it. I don't want anybody to know or anybody to care, I need a reason to leave this place behind.
