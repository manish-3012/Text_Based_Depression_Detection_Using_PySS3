help me.I have known all my life I would die by suicide.. i have made a few failed, half hearted attempts maybe out of self pity or maybe out of fear i knew i wasn't cutting quite deep enough, drinking strong enough pills or actually getting as far as pulling a trigger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sound pathetic i realize that. 

There is a backstory too long to get into, too many hurtful things i do not think i deserved, or am i just an awful person not seeing the hurt and burden i am and have been.

&amp;#x200B;

I have so many reason to die but my selfish fear wont let me. The suffering circles back in the voice of my failures spoken through my husband to be. Failures amplified to a point where most of it is an exaggeration but the bitter truth is i am not innocent, just not as guilty as i get told i am. Half truths have become full lies and i cannot find the way to defend or change any of my past mistakes.

I do not have anything to stick around this godforsaken world for, why can i not find he balls to just end my misery
