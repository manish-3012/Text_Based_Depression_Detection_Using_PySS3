Not Worth The StruggleI am very sensitive to sound. It is very hard for me to concentrate on reading when there are obnoxious sounds in the environment. Pretty much any sound is obnoxious. I used to be able to read a lot, but now it takes much more effort. Even when I am not trying to concentrate sounds bother me so much that I am constantly scared of the next big sound. I hate living with this anxiety. I have tried every conceivable medication. I am unable to hold a job. I'm going to try volunteering just so I'm not constantly in the house being depressed. Nothing makes me more frustrated than being stuck in the house spinning my wheels. I hate the sounds of my house(creaking floors, ect) , I hate that I will have to hear them every single fucking day. I'm 20 and very frustrated that I have to go through more of this crap just so I can get nowhere with my life. I really do not want to live more than a few more months. It is not worth the stress. I cannot concentrate enough to study, so university is out of the question. I'm left to spin my wheels for the rest of my life as compensation for putting up with the constant shit show of sound, depression and anxiety. A pathetic life is not enough motivation to drag myself through the sounds and anxiety. People say that your 20s are supposed to be the best time of your life. I have barely started mine and they are truly a miserable shit show. Getting nowhere with my life is not worth the struggle.
