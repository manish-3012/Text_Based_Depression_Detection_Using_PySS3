Coping without cutting is difficultLet's just get right to the chase -- my family and my significant other  is worried about my cutting habits.  I have been trying to stop but the need is still there, especially times where I feel like I have no other option.  I am wondering if there is a specific place on my body where I can relieve myself without making it entirely noticeable.  I know that I should support my bad habit, but it's just something I feel so compelled to do when I'm alone with my thoughts.  Talking about my problems makes me feel selfish.  I don't feel comfortable talking to my boyfriend or my family because they begin to feel upset and tell me that I am selfish for doing these things.  I was hoping that maybe after writing this I will not feel the urge to cut.  I was thinking that this could perhaps be a safe outlet if I needed one away from my immediate "support".  Who knows.
