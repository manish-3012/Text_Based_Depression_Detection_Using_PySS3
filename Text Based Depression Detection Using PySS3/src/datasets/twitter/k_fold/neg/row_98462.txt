I need someone to talk to...I was abused by my mother and father growing up and I moved away from them when I was 16 when my father went to jail. I remember being so scared of my mother and I just wanted to get away, and if I didn't, I would have killed myself then to get away from the pain. I got emancipated and moved in with my currant boyfriend who I have been seeing on and off for the last 4 years. I am 18 now and I still have nightmares about my family. I wake up and I feel like I am suffocating and I hate it. I hate how I don't trust people because of my parents. I don't see people anymore, just monsters in peoples skin. I started seeing a Therapist because I had developed a cutting problem to cope with the anxiety. Everything seemed to start looking up. I started eating better, exercising, and doing more things that made me happy, but in the back of my head there was always that darkness that would seep in every so often. It has been worse lately. I told my Therapist and she understood what I was feeling. Apparently I have PTSD from the childhood abuse and depression. My Therapist mentioned that I might show more improvement with some Anti-depressants as well as continuing weekly Therapy. She explained how it worked and at this point, I want to keep trying. I was with my boyfriend earlier and mentioned to him that I was thinking about taking anti depressants. He laughed and said I have control over how I am feeling. so I don't need to take pills and that I can just choose to be happy if I wanted but I am choosing not too. This broke my heart...He doesn't understand me. He doesn't understand the soul crushing feeling of the darkness. I can't eat or sleep and I am tired of the nightmares. He is at work right now and I just kept hearing his words over and over again along with the questions: Why am I so pathetic? Why can't I do better? Why did the people that were supposed to love me make me this way? I did the only thing that I knew would take the pain away. I started cutting. Now I am sitting here with bloody arms feeling more pathetic for not being stronger. My boyfriend is going to come home to me being a cut up mess and I feel so weak and ashamed. I am so embarrassed and I need someone to talk to...
