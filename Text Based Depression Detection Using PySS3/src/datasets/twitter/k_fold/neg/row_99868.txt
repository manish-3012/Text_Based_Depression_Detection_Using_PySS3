I tried hanging myself. And i failed.I tried hanging myself about a week ago and no one knows. I went to an abandoned factory and tied myself up before thinking about it too much and just did it. I blacked out before waking up on the ground. I donâ€™t know what to feel. That whole day i had finally felt happy and relieved when the thought of taking my life came and now after i did it i want to try it again. I thought maybe i would feel better as i have read that people have a new outlook on life after an attempt. But I donâ€™t.
