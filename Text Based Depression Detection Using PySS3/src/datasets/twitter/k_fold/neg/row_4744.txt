I don't know what to do.I'm getting more and more confused by life. I don't feel anything. I don't feel sad or angry and somehow I still want to die. Noone cares about me but, the requirements from others are still getting bigger and bigger. I can't stand that. Day by day I feel more empty and dead inside. All I wanna do now is stop existing. I miss the times when I was a kid and I knew that someone cared about me at least a little.
