Purposeless? Need something to do?Just chanced upon the subreddit /r/ProjectReddit. Every week, the mod hands out one assignment that you are supposed to devoutly attach yourself to. It is currently in its 19th week, so you can take your pick of assignments.

If you find yourself aimless and feel that it's all pointless and hopeless, why not distract yourself with these? They are beneficial to your health and both help to destress as well as help you learn to manage situations.

Give it a shot.
