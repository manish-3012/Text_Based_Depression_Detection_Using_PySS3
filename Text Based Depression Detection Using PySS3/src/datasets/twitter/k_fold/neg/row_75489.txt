I just don't want to do anything anymoreI've just lost the will to want to do anything. I don't want to go to school tomorrow, i dont want to deal with life, i don't want to have to worry about my future, and how much I'm failing at it. Honestly at this point i just want to die and be done with everything. I can't bring myself to kill myself though, because i know that there are people that i would hurt if i did. I've been on that end and i wouldn't want anyone else to have to go through it. I'm just tired of living, and i don't think i can continue on like this. Most of my friends have left me, with one of my best friends now refusing to even acknowledge my existence, let alone talk to me. Life just isnt fun anymore, theres no wonder or excitement, just dread and disappointment.
