close friend opened up about not liking himself and wanted to start hitting heroin and self harm again, don't know what to dohey there, a close friend of mine, recently opened up about being incredibly lonely and down about himself, citing that no one likes him and that he only has 3/4 close friends, with everyone hating him. the dude always seemed so upbeat and cool, it never hit me that he had been suffering. anyway he says he wants to just waste away and be the loser everyone else sees him as, and wants to kill someone as that would get him attention as he says. i tried my best to help him and give him support, but frankly i don't know if i said the right things. we meet again at school tomorrow, but i don't know if i should tell anyone, including his girlfriend to just look out for him? i feel like he's in a very bad spot mentally, but i don't know how to help him
