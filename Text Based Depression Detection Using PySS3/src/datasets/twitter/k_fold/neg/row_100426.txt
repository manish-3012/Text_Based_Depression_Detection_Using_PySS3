Boop!c: Rant sorry.The thoughts aren't stopping no matter what what I try to do. I can't seek professional help, the cost is too high for a worthless person like me. I am not labeled by any professional and it drives me deeper into my corner of whatever I have because it's like no one cares because I don't have my official government labels. I'm not depressed because no one ever labeled me as one. I'm not suicidal because no one sees the scars. I'm not crazy because no one gets to know me that far. But why the hell would I want to show people those things? What's the point of cutting myself if I'm just going to show it to people? I can't breathe.

I have a boyfriend. He loves me, I know so. But he's dumb because he's too kind. But if I tell him that he'd be sad and I love him to no ends. I'm attached unhealthily. To him, anyway. And but he has a cool woman his parents pay for to help him with his problems. And I'm worthless. He tells me we'll talk about my problems but it always just goes back to his and I simply pretend I'm okay so he's okay. I don't pretend. I probably do, actually. I pretend a lot, but I've tried over and over and over to talk it out, to ask for help, to move on from being rash and self harming. 

I want him to get abusive, sometimes. He's sweet... too sweet. Never would lay a hand on me. But I'm hurting. I don't want to hurt myself.. it makes him sad. I rather he be abusive so at least I get my pain from somewhere. I can't figure out why I can't be happy. He's the only happiness. I'm too young. I should have died sooner. My mom would cry if she knew... but she knows. But she doesn't think I have a problem. Mothers knows best, right? I don't have a problem. Dad said he would support me no matter what, but dad drinks too much. The air is thin here, I think. I can't breathe.. my laptop is freaking out xD The tears got on the touch pad now the mouse won't stop.

I wonder if I was the stick figure in the stick-man v animators, would I be able to die from the pointy point of the mouse? Oh, it's kinda like suicide by cop. I looked into it but I don't like the wuss way of leaving. Would be manlier to just die from self-harm than a stupid cop.
