I feel increasingly unhinged and I canâ€™t do this for much longer.so, this past week has been a weird one. my moods have done a world tour and now iâ€™m so exhausted. has anyone else struggled with this too? 

day 1, sun: had a massive, overwhelming self-hate spiral the day after my therapy session, cried for hours and wanted to die. note: i had a dose change for my effexor 2 days back. 

day 2, mon: emotionally drained and flat.

day 3, tue: felt extremely hopeless, cried a fucking ton from shower to bed because of how endless my emotional pain felt. 

day 4, wed: cried a ton again, mainly due to anxiety over therapy, moving houses, and the thought of my parents dying in 20 years and me wanting to kill myself immediately after theyâ€™re gone. 

day 5, thu: migraine, but otherwise fairly normal. went to dinner with some friends. 

day 6, fri: no thoughts in my head, but physically drained of all energy. laid in bed throughout the day for a good 8 hours straight. didnâ€™t eat much. 

day 7, sat: lots of thoughts and questions. exhaustion was around 65-70%. my brain needs hugs. 

day 8, sun: had a terrible series of dreams. more energy that day, but felt jittery and nauseous. chest felt heavier. no thoughts, and felt empty. i didnâ€™t eat much again. 

day 9, today: didnâ€™t sleep a wink last night (despite nightly rx of trazodone &amp; zopiclone). feeling very unemotional and flat. no thoughts in my head except thoughts of self-harm because i felt nothing in my chest &amp; head. i used a meat cleaver to try and cut myself at 5am in the kitchen, but the cuts were so uselessly shallow that i was plain unimpressed â€” this was weird because i never feel the urge to SH unless iâ€™m uncontrollably hurting emotionally. went to get breakfast without my family knowing, and wanted to sit on the roof of a nearby parking garage and see if i wanted to jump. ended up going home and napping for 2 hours after everyone else woke up. 

i feel unhinged. i donâ€™t know what to expect. i know iâ€™m in the depths of a MDD episode right now but this has been a whole other level of ill. how the fuck have i gone from crying for hours to feeling nothing at all? whatâ€™s happening to me?

iâ€™m so tired of feeling this way. i just want to make it make sense, and feel better. i thought i was supposed to be improving with treatment but i feel like iâ€™m going nowhere. 

when is this going to end?
