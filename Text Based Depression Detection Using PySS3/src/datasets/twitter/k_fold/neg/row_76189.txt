Fiance of 5 years is leaving me.... Dont want this life..As im writing this i have tears in my eyes. I have someone that i love and the only one that makes me happy leaving me. He is going back to his home state and leaving me in mine. He said he wanted to stay but i guess that was a huge disappointing lie. I cant take anymore Reddit. I know i sound stupid but no life at all would be better than a life without him. He's leaving Saturday and so will I....It's the only way to be happy Reddit. I dont know any other way
