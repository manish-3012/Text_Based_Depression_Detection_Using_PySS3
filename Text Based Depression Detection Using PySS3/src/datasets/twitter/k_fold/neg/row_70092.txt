i'm about to end iti'm so fucking done with life. it's pointless for me to keep trying. i don't have a reason to live. none.

my mom isn't the best of people. she's always been religious(trying to save my soul at the age of 7), and extremely strict, but when i was 8, stuff got out of control. she screams at me constantly over small stuff, at one point she starved me and my brothers for being "ungrateful". she's made me drink a cup of soap before and turns every-damn-thing about her. my dad lets it happen and says "BUT SHE IS YOUR MOTHER" when i tell him what's been happening. 

i'm 16. i can't drive, use the phone, or leave the house.

i'm too stupid for just about everything. it's a family joke, actually. i have adhd and mild autism and a speech impediment. my lack of concentration got me b's, c's, and a d last semester. my brothers get straight a's, and my mom points out how stupid i am compared to them at any chance possible, and it's considered hilarious. 

i hate myself.

i started becoming depressed when i was 12 due to home stuff and i've been bullied since third grade. this past year, a group of guys threw rocks at me when i was walking to class, and one threw a pepsi bottle at my face. my school did nothing about it. i've been cutting since i was 13. i've been clean for a month. 

last summer, i was raped by a family "friend". i hate talking about what he did, and my parents don't know about it. the reason i haven't killed myself yet is because of the possibility of seeing panic! at the disco on tour, but my mom took that too. i can't mention panic in my house anymore or she'll hurt me worse.

so that's it, i guess. 

i'm sorry.
