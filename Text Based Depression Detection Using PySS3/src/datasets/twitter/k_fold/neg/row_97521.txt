Why Can't I Just Do It?Quick Intro: 
So I'm 24, living with parents, no job, in tech school and I'm an alcoholic. I used to be sort of popular then I started drinking heavily, gained 150lbs and dropped out of college. I spent all my money on drugs and alcohol and lost all but 2 of my friends, the ones I didn't lose are slowly moving on. You know how life is. 

I just had a convo with my mom telling me how they feel like such failures and how I wasted my life. They claim they're there to talk but their talks are kind of like those memes you see, the ones where someone says they're depressed and the other person just says cheer up, don't be depressed and the first person says "wOw oMg CuRed!" or they just talk over me not with me. They think my addiction isn't real and neither is my depression, they truly believe it's as easy as just stopping and cheering up. My mom kept throwing my alcoholism in my face and how fat and far off I've fallen from who I used to be. Or they'll remind me how difficult it is for them to not be able to tell their friends I've graduated and got a job. It's like they don't care about my future, they just care if they can brag about me. It's to the point where neither of them seem to care for me and only deal with me because I'm their son, not because they love me. I pictured myself dead and imagine what my parents would say and I keep thinking they'd just shrug it off since their "ideal son" died when I became an alcoholic. 

Given that I finally feel all alone (no friends or family) I don't see any reason to not off myself. I keep thinking of going to my room and ending it but I just can't. I keep lying to myself and telling myself there's something better later on. But if I can't even have my parents, if I can't have the people I thought I would always have with me then what even is the point? 

tldr: I'm very suicidal and needed to vent, you aren't missing anything if you skip this post
