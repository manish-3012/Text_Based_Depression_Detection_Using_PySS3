Iâ€™m so tired, I donâ€™t want to sleep because I know it means I have to wake up again.there is literally no reasons for me to continue living. My favourite part of the day is sleeping but that only feels like it lasted a second then I am pushed back into the depressing reality. Iâ€™m really tired and just want to sleep and never wake up, I really feel like giving up. Depression wins I guess.
