Iâ€™m ending this painEverybody will fucking use me up and get what they need and once I stop being worth shit then they just throw me away. I genuinely thought you loved me, I thought you were different from all the pieces of shit in my life but your not your literally like every one else. Iâ€™m tired of this, Iâ€™m fucking tired of being a toy. I deserve to be loved, I deserve respect, and Iâ€™m never going to get that and quite frankly Iâ€™m tired of chasing that image, Iâ€™m tired of life in general and I canâ€™t be here anymore. Mom and dad I tried for five years to be strong for you guys but I canâ€™t anymore. I wasnâ€™t made to be here and I think itâ€™s time I go. Iâ€™m sorry
