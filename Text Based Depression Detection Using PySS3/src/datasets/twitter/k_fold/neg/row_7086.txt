Still Suicidal, But A Friend Shed Some Light For MeI'm still depressed, and I still feel incredibly suicidal. But one of the most important friends in my life just texted me that they miss me already. She came to visit me from out of state this weekend, and knowing that she cares enough to let me know that may help me make it through the rest of today, instead of thinking of tools I have in order to off myself. 

For everyone in the same situation as me on here, no matter how confident you are that no one thinks or cares, I was just proven this afternoon that it is never the case. Hopefully this can also help you survive through another day. Hopefully longer.
