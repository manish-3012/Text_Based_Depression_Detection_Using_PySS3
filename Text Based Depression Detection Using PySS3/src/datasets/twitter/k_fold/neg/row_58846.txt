Ugly, Short, and Disposable.Being a short male, that already makes me severely hindered when it comes to love, but when I am ugly on top of it, that just makes it worse to the point I am undateable. I don't watch anime or practically anything because it showcases all lovey dovey aspects and since I am ugly and worthless, it just drills it in.

Especially when the protag is a hot, tall male with actual intelligence, instead of my faux-smart ass. Of course, no one cares because I'm male and thus disposable. I doubt this will get a response.
