Please help me.I am at the point where I just want to give up. I've been depressed for 4 fucking years now ever since my parents through their though divorce with me getting put in the middle of it. My mom kicked me out of her house because I hated when she talked about my dad and now my dad is about to do the same to me because I don't like him talking about my mom. It's gotten to the point where I have no where to turn too as my family all lives far from me and I just recently moved so I have no friends in my new town. I live at the beach so it'd just be so easy to walk into the water and just never come back.
