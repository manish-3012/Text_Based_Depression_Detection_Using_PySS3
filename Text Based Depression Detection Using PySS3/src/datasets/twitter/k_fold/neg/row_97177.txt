For the most part, Iâ€™m pretty good now. I know nobody cares, but I just wanted to say it.Iâ€™m not sure if I will need this sub anymore, but I guess Iâ€™ll stay just in case, or if anyone needs any help. I never made a post on this sub, but I joined it because I liked reading stuff about people feeling the same way as me. Thank you for your help, even though you didnâ€™t know you were helping me :)
