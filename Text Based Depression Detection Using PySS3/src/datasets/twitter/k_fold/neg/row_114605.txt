I've finally chosen a date.And I feel... well, I don't know how I feel.

A lot of myself is just relieved that my pain will be over soon and I have something to look forward to, but another part of me is forlorn, like I'm sad I have to leave so soon. I'm really conflicted. I know this probably means there's some part of me that doesn't want to die, but I am literally unable to get myself help.

I just posted this here because I needed somewhere to put it without worrying my friends, sorry.
