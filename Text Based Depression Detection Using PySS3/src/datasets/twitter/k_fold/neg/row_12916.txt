I can't kill myselfWhere I am its safe no one sees me. Everytime I decide this is my last cigarette and I will do it. I put the rope around my neck and I hang myself for a few seconds then I climb back shaking. And I try to distract myself. I am scared of dying. I dropped school 5 times I am 23 unemployed. I lost my only friend. 

 At the therapist I was crying so much that I couldn't talk and when I did it was about worthless stuff I felt even worse  after I saw him. I have been depressed for 10 years I tried to get help. I attempted kill myself but with pills it don't work it was only the most physically painful night in my life. And nothing changed.
