Probably won't make it to New YearsI've decided that I won't live to see New Years Day. I've finally gone completely numb from how bad it's gotten. Things aren't getting better on my end. Nor will it because I don't have money for medicine, therapy, or hospitalization. I've got a method that should be pretty foolproof as well. Now it's only a matter of time. There's no reason for me to stick around. Besides, there's no way to get better.
