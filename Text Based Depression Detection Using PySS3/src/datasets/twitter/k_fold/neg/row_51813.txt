My 20 year old girlfriend of 4 years and 3 months left me for our 42 year old professor.I have no idea what the fuck to think about this. This girl was my high school sweetheart and it was painful enough when she left me (2 weeks ago today), but I found out that just a week later she was dating our former professor (we took his class a year ago). My exgirlfriend and I are both 20 years old and she has been seeing a 42 year old professor at our university. I have no idea how to handle this. I can't come to terms with what this says about me. She was my first real girlfriend. The only other girl I dated was in middle school and that was its own fiasco.
My biggest problem right now is the fact that she was the closest I have ever been to a human being and, never in a million years would I have seen this coming. Granted, she is bi-polar, but our problems in our relationship resulted because she went off her meds, and now she's back on them! I was even the one convincing her to start taking them again! I just can't handle what this says about me or any of this. It's all beyond my scope of understanding. I'm in a very, very dark place.
