Is it normal to feel like this?Recently I've been feeling like I'm just letting life pass me by and not really doing anything. I don't know if it's because I haven't found my purpose in life, but I constantly feel worthless and wonder just what the fuck I am doing here. However, whenever I feel a little more calm, I think over my current situation and realize that, on the outside, things aren't really that bad and that I have love and support from my family, at least. This, in turn, leaves me in disgust with myself for even thinking about killing myself and makes me feel even worse. It feels like my value in this life is so minimal and nonexistent that, even if I have had food on my table and a roof over my head, a family that loves me (all my life) and opportunities in life, that I still somehow manage to feel like this on the inside. I just feel so useless; like I was never meant to be alive and don't even deserve the love I have been shown by others. I don't want to feel like this but I can't help but blame myself for the way I feel and think, and the poor choices I have made. It feels like a chain that's with me all the time. 
I feel so scared of talking about this with anyone, I feel very alone and just needed to ask someone.

TL;DR I feel like I shouldn't be depressed but I am, so it makes me feel even worse
