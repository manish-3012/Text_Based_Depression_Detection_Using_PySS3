mind vomiti cant get a grip right now. life is bullshit. thereâ€™s no reason to be here. weâ€™re all just some cells hurting through space on a rock thinking weâ€™re important. maybe if i was another person i wouldnâ€™t care. i have nothing to distract me from the fact everything i do is meaningless. i could hurtle myself onto the pavement and the only change itâ€™d make would possibly scar some people who will eventually die, be forgotten about. iâ€™m fucking sick of enduring just to endure. because we â€œtake the good with the bad.â€ i wouldnâ€™t eat a cheesecake if i knew it was 90% shit, so why iâ€™m still living that analogy is just stupid.
