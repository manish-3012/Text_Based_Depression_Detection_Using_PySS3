How can I convince my friend her awful life is not her fault, and help her get everything back together?Long story short, she was in an abusive relationship, regularly raped by her ex-husband, before and after divorce. Had a miscarriage with their child, baby's death supposedly caused by a previous suicide attempt. Takes blame for marriage, for being raped, and for the miscarriage and wants to kill herself as she feels she deserves death for what she has done.

Since leaving her state she's lost an absurd amount of weight and weights under 100 pounds at 5 foot 7. Hasn't eaten in weeks, takes fat burners and whatever crazy supplements to destroy what remains of her body, and will not be convinced that she's doing something wrong here.

She attempted to kill herself last night and failed. I can't for the life of me get her to understand that being abused was not her fault, that she did not kill her child, and that she's destroying her body. I've been at this for more than a month and I'm running out of things to tell her.

Advice?
