It is all meaningless.Tomorrow I have to go to the job I hate to work for people i can't stand for a company that cares little less than shit about it's products. I feel physically sick when I think about my job. It isn't bad pay or horrible work conditions but it is morally questionable and pointless.

I can't just quit, if I quit my family would disown/throw me out and I am not stable enough at the moment to be able to go through a job application process. I have worked at my current place for far to long and have become part of the equipment.

I got out of a meaningless loveless relationship that lasted for 7 years, guess that kinda gave me perspective on how utterly futile life is. Also made the mistake to start talking with my ex after a mutual acquaintance guilt tripped me into it. Should never have done that. 

If I wouldn't be such a fucking pussy I would have killed myself ages ago. 


Every single fucking night I hope I don't wake up again. 

Sorry for bad English. 

Edit
Can't sleep, all I can think is that I want to die. Have to work up courage to go through with it.
