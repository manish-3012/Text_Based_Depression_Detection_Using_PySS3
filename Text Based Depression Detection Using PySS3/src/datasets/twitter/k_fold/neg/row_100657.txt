I really think I'm ready at this point.I don't know how I'll do it, and I'm not asking for advice on how to do it, of course. Probably the most painful way, because that's what I deserve.

But I can't fucking live like this anymore. I can't. I can't live a life where I am in pain all the time and nothing gets better because I am a defective model. I have tried every antidepressant, I have seen hundreds of doctors. I'm over it. I'm over everything. I'm not fixable. I'm damaged goods and I should have been tossed out a long time ago.

I give up. I officially give up. I will not make it to morning.
