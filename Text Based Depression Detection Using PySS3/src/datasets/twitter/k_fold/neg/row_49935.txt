I don't want to be here anymore ; I'm tired of livingI've just turned 16 and since i was 14 I've been dealing with depression and anxiety. The pain i feel constantly is unbearable and its too much for me to handle anymore. I live each day for my family because i don't want my parents to lose their only daughter and my brothers to lose their sister. However, I just can't carry on anymore. I'm sick and tired of pretending to be okay and putting on a brave face each day. No one has noticed that I'm not okay and that hurts so much. My arms are literally a bar code but the self harm doesn't feel the same anymore. I know i don't talk to anyone about my problems which doesn't help but its too difficult to. I don't want to bother people with my problems and sad low life ; and even if i was to finally open up 2 years later, its not like I'm gonna get better. I'm broken, useless, and irrelevant. There is no actual point of my life. 

I'm planning on ending it next week but I'm so scared it wont work. How is it i have to live with a life i don't want and live in pain, but not be able to leave it?
