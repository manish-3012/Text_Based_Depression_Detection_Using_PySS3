Lowest of the lowI'm a damn failure. I'm a high school student applying to college. Not a single damn college I'm applying to will accept me. I'm not even going for the good ones, just regular state universities. I guess I'm just an idiot. I used to have straight As all through middle school, and used to be in the talented program, with all advanced classes. Now, I can barely break a C in an on level class. My dreams of doing anything with my life since I was a kid has been destroyed. I completely and utterly loathe myself, and I feel like just a burden on society. I'm pretty sure that all my family don't care either. I've been certain that I'll be dead by the end of this semester. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I have goddamn voices even telling me to do it. I'm really tired of this crap. I'm an atheist, so I don't believe in an afterlife. I just want to be in a place where I don't have to deal with myself ever again. My relatives have such high expectations for me. Some of my uncles have gotten scholarships to Princeton and Harvard. That just shows you how low I am compared to them. I know I will never amount to anything, and I'm wondering why I continue to waste oxygen. I've been given so many opportunities, and I've wasted them all.
