I hate people who "advocate" for recovery but tell others to seek help as an insult.I don't understand how you'd call me a delusional idiot when I try to call out you on hurtful shit you did to me then tell me to "genuinely seek fucking help"

You might as well tell me to kill myself if you're gonna gaslight and insult me like that. I don't need that kind of help. I should've killed myself back in august instead of sticking around for you since you never actually cared about me anyway.
