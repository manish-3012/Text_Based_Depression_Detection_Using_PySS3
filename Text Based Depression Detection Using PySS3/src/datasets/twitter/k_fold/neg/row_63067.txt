so sick of hating myself, don't know what to dohi. last year when i had turned 24 i went through a period of serious anxiety where i was convinced that i was aging poorly. i would inspect and obsess over minor changes in my face with time, documenting them through digital cameras and getting seriously distraught by any potential major changes. i tried everything - a skincare routine, face exercise, home dermarolling, acupuncture, etc. - but they haven't really changed any of my flaws and in fact have made them worse. a big thing i feared was small dimples on my forehead that i felt made me look neanderthalesque and angry.

after cbt i would keep hoping to one day be able to bring my face back to the way it was but i was okay with dealing with things for now and i wasn't too upset about the change of pace. then i started noticing my tear troughs and the obsessiveness came back again and i ended up stretching my nasolabial depressions and my tear troughs. i was so torn up about it but tried to think of the positive side - that with a good diet and decent skincare, it might go back to normal. i got all the hydrating lotions from kiehls for christmas and while it made my skin look nice it didn't change my damaged features and i got really upset about it and decided to buy an electric facial toner off of amazon.

now i just used that and it isn't changing anything. i keep worrying about shit that i have done in the past and feeling that i will always be this ugly forever makes it feel so much worse. my friends and family say that i look fine but i know my own face best and know that i look dreadful compared to most people i know. i am just tired of going through day by day wanting to get on with my life and constantly examining and hating myself because i will never look normal again. i just want to put an end to it or escape from it.
