Sometimes it never gets better but try to avoid this before itâ€™s too lateImagine yourself in a situation that you canâ€™t decide which one is easier, keep living in a situation killing you slowly or committing suicide. 
First Iâ€™m gonna explain my life. Iâ€™m in a country that Iâ€™m not a citizen in and because of that I have no rights to stay or to get a job or to do anything. I ran from my own country because I got raped, humiliated, beaten, threatened. My family said I needed to get help from a psychiatrist/psychologist or whatever and I needed to be cured because of being gay. Nobody gave me a job, my family didnâ€™t support me emotionally or financially, once police officers came to my home because neighbors complained about me being gay, I got beaten by some people four times, my cousin and my brother abused me dozens of times when I was kid, I got kicked off from some restaurants, hairdressers, markets many times, got raped three times, and so on. So thatâ€™s why I came to this other country and I asked for help, I went to many organizations, I talked with many people. Nobody can do anything right now and I try to survive by doing some things that I donâ€™t wanna do. I slept with guys to eat and stay with them. And now I canâ€™t do it because of some reasons. There is an organization and they told me they can help me in 2 months, but I only have one week to stay in the place that Iâ€™m staying and also I have no money. I donâ€™t have anything atm except my phone and some clothes. I sold my other stuff to buy some medicines and food. I was saying â€œat least Iâ€™m alive and nobody is telling me I need to kill myselfâ€. It didnâ€™t last long. I just wanna die and escape from everything but I am not dying... I am thinking of killing myself but Iâ€™m afraid to do it and I donâ€™t wanna suffer while Iâ€™m dying. I just wanna die instantly. But itâ€™s not happening. People say I should think about the things what I got or killing myself is not a solution. I donâ€™t want a solution, I just wanna relieve and get rid of all these things. And also I donâ€™t have anything to lose. No family, no friends, no job, no money. Anything. I donâ€™t even have hope. Whatâ€™s gonna happen? Am I gonna find my place in this world and people whoâ€™re gonna be my family? Maybe, but I just have one week to find these. So Iâ€™m waiting for a miracle. Anyways, Iâ€™m writing this because I know there are a lot of people like me, even worse, but if youâ€™re reading this and if your life is getting worse, please try to find help and hope. I wasnâ€™t expecting to be in this situation, but here we are. Always try to have backup plans, never forget that everything is possible. Even I canâ€™t believe that Iâ€™m living this. Just be happy and make plans, if they donâ€™t happen, make another one. Live the moment but never forget yoir future. There are millions of good people, I couldnâ€™t find one because I didnâ€™t have enough time and couldnâ€™t search enough. But you have time, please find them! Everything is gonna be fine, youâ€™ll be fine.
