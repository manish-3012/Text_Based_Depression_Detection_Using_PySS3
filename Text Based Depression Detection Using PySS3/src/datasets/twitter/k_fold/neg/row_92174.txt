Sick and not getting better. Not about to do anything because I don't want to hurt the few people around me but life really let me down...and I wish I could dig my way out or felt like I wasn't just a burdenToo sick to work, doctors can't figure out what it is so its not like I can get any type of disability. Most get angry and say I must be making it up. Family just gave up on me and I basically live in a room too tired to do much of anything - basically I feel like a child going on 30 with maybe five people and some cats who even remember I exist. Never been good with people but when you're sick all the time, have no money and can't drive it reaches a place of basically isolation. 

I have a couple friends helping me and it means the world but I feel so guilty, have nightmares about how much of a burden I am. My family basically vanished and talks to me once a month at most despite me trying to reach out. They're angry I had to drop out of college - I was about to go to medical school, ironic. Now I'm too tired to get up in the morning and have migraines every other day. Nothing is getting better. I have 15 dollars in the bank and no income - I don't want to hurt anyone but everything I've ever cared about feels like it was stripped away from me. 

I just wish I knew this wasn't forever. It's been six years and nothing is getting better.
