I'm ready to end it.My life has been falling apart for months. My sister is successful. My best friend is successful. My life is trash. I can't hold a job. I can't hold friends. Hell my family is falling apart.

I have no money, have a shit car. My girlfriend went off to college 2 weeks ago and she just decided to end our relationship because it wasn't working for her. No matter what i said she blew everything off. Yesterday my dad choked me out in the ground and I went to the police. Charges weren't filed and my own mother wouldn't believe a word i said. A family friend who witnessed it completely refuted my story. I got forced out of my home.

Every day has been something else fucking me up. I can't think straight. I can't sleep. Barely eat. I went to a therapist and that did fuck all. Im crumbling. I'm ready to drive my self into a brick wall and never look back. I don't want to breathe. I don't want to talk. I'm ready to end it. I have no other way out. I accept death. I beg for it, plead for it every day. I can't go on like this anymore.
