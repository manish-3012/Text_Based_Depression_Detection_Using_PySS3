I'm suicidal, I know it, but I'm too afraid of being committed to ask for help. What do I do?I go throughout my day for the past five years switching between states. At first I'm tired, apathetic, coldly logical, and firmly believe that there is nothing on this earth I want to experience. The other state is one of intense anger and emotional pain in which I'm actively screaming down the walls and banging my head against the door to just make it stop for the love of God. But I still have reservations, if only because I know it would hurt my loved ones. 

On the other hand, I am an inherently violent and destructive person. Being committed, having my clothes taken, being restrained, and possibly forced to take meds to which I don't consent would drive me over the edge to hunting down and killing those I've perceived as having wronged me. 

So I don't really know how to use the system without it blowing up in my face.
