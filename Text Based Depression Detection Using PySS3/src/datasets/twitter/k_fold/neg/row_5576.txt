a waste of lifeI'll admit I was a smarter and prettier girl when I was younger. I was one of those that could turn heads. I didn't know what I had. I'm the only sibling in my family that was a mistake. My parents thought of me as the golden one back then and a good mistake but now I can see that they're disappointed at what I've become. I didn't realise how mentally fucking it was for my sister at that time but now its her turn to shine, she's the pretty one now. She's become more confident and mean now. It' s a vicious cycle. One of us has to take the sacrifice. I wish my parents accepted the abortion. I'm going to suicide I'm not sure when but it'll happen and I can't get talked out of it. I just wanted someone to hear my story. I don't have the motivation to go study or invest in a hobby or make an achievement.
I lived off my looks and now I got nothing left. Girls who were jealous of me are now happy I'm ugly.
