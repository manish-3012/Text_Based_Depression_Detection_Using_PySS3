What do i even do anymore
I'm drunk. Im bleeding. I'm lonely. Its all my fault.

I've been dealing with heavy depression and self harm for the past few months and my friends have left me. I know its all my fault. They've reached out and all I've done is push them away. Its not their responsibility for my mental health I know it's all my fault for pushing them away. They reached out and I pushed them away.

Now I have no one left.

My best friend doesnt even want to see me anymore. My friend group gangs out without me and doesn't tell me anymore. There was a birthday celebration and no one told me. I found out about it and decided against coming, if I wasn't invited then Ill respect that.

Im so lost. I pushed everyone away and its all my fault. I don't want to live like this anymore.
