HelpI want to kill myself. Itâ€™s that simple, no backstory needed. I have a relatively good life, outside of home. Now I have to stay with them and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I wanted to before, and now I canâ€™t think of anything else. Are there any painless, guaranteed methods of killing myself? The closest thing I have are pills but all we have is fucking B-12 Vitamins for my mom, which are water-soluble so I couldnâ€™t off myself, just give myself hangover-like symptoms.
