My aunt got arrested for dealing 10 kilograms of heroin and I am pretty sure she will get death penalty in my country. I was already depressed. Now I am even more depressedI am devastated. She was the only one who helped me by taking me to the hospital when I was 16. I usually visited her and we talked a lot. I just got the news, I don't know how to feel about this. We are in a 3rd world country (southeast asia) and dealing more than 600 gram of heroin will get you death penalty. I was already depressed. Now I am even more. It's Lunar new year and I am devastated, truly devastated. Not only that happened, 2 days ago my mom's aunt died. And today we got another bad news, my mom almost got a heart attack when she heard her little sister would get death penalty. I didnt even know she was a drug dealer till today.

3 years ago on lunar new Year my great grandma was dead and I loved her so much. Every new year is so unlucky for us. I am so done with life.
