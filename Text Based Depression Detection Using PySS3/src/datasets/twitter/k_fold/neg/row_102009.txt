I can't stand life even thought I'm privilegedGood parents, good friends, middle class, good grades without making an effort. I'm just a teen with a good life yet I feel so hopeless and I want to die so bad. The only reason I haven't killed myself It's because I'm worried about my mom and my best friend, they're both mentally ill and I know about the Werther Effect. I've never been happy, always the jealous creppy, violent, sad girl. I was diagnosed with Major Depression in November, I'm going to therapy but It's not enough.

I cry over nothing, I scream or get violent over nothing, I can't stand myself, I feel like shit because my friends and parents are so sweet and understanding and I'm cruel and awful.

I already tried to kill myself before and can't stop thinking about doing it again. 

Sorry for my bad English I'm Mexican.
