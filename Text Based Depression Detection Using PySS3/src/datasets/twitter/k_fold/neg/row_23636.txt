Update: Talk to me pleaseI'm still here. I talked to some people on here last night...via PM...and another friend. I had left home. Left my kids. I came back home. 

I don't feel any better. I dreaded waking up today. I dreaded being alone tonight with my kids. I was scared. I called my therapist. He wanted me to come in. I didn't. I know i should have. I didn't. I can't really do anything. Once again, not making sense, I know. My husband took the kids out of the house for a while. Won't lie...the opportunity to end my life was right there. I wanted it. Was tempted. I craved it. Instead, I laid on the couch and slept. I was questioned later about why I didn't do my normal things...computer, eat lunch, things around the house...so on. I just...couldn't. I begged him not to go to work. I pleaded..I cried. He went. Once again, I'm back where I was last night. I want it **so badly**. :'(
