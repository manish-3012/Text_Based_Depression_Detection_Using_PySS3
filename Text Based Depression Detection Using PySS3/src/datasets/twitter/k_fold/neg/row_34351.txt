I wrote my suicide note and a note about caring for my hamster.I felt guilty writing both. I phoned the Samaritans last week and the man was nice. It isn't the world's niceness that is the problem, it is the pain.

I first tried to die when I was 12 or 13. I got into the bath fully clothed and had a note on the side. I cut my wrists and thought I'd bleed out in the warm water. It got redder and redder but I didn't die. I had to get out, patch up the wounds, and go to school the next day with no homework done.

After that, I took several big overdoses, but I always threw up in the night and lived. No one ever found out. I always took myself off alone.

I cut a vein once but it didn't bleed enough. My arms, legs and stomach were filled with white scars by the time I was 18. I quit at some point. 

I stood on the edge of buildings in my school uniform daring myself to jump. 

I crashed a car at 20 and got out alive. I felt cursed. That was my trump card, that one had to work. 

More overdoses. Different pills. Illicit drug overdoses. I kept waking up in my bed, covered in sick.

I last tried to die in March. I went to hospital this time. I fucked my heart rhythm up, but it came back.

I have bipolar disorder and when I'm depressed all I want to do is die to stop the feeling. Or stop the numbness. But generally it just hurts.

I'm nearly 28. I want to hang myself. But when I make the noose and tighten it I freak out.

Yet I lay in bed with a man last night, and I was happy for a little while. He has no idea. And unfortunately I think I have feelings for him, which is why I've become depressed. Because it reminds me of all the rest.

Has anyone noticed that men have this shadow of an ex following them? You're never that girl. You're always after the big love. There's nothing for me left. I am nice but I am nothing really. Just someone to fuck and move on from. I can lie in his arms and feel happy. But he just wants her back.
