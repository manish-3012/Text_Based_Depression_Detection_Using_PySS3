I think I'm a failureI suppose I've felt this way my whole life. My dad was emotionally abusive, and a pill addict, so I never had any chance to connect with him. My parents split up about 3 years ago, and he went into a spiralling depression, I don't think he's gotten over. 


I recently rekindled a friendship with a girl that I was really close to in middle school. She's everything I've wanted in a friend. Compassionate, funny, smart, and open about her issues. She got out of a relationship a couple weeks before we started talking. I'm not strong enough to understand the difference between friendship and a relationship. We got drunk one night, and things got hot and heavy. I thought I fell in love again. We kept hanging out almost every day for a month. She made me happy. Truly happy for the first time in years. I fucked everything up. Like I always fucking do... 


I thought we had something meaningful. She talked to me about her problems, and I mine. I wanted to just hold her until my arms fell off. That's me. How I've always been. Falling in love too quick, and driving those I love away because of it. I've done it so many times in the past with friends. 


I get too god damn clingy, and it annoys them. I hate myself so much, that I feel the only time I'm truly happy is when I don't have to think about myself, when I can just get lost with other people. 


I can feel that she doesn't feel the way I feel. I know she isn't in love with me, and this shit sucks. It makes me feel like a piece of shit because I shouldn't feel entitled to anything from the world. It's not mine for the taking. I am its. 


I don't want to die because a girl doesn't love me. I want to die because I don't love me. And I'm afraid I never will.
