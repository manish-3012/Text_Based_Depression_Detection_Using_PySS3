I can't exist like thisI'm not sure where to start so I'll just hang to my flow of thoughts.
I've been having suicidal thoughts for 2 years now and at first they only came to me when i realized that everyone will eventually die and be forgotten along with anything that person done throughout life. Hovewer after some time it supplemented with more than just that. Every morning I wake up with terrible anxiety inside me, it feels as though something is carring me down and I can't even sit or lay still.
I've got a lot of diagnoses which make my life harder both mentally and physically. They've started to appear ever since maternity hosptial where I almost died at 21st day of my life due to unsanitary conditions.
I am almost 20, my birthday is in couple of hours and all i feel is how i burden the life of my parents and relatives. They only thing i feel towards them is respect for putting up with me and my mood but nothing more.
I am finishing my bacÑalaureate in a month and I don't know what to do next, I've got no interests, no hobbies, no one to be loved by, not a thing that i would want or desire.
I even don't want to bother my friends cause I think they are tired of hearing about how I want to end myself and my depression in general.
I tried to get a job a couple of times but never got past job interview.
I often think about things that occur in life in general and I think I don't understand most of human behaviours. I have existential crisis and I can't determine my value of existense at all. 
I never feel confident about myself because my parents never listen to what i have to say to any of the subjects even if I'm the only one that actually understand what is it about, and I never felt succesful in my entire life. I don't want to live a life working only to exist and exist only to work. I don't want to live a life where I constantly feel uncomfortable about my own existense and hate it. I don't want to feel as though I am all alone and no one to turn to. And I don't think I have the strength to end it all either. I feel close to shutting from the world and everyone I know and I don't think I can stop it. I often hear two or sometimes three voices in my head and I think I'm going crazy. I don't want to carry on like this, it's unbearable.
