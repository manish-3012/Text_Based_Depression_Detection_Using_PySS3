Excruciatingly lonely and want to die?Iâ€™m so lonely. All the friends I make leave me, all of the guys I want to date leave me. I just want one person to stick around and love me for me. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a bad person Iâ€™m loving, caring, passionate, creative, unique. But everyone seems to hate me, seems to be jealous of me, wants the worst for me. I feel like Iâ€™m cursed. Nothing works out for me. I spend days on days alone in my room by myself because I have no one to hang out with. The most Iâ€™ll do is go outside for a cigarette or to get food. I feel pathetic and ugly. I donâ€™t know where my life is going and Iâ€™ve disappointed my parents massively. Itâ€™s pointless to live honestly
