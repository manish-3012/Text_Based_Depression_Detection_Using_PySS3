I want to watch the sunset and OD on the beach.This is the worst day I've had in a long time. I see no future. Everyday I feel like I'm getting worse. I talk to myself a lot. Got caught at work, just started, now people are keeping their distance. 

I feel like maybe it's always been like that, aways on the outside looking in. I don't really have people. I don't know what's wrong with me but it's not gotten better.
