I've been working myself up to do itI have my notes typed out and I have a plan. I've been working up to it. I wanna make sure I could do it if I had to.

I open up the folder on my computer containing the notes and I maximize the window. I walk over to my closet and I wrap the belt around my neck, lifting it upwards. I start fading out but just before I pass out I let go. I don't know if I will ever do it. I've never been at the point where if I felt I needed to I could. Now I'm at that point.

It feels freeing and yet now I'm all the more trapped

I'm not sure what to do.

I don't know if I can stop it.
