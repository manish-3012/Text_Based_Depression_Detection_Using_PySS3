nightmaresit's two am and i'm wide awake. i'm drenched in sweat and my fingers feel stiff as i type. 

i had a nightmare. a repressed memory from my first attempt.

i woke up convulsing, saliva slicked down my neck. my torso was strapped down to the hospital bed and my arm was heavy from the tubes stuck in them. i swung my neck around and screamed straining against the straps, terrified. i didn't know if this was hell or reality, or which one was worse. i envisioned ripping the world in half, i was so goddamn angry. my throat hurt. nurses rushed in my room moving too fast for me to process. in my room the wall was made of glass, so i could see everything going on outside and fixated on that instead. my mom was sobbing in a chair. my dad was arguing with a nurse as narcissistically as ever. the nurses's station was behind my parents and around them were other rooms. a girl maybe a year or two younger than me stared at me with fear in her eyes until some adults drew the curtains. a nurse drew my room's curtains and everything went black. 

my body went limp. 'i'm still in hell'. 

my dog is dozing next to me now. he never did that before. he'd stay by the door all night. there's a hole in my wall from a panic attack and a stuffed bear a little girl gave me for christmas what feels like years ago. everything is two-dimensional because three-dimensional life is overwhelming. i don't feel anything. fight or flight? i've never actually done either. live or die? which one will do the most damage? no. the way i was raised, the only thing i learned was freeze. that's what i've been doing for so long and my muscles ache, they ache so bad.
