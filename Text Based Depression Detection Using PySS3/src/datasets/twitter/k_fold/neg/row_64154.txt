I've been fighting against itIve been fighting against thoughts of suicide but they still creep in. Im 32f Ive had this problem since age 14 and it has subsided in the past- its not like the last 18 years have been 100% horrible. But it comes and goes. I had my first child, born 8 months ago and my depression has worsened (despite mediccine for ppd) and I fear with all my heart of telling anyone because Im afraid they could take away my baby. Im not going to hurt myself and I have no tendencies such as, you know, like having a plan or anything, I just hate to have these thoughts.
