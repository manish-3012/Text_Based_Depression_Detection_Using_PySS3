I quit my jobI got a job at best buy, worked for four days, hated it, (no training and co workers too impatient) and am going to apply for some grocery stores or even just go back to mcds. At least that was easy, I don't have time for a massive learning curve. I need money. But if my family (and by that I mean parents AND siblings) find out, they will be furious. Even though I'm only doing whats best for me. I know its quitting but I was overextending myself with that job. Did I make the right decision?
