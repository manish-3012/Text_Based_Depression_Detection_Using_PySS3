I'm fighting a giant war, but no one knows.I'm going through so much right now, I can barely even function properly, but to everyone else it just seems like I'm lazy. I wish I had some time to address my mental problems and try to understand them and figure all of this out, but there's too much pressure.

Life sucks.
