I want outCouple weeks ago i made an attempt which quite obviously didn't work, i never managed to go through with the last part of it and well my partner wasn't very supportive with the situation. Since then ive been trying to get some form of help after been passed from one place to another and being left in the dark i finally got some sort of help. Ive still had thoughts on and off but i feel like im now slipping back towards those thoughts all over again. Last few days its been every day.  
Everything has just gone to shit these last few weeks, i can't get energy or motivation to do anything much, it takes massive strain going to appointments, i spend most of the day in bed or asleep if i can just so i can forget life. My memories feel fake, i don't look forward to anything in the future and present nothing at all interests me, i feel trapped here and now. Only thing keeping me going was work and i started breaking down at work and have had to take time off, so now i have nothing, nothing at all.  
I have nothing to keep me here, i want to od again but make sure i do a better job of it this time. I can't get the thought out of my head no matter what, i already have the means to take them, its just a case of when.
