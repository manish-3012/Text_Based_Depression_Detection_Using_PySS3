Was writing my letters and prepping the rope when the drugs kicked in.I've made a few posts before. Same suicidal bullshit. My therapist doesn't see how miserable I am. Even when I mentioned my own death. I am all alone. I want this. Everything I've strived for or wanted is gone, taken away. I can't keep fighting anymore. 

I keep having this sick fuck delusion where everything went right and I'm happy. It hurts me more than anything. I'm waiting for the lifeline chat to come through. Apparently, there are lots of people wanting to die tonight.
