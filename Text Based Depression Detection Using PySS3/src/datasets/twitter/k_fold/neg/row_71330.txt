Just need someone who knowsRight now I'm giving myself no more than two weeks, I've been only getting worse lately and I don't think I can handle it any longer, I feel like my own body doesn't belong to me and everything I have could've been used so much better by anyone else who somehow can deal with how it all is. On one hand I want to live and experience what I can have living on my own which I really long for, on the other I just feel this strong urge and desire to end it, the very thoought of it feels so peaceful, like a happy ending. Everyone around me thinks that i's enough to "change the way I think", they say it's all my fault, blame me for everything I feel, they don't understand that I've been trying for years now, did all I could to keep trying and going forward and I just can't anymore, it'd be so much easier if they just... stopped saying that, let me sort things out on my own, but now it's not yet possible and I won't be able to wait long enough.

I think I just need someone who understands and knows how does it feel like and that "being positive" doesn't change shit, either that or I'll just ask to be locked up in a hospital, I just want someone to help me after all this time, part of me doesn't want to just die...
