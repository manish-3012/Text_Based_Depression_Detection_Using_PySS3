Iâ€™m so scared about graduating highschool and facing the future that Iâ€™ve constantly been considering suicide.The title says it all. I am going graduate highschool this year and itâ€™s so scary. It brings out all fears of future like the scary idea of the possibilities of the future like leaving my parents behind, climate change, and well all other terrible thing that could happen. 

And thus Iâ€™ve just constantly been thinking about ending my life so that I donâ€™t have to deal with anything about the future.
