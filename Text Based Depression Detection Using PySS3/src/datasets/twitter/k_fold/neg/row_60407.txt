Why hasn't anyone called me out on my bullshitLike seriously, I'm the worst. I have never even been close to having a gf or any real friends, I do basically nothing all day and I have no discernible skills. Why do people insist on me being alive. Why haven't I been executed for my failures. There's gotta be a way I can trade my life for someone else's. Someone battling an aggressive form of cancer would surely be more deserving of this precious gift of life, a life that I had a one in a billion chance in obtaining. I am wasting my precious existence by being a burden to others and not fitting into the mould that I'm supposed to fit into. I'm so drunk rn, can someone euthanize me
