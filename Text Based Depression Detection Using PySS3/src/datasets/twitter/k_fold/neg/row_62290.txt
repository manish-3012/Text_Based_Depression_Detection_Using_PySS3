My libido is goneThis might be a stupid reason for being suicidal but my libido was preventing me from committing suicide and it made me feel "normal". I have chronic health issues but I was never too worried because at least I had a high libido. Then a few weeks ago after taking antibiotics for a bad sinus infection my libido DIED. It's totally gone. There is no feeling down there and it feels like I have to pee all the time. I'm going to the obgyn next week but she'll probably say there's nothing wrong, just like they all do.

Fuck my health. I haven't exercised properly in years. My low libido. Stupid fucking healthy people without a care in the world. FUCK. YOU. I HATE THIS FUCKING LIFE. I HAVE TRIED SO HARD AND FOR WHAT? NOTHING. FUCK FEELING THIS WAY AND FUCK THE WORLD. WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER FOR THE SAKE OF OTHERS. WHY DO OTHER PEOPLE GET TO BE HEALTHY BUT I DON'T. I ALWAYS HAVE TO TRY 10X HARDER THAN MOST FUCKING PEOPLE JUST TO FUNCTION
