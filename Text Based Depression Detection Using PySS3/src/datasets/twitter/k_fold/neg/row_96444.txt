My friend is going to do it and is researching methods on reddit....What should I do?I'm his roommate and I'm worried I'm about to lose him. He always thought lowly of himself and being not good enough to live up the standards his family set and now he's going to take his life..he's been rambling on about how everybody should have the right to die and people who feel like life is meaningless need the facilities to kill themselves painlessly for more than a month now, and clearly his mental health is taking a toll on him. I don't know what to do, nothing I say will help and he's disguising his question on methods as "just for knowledge".  I don't want to lose a good friend.
