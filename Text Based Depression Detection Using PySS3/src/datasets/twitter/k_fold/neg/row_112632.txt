IdkSo, my ex and I broke up like 2 or 3 months ago, we're still friends, were friends
He just said that I'm dead to him, that it would be better if I'm not here anymore
He knows I'm not okay
It's been a shitty year, a shitty life, I'm just utterly alone
I just can't take it anymore, maybe I should just make his wish come true.
