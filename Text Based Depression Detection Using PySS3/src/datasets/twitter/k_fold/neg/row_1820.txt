I accidentally stabbed myself todaySometimes I like to play around with the kitchen knives. Pretend like I'm actually gonna go through with it and stab myself. But ive always been under the assumption they weren't very sharp. They're old and well used. Except today, when I held one of the pairing knives up to my pants to give myself a little prick like I had done many times prior, the entire knive went in. 

There's a lot of blood and it stings, but I think I'm off the Suicide Watch wagon for a bit.
