Hate my lifeGod I hate that I am stuck with the most passive aggressive, emotionally manipulative parent of all time. Who constantly talks about how I have a horrible sister. Who always has to talk down to me to assert this dominance as an authority, but still have the benefits of being of being her â€œbest friendâ€ because sheâ€™s chosen to not have any other facets in her life to make her happy. I canâ€™t fucking wait for it to be my 21st birthday so I can just fucking buy a gun to shoot my fucking brains out. Every day I go through the exact process of driving to the exact shop where I would buy a handgun, go through a background check, and walk out with it. Then, I would fucking go home, and just blow my fucking brains out in my driveway for her or the neighbors to find me. God, I donâ€™t know how long I can wait until I just find some other alternative. Iâ€™m losing my fucking mind in here. I need to fucking kill myself as soon as possible. Fuck I hate my life so much. My body aches for me to die. I just want to rip out all of my insides. I want to just fucking claw away at myself until I fucking lose consciousness.
