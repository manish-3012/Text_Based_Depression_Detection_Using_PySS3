I feel like it's just better for everyone in my life if i just killed myselfI've been depressed since my early teen years. A lot of people on this sub talk about how they've been abused or how they are in a bad situation. That's not my case, my life is relatively good, I've never been abused by my family or anyone else (I have been bullied at school but I guess everyone goes through that at some point), I'm in a decent financial situation and I have really good and supportive friends. That is why i feel like I'm just a spoiled cunt for not being happy. The reason I'm depressed is because I feel like I don't deserve love or happiness. I feel like I am nothing more than a parasite and a burden to all the people in my life. I hate myself, I could be so much better but i don't do anything about it, I mean I do have full control over my actions but I'm still such a piece of shit. I don't know why my friends think I'm a good person, I'm incredibly selfish and even when I'm supposed to do the right thing I'm either too lazy or just don't care. I tried so hard to change my ways but I'm still such a piece of shit which returns me to this endless cycle of despair. I feel like it would be better if I just killed myself. Sure people in my life would be sad for a while, but I would be doing them a favor in the long run.
