I can't do this anymoreI don't want to be in this life anymore. I don't have any money. I have debts that will take me a long time to pay off. I'm the black sheep on both sides of my family but I'm forced to take care of my mother because she has a rare disease. I have been sexually assaulted more than I would like to admit. Therapy and medications aren't working. I'm keeping secrets that could potentially ruin relationships. I have thought about running the car in a closed garage multiple times. I have thought about self-harming countless times. I have thought about overdosing on prescription pills with alcohol.  I am a nobody and I will die a nobody.  For the life of me, I can't think of anybody who will show up to my funeral. That's how alone I am.
