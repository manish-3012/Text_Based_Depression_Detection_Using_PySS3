Impossible to stop thinking about dyingI won't bother you with all the shit that led to this because i tried that and no one gives a fuck, understandable tho.

I can't stop thinking about killing myself, i just want everything to end, i have literally no one left that cares even the slightest about me, family too.
I don't want to end my life as i know it could get better but I'm at a point at which I don't give a fuck anymore. I've accomplished everything i wanted in life but having kids, so with all the shit that's piled up on top of my shoulders i don't think that i did too bad.
I don't want to do this, i really don't but there's absolutely no way out of this loop i got into, hell even therapists looked at me and didn't know what to say, instead i got pills which just make me want to jump under a train.

Don't let yourselves be left without a single person in your life, you'll end up like this, and it's horrible.

I guess I'm gonna look into the best way of doing this, I'm out of energy to fight that urge. So much frustration that it's impossible to handle, thoughts about ending it come involuntarily...

Any quick ways of doing it without making a mess?
