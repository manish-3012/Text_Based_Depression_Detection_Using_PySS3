I will overdose tonight.I will. I will. I will overdose tonight.

I am just 'around' in people's lives. They do not want me. It is not a big deal if I'm gone. I don't want me. Maybe somebody in this world will read this and not do what I did.

I let something good go. I went for something unconventional, and different. Different can't love me. Different can't have feelings for me. Different says 'I love you' out of an obligation. Different says how terrible I am, how everything is my fault. I tell different to go, because I am too weak to leave. I am too weak to be by myself. I need any little bit of affection I can. Different will not give it. Different will not leave. Different continues to tell me everything I've done wrong. Different is right. Different always wants to be right. Different will move on. Different will be okay. Different will hardly remember me. Different will move on. Different will be okay. Different will continue with its life. Different will be free. Different won't have an obligation. Different won't feel 'tied down'. Different won't be embarrassed about me. Different won't need me to depend on it. Different blames me. I believe you different. You are immune. You don't do anything wrong. 

Thank you for pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing, pushing. It broke. It shattered. I broke. I shattered. 

I can't live. I can't escape. I can control this.

Please don't do what I'm about to do.
