I'm just so exhausted from life...sigh...I never thought of myself as suicidal but I can't say I never thought of it before. Often I think about it and the ways I could do it but I don't have any kind of courage to put it in action obviously cause i'm so pathetic. I'm not just exhausted in a sense of needing sleep, I feel life is draining me and being alive is such a chore now. I sometimes wish I have courage.
