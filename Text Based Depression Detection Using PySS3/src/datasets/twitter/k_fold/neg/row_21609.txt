I donâ€™t want to do this to those I loveTonight I contemplated leaving, but I couldnâ€™t bring myself to hurt my husband and my mom. Google tells me the best thing to do is to distract myself, so I let my hand draw whatever it pleases and this is [what I ended up with.](https://ang33ya.tumblr.com/post/621247146370465792) I think it sums it up pretty well.. Melting? Fading? Disappearing? I wish those I love can just forget I ever existed so the void can engulf my being... 

Medical school taught me very well how to fool others into thinking Iâ€™m perfectly OK. And I know the treatment plan, and that itâ€™s unlikely to work. I also know the consequence of attempting, thatâ€™s why it remains a thought but not an attempt (and irl I will never admit to it). Being a smartypants patient really sucks. There are things that bring me joy. There are people who love me dearly. But it doesnâ€™t make the thought of wanting to disappear any less intrusive. In all honesty Iâ€™m just fed up living in fear and regret.

Priority is to learn how to live with myself. For now itâ€™s one day at a time. Even if it means to â€œwaste my lifeâ€ distracting myself. After all the alternative is irreversible. And Iâ€™ve seen death too many times to know itâ€™s not poetic or fun.
