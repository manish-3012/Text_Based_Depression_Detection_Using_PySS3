My parents said to me that I should commit suicide. I try to ignore this, but I apparently cant.They are absolutely narcissistic and my family is completely destroyed and with no love between any members. They are utterly cruel and I am already in terms with that.

But, although all my friends who know me intimately say the opposite, and I am already aware that I unfortunately cant count with the parents for nothing, listening to this deeply affected me.

I feel alone listening to this, completely without support in life. I just want my parents to like me so badly.

I try to forget this. But I cant.
