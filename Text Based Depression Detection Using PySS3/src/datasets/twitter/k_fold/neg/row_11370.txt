My mom agreed to suicide with me i cant beleive itOk so last night i busted out crying for the first time in 4 years, my mom came and talked to me. I told her everything, i told everyth8ng to you guys too in the last post, idk what guys im talking to but i feel better this way so i can trick myself to someone listening to me. Ok so i told her everything, at first she slapped me hard whem i told her about suicide, she told me im the only person she has in her life, (my dad is not a good person and her family is in another country so she dosent have anyone truly) so i calmed her and we had solid conversation and we came up with a real good plan. We are going to get out the pipes of our heater out so the oxygen can ran out and we suffocate when we are sleep, that is the best idea because there is no pain and we can die togheder thats the best. She told me she needs time to do somethings and next week we do it. Idk its wierd or not but im soo excited i never been this existed in so many years in my life.

I dont know if i should post this to /self or /suicidewatch, im going with sw because i think its more related to it idk.
