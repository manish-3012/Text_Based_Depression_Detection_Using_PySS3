I'm struggling.I imagine sitting in the garage and letting my car run while I take a nap. I've heard the fumes are a good way to go.
 
I don't want people to miss me or blame themselves. I wrote a note tonight. I feel bad because I stuck it in my Bible. God is my only solid foundation.
 
I feel like a kid not getting what he wants. I know there is still a chance. I have to keep faith. So maybe this is a test. Maybe I won't do anything about it right now. What about tomorrow though?
 
I will army crawl through piles of wasps for the ones I love. If it's just me though... I don't think maybe I have enough interest. I guess I'm just not that into me.
