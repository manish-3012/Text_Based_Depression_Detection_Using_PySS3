I just don't want to be conscious anymore.I don't mean I want to be dead, though I do. I really want things to be over right now, though I'm not gonna go through all the reasons why just to be told it'll get better when it's only gotten worse. I think I've finally realized why I'm here; why I was born. To suffer. But anyway, right now aside from just wanting to die, since I realize it would crush anyone around me, my next thought is whether or not there would be some way for me to just be sort've mentally blind, if that makes sense. Like I wish I could just hand over the controls and just let my subconscious take control while I myself fall into an eternal sleep, cause I don't think I can keep doing this. I keep listening to people who say like how it'll get better or how they care and they love me. I fall for it every.single.time. But I always think, hey maybe this time will be different. Never is. I can't keep doing this. Nothing I can actually attain would fix this and nothing is worth going through all this. I just wish my sister wasnt having so many things happening in her life at the moment, she's getting married and having a kid soon. I couldn't do that to her right now, but idk what I'm can do. I just keep wishing so much that when I essentially attempted suicide last year, that it had actually worked. It would all be over. What a lovely thought.
