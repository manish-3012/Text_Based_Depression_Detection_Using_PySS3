What if I've tried talking?What do I do when I've tried talking to people, and no one seems to really care? What then? Do I start writing my notes and such? Do I still continue trying? Because I'd much rather die with family and friends being oblivious to it, but atleast being there, rather than aware of it, but sick of hearing about it
