:') V2I posted just yesterday about my grandfather being hospitalized, and If he died, I'd go with him. Well, he died, and for a while, I felt strong enough to deal with it. But now I feel afraid. I don't want to live in a world without him and I don't want to face the emotional/financial fallout that's going to come with it.

I'm sorry, I tried being strong. But I'm just not strong enough. If fear doesn't take over this time, I might end up offing myself tonight and I just want to apologize to those who tried to help me.
