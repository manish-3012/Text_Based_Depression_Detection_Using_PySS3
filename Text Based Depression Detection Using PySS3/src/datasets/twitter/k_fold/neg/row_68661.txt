21F. Junior doctor. I always do everything wrong and become a burden for everyone.I feel im only a burden to my other partners. I never do anything right and make everything slow for everyone, even though we already studied together. I always make mistakes. No one wants to be with me because i always make mistakes. . I know i have to improve myself but i cant think. The only thing that is always on my mind is "im sorry for being weak. Im sorry im not strong enough. Im sorry for being selfish. Im sorry for being self centered. Im sorry." Im always shaking and wanna cryceverytime im in the hospital, wondering when i will make mistakes again.

Im planning to save up funds so i dont burden my family financially when i kill myself. I feel bad for my parents, when i die, people will say "their daughter isnt strong enough to face the pressure of reality, so she decided to kill herself."

Im sorry.
