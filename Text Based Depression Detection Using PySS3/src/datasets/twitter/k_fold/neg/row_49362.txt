I... just donâ€™t know what to do anymoreIâ€™ve tried everything. Medication, therapy, even drugs, Iâ€™m only 19, but I always feel like if I keep going on with this life thereâ€™s going to be a point where I will actually kill myself, and I know it will happen soon. Iâ€™ve been sexually assaulted when I was 7 and itâ€™s still burned into my memory, replaying every single fucking day, even today. Iâ€™m about to fail college, and Iâ€™ll soon have no family in the country. Iâ€™ve just come to terms that I am going to be alone. I hate the fact that looking forward all I have is a empty void, I canâ€™t even feel anything other than physical and emotional pain over the past months. Over the past months all Iâ€™ve been doing is crying and begging for it to be over. Iâ€™m just done trying to keep pushing forward. Iâ€™m tired of being strong for everyone else when I have nothing. Iâ€™m tired of giving everything I have, then getting less if Iâ€™m lucky.
The only person I can talk to is on the other side of the world, I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m feeling anymore. Fuck, at points I feel like I literally donâ€™t exist. I could go into groups of people I know, say hi and get nothing, I tried going to other friends and they fucking hid from me. 

I weigh less than 50kg now, I wake up with a sick feeling in my stomach every day, canâ€™t eat anywhere near a quarter of my normal portions, I can see my ribs.

Iâ€™ve always been expected to get the best in my education, passing grades were never enough. I would get shouted at, I would get beaten.
I was physically abused for most of my life.

Iâ€™m just so tired of it all. I want to die now, I just want all the suffering and pain to stop.
