dying of lonelinessI am a 21 year old guy from the USA and I feel like no one notices me. I am 100% sure that no one at college cares about me either, plus I have never had a real friend since elementary school. The loneliness has been crushing. I can't even get a job either, I tried hundreds of applications and job fairs but none of the employers ever got back to me. I tried to kill myself 2 years ago through overdose. But it didn't work. But the overdose did cause a "dystonic reaction" that consisted of severe muscle contractions that went throughout my whole body (especially down my spine). It was the absolute worst pain i have ever encountered in my life. Eventually at the hospital, they gave me an injection that reduced the process.

 

I feel like that I am going to do something crazy again because my life hasn't improved. And I don't know how to have interesting conversations with people so I don't even bother with introducing myself. No one at college ever talks to me, I don't know why but it seems like I am just not worthy of people's attention. And I have spent 3 years in college though i have only completed 6 classes; which has made me feel stupid, slow, and worthless. It feels like college will never end and i will never get out of this hopeless situation.

 

I just don't know what to do. I want to end it. It feels like life is never going to change. And i am pretty sure my folks will die by the time i finish college so then i will just kill myself instead of being homeless. 

 

I am so goddamn lonely. I just can't take it anymore. fml
