no other course of actionI'm a loser dude type of person who isn't naturally good looking or into the drinking partying scene.  Just not my bag.  My father was out of the picture for most of my life so I was "blessed" with a single mother. (that's where this whole BS started TBH) I was obviously not the favorite.  Ive been fighting depression for a long time now and this isn't new.  Been to multiple doctors and counselors and spent so much money with no effect. I had somewhat given up on "getting better" because to doctors "getting better" is drugged up and silent and moodless.  "getting better" is no more than a chemical lobotomy.

I had recently decided to go see an anger management counselor on advice of a good friend.  I was inspired and cried a little during the pitch that the counselor gave me about "why I should use him".  I don't have health insurance so I had to pay cash upfront.  So I scraped by for a month and paid off the thing.

I started utilizing the techniques prescribed by the counselor and I felt like I was getting better for once.  I started gaining a small amount of self esteem when everything turned south harder than it ever has.  I started noticing that the people around me are generally selfish ignorant people.  They try and act like good people but their bad outweighs the good 10 fold.  So I worked the system like I was told even though my emotions were driving me to be militant. These people who I have been living for going on 8 years sense I tried killing myself previously.  It turned my perspective of the world upside-down.

*"can you please explain to me what you mean again?  It is hurting my feelings please stop"*

apparently that was the go to line from the counselor.  I tried using it on people and I got:

*"noone cares about your feelings you pussy ass snowflake"*

*"stop being such a bitch"*

*"if you wern't so busy feeling your feels maby you can get some work done for a change"*

*"its just how you are, sucks to suck"*

They might as well should of said just kill yourself already loser cause you are worthless and a burden.

I know everyone around me is fighting their own fight every day but I try and go out of my way for people.  I feel like I'm not feeling that love back. 

ontop of all that general I'm a loser stuff, we get into the extra loser "natural human reactions" that I have to deal with.  I have never been successful with women.  I try my best to just ignore them because usually it ends up with me being butthurt.  I had recently tried to break that trend with a new friend.  She was in a hot mess with her fiance and other men and I honestly just wanted the best case scenario for her.  She would ask me what her husband was feeling etc.. just a mans perspective.  It felt wonderful to help her.  that Obviously led to feelings cause losers like me tend to fall in love after 5 min of nice calm talking.. but I did what was right and repressed my feelings.. It was after all what was best for her.

So that ball of bullshit leads to me hoping that she is different from other women and this pedestal and that pedestal and everyone got a pedestal that day.. 

come to find out shes been fucking one of our mutual friends for awhile now.  and somehow that destroyed my self worth.. What makes matters worse is these people I work with.. so every day I come in and see her hoeing herself out while her husband just hangs back and continues to support her.  It is so wrong.. every time I see her I get sick to my stomach.

So it became a hydra of pain.  On one hand I was mad she cheated on her husband who has been trying to do anything and everything for her.  On the other hand she chose my mutual friend?!  I'm second to that guy?!  I really am a worthless piece of shit loser.. my god.. If any cheating were to happen it should of been with me damnit! Idk if thats the real feeling but its something like that.  Some bullshit about how I was the good one.. you know..  

So it just took the life out of me..  even if I was well, what is the point of being good?  I'm the world's rug to step on apparently.. I'm sick of waking up everyday to go to work just to be angry.  Ive spent so much time working on my career just so some bimbo can brainfuck me daily into suicide.  The internet is constantly telling me that I'm a rapist sexist misogynist who is oppressing everyone and should just kill myself already.. The whole thing is fucked and I want to put my 2 weeks in and then walk to the mountains and never come back.

"just get another job" people tell me

Yea ill just quit this recession proof job right before a giant recession.. I just want free of this pain that I have to deal with every day.  This pain is because I'm a loser wimp who lets people take advantage.    


I dont know how long I plan on staying.. But I just want to put it out there that dieing is looking real good lately.  That relief is what I want.  And "pushing through" or "faking it till I make it" has not worked at all.  I just want freedom from this pain
