Why am I so incompetent?Second time posting here, and things have gotten worse. Moved to a new school, have no friends, and I have a terrible reputation for being "creepy and desperate" because I ask out too many girls. My grades have turned to shit (junior year) only 1 friend (girl I'm hopelessly in love with) and I'm so depressed to the point where I just collapse on the floor crying. There's no future for me and I feel like just dying right now. It can't be as painful as what I'm dealing with now. I don't know what to do.
