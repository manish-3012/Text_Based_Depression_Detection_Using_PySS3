Easiest way to kill yourself?What's you guy's opinion on the quickest and most painless way to kill yourselves? I've been depressed since as long as I can remember and I'm now 22. My anxiety has only gotten worse with age and I've tried multiple different drugs to help cope. None of the drugs seem to help which leaves me helpless. I feel like a piece of shit human being who's a waste to society. I guess I just am lost and don't know what the do anymore. My thoughts just keep getting worse and worse as the days go on. Ugh.
