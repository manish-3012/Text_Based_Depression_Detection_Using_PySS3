WhenIt's not a darkness. Nothing that dramatic. It's knowledge. A piece of knowledge at least. It's knowing that you don't matter. 

People are connected to each other. We use words like vibing to describe this. When you fuck with someone you fuck with them. I donâ€™t vibe with anyone. I do it to myself I know. I honestly could not tell you why. Regardless, it's that knowledge. It frees you from personal attachment, because you don't matter. So nothing matters to you. Really, anyway. 

Nothing matters really because nothing we do makes a difference. I don't think as a species we'll learn fast enough to leave this planet before a cosmic level event or large scale natural disaster sets in motion the chain of events that will cause our extinction. People are being taught more and more to accept this attitude and it's wrong. The curiosity associated with this attitude should be promoted, the willingness to matter while we're here at least. To do things, things that matter, things that donâ€™t. To learn how to put together a puzzle, a Lego set, a birdhouse, a shed, a PC, a car. To do stuff while you're here and know your shit. The desperate will to do better. Obviously, if someone is reading this, I couldn't matter. Or maybe I do, in some way, manage to do a decent amount before someone reads this, then good for me. I did my job as a functioning human being, and as a man. Either way, I don't feel like I ever will vibe with anyone. Iâ€™m realizing this now. I can do stuff, I can be generally handy and knowledgeable, I can improve myself. But I'll never really vibe with people. And that knowledge frees me. 

Iâ€™m not saying now. I'm not that selfish. When my sister gets married, and starts a family, when my mom and dad get their happy ending. When they see that one of their children can be happy, and they can rest easy knowing that I at least went on to be a productive person. When no one is really looking anymore. Then I can stop doing this. I can quit. I really want to.
