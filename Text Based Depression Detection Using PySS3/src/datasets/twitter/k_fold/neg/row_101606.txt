I have decided how I'm going to do itMy plan is to go the beach alone and enjoy it for as long as I want and maybe cry a little haha. On the way back home I'm going to find a nice quiet street and crash my car. I won't hit anyone else and people will just think of it as a car crash. I'm weirdly relieved that I finally found how I'm going to do it.
