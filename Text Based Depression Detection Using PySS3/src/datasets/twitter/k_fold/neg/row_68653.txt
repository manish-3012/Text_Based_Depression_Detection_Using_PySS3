I've decided to give this one more yeari have been drinking, sorry if i wrote this poorly

my life has been an absolute mess since i graduated high-school and i had been feeling worse and worse every single day. I was going to end this all on on midnight because i'm really pretentious and love the idea of going out on the new year. but i decided that the next year has a lot of potential for improvement, im going into college and I'v started exercising. i guess we can file this under w for who give a shit but hey, heres to the next 365, hopefully better than the last.
