I'm off my meds again.All they do is make me a zombie. Sure, I don't hate myself over the fact that I'm 25 and have never held a girl's hand, but I'm also not able to feel basic emotions either. They completely kill me personality wise. Not that there's much there anyway.

I'm feeling it again. I want to scream and stab or shoot myself. Pathetic failure, waste of 2 and half decades. I work myself to the point of tears to help my family, but have nothing to spend the money on. Just things that kill me slowly. Alcohol, cigarettes. Nothing else stops the pain or banality.

I want to know what love is like. I've never experienced it, I've been so long without it, I'm now seen as weird because of it and likely never will.

I just want to fucking cry. I just want to make that leap and get it over with.
