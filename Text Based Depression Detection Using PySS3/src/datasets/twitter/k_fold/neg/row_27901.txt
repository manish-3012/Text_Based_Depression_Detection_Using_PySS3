Been planning my suicide. Been suffering from depression for over 10 years.Start off I feel little happy thinking about killing myself.  Hard to remember happiness. My depression had effect on my marriage. My ex didn't have patience for this. Decided to tell me she didn't love me anymore right after my moms funeral. She took kids and left me homeless. I get see kids one week out of year. I work full time and between child support (which she makes twice as much as me) and taking care of my dad(in he's 80) I don't have money to visit them in different state. I using eat one meal day. Work and sleep mostly. I almost finish writing my goodbye letters. 
BTW I have tried get help with depression. VA turn me away once. Second time made me wait 6 months try again. After 6 months I stop caring. If they didn't care why should I. Get rid you have so much live for. I feel it full of crap. How can you have so much live for if you're sad all time?
