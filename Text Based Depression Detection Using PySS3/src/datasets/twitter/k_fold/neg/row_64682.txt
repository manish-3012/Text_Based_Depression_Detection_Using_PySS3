ResentmentI just want to be done. I am so angry and resentful of my friends, family, colleagues, clients and dog. I have to fucking worry about the negative impact in them. It's not fair. Because I'm super selfish but not selfish enough so I won't. Even though I have multiple plans amd already planned my services, I'm still too worried about them. I'm praying I can keep getting away with slacking without losing my job. Still future oriented because I won't do ir. But it's unfair that I have to worry about them and they're selfish enough to make me feel like I have to continue living through this. I'm so tired and sad. I wish this would end.
