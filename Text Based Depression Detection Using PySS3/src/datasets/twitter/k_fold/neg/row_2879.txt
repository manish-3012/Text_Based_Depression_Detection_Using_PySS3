Escaping herIll be honest, this is just a recurring intrusive thought. Ill be fine. 

But I cant stop thinking about how if I killed myself Id never have to worry about my mom again

Its a little funny to me how people pull out the "but your family" when theyre trying to help me with suicidial thoughts, as if my family isnt a giant factor in why I want to die lmao. I know those people are trying. It just feels like a slap in the face.
