final cry for helpthis really is my last resort. i donâ€™t even know what to expect from posting this because i know what the comments are going to say.... but this is all iâ€™ve got left to try. 

iâ€™m on the waiting list for therapy but itâ€™ll be months until i can get a therapist, but even then i wonâ€™t even be able to go since i have agorophobia and canâ€™t leave my house to go to the therapy appointment so ... thatâ€™s not really an option.

i donâ€™t have a single friend so i canâ€™t exactly talk to them about how iâ€™m feeling. so, i guess this is my only option. 

so sorry for rambling i donâ€™t know what to do or say anymore i just need help before i do something really really bad
