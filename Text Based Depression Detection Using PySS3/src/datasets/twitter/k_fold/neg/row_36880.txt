In the last 2 weeks I have helped 3 people not hurt themselves and its killing meThe past 2 weeks I have had 3 friends message me saying they want to die, I have talked all of them out of it and 2 of them went to hospital. But its killing me, I attempted suicide 2 weeks ago, I sat on the bridge for hours but I got down. Its just now I'm a mess I dont know why they thought I would be a good person to chat to. I know this is not a self harm page, but I have cut so many times today, I dont know if I deserve to go on.

I have helped my friends and they are in a better place now, so my life hasnt been a complete waste. They will get over me I know they will, they have finished using me and I hope they will get better soon.

I just wished I had someone like me to talk to about things
