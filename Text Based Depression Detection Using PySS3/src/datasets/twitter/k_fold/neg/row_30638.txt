So this is how it endsA little backstory: My mom is an addict, lost my dad when I was a young teen. Was pulled out of school at 10, and to this day I don't have a diploma/GED. No drivers license, no vehicle, no job and no way to get to work even if I had one. Staying with a family member at a cheap motel, but they're currently struggling with addiction too. 

I'm 21, don't have many friends, and I'm horribly depressed and lonely. I've been this way ever since my dad passed and I don't see it changing. I feel like I have nothing to live for and no reason to go on. It'll be a miracle if I make it through this week.
