Iâ€™m seen as garbage by societyEveryday is just a reminder that Iâ€™m this ugly tranny that everyone hates. Has never and will never be loved. Forget loved, even liked. I wouldnâ€™t wish this on anyone. I donâ€™t do anything wrong. Iâ€™m a good member of society. Imagine if we treated every person who got a nose job like someone trans. Itâ€™s their body and their business. You arenâ€™t required to date them or talk to them. But youâ€™re expected to be respectful.

But since Iâ€™m seen as a subhuman freak I must be deserving of every false insult and physical attacks. Iâ€™m not mentally ill. Expecting someone to be super confident and happy when everyone hates them makes no sense at all. How are you going to make fun of people over the high suicide rate when you contribute to it? â€œYouâ€™re ugly, crazy, trash who tries to trick people and Iâ€™m gonna spread this message to everyone.â€ Do you understand. But whatever. I never should have been born in the first place. 

Sorry for my brain not matching my body. I didnâ€™t know what I did with myself to feel normal directly effected you so much. Like most of us we try to ignore it or get sent to camps and it doesnâ€™t work. If it did thereâ€™d be no one gay or trans. Life is not a gift but a punishment. I wish I could have experienced what it was like to be a normal person.
