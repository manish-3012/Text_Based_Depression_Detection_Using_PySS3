19 and it shouldn't have to be this way.I sware I'll never know what love is and I feel more and more on the brink of killing myself everytime it potentially gets better and it gets to the point where its like I get sad but its starting to feel less sad now and more like im prolonging my life because im a failure. I have many suicide attempts in the past and its getting to the point where I dont care anymore and would just like to end this all. Im tired of being blamed for not doing anything when I have 2 jobs and going to college and helping my mother who had surgery. So I guess Im a failure after all and I dont think im going to past this semester with everything thats going on so im delaying the inevitable I wish I could just fucking die and I dont have to do anything anymore or listen to anyone. I actually smile knowing that I can control something and thats my suicide. I try to feel and love but people ruined that me for a long time. So I never know whats real or whats not and people prove to be untrustworthy time and time again and its fucked up because I got a skateboard for release and I know its some people that care so I know itll hurt them but I envisioned my funeral many times so its second nature.
