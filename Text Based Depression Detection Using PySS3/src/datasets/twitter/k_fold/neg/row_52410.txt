I'm doomed for a life of eternal misery, death is my only escapeAge 8: Sexually assaulted for the first time. In my naivete, I told my dad and all he said was go up to your room and sleep. Never addressed it.
Age 9: Sexually assaulted for the second time. I was wiser this time.
Age 14: Had a two year long abusive relationship which made me petrified of men. Loud voices and sudden movements would trigger me. 
Parents are not the best, I was severely bullied in 7th grade and became suicidal. When my mum found out about my suicidal tendencies, she said "Go ahead. Do it. I'm watching".
I had my first full-blown panic attack at the age of 18 and my parents rubbished it, said there's no such thing as a panic attack and said I probably just had too much to drink (they don't like people who drink they're orthodox asians)
I'm 21 now and I just graduated from college which was one of the best times of my life. I became independent, my anxiety was at an all time low, I did well in school, I was published in a newspaper and in a journal, I found the love of my life, my professors became my closest friends and then I graduated. 
I applied to eight different places for a job, everyone reverted with a letter of rejection. My last hope rejected me today. I am stuck at my parents place who love controlling me. All my autonomy and my mental health goes to shit. I become a different person. I have nowhere else to apply, I've exhausted my list of contacts and networks. My parents are in debt. I'm exhausted and I've realized happiness is fleeting and its a cruel joke. The only job I got was one which paid me 3 times the average but it was a sales job and i was interested in academia and research so I said no because I wanted to "follow my passion". I was a fool. And I'm paying for it. Goodbye.
