I'm so desperate, I just need someone to accept my decision and be with me until the endI don't even want to die. I just genuinely can't keep living like this, it's too much pain. My whole existence is nothing but pain. I can't ever take a break from it.
I know that I need to die. Logically I should have already died some months ago, but due to the fact that suicide is fucking hard, I'm still here.
I am terrified of thinking about it. I didn't manage to pick my method yet, but I can't make it to 2020, I just can't.
I'm so fucked, it scares me.
I do nothing all day instead of trying to prepare myself for my end, but I'm unable to.

I don't want to go through this alone.
There's absolutely no life for me left already, although I'm just turning 19..
It's for sure.
I fucking tried my hardest already, there really is nothing left.
I wish it all wouldn't have to be this way.

I could really use someone to talk to..
