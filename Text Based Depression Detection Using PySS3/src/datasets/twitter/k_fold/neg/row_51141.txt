I feel so worthless, ugly, unlovable and I just can't fucking take it anymoreI have no friends, nobody who understands, my mom blames me for everything that has happened. I feel so empty inside. I have absolutely no one. No support outside of therapy. I am lonely all the time. Just stuck with my thoughts, with myself, with this pain and it is so freaking hard to cope with everyday. I'm not saying that I want a crutch, I just want support and I don't have it. Nobody wants to be around me because of this fucking depression, no matter how much I reach out and try to converse with others

I feel like I am losing my mind because of this loneliness. It is so crippling. It's eating away at me every day. I am seriously struggling. It feels like I'm fighting 5 battles in one, all by myself and I'm on the verge of giving up and just surrendering again as I have tons of times in the past few months. I feel so very sad and I am very alone and lonely. I am so fucking tired of living with this everlasting pain
