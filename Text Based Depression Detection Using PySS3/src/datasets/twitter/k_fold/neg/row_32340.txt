Nothing to live forI have overwhelming anxiety, depression, borderline, my parents don't understand my illness. I had all this for 15 years and I suffer everyday. I don't want to suffer anymore. Girls don't interest me because due to my mental illness I end up destroying all of my relationships. Nothing ever works for me. Lost three jobs in 10 years. Killing myself will end all of this suffering. I am going to do it, I know I will. Problem is WHEN.
