Sharing my last piece of art.http://i.imgur.com/DDDvgKB.jpg

I've never drawn anything... messy like this before. I actually drew 3 pictures depicting different methods and all have my ex (as of a couple days ago) in them. I've been contemplating this for a long time (way before we ever broke up) but I feel ready today. I think it has something to do with not having anyone to show up for anymore. I feel confident that this is the best choice for me.

UPDATE 1: Still here. About to sort this out after finishing my drugs and downing a lot of whiskey. Home stretch.

UPDATE 2: Incredibly at peace with this as I write my note and hallucinate a bit from 4 days without sleep only a few chips or nuts to shut my stomach up. I've said my goodbyes in ways that are not alarming but so that I could talk to the people that I know care and/or love me. They will be thought about but not considered when I do this. I made this choice for me.
