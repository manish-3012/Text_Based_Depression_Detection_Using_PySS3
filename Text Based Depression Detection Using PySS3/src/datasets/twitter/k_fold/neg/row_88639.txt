I didn't mean to..The other day I was in a really deep depressing mood and I kind of zoned out.. I didn't realize what I was doing. It was like I wasn't around anyone. Being in the middle of a class I obviously wasn't alone but I felt like I was in isolation.  When I snapped out of it,  my arm hurt and I was tearing up. I moved my sleeve and revealed several cuts on my arm,  not deep,  but I definitely broke skin.  I'm assuming I did it with the sharp end of the mechanical pencil I had,  as it was the only thing in my hand.
 I haven't self harmed in months,  I've had urges but never acted on them. I'm just scared because I don't really remember doing this.  Nobody else saw me.  I can see myself doing it though,  like I was outside my own body.  It's very confusing.  But I'm scared of myself now.
