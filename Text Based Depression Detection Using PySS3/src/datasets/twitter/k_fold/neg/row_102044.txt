Please be cautious for the next few days on TikTokHi everyone! For those who watch TikTok, I would highly suggest staying off of it for the next few days. There is a highly disturbing video being hidden of a man committing suicide covered by cutsie videos. You won't know what you are watching until it's over. I made the unfortunate mistake and it was very triggering. Just my two cents! Hope everyone is well.
