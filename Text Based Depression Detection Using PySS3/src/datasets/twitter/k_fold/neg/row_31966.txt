My guiltI love my boyfriend, more than any words can explain. H, Rocky, and Wrigley are my life. Nothing more, nothing less. I love my family. I'm getting a masters in psychology, yet I can't help myself. I know I have severe depression and anxiety. I just want to end it with no one else having to bear this burden that I feel.
