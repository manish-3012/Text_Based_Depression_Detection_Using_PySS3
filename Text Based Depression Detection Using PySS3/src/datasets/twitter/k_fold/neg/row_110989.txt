I threw away the best part of my life, I don't want to be here for the restI am 52, by internet standards I am ancient. For most of my life I lived with active self-hatred. I wanted to kill myself in junior high, and when I got out of high school. I wish I had. Then I had a major surgery for something that I had ignored the symptoms of for years. After the surgery, because of pain and the shock of it, I suddenly had compassion for myself, at least for my younger self. I realized what a waste my life had been, what I could have had if I had just liked myself then. I thought I was fat and ugly. It wasnâ€™t true then it is true now because of time and biology. I donâ€™t want to die. I just donâ€™t want to live with this grief, regret, and shame and despair; and the loneliness. Especially the loneliness. I wanted to do so many things in my life, and now itâ€™s too late. I neglected my health, and gained weight. I have lost 125 pounds, and I still have about 160 to go. Now I have an ugly scar, not that it matters. I am hideous. I made a post on r/loseit several years ago, and someone suggested that I might as well kill myself. I wish I had back then. The future holds no joy for me. There is nothing to look forward to. Itâ€™s too late to have any sort of a career. I donâ€™t find men my age attractive. They look like my grandpa to me. I just wanted to be young and have fun and wear pretty clothes. I could have done all those things. I thought I was fat and ugly then, but I wasnâ€™t. I am now. I will never be attractive. Even if I lose weight Iâ€™ll still have extra skin. And to suddenly become â€œself-awareâ€, and I am right in the middle of menopause, the surgery I had make me start menopause suddenly. It is like being hit by a bus. Sometimes I want to die just so the hot flashes will stop. I would rather just it be over with. I just want to have never existed. I have neglected my education. I dropped out of school so many times. Sometimes it was because of depression and anxiety, sometimes I think it was just because I wanted someone to notice how miserable I was. I have never had a real relationship. That is what I regret the most. I realized how lonely I am. Thatâ€™s when I actually think about doing something, just to make it stop. I sit at the computer and tell myself how stupid I. I could blame all this on bipolar disorder and anxiety, but I could muddle through dead-end, mind numbing jobs. I could do things that I thought other people expected me to do, just not anything for myself. Most of my life was just on autopilot. My life before seems like it happened to someone else. I am on three medications and nothing is helping. They say that my feelings are just the depression talking, but at what point is it not? My situation is still the same. I couldnâ€™t have fucked my life up more it I had deliberately planned it out. Itâ€™s all just so fucking stupid. Oh, and just for an added kick in the teeth, last October I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I am doing all the things I am supposed to to fight the cancer while at the same time wishing I were gone. If that makes any sense. If any of this makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense to me.
