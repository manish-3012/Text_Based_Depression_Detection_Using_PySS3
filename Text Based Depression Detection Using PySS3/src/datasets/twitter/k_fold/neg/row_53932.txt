My parents are causing my suicidal thoughtsBeen suicidal for almost 4 years. Iâ€™ve been cutting myself for over 2. Just recently told my parents about how I was suicidal and Iâ€™ve been cutting myself. They told me that I should stop acting and be a man. They told me I was cutting myself because I was â€œtrying to get attentionâ€ when my top priority was to not let anyone know. Thatâ€™s why I kept it a secret for so long. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I feel suicidal everyday, but I donâ€™t really have a plan or thought on when and how I will end my life. I just want the pain the end. To be happy again.. One of the main reasons why Iâ€™m suicidal is because of my parents. Theyâ€™ve been abusive to me for almost my whole life. Hitting, kicking, screaming at me. My parents argue and drink almost every night. Then my mom blames everything on me. Saying that itâ€™s my fault that she is arguing with my dad WHEN MOST OF THE TIME I WASNâ€™T IN OR PART OF THE CONVERSATION!!! Sometimes my friends can hear my parents argue. They ask if Iâ€™m okay and if they should call somebody. I told my parents to quiet down so that nobody asks anything. Then my mom started saying that if they call the police or anybody, it would be my fault. Then she started taking it out on me. Telling me that Iâ€™m a failure and that I am an embarrassment because I was suicidal. For all my life my mom told me that if I tell anybody what my parents do to me, then I would be taken away and sent to a new home. When I was younger I was scared of that thought and I didnâ€™t want to leave my parents. But now that Iâ€™m older I feel like it would be better to get away from them. Anyway, if you read till this point then I hope you understand whatâ€™s going on. I didnâ€™t want to make a huge ass paragraph so I only wrote a little bit.
