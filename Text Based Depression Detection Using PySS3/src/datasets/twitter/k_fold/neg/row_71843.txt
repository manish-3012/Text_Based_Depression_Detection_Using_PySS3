The only thing stopping me is fearI want to off myself in theory but I am too afraid of:

a) Fucking it up and ending up in restrained mental hospital with kidney/liver failure.

b) Succeeding, but not before horrific pain in which I probably chicken out, call for help and end up like in point (a) regardless.

The only plus side to the starvation I've been doing for days now is that I finally am having dreams again (that I remember and they are interesting too). I figure this is appropriate torture for myself since my family doesn't truly like me and most of the friends ignore me or never have time. I'm a crappy person anyway. Guess that;s why I'm alone. The only reason the dog somewhat likes me is because she is skittish and doesn't know better than me.
