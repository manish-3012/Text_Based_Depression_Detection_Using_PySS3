3 days until the only woman I have ever loved gets married.And it's not to me. Shocking based on the sub, I know. 

C and I have known eachother for 15 years or so and from the day we met I knew she was important to me. We fooled around a few times at the start, mostly drunken hook ups, but neither of us wanted anything more. Fast forward 5 years and we have become very good friends and talk about everything, including us. We decide to give it a go but life has other plans. I lose my Father and Mother figure 3 months apart which puts me into a state of mind where nobody could be around me. Including C, who by this point has developed a fairly serious drug issue. Needless to say, our relationship didn't really last. 

5 more years elapse. C and I both talk to the "right people" and get to a healthier place. During this time we stayed fairly close, but shy of a few drunken nights we stay platonic. One day she tells me she has a GF. I have 0 issues with this, we are good friends and M makes her very happy. 

About 2.5 years ago, C and M are now living together. R (a mutual friend of C and me. I've known R for 10 years at this point) and I start dating. C&amp;M and R&amp;me are now couples friends (double date, take holidays together etc). One day while we were at the lake C tells me how she has made a mistake. M and her are done, they just can't talk the way we do etc and she wants to get back together. At this point i didn't have any idea what I should do. Things with R were going good, we were talking about moving in together when her lease was up, so I told C that I was going to stick it out with R. 

Over the next 6 months C slips back into her drug dependence while almost completely ignoring all her friends and family. We talk very randomly and I blame myself for what has happened (I know she is an adult and she made her own choice but that didn't change my conscience.) and my relationship with R sours. We end up breaking up 2-3 months later.

3 months ago. I get a call out the blue from C. I hadn't heard from her for a few months at this point, so I was very happy to hear from her. She got her shit together, 12 weeks sober 4 out of rehab. We talk a few times and she is the girl I fell for 15 years ago again. I'm single at this point so we decide to go to dinner. This is when I meet S, C's fiance, the reason she cleaned up. He's honestly a great guy, he treats her like a princess. And he's REALLY good for her. 

The wedding is on Saturday and I'm the "best friend" (male head bridesmaid. But not going to lie the name REALLY sucks). I'm very happy for her, this is the first time I've seen her this healthy and happy. And I'm going to be there for her but I want nothing more then to just crawl somewhere dark and die.
