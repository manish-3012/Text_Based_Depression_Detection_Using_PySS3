My guilt's causing physical pain, I can't take it any moreI just feel so guilty about everything. Making my dad pay for my tuition, primarily, it's expensive as hell. My mom's a barely-functional alcoholic who won't pay for any of it and yells at me whenever I ask about it. I've tried to make friends in class, but no matter how many people I talk to, no one wants to hang out outside of class. I just feel so lonely and worthless and most of all, guilty, and I have no one to talk to about it. My stomach's tied up in knots constantly and I've thrown up so much in the past few months. I can't remember a day that's gone by where I haven't cried. I don't know how I'm gonna make it through college, financially and emotionally. I don't know what to do. Everything hurts
