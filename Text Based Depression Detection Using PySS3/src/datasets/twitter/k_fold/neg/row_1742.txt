My parents are the only people that would careBut they donâ€™t realize how much better off theyâ€™d be without me bringing them down. All 2 of my friends would be so much better off without me.

People would actually be glad Iâ€™m out of their hair and I canâ€™t annoy them anymore. 
Itâ€™s hard to continue living when I know Iâ€™m just a burden to the people around me.
