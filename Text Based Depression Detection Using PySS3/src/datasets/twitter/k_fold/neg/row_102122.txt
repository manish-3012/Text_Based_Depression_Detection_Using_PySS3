Having major surgery soon, want to end it beforehandIt's going to cost my family a LOT of money. On the other hand, I'm working on disability, to help my parents financially. Credit card debt and retirement, so not much of it will go to me. Not fair, I know. 

Maybe after I get disability and back pay for a while, I'll do it. Can't refuse the surgery though.
