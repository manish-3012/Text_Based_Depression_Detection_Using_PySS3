This is itI have made a post here before, and I don't want to make another, but I am done.

The last things I held onto in life are gone. I don't remember what life was like before this, and I won't be here for after. I have lost the energy to do anything, and I feel nothing. If I wasn't such a pussy i would have been gone a year ago but there was no point waiting. ive achived nothing since then
