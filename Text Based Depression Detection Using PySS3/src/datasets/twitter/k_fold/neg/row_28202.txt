What's the least traumatic way I can go about the deed for those that find me?disclaimer: I'm not currently set on killing myself, it just relieves some of my anxiety and gives me sense of control to create a detailed plan if I ever do decide to execute this option. 

I want to make this as easy as possible for those that are going to have to deal with my death. I don't want to traumatize anybody through finding my body. I would think the most ethical means of discovery would be for an EMT to find me. It seems that they would be the most mentally equipped to deal with the discovery of my body, having no personal attachment to me and having much experience with dead bodies. Hopefully I'm just another Jane Doe to them. My current thoughts are to take a lethal dose of opiates in a town that no one I know has any sort of connection to. I would hate to do it in a local area that my friends or family would have to drive by constantly and be reminded of my death. I predict that my death will come as a surprise to many, and I'm worried about there being a possible homicide investigation even if I just OD in the street with a note in my hand, is there anything I can do to ensure that this wouldn't happen? I would hate to force my family through a painful legal ordeal on top of the group that they're already going to be feeling. I also would like to draft some sort of note that would help them get closure, but I'm not really sure what people look for in that as I have not dealt with much loss in my life. I like to hear you guys's thoughts, and again I'm not set on killing myself I'm just trying to make a plan.
