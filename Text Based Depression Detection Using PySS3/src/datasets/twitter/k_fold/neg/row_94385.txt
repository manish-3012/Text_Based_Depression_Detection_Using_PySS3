Not sure where to go, so here I am..To long of a story to type out, so the run down it my gf of alnost 6 years, the one I was about to pop the question to and start a family with after so long of preparing for it, looked me in the eyes about 2 weeks ago and told me that she was no longer in love with me. She said the last year had been downhill for her and I could not provide what she needed. She wants to stay friends but its so hard after all the memories to even talk to her like a friend. I can't lay in bed now it's so lonely. No sleep since that night, been going downhill rapidly myself. Lost my job, my only vehicle broke down and is an extensive repair which I may not be able to complete. I have been running on no sleep, trying to be with friends to cheer me up and it's just not working. Everywhere I go I have memories of her and just want it bad so fucking bad. I want to go back in time and try again, but it's not possible. I don't know what I'm feeling, but I know it's not good or healthy. I just dont know where to go. I can't live the single life. It is literally killing me more every day. Hell even a simple song on the radio about some gushy love shit makes me want a truck to t-bone me. Atleast then it wouldn't be so hard on whomever cares, if they even do. Where the fuck do I go? I don't know anyone that would want to be by my side. I need someone I can ooen up to, come home to, like it used to be. That just wont happen though. Where do I go? What do I do? Nothing is working so far.
