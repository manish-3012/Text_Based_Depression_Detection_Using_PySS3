don't even know, 2 down in 1 day... breaking meSo... last 2 days 2 of my friends have died.. both have the same first name and both within a few hours. Dunno how to cope... I've been suffering with depression for a good 10 years now but always managed to keep control but this time...... 2 deaths in the same day is just tipping me, If some people with such great potential decides to kill them off and the other have a car accident the same day... what the hell is the point of my life who has nothing, would happily trade my life for one of them 2 because I know for a fact they would do so much more than what I could ever do.... so stuck playing Dota and working 6 days a week with gym and no future prospects/happyness..........
