Am I too emotional?All of my short life, I have been disciplined by my parents, whether it was verbal or physical. Everytime, I end up crying even though I have an overwhelming urge to push against them somehow. My brothers get over it quickly without tears, smiling the next day as if the punishment was nothing. I try to do it, too, but I get filled with so much rage at the sight of my parents. Iâ€™m so petty, sometimes I think about killing myself just to provoke them.
