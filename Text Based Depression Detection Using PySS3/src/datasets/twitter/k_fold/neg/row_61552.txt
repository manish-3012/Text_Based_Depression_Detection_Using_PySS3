Living is TortureI've posted here a few times now.  Still wish I was dead, still don't have the guts to do it.

I know that dying will put my family through excruciating pain.  However, watching my family suffer because of my shit is becoming more than I can bear.

I'm unstable, I can't provide them with what they need to be happy and successful, and it kills me inside.  They didn't ask to be brought into this world, and now I'm putting them and my wife through hell.

I wish my family could see how all of us would be better off if I just died.  They would all move on to better lives, and they wouldn't hanging around their necks like a weighted stone.

I'm starting to think I need to just do it.  It would be a tremendous shock at first, but eventually they would see what a tremendous weight has lifted.

But I'm a coward, and that will never happen. I'll just be stuck in this living hell of inflicting suffering on the people I love most, and having to watch them endure it.  If hell exists, I deserve to be there.
