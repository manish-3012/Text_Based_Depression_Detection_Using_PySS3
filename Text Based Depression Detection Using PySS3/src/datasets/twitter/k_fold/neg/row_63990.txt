It's only logical.This is going to sound cliche but I don't belong in this world. Honestly, I have never fit in anywhere. Growing up, I was always overlooked and seen as over emotional but also pressured to be something greater than everyone else around me.

I never met anyone's expectations and I can't even meet the lowest of society's expectations. Sure I have a job and contribute somewhat but my job is literally pointless and could be filled by anyone. I will never have the luxury of going to college so society says I deserve low-paying, degrading work. I'm not educated enough so my opinion doesn't matter. I don't matter. The basic thing I can do as a human-being is reproduce and let my offspring try to do better than me but I have feeling I would extremely fuck up even child-rearing. I don't have the money to support another human-being. I can't even support myself.

I don't find joy in even basic things. I am bitter towards the world and almost everyone and everything in it. I have no family to speak to. I have no friends. And the one person left is tired of hearing it day in and day out.

The world is overpopulated. I am of absolute no value. Kill myself is the only thing that makes sense.
