Yo whatâ€™s up reddit?Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts since the third grade. My immigrant parents donâ€™t believe in mental illness. I sought therapy and medication myself, but none of it helped. I dropped out of high school just before graduation, leaving my friends and potential behind. Since then Iâ€™ve done/sold drugs, got tattoos/piercings, and fucked way too many random girls in my shed. Not to mention the love of my life, who is a totally unfeeling meth head whore. Basically my life is a meaningless mess and generally not worth any of the pain that it causes. Today, I made direct eye contact with myself in the mirror, and told my reflection with the deepest sincerity: â€œI am going to fucking kill you.â€ Tears fell down my cheeks as I realized how honest that threat was. My own gaze pierced my soul like knives. There was both the thrill of murder and the terror of death in my eyes, and my heart still races for the hunt. Iâ€™m fantasizing about blowing my brains out with a shotgun, alone in a peaceful, open field. Currently mustering up the courage and resources to make my fantasy a reality.
