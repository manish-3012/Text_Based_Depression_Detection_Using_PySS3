I feel like its getting closerTheres this feeling i get. Where i just know that my times running out. That the last day ill breathe is coming closer and closer everyday. I cant explain it. I just know. Its soon. This year. Not next year, not the year after, not anytime after this year. Maybe next month, im not sure, i have a strong feeling around november might be it. November.... i never thought much about that month. No holidays, no birthdays. It was my birthday a while ago and all i thought of the entire time was that since that day was my birthday, i wondered when my  deathday will be and that the birthday this year would be the last one ill ever celebrate. Ill never have friends. They all leave. I dont have a family that cares about me what so ever. Im unhappy. I hate waking up. I hate it all. And i feel relief that ill be gone soon. I could see everyones smiles then. Im better off dead. This world just isnt for me.
