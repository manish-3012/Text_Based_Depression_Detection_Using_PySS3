Im scared of myselfI don't really trust myself, my panic attacks started when I was literally 5. I get them when I'm alone and it's dark even though I'm not afraid of the dark or anything. I've thought about it many times and I don't know if I'll be strong enough to refuse self-harm. Don't prioritize responding to this post, others need quick help. I just want someone to talk to, hopefully actually talk.
