my lifethe love of my life left me after we was together for 20 months because of the way I treated her and because of my selfish attitude and sheâ€™s now talking to somebody else, i have 0 irl friends and 0 online friends who actually care about me, my 17 year old brother is in hospital after taking drugs, last week i had 8 panic attacks in 7 days, iâ€™m on sleeping medication because i canâ€™t sleep anymore, i can barely eat and have lost 18 pounds in less than 2 weeks, iâ€™ve been on anti depressants since i was 14 and had to drop out of school because of my panic attacks/social anxiety, my dad was physically abusive towards me as a child and now iâ€™m turning into an alcoholic like him and iâ€™m wasting my pathetic life away in bed, i really donâ€™t know how or why iâ€™m still going i lost the only person that truly mattered to me and made me feel like i matter and now iâ€™m just suffering so my parents donâ€™t have to

idk what to do anymore and i have no idea why iâ€™m even writing this iâ€™m just in so much pain and want it to end
