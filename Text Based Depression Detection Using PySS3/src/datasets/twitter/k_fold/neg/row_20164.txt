This is not an official suicide noteFor legal purposes I deny any thoughts of harm to myself or anyone else and if asked in person will deny it.

Now that disclaimer aside....I just saw my forty seven year old crush with a twenty two year old in his lap which doesn't bode well for his thirty five year old fiance.    He was one of the few guys my own age who was interested in me.   Now I know he's not the only guy on earth but this echos a larger truth.

The larger truth is that the red pill was right, love is only about looks and beauty and the physical world.

I am a failing organism and the poor treatment and disrespect I get from our whole society is just a symptom of something larger.

I know this letter might make everyone laugh but honestly I've been come that smelly in cell neck beard who's only joy in life is arguing with reddit trolls.

I hate my life, I hate most people, but worst of all I hate the feeling of my own skin.

I hate waking up every day being me.

I hate the feeling of being inside myself and even the best technology, the strictest diet or hardest work out can't fix the feeling of having my body fail on me.  You can't fix aging.

If you are male you can be a toothless balding fifty year old covered in tats and still get a twenty year old babe in your lap my idiot friend proves that but if you are female you sit around watching this display just feeling saggy and wanting to throw up your food.

I miss being loved and cared about even though it wasn't real.

I hate people because they've abused my my entire life and that's a universal truth of life on this planet as well.

I fucking hate other people.   A lot.
