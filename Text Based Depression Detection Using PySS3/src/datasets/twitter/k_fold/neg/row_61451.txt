I'm too poor to dieI'm way too poor to do it I want to end this endless pain but as a poor person whose family lives off government assistance and pay check to pay check I would hate to have to put them through the financial struggle it is to die. So I sit and suffer knowing that this is it, my hell on earth feeling it all at once hurts. I can't gain control I've tried I'm just too tired so weak from trying to constantly stay numb but as soon as it wears off it all hits me like a ton of bricks i get filled with all these emotions all at once its unbearable. I was supposed to be a healer but I can't even heal myself i was given this gift to help others but I can't even help myself. I've failed my light has been snuffed out no one will understand I'm truly alone I wanna die but I cant afford it so I sit and suffer
