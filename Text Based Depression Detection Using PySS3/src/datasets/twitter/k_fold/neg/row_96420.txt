I am on 40mg of propranolol a day and I've just taken 280mgI haven't been taking my meds properly at all. I'm going through so much shit I have tried to end my life multiple times, I took 75 ibuprofen on Saturday and that was the last time I OD'd

I was moving out of the emotionally abusive home that I live in with my mum, my dad was helping but she's made up some lies saying I can't look after myself or a flat and everything was ready and then he ditched me last minute. My mum called the police on my boyfriend saying he was abusing me, he's not and reported an argument we had over 2yrs ago, it's been over 2 weeks and Iv'e rang the police multiple times over an update and Iv'e heard nothing, Iv'e lost my job, my grandma's dementia is so bad she has to stay in hospital until she has a home, friends are angry with me and not helping. The police told my boyfriend not to talk to me and he's the only one who can help me and I'm stuck home with my mum who's emotionally abusive to me in name calling and she's financially abusive too. Anyone know how long the 'investigation' will last?

Anyone have any idea's if I will survive this as Iv'e had around 5 overdoses in 2 weeks around 60-80 painkillers and now this
