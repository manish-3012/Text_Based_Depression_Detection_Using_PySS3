Iâ€™m ready to give upI know this is probably just another cry for help in a sea of posts... but Iâ€™m at the end of my rope. 

Iâ€™ve suffered from severe depression and anxiety for years, but I feel like I canâ€™t carry on. I spend every night uncontrollably weeping and screaming on my bathroom floor. 

I want to give up. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t live like this. Trying to survive day by day is no way to live.
