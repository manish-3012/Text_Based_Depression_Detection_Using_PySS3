Iâ€™m having obsessive thoughts about partying thatâ€™s driving me to suicideMy brain is racing with thoughts that Iâ€™m missing out. I want to dance, drink and sing but I have no friends. All I can literally think about is being with a group of random people and getting drunk. I try everything I can like exercise, reading and watching TV. But these thoughts wonâ€™t go away. I also have thoughts about posting notes on peoples doors saying â€œlooking for a drinking buddyâ€ or going to the bar alone and talking to random people (even if they hate me) Iâ€™ll still annoy them. 

I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. SEEING SNAPS OF PEOPLE PARTYING, I TELL MY MOM TO HELP AND SHE DOESNâ€™T. I POST SNAPS SAYING I WANT TO PARTY BUT NOTHING HAPPENS!!! I want to have sex then hang myself because these thoughts are causing me to go crazy. I JUST WANT TO PARTY LIKE THIS
