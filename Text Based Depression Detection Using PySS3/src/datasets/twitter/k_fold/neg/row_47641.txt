When I see people get excited it freaks me outWhen I see people that are genuinely happy with their lives, and have pep in their step, itâ€™s honestly just weird to see.

Iâ€™m so envious of it, yet I also pity them in some weird way.

Depression strips the light away from everything youâ€™ve ever enjoyed, and makes things that should be great, average at best.

Fuck this.
