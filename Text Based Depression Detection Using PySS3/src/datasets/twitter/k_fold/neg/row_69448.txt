iâ€™m finding it much harder to stay alive.everyday just gets harder and harder. sometimes i find myself holding a bottle of pills or trying to find a rope and trying to find cons to doing it. sometimes i find myself sobbing and being unable to breathe or think. and sometimes, right now actually, i feel absolutely numb. itâ€™s like nothing around me is actually real and iâ€™m just sitting in a void. nothing feels or smells or looks real. i hate living.
