Iâ€™m a 17 year old male (itâ€™s long as fuck lmao)Iâ€™ve never really opened up about my feelings to anyone in my whole life and every fucking time someone tries to get me to open up I end up feeling annoyed like Iâ€™m not depressed and then push them away and Iâ€™m pretty sure this is because my parents never taught me about feelings so I have no idea how to handle them so I just shove them deep deep deep into my body and the one time I tried to let them out I broke down and just cried and my family is African American so they just brushed it off as me being a little bitch which does suck but to be honest Iâ€™m just so used to them not caring I just donâ€™t care anymore and thatâ€™s just one problem Another thing is that I really donâ€™t see myself making it to the end of this year and graduating because when I was young my mom found the â€œChurch of Jesus Christâ€ and converted to being a Mormon and ever since then she would let me skip school all middle school because I would create lies to avoid school and she actually believed them and I know that sounds like my fault but she should definitely be smarter than that and she really just takes the church over anything including her own fucking children and it sucks because now Iâ€™m really behind in school and not to mention my parents are divorced and used to argue every single damn day and the only thing that brought me peace was my Xbox 360 and now I play video games all the time because my mindset is whenever I play games I donâ€™t have to worry about everything else in life and also Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m addicted to porn and I canâ€™t stop even though Iâ€™m trying so fucking hard to stop but the feeling I have during it makes me feel like Iâ€™m loved by something so I masturbate a lot to feel that feeling and another thing (lol I feel like a loser doing this) I tend to dwindle on the past a lot because those were the only times I was really cared about because now I have 5 siblings and me being the second oldest you would expect someone who is black and 6 foot and is decent looking to be extroverted and fun to be around but Itâ€™s the complete opposite and I am extremely introverted and only like being alone and I hate that about myself and Iâ€™m pretty sure thatâ€™s why I like pushing people away from me and it really sucks to be like this and I donâ€™t even know who the real me is anymore and I just really want to feel happy like I was when I was kid and it sucks man that I could be playing some sports going into a 4 year college but instead Iâ€™m depressed and want to die so badly and now here I am opening up on a app god I just want someone to save me so fucking bad itâ€™s not even funny.
