Worried about my friendI recently lost my mom, who was my best friend. Now my friend who is bipolar is on a pysch floor because of suicidal ideation. She ALWAYS takes her meds and has no logical reason to kill herself. She just st getting strong thoughts and plans to kill herself. I'm freaking out and I can't handle another death. I'm really angry too
