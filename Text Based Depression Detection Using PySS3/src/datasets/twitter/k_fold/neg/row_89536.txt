Survivors: Regret? Relief?Just curious for anyone who has survived an attempt, did you experience relief or regret on waking up and realizing you were still here? How about final conscious thoughts? At the last minute (but after it was "too late") did you regret it at that very last moment and want to take it back. as I've heard many do? Or did you never waver? Thanks in advance...
