RamblingsI walk along a cold and empty path.

You can hear the children laughing.

The bustle of traffic.

How the words wrap in the wind like lovers in the night and embrace the invisible decay.

Looking here and there, anywhere.
A sign?

Oh god is there one?

A god or a sign, I'd take one please.

Yet alas this is what it is.

Doomed to the endless groundhog days.

Is the sky blue or just a figment, I don't really know anymore.

I don't want to know anymore.

The faceless beings that stand in front of me.

Who really exists

Who really lives
