Im getting worse,no matter what I doI've done everything that I've been told to,I started new hobbies,made new friends, thought positively, tried to better myself,and ect,yet I'm still in the same place that I was 5 years ago,wanting to just end my life and stop existing.I don't even hate my life,I have everything that a person should want right?A great family, a great friend,talent(kinda),and just genuinely things that should make me happy,so why do I still feel like this,just hopeless and miserable,even when something good happens I still feel this weight of anxiety and paranoia that its not gonna last,and anytime I think that I'm finally better I just fall back down into the same old pit over and over again.I wanna stay for my family,my friend. I don't wanna hurt them.But sometimes it becomes too much.Any advice?Thank you
