I'm going to take my life within the year. I'm at peace with this. I cant fix this, this is a goodbye to my friends and family.Dear Mom/Dad/Family/T. and Friends.

I want you to know, none of this is your fault. I am thankful for the time I've had with you, the memories we've shared. None of this is your fault. 

I wish I could put it all in better words. I'm drained, I'm broken and I simply dont feel anymore. I feel alone that I cannot put a happy face on anymore, it has been 22 years that I've carried on in silence, in this abysmal shadow, I've wanted to kill myself for so... so very long. I'm 26 and I know I will not see 30. Of all my shortcomings I thankyou for putting up with me, and I'm so sorry you have to find this.

I'd be lying if I said my self guilt has not worsened in these last few years, but as I approach 30, I have no-one, nor a home nor my own family. I fear I will find no-one, and so I'm driven to what I'm about to do. 

Please know, this is not your fault, it is mine. Know that I'll find peace in this release. 

Mom, Dad, T. 

I love you, I'll always love you.
