Is it possible to come to terms with death?I've decided to end it, nothing can change my mind. The thing is I'm always too scared. I don't know how to consciously make the fatal decision to end my life. It's not natural to have to kill yourself.  Everytime I try, I hold back because of instinct.  I've looked up ways of understanding death better or preparing for it as if I had a disease.  I can't seem to accept anything or get past the anger stage. I'm just wondering if there is anything else I can do in order to be less scared?
