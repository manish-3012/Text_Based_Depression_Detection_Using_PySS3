shit or get off the potlive or die. it's a lot harder to live. i am constantly comatose. kinda just wanna curl up in the fetal position and return to a state of inertia. the big sleep. i'm tired. i can't do anything, and i don't wanna. 

all i've been living for is self-gratification. 

eat, sleep, get high, masturbate, drink coffee, bite my nails, smoke cigarettes, browse the internet. 2 years of this, straight. i only leave the house to buy cigs and weed.

i feel guilty for posting in this subreddit. i don't think it's worth getting advice that i'll just ignore, and i'm sure others are a lot worse off and need it more.
