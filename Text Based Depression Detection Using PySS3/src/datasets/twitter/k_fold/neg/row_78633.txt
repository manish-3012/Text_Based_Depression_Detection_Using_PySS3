Even my mother has given up on meIm a 22 years old and I have BPD and bipolar disorder. My mother is the only person I have to talk to and a few days ago I had a breakdown. She told me she cannot listen to me anymore and that she is done with me. I havent heard from her since. The last person I had on this earth has finally given up on me. I think it is time i give up on myself as well. I want to kill myself but not die. I want people to understand how much I am hurting inside. Is it selfish to want to try to commit suicide but not actually want it to be successful? If it doesn't work I may finally get the help i need and if it does work I won't even know and I will be at peace with no more pain. I think it is time for me to try.
