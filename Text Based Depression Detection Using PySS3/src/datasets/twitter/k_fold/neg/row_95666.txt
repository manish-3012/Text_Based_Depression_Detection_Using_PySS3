Do I really need help?I am a loser. I used to be good at academics, but my shitty college academics have proven to be unworthy and my academics have gone downhill. Professors are unwilling to teach and students often mug up concepts to get grades. I love maths, still I have barely passed the subject. All my curiosity to study has gone. But as I am an asian, my parents have spend a lot for my education and I cannot betray them. I am currently a Junior(3rd year) pursuing electrical engineering with basically fucked up grades. I cannot stand it when a professor comes in the class, takes out his book and tells to mug up so and so article for exam and then leave. I have just wasted my life unto now. My ex left me because I was becoming a loser. My parents expect so much from me. I don't feel the urge t do anything.I just wish that I die every time I sleep. I have no motives left in life to live. I just wish there was an easy quit button for life. I don't wish to be a part of the life I am leading. And as I am not good at anything, I guess I'm not worthy enough to live on Earth.
