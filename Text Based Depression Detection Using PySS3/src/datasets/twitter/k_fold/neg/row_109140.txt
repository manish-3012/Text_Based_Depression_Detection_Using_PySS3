Housebound, fucked, going to attempt better this time.For the past fucking year I've stayed inside my room in fear and anxiety. I don't go out. I literally stay in my room.

I went through it all - therapy, medication, self help books, bouncing back to school, working and now I'm back to being staying at home in my room. I'm in my early twenties pissing them away by literally sitting in my room. The money I saved up from work is spent on delivery pizza and stress spending. I literally have 139 dollars in the bank right now. 

I fucking hate myself. I tried detaching from my issues by volunteering and helping other people but it just made me feel worse about myself. 

I have no friends. I used to have a lot and I ignored all of them. I almost finished a degree but it got too hard and I gave up. I had a fiancee and he cheated on me. 

I have a mom. I feel so shit that she lets me stay like that - even after what she did to abuse me she is trying to mend her mistakes. I have no other family. I don't even want to live for my mom. 

I have an organ disease and multiple suicide attempts. This is it. I can't spend everyday at home like this anymore. I can't go out. I don't trust people. I hate everyone. I am going to hang myself tonight.
