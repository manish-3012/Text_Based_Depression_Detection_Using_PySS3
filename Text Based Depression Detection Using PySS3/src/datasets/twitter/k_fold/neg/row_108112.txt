How am I going to wake up tomorrow?I have massive debt. Massive. Half a million dollars massive. I lost my business and have no income. Spent the weekend putting a good resume together to start a job hunt. About half an hour ago I got my truck repoed... Someone just came and took it away. I'm 3 months behind on my rent. I've been sent to collections more times than I even thought I had accounts open... 

I just dont know how I'm going to wake up tomorrow. Right now, I feel nothing. Even after watching my truck get towed away, I dont feel a thing. I'm not panicked, I'm just nothing right now. I just dont understand how I'm going to wake up tomorrow. I just dont see a solution for this. 

Every time I manage to get up and put my big girl shoes on, I get slapped down. And it's my fault but I cant find any sort of end to it. 

I dont want to kill myself. I dont want to. But I just dont know what the hell to do. What can I do? I'm exhausted. I've used up all my tears. 

I dont know, I think maybe I just wanted someone to read what I'm writing. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this. I've just... given up.
