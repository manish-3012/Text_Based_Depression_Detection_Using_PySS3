Depressed for 8 years.I don't want to commit suicide, I want the pain to end. This week I experienced true happiness for 3 days, but.... It's over. Now that i know what I've been missing out on, i just can't bring myself to keep going. I feel trapped in this world. I want to be remembered, but i don't at the same time. I read a quote that goes something like this "People die twice. Once when they stop living, and twice when they're forgotten forever."

That's one of the few things that's been keeping me alive through all of this until this year.

I'm a disappointment to my family. I'm the failure black sheep. My friends never take me seriously and bully me everyday when i just can't keep the happy attitude up. My mind is completely fucked. I feel like I'm bipolar, depressed, and i think i have sleep apnea. This is all undiagnosed btw.

Does it actually ever get better? I've made commitments to myself to never have children or get married because i don't see how it could bring me true happiness. This might be because of my parents abusive relationship with each other, but it's too late. The damage it done.

My earliest memory is my crying alone in the kitchen with a knife pointed towards my chest while my parents fought. 7 years old. That's the closest I've come to killing myself. I want to try again but I'm having trouble finding any good methods but I'm too scared to research it anymore.

I need help. I want help. I won't let people help though. Please. I don't know what to do. I want to do something big and then painlessly die. I'm too stupid to do any of it though... Please.
