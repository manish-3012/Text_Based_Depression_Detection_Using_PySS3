OutcastIt just doesnâ€™t make any sense to me that if life is always going to be a constant battle for survival then how is one supposed to relax? I just donâ€™t see how this constant chase of fulfilling my bodyâ€™s desires will lead to my freedom. This world is a shithole and Iâ€™m supposed to be fine with everything and conform to whatever bullshit I was born into? Lmao fuck that, life should be 100% without suffering/pain because I see nothing good/useful that comes out of being hurt. Iâ€™m in a constant state of anxiety and just thinking about jobs, money, socializing, etc. makes me want to run away from everything. Thereâ€™s just no hope for someone like me because being an eternal outcast is my destiny.
