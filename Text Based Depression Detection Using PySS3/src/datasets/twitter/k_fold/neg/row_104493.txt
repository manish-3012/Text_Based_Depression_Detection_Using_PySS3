What's teh fucking point? I wish I was never born.I've been a failure as far as I remember. Reminiscing back from the earlier day until today, I've never  accomplish anything in life. To make it even better I'm not even good in academic stuff or any aspects in life. I don't possess any innate talent to back me up. Man, I wish I was never born. I wish my mother aborted me so that I don't have to suffer this life anymore. I have a good life and a good family but yet some part of me want to died. I just wanna vanish, embrace the eternal void of slumber.
