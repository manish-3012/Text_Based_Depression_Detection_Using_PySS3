Idk.I just think that the idea of suicide can feel so liberating sometimes and thatâ€™s why I even consider doing it. Itâ€™s like the idea of there being a way out of here just gives me the comfort that I need. And the fact that it is a choice that I can take whenever I decide to finally call it quits, it gives me a sense of power as well as a sense of relief. 

But of course I tell myself I wonâ€™t do it yet, not before I try to change my circumstances a little more.
