I give up.I'm done, I've written my note out (it's pretty bad) and I've planned exactly how I'm going to do it. I know I won't last till the end of the week, and honestly I don't want to have to spend the rest of my life "lasting", so maybe it's a good thing. I can't spend my days cutting and crying and sleeping, in an endless cycle. I can't do it any more. And I don't have it in me to wait for that "better" that everyone says will come *eventually*.

I'm not going to choose a day, because I'm not going to wake up knowing it's the last time I have to wake up. If I'm having a good day, I don't want that to be my suicide day, so when the time comes I'll do it, I just know it's going to be this week.

When I do it, I'll go down to the train tracks, call my ex-boyfriend for some final words, and hop in front of the next coming train. It's gonna hurt for sure, but everything hurts nowadays. I'm very scared that I'll do something wrong and survive- that terrifies me and I wish I had access to a more secure way of doing it, but unfortunately a train or hanging are all I can do. 

Anyway, I just wanted to put it in words. I'm kinda hoping my ex will see this, because honestly, he's the only reason I didn't kill myself a year ago, and he's a huge reason I'm making this choice now. Thanks to this subreddit for helping me get through some especially bad nights, and I hope the others around here can get better.
