I wanted to tell someone goodbyeFor the last 9 years of my 20 year old life, I've been nothing but a burden to those around me. My pathological need to lie constantly hurting those I think I care about, my passions fading one by one, failed relationship after failed relationship because of my own faults.

I've never been good at committing to much of anything, and I've finally reached a point where I'm burnt out. I am a constant disappointment to my friends and family, I achieve so much and throw it all away because I feel so undeserving. But to top it all off, the constant physical pain I am in seems to only get worse. 

I haven't been happy in a long time, but now I don't even have a light to look forward to, so tonight, I just wanted to say goodbye.

I'm sorry for who I was.
