just wanting to vent a littlei seriously considered and even was going to overdose today. but of course as i was going, every single fucking person flocked to the kitchen. i didn't know if it would result in death, but i just wanted to be unconscious or something. it would be an act of selflessness, so people wouldn't have to bother with me anymore. i'm unfixable and forever stuck with this mental illness, so suicide almost seems like my destiny.
