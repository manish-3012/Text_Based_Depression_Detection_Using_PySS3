Who is a Suicide Attempt survivor and how do you feel about it?I wanted to ask who of you is a suicide attempt survivor. I am not sure if i am myself because my attempts happened out of a very impulsive and unpredictable mood swing because of tiny mistakes but i guess i am. Although i never got into danger in the first place.

Now anyway who of you is a survivor and how do you feel with it? Do you regret it or not and are you struggling it. Are you capable to live on undisturbed or does the day of your attempt or attempts haunt you everyday? I am looking forward to your answer. I want some people to talk to. I share my suicidial times and you yours so we won't feel alone and can motivate each other for life. I do not wanna feel alone.
