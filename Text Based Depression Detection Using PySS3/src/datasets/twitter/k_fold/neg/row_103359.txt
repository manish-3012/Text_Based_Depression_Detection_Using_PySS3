One teenager's life ruined..This is so overwhelming.I have never used reddit before for such a purpose,so if I made any mistakes please know that I am sorry.What happened tonight is one of the many triggering events of my depression and my suiucidal thoughts that come with it.I loved this gorgeus girl for one year but we broke up due to the fact that I did not want to interfere with some exams that would decide her future.She was absolutely gorgeus.I'm pretty sure she still is.Smart and Beautiful.And she understood me fully.We have not talked for two years and out of the blue she messaged me saying that she still loves me and could not get over it.We met and I had to explain to her that I cannot love her because I'm damaged goods.Since I was 5 years old all I recieved was emotional abuse from my father and grandmother.My mom had no role in this.Now,only recently I have found out that my dad has been cheating on my mom for a long time.My mom has her faults too,of course but she is redeemable.My dad is a criminal who earns his money through deceit.I cannot say more about him because I am afraid for my security.My mom cannot leave him because her pay is fucking horrible.My dad earns 4 times what my mom does.This is really just the tip of the iceberg,but I am really fucked up.Knowing that I had to let this girl leave because I cannot give her the love she deserves was the last drop.I did therapy for a while but I quit it because I cannot afford it anymore and I cannot justify therapy to my parents because they wouldn't understand.There are a lot of things left unsaid but the point I'm trying to make is that I've had enough.I cannot love,I do not have friends,I am handicapped socially,I have no money and what they're giving me is peanuts(I have to work in order to purchase something I want),I have to cook for myself,I have to wash and iron my own clothes,I have to go to the doctor's by myself and many more...I've had enough.I want to die,I don't want to commit suiucide because I do not have the balls..I regret being so smart and realising a lot of things i really shouldn't given my fragile age of only 17 years old.Why would the universe want me here?I am a weakling.I do not deserve to procreate.I cannot be a succesful person because I cannot perform academically given the abuse and torment I have to withstand every day.I am also worried for my kid sister.I do not want anything to happen to her and she is the only reason I did not commit suiucide.
