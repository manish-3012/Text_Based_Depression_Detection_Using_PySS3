I cannot remember the last time I was happyI just kind of exist. I drift through the days, looking forward to nothing, enjoying nothing. It's been this way for years. Therapy didn't help. I have stopped planning for the future because there is no future for me. At night, I can sometimes hear the creaking of the rope. When there's no difference between life and death, what's the point in putting effort into life?
