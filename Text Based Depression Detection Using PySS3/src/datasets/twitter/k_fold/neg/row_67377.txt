Tired of being me. I want to start over.I get it, like no ones a burden or whatever.
But what if I say really bad things, and do bad shit over and over again. I keep telling myself that no I won't fuck up this time. That this time I'll be a good person but I always screw it up...

I have hurt all my relationships. I have soiled whatever positivity i have in life with my behaviour. Everything I love doing I have some association with me doing something bad. There are games I can't play anymore and things I can't do because I associate them with guilt. 

Guilt is literally killing me, which is pretty screwed up when i NEED it so i don't mess up anymore. I don't want to seem like im acting the victim in a situation, but in reality im a pussy who cant handle taking responsibillity for my actions. I break down and I never stop blaming myself

I want to die so that people can be free of the negative shit i bring into their lives. And there's no escape, no punishment great enough for what a bad person I think I am. 

I've isolated myself for weeks now because I can't handle who I am, and when I meet people i always do something wrong. I'm lonely but it's for the best, so I can't hurt more people. I feel absolutely disgusting.
