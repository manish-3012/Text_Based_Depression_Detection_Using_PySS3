I need to know why I survivedI need to know, because honestly, I'm so close to hurting myself or doing something worse right now. I'm not sure I'm going to make it some days. 

Nothing and no one has been fair to me. I just know life can't get any better than this. not for me at least. 

I survived a car accident, but now I wish I just died. I've also been through some other things which I've posted about recently but I have no energy to talk about it again. 

People don't care about me. there's no hope and no love for me out there, and there never will be.

If there's some sort of painless poison for me to take right now to fall asleep and never wake again I might as well take it.
