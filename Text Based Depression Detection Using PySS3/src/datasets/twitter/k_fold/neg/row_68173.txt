I Tried to Kill Myself 2 Years in a RowOn November 23, 2014 and November 23, 2015 I tried to kill myself. These were not my only attempts but most notable. I just made it past yesterday without self harming or attempting (Unless you count getting a tattoo) I wish I could say that this is an example of recovery being possible (And it kinda is) but now I'm just sitting here wishing I had done something...wishing I were dead or at least in the hospital. I feel like I wasted my chance and now I have to wait another miserable year. I don't want to hurt my family but I hate being here so much. Thanks for listening to my stupid thoughts.
