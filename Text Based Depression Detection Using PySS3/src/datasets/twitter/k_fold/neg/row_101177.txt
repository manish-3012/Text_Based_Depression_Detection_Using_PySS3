Please help me... I feel like everything is catching me up... Like I am running and if I stop something horrid is going to catch me.
 I feel like my entire world is on a sheet that is being turned vertical... But everyone stays still and no one notices my whole world slipping and me sliding with it.. clinging on by my finger nails as to not fall into the darkness. Why does nobody see me fading away? I want to die so badly, but I know I haven't got the courage to do it. I want to do it. Is that so bad? Does it make me a coward not to be able to do it? Or does it make me a coward for trying to escape? I've put knives in my wrists and ropes around my neck, I've walked out in front of buses and  I've walked right up to the edge of subway platforms as the trains whizz by... But I never do it properly. I always know I am never going to go all the way and finally put a stop to it all. Which terrifies me... Makes me think there is lower to sink yet. I can't handle it getting worse. I would rather just end it now.
