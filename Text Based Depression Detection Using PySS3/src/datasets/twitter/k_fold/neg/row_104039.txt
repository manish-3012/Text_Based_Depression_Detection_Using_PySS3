i wish someone caredstaring at the skyline wondering where everything went wrong in my life. i come and stare at the ocean and the stars whenever iâ€™m feeling like this. too bad light pollution sucks. wish i had someone with me right now to just sit here with me. i donâ€™t even need anyone to talk to i just wish someone genuinely cared about me.
