Please help, I'm at my rope's end.Basically,

I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered

And I hate it so much,

So fucking much

And I want nothing more than to be fr

But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer

I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th

And I want to be saved

I've been trying to save myself

But I know no one can save me

I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it

Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister

The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings

I jsut want to die

Then there's the whole layer of more "normal" trauma

My family treated me like shit 

My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance

Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment

My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more

So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake

My feelings are never listened to

The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!

I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE

WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA

"Relax, you thrived"

"Don't blame your father" It was totally all his fault

"Imagine being the mom of that child!", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!

She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him

There's just, sooo much

And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people ("You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble.

I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse.

My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me). I was loyal and did that

&amp;#x200B;

And suffered through all of this hell because of that decision
