Probabky going to kill myself soonIâ€™m socially an idiot and hate being alone. Iâ€™m too far gone now that Iâ€™m turning 23 and didnâ€™t have the time in youth to develop social skills since I was a kid. Not only does this prevent me from talking to girls I like, it prevents me from having friends and being successful with school or a potential career. I never really had friends or a girlfriend growing up. Also, if I had to guess why, Iâ€™d say my self-confidence is lacking because of the way people picked on me growing up. I hate looking in the mirror and feeling incapable and not knowing how Iâ€™m perceived by others. I hate not knowing if Iâ€™m ugly or not or if things can change. All I know is that nothing feels positive. It all feels hopeless and I canâ€™t shake it.

I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to do it but I just have a feeling that 2020 will be my last year alive.
