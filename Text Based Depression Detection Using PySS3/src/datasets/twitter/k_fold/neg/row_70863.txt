Back to zero days cleanYesterday, after a year of progress I once again succumbed to self harm. I used to tell myself that it was just a phase, that I'll get over this, and I did. I was doing so good. Until everything went to shit this year, and everything I've worked on was just gone.

I'm in college, broke, in debt, and my parents can't support me and my sibling and even themselves. There are days where I don't eat, days where there's constant yelling, fighting, arguing. 

I have no real friends, and the one person I trust I can't even or don't want to talk to now in the fear of driving them away with my sadness. 

I can't seem to study, nearly failing, and the little drive I have I use up in playing all day every day just to distract myself.

But after all this I can't seem to feel anything. I might end it soon, if only I had the courage to finally do it.
