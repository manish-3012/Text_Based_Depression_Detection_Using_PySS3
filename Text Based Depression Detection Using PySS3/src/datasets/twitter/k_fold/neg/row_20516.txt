Everyone in this world is so meanThis week, i deleted twitter on my phone because im tired of seeing people harassing each other on that site daily (ok tbh its mostly the kpop stans harassing people). Ive spent hours blocking people but i still see that stuff daily. Today, a mutual of mine said something rlly homophobic so i had to block them. I dont think ill ever be able to feel comfortable around anyone because one day theyre going to turn out to be mean. I have friends who i thought were super nice but one day they start calling people slurs. I dont want to live in a world full of mean people anymore. Im so tired of it.
