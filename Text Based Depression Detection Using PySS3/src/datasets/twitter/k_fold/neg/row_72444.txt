I want to do itI want to do it. I don't enjoy living at all, it's not for me. Why do we have to live even if we don't want to? I am not 'normal' I don't do normal things, I hate everything. I need to get a job but I can't do that, I can't imagine people staring at me everyday, secretly judging my every move, watching them leave and laugh about me. I can't stay at home though, it's not fair on my mum, she shouldn't have to work so hard to keep me when I'm a useless cunt. I wish I could just stop existing so that the very few people that care wouldn't get hurt. That's all that's stopping me, those few, as much as I love them I hate them for keeping me here, I don't know what to do.
