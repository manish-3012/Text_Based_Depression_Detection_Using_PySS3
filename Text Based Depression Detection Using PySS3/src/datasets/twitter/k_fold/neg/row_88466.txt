looking at other people with their couples makes me fucking melancholy.looking at other people enjoying life, having friends which they are comfortable around (that hasn't happened to me since i was 5), seeing them out with their soulmates. makes me think of how me and my crush would be together. if only i didn't look like a distorted pumpkin with dyslexia. i can't even start a conversation with the person i like because i'm always like: "she doesn't give a fuck about me"

 "what do i say to her that doesn't feel like small talk"

"no if i say that she will judge me forever"

"if i do this she will lose interest in me"  


and the worst part, i keep attracting people in my life which i DONT WANT. EVERY. FUCKING. TIME. the only people a fucking incel attracts are about as equally ugly as how the incel is. not making fun or judging any incels here, just making a statement.  
i wish death was acceptable to society. and that people didn't see it just as "making your family sad" or whatever the fuck. i could just hook up the plugs, inject something like cyanide in my bloodstream and let the wonderful, sweet release of death slip me beneath the waves.
