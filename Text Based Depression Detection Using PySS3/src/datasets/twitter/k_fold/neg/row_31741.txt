The World Was Beautiful For A DayI'm a senior in high school right now, and have been dealing with major depressive disorder or possibly bipolar since 10th grade (with symptoms since birth). This has caused me to sabotage destroy every single relationship and shred of happiness my life has ever known. I have frequent suicidal thoughts, and occasional attempts, and battle with drug addiction. All in secret. With abusive parents, I came out an abusive person. I abused friends, girlfriends, and myself. Life had been pretty regular before 10th grade, with something kind of missing (which I assume is normal). Once the depression hit, everything was juste empty. Friends didn't make me happy, things I used to love like film and comics were boring. I'm majoring in music next year at a conservatory, yet music doesn't even intrigue me anymore. It's like everything became pointless, a feeling many of you are probably familiar with, unfortunately. Then it happened. I fell in love. Such an intimate connection that whenever I was with her my life became meaningful. After a while, we started to date. Just like every other time, I abused her emotionally and forced her away. After only two months of "dating" but about a year of this extremely close relationship, she broke up with me. Now every second of every day I'm plagued to know what I did to her. I was EVIL. I drove her away, into the arms of someone else. No one other than my closest friend. After reconnecting with her soon after the break up, we're now at the point where she says she loves me and has these strong feelings for me still, but also has feelings for him. This did WONDERS for my depression. That was both sarcastic and literal, because of course that made me feel the lowest of lows, but at least I FELT. She made me (and makes me) happier than anyone else ever has. I've seen the two extremes of life and feel like now, I have LIVED. I gained a new perspective, I saw the stars and clouds and trees in a totally new light. I was in the deepest of sorrows, yet found the beauty in everything. Music was AMAZING again. After a few days now, nothing has really changed...but I feel like I'm reverting back to where I was for the past few years. I'm losing this appreciation for the world. I don't know what to do. I love her. I changed myself after months of self loathing, I accepted myself as a good person regardless of all the terrible things I did to her and so many other people who trusted me to PROTECT them from harm. I truly am a changed person. I experienced LIFE. Now I'm terrified to lose it. I'm terrified to lose her. I accepted that regardless of the feelings we have for each other, there's no way we're getting back together. Fuck. This is just rambling. This isn't even coherent. Why the fuck am I saying this? I fucking ruined it. I DESERVE this. FUCK. Right now he's at her house just down the street. She's supposed to come over after he leaves. Fuck. This is too long. Fuck. I don't know what I hope to gain from posting this. I'm being so fucking bitchy. Fuck. I can't end it. She relies on me. I want ONE THING. I HAD IT. I FUCKING RUINED IT. ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT ARE THE TEARS SHE CRIED AND HOW FUCKING APATHETIC I WAS TO IT. WHY COULDN'T I JUST FUCKING CHANGE FOR HER UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE?! WHY THE FUCK ARE WE EVEN ALIVE. SOME PEOPLE JUST AREN'T MEANT TO BE HERE. How do I convince her to let me do it? I know my parents won't care. My friends can deal with it. They have each other. They all hate me anyway. I'm fucking WORTHLESS. I'M EVIL. WHY DOESN'T THIS POST MAKE ANY FUCKING SENSE. I JUST WANT ONE THING. I'LL DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO HAVE JUST THIS ONE THING, BUT NOW IT'S TOO FUCKING LATE FOR ME TO BE HAPPY ANYMORE. THE REST OF MY LIFE I'M DAMNED TO REMEMBER THE PAIN I CAUSED HER BECAUSE I'M LIVING IT RIGHT NOW. DAMNED TO REMEMBER THE MISTAKE I MADE THAT I CAN NEVER TAKE BACK, NEVER FUCKING REDEEM. HOW DO I GET HER TO LET ME JUST FUCKING DO IT?!
