I'm gonna go take all the ativan I can find in my houseWhy the hell should I keep going? Guys don't want to date me. I can't even get a guy with low standards. I don't know what I'm going to do or the rest of my life. I don't know what the hell I'm doing in college. My grades suck. My job sucks. I'm stuck. My depression and anxiety are just getting worse. It doesn't get better. Why should I go on when everything hurts so much? It just doesn't seem worth it.
