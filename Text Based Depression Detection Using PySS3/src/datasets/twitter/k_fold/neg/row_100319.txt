I'm fucking trashI got into another wreck today. This is my third one in five years. I had a passenger in the car since I'm an Uber/Lyft driver and I slammed into a guy in front of me in rush hour traffic. He was moving when I looked at the light a few hundred feet away. In fact, why didn't I see him in my peripheral vision? Luckily it wasn't at full speed but still... I'm not too sure on the coverage since it was changed recently. I know we have liability but... I feel like a failure and like I'm incompetent. I'm always anxiois, always paranoid and I'm too emotional and sensitive. I haven't felt real in over a year. I don't deserve to be happy. I've been on and off suicidal but Im too afraid to do anything. Idk what happens when we die. Im scared ill be in hell or limbo and sometimes im afraid ill just not exist. I want to be reborn into someone else, but at the same time what about my mom and fiance here??  Or i wanna be in heaven or even a spirit or something but i just dont believe in it anymore
