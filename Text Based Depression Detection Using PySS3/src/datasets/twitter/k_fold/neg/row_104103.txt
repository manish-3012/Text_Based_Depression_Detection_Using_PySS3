Out of touch.Been struggling for a long time now. No friends. No connection to my family. No relationship for a while now. I always thought to myself, people say going away is selfish, but isnâ€™t it more selfish of them to keep me here. 

You donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like waking up to a black hole everyday for years now. Even if you do, youâ€™ve never been in my black hole. Itâ€™s dark. Void of warmth. But it comforts me.

Waking up used to hurt. Sleeping used to hurt. Dreaming used to hurt. Now it doesnâ€™t hurt anymore. 

The lows are higher than the highs now. I donâ€™t feel anymore. I canâ€™t feel anyone anymore. Iâ€™ve been gone for 15 years already. No one would know. Maybe I need to catch up with myself. Happy holidays.
