Was in a porn video once when I was 19, two years later and I want to kill myself because of itHappened when I was struggling with undiagnosed PTSD from a sexual assault. I got on meds and got therapy and was only in that industry for a couple months. I made one video and I didn't do anything except kiss her, but we were naked. I feel like I was using that and camming to take back control of my body. Now I completely regret it. I feel ashamed and every time this girl (who is still in the business) shares the video on her twitter I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself. I have tried to reach out as she used to be a very good friend, but she hasn't spoken to me since. I feel so disgusting. I feel hopeless. I know people from our highschool know about her so I'm sure they've seen the video. I honestly just want to kill myself. I am so fucking stupid.
