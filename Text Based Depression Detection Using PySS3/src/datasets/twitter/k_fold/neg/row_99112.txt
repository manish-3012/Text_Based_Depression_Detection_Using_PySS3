I wish I had the guts to just do it.I just want it to be over, I'm so tired physically and mentally of being here. Nobody has ever truly cared about how I am, they just act like they do so they can use me for stuff. My dumb ass always falls for it too. I'm sick of hearing the classics, "It gets better", "Everyone is sad sometimes". I've told a few people how I feel and they never check on me, and hell, we don't even talk anymore. I've been miserable the last 3 years of my life and I just can't take it anymore. I'm sick of living for other people and the feeling that people will miss me is gone. Only thing stopping me is that I can never work up enough courage to just do it...
