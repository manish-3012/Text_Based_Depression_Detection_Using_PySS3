Iâ€™m debating weather to do it or notMy fiancÃ©e split up with me 2 weeks back but she never gave me a reasons why apart from that I was in the army. Now sheâ€™s treating me like Iâ€™ve done wrong and saying I need to give her money that I owe but I donâ€™t owe her nothing and everytime she messages me I get an urge to end it all because I wonâ€™t have to feel this loneliness and pain
