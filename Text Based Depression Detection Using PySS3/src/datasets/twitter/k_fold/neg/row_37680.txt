Dropping outBeen pretty down these past few months and now I decided to drop out this school year to take my mind off of things. I've been dealing with social anxiety and depression for the past 6 years. Though my parents are very supportive of me other family members can't seem to understand the mental illness that I'm having trouble with. They often say that I don't have ambition in life and just too lazy to go to school.
