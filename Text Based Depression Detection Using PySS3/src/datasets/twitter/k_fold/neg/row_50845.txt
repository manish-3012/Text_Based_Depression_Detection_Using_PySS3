NothingRecently I've been saddened by how alone I feel how my "friends" know about this yet only a few try to help, I've been depressed for years and have thought about suicide before but held back for fear of what it would do to people now I know they won't care a couple of nights ago I was walking home alone at midnight when I just stood in the middle of a highway and closed my eyes nothing ever came so I walked off I've told people but the most of a response that I've gotten other than from the same few was "not on my doorstep please" they taunt me to do it I don't know why I shouldn't anymore either.
