Better location: where I work or where I live?Seriously thinking of overdosing on my medication (dualoxatine) and trying to decide if it's better to kill myself where I live or where I work? Obviously not in my home ðŸ˜‚ but probably a remote part of the city. I just don't want to survive this time however I attempt it; my insurance won't cover another trip to the ER, and I don't want to saddle my partner with debt.
