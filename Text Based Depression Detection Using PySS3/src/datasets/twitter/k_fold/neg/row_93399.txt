I'm done. Hopefully my last time on the internetI'm 17 years old, diagnosed with a bunch of bullshit depression and anxiety claims. Haven't been going to school for the past month and am probably gonna fail my courses Unless I do some assignments. My girlfriend broke up with me. I lost the only few thousand I had left margin trading. I have no ambitions in life other than wanting to make YouTube videos playing PUBG but I'm really bad at editing and have no motivation to do anything of that sort. Probably gonna try to OD on xanax and clonazepam and get as high as I can before I die. This is a plea for someone to talk me out of it. I tried to talk and get help but I was put in the hospital for 3 days under a form 42 which makes it so I can't do shit other than lie in bed for 3 days straight, so no. I'm not gonna fucking talk to anyone.
