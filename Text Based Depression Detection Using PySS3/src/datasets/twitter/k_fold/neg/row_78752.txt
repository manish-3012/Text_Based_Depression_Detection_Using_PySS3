A positive-ish postI donâ€™t talk much, itâ€™s probably for the better, but something Iâ€™ve learned from my bouts with melancholy is that social media amplifies everything. (Yes, reddit included)  
Before I deleted my Instagram a few weeks ago, I wanted to see if I could prove this. That day I was looking for sad stuff, so I looked up cutting, as I read through posts my already low emotions began to drop deeper, the gut-wrenching feeling of wanting everything to just go away grew from a pebble to a stone. I felt miserable since the things they posted made me feel pitiful and hopeless, as if the world is a shitty place and everyone is worse off than you. Knowing that there is nothing you can do only tears you apart more.

Then. I logged off and deleted my account.

Since then I havenâ€™t gotten a lot better but I havenâ€™t gotten worse. The constant resistance from getting up every day has decreased, the waking up to read about people with more sadness than I am in, is gone. Feels selfish right? Thinking only about yourself?  

Yet, itâ€™s far from it.

Focus on you. Focus on getting better. Whether itâ€™s just getting the motivation to get up in the morning. Whether itâ€™s getting on the internet to apply for that job at the hardware store down the street. Whether itâ€™s putting that $20 in the bank instead of buying 3 packs of cigarettes. Focus. Focus. Focus. (What my teachers back in high school used to say before they realized I have ADHD)

Canâ€™t focus on you? Focus on something else. (More specifically, helping something/someone else) Make an appointment with Red Cross to donate blood, walk over to the library and ask them what books theyâ€™d recommend to learn something new... python coding is in demand. Maybe walk a few miles to the park, and sit on a bench, youâ€™d be surprised the amount of dogs you get to pet.

Melancholy doesnâ€™t â€œgo awayâ€ someone who says â€œcheer up, youâ€™ll be fineâ€ has no idea what theyâ€™re talking about.
But I can say this, try some things and you may reach a time where melancholy is no longer riding shotgun telling you how to live your life.
