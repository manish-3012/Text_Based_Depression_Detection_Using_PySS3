Every thought.I'm currently riddled with anxiety and the can't even.  The only calm to any of this is the yearning for deaths door.  Why am I thinking like this, it can't be healthy but fuck am I in a fuck ton of pain.  The worst emotional pain I have ever been in.. I don't know how to be above it, it's been constant for the last two months.
