constant thoughts of perishmentjumping off a building. everyday research. 46 metres of height is sure to kill you. thinking of a day, thinking of the letters ill leave behind. every minute of my day is just scenarios of me falling and reaching the ground. 

im scared. im 16. and im bipolar. 

this coming week, death is just around the corner and i have gone completely numb.
