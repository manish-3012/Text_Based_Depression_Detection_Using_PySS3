Well, I'm back.You know, I had hoped I wouldn't see you guys again but, here I am. This is my second post not including an update here within a month or two. Unfortunately things have not gone up like I had hoped. Good news is, I'm over the girl. bad news is the stress of life is unbearable. About an hour ago was the fourth time I've broken down since last being here. Stress is coming in from many different places such as family life, school, and relationships. So far my family is fighting as always and my mom is applying a whole damn lot of pressure on me about having C's as well as one class that I'm failing. School is stressful because its numerous ways of learning can't conform to what the individual needs. Relationships are sorta sucking in the way I can't get one. I know its a little bit silly but having one would improve my life a ton. Now same as my first post, I really don't want to die, but seeing my life from my eyes, its pointless. I spend my entire life trying to make someone or anyone happy in little ways and I get crap for it. My anger is getting out of hand and I've tried meditating to little avail. I don't know if anyone will read this and I doubt some people care, but I hope that you guys do and can help me in some way. So please, help.
