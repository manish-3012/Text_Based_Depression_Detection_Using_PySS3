i hate this shit lifeI can't fucking take it anymore, I'm tired of being me, I'm tired of being my family's failure. I fucking hate it. I can't fucking picture myself as a responsable adult. I'm obviously not gonna make it past 18. I'm failing school, I'm alone no one cares and I can't do anything about it because I'm a fucking coward and tell anyone about it. and I'm too scared to commit suicide so I'm fucking stuck here. I wanna end it so bad but I'm too scared. I hate it
