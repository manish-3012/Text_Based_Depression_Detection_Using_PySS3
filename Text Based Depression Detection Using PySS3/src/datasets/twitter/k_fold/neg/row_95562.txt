Crying in my carHavenâ€™t cried in a long time. It felt good for a moment but now Iâ€™m back to feeling hollow. Most days Iâ€™m on autopilot and I can function by just getting thru like a zombie but then you have those days of clarity, like today. I think I feel worse than I did before crying tbh. Iâ€™ve accomplished absolutely nothing and have no one. Honestly life wouldnâ€™t be so bad if I had one friend in my life to help me through, to laugh with and confide in. Havenâ€™t had a good friend like that since I was 18, Iâ€™m 22 now. Yes thatâ€™s still relatively young in the scheme of things, but also itâ€™s not that young either. No degree and dads job required us to move constantly. So no long term relationships whatsoever. I deleted my Instagram because I canâ€™t bare seeing everyone else living their lives with friends and school while I have nothing. Iâ€™m just teetering on the edge. I pray almost daily that a car will collide into me or Iâ€™ll somehow die in a freak accident. Donâ€™t bother saying I have anyone to live for Iâ€™ve heard it all before and saying that cliche shit never helped anyone.
