Hey it's meYou guys ever had a problem with motivation? Pretty redundant question considering my audience, but it's a good opener. I just don't care enough about doing things, I wake up, I passively wait through my day and I fall asleep, most often without even realising it. I have no interest in playing games, meeting people or killing myself. I just don't have the drive anymore. I did something a few days ago, and it was something I always wanted to do, I stopped a thief, he tried to rob someone and I got the money back. And I hate that I did that because now I'll never be able to reach that same happiness because I can't just go out looking for crimes. I'm just sitting in my room, no motivation to go out or do anything except wait for when I pass out.
