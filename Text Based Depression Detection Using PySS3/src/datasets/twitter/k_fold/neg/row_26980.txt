My girlfriend broke up with me because she â€œcanâ€™t see herself being in a long term relationship with a manâ€Iâ€™m heartbroken. My (now ex) girlfriend of two years broke up with me because she couldnâ€™t see herself being with a man long term. She broke up and got back together with me 4 times over the past month or two because she wanted to make it work, and this time was the last. My home life is terrible and she was genuinely the only thing that made me happy. I have trouble connecting with people, but we instantly made a connection two years ago. I donâ€™t know what to do. I havenâ€™t really eaten or slept much since it happened Monday. My chest hurts and my pulse is super fast and hard, And Iâ€™m having heart palpitations. Most likely benign but itâ€™s still rough. Iâ€™ve never felt this awful. I want to drop my college courses. I failed a test and messed up on very important assignments because I was so upset I just couldnâ€™t focus at all. I feel so fucking awful. Iâ€™m already struggling with suicidal ideation and now I think it just pushed me over the edge. I canâ€™t stop thinking about her.
