I dont know what to do anymore.It's about my girlfriend. Shes had the worst life she could possibly live, and it's getting much worse and affecting me. Recently, some really bad things have happened. I live in Britain where lockdown is happening, meaning I cant see her at all. I'm the only one that can make her happy. All of her 'friends' have started seriously bullying her and out pastoral manager wont do anything about it. Shes being taken away from her family for god knows how long. She cuts herself every day. Now, a week ago, she was diagnosed with cancer. Her state of life is so bad shes had 2 major suicide attempts recently, one of them she almost cut her hand off. Theres nothing I can do to stop and help her. Shes all I have. And, if she goes, I'll have nothing left.
