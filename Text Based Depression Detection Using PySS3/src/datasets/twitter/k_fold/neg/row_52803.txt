I think tomorrow will be my last dayI tried so hard to continue going on but everyday is the same. I dont even know if I have the balls to do it, but iâ€™ve made up my mind in trying to do it. Iâ€™ve had to drop out of high school due to illness i got from my cheating ex-girlfriend, who i thought i loved and she was the last thing i had. My mom disowned me and im now living with a friends parents. They tell me im not a burden but i know i am. Nothing of mine is truly mine iâ€™ve lost my job due to this illness as well and no matter how low of a job i go i cannot get one. There is a lot more to this story but, just going over this in my head has worsened it. If my mom ever finds this or any of my friends and family finds this just know im sorry i never meant to be a letdown and i promise i wont be missed. Goodbye
