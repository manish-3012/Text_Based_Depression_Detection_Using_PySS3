Roommate's gf acting strange - should I be worried?Hey SW, this is the only place this made sense to post. I wish this could be someone else posting, but she's not that lucid right now. My roommate's gf has been acting really weird (hallucinating, nonverbal, pretty much catatonic). She's diagnosed with OCD and on meds and everything, and I know they've recently changed her meds. To be honest, I don't know if she's taken a single one and this is some kind of Seratonin-storm-like kinda thing, or if she's been taking them and this is some kind of interaction. I just caught her with a handful of Motrin that she tried to sneak into the bedroom, but when I caught it she was smiling and mischevious, not exactly what I'd call suicidal behaviour.

I've known this girl only a few months, and she's definitely eccentric. She sleeps 14-18 hours a day, sometimes more, but she always seems to get her homework done, so until now, it's been a non-issue. Now, that laziness, combined with the new behaviour, is threatening her final exams, her GPA, and pretty much her entire academic career.

Her boyfriend / my roommate is at wit's end. He's got his own shit to deal with, and he has no idea what to do. It's shocking how fast this onset, best-case scenario this has all started over the last 12 hours. That's the only reason I'm so confused. My roommate won't doubt her, and I've offered to take her to the ER if we feel that her health is in danger. For now, she's made it out to the sofa, but she insists that she bring her gerbils with her. She's still (purportedly) seeing aliens everywhere, and will only communicate via text message. Does this make any sense to anyone? Should I be worried?

EDIT: Thanks for the advice, everyone. She's currently in a Concentrated Nursing Unit under 24h surveillance, and they think this is just a bad reaction to the Prozac. Apparently the symptoms gradually appeared, and it took a drastic change in her behaviour for us to notice, and I feel terrible I didn't investigate sooner. She's no longer scared or anxious, and everything seems to be under control.
