any adults reading this?I'm 25. I've been reading over some of these other posts.. and I know I shouldn't compare... but I am truly alone. My roommates won't be back for several more weeks (they are away on externships). I don't speak with my family very often.. I could kill myself tonight and no one would know for weeks. Should I just do it? You can read my previous posts for details because I just don't have the energy to go into it all again. I just really have no reason to prolong my life. I'm a waste of space.
