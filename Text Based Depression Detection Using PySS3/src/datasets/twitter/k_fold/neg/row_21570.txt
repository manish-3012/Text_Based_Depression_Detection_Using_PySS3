Anyone want to have a convo?I haven't talked to anyone in a couple months, at least not more than "how's it going?" or "thanks". I've been pretty out of it. I have chemical use problems, weirdness problems, and so on. I quit my dead end job out of suicidality. So for the last two months I've been trying to decide whether to die or go live in the woods. I cut myself really bad a few weeks ago. My body is covered in scars. For real. You've probably never seen anything like it. I'm a freak at this point. That's cool. Ok whatever. I still care about people and good things. But it's hard to not want to fuck myself up. Hmm. I couldn't really explain how it's been. But it's uncomfortable. I don't particularily want to die. My brain is pretty messed up bu this point though. Anyway, hello.
