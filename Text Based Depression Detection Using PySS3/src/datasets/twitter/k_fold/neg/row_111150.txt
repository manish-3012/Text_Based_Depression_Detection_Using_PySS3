repeating cyclesi am meant to hand in my masters dissertation this week and for the past two months Iâ€™ve done nothing, i have adhd and working from home has been impossible and I have just been having constant arguments with my girlfriend and we repeat these cycles and Iâ€™ll always repeat these cycles no matter what. The stress and the adrenaline and the rush of reconciliation repeats, she blocks me and then wonders why Iâ€™m unable to focus on literally anything else Iâ€™m done and this is the last time. I canâ€™t see any end to this cycle Iâ€™m addicted to and it never disappears it just merges into something new Iâ€™m taking control.
