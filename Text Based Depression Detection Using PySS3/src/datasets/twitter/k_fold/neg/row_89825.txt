Tomorrow is my 25th birthday, I'm in a mental hospital thinking about ending my life tonight.For the past 1/3 of my life I've been suffering from physical pain in my upper body, anxiety and a schizotypal personality disorder.
For the past months I've been out of my real life, admitted to the mental hospital due to constant stomach pain, dizziness and being unable to function.
I want my old shitty life back. 
You don't know what you have until is gone is so true. At this point my shitty state of being prior to the stomach pain seems manageable despite being living with lots of limitations.
In regards to my stomach pains, the doctors have found an ovary cyst that requires surgery, as well as a polyp with dysplasia that's up for further testing.
Even though I'm having these tangible things to moove on with, I'm struggling seeing the worth of my existence as I'm staying alive not to live.
I mean, the world is overcrowded anyway and evolution didn't have the greatest plans for me by all means.
I have a great supportive family, relatives, and even staffmembers at this place to reach out to, yet it feels like there's a wall keeping me from them. Knowing that telling them how close I am to the edge, will  make them lock me up, so now I'm here where there is no wall, hoping someone can knock some hope into my scull.
thanks for reading..
