It's all falling apart. And I fell there is nothing more to do.I'm close to losing my job because I have a hard time getting out of my bed because of my extreme anxiety and depression. I don't know what to do anymore l. If I lose my job, I'll fail my education And just wasted my time for the 4th time. But this time I am so close to the finish line. I'm done in March. On top of that my girlfriends mental health is declining and she is ready to leave everyone behind her including me, her family and friends. So I'm starting to lose hope. If I lose her I will lose my job. And if I lose my job I will not be able to pay rent or help my girlfriend. So I fell like its all falling apart and I can't do anything about it anymore. I am so extremely exhausted and I'm certain that soon ill end up killing myself. So right now I'm just waiting for it all to fall down, or be lucky to get through it and still end up being unemployed in April. Existence is not worth it anymore.
