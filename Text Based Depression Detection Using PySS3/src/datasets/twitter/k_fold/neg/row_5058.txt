Itâ€™s a passive decay.Every single day is a loss. Every joke I make; every smile I perform; every time I speak a part of my soul leaves my body. 

Itâ€™s exhausting being alive. 

The moment I open my eyes the calling of death starts murmuring. No matter how happy the day was or how energetic  I was, itâ€™s always the same at the end of the day: I wish I was dead. 

Thereâ€™s no stimulus, no fun, no friends, no change, no energy. 

Lifeâ€™s in the way, and at this point Iâ€™d rather skip the wait.
