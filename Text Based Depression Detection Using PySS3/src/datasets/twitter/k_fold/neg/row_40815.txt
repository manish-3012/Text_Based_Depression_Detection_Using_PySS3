I don't know anymore.I sit here writing this because i don't know what to do anymore. I feel so alone and i don't wanna be here anymore, every time at night i curl up in bed and just think about how fucked up life is and how i have to be happy around my "friends". My family has no clue i'm like this, my friends don't have any idea because i just seem happy, i always fake a smile and i guess it seems to be working.

Sorry this is so stupidly wrote, i'm just shaking and i can't even think straight

I just want help, yet i'm scared to ask for it.
