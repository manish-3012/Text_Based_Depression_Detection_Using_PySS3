I do not understand. Everything I do for myself is to break the cycle of wanting to kill myself, yet I always return.Iâ€™ve always felt off. Like some part of me was incorrect, wrong, or missing. Itâ€™s a feeling Iâ€™ve had since I started being able to have memories. 

I have explored this feeling to the farthest reaches I can imagine. I have tried to find myself in various religions or scientific theories that make me feel as if I have a purpose. I have tried sports, gaming, social events, helping my community, and finding a â€œpassionâ€ for my career. I have tried therapy, antidepressants, and experimenting with my consciousness, and looking to family members for help. 

Yet, at 18. Here I am still. 

I have convinced myself not to commit suicide, logically it makes sense to me. I do not know what possibilities await me (if any) on the other side. It is better to stick with the devil you know than the one you donâ€™t. I still though, feel like I want to kill myself frequently. Suicidal ideation never stops in my head, it is always a reoccurring event no matter what I do. 

I am merely coping with existence. I want to feel alive. I want to feel as if this isnâ€™t a trap, but a gift. Is there any logical reasoning in addition to actions I could take that could provide me with that feeling? I want to know what is wrong, and correct the problem. Iâ€™m open to do anything, I just want it to be and feel right.
