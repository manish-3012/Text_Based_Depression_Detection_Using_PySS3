Crying in my bed 24th night in a rowIm so tired of being around. There's 7 billion people on the planet. There is enough without me. 

I'm tired of crying every night and I'm tired of not enjoying anything, except for conversations with a certain person who hates me.

I physically don't enjoy most of anything anymore. I used to love playing sports, and playing video games, and going to school but now I hate all of them. 

I worked my ass off this summer and I didn't make my school sports team.
I studied my butt off for 14 hours on world history ap, and I only got an 80 on the final.
I got a PS4 that I saved up for but now everytime I look at it, it reminds me of how pathetic I am and my lack of friends.

I had 2 pillars in my life keeping my afloat. One was sports, which crumbled this year. And the other was my best friend wish is still crumbling.

I have had a lot of suicide idealization within the past 6 months. It would be so fucking easy to drop off of the face of this planet. I self harm to cope with the fact I will never be ready for the world because I have had no social experience, no true aspirations, and no reason to live. 

I'm not going to do anything to irrational tonight. I don't have supplies and I need to ATLEAST wait until the holidays are over. 

In the summer I plan on either killing myself or running away with about 150$ and whatever I can fit in my backpack.
