Just another eveningAnd another day has passed where I know she is laying in his arms again.. and im sitting here and think about her.. and the last 6 Years we spend together.



I know you still "love" me.

I know you just need to clear your mind.

I know it doesnt really mean anything for you.

I know you still want to be friends, even tho I cant handle it, obviously.

I know you will come back to me some day, it was your promise after all.



But still im sitting here, so hurt I cant think about anything else. And I know I will cry myself to sleep again tonight, and try to do my best not to think about Suicide again. I mean, would it even matter? You already got someone "new", I guess you wont even miss me..
Tomorrow we will mayben even meet again, I will be happy, until u leave again.. And i will suffer again.
Why cant i just forget you?

I wish I could describe better what i feel in English, but sadly i dont know english enough..
