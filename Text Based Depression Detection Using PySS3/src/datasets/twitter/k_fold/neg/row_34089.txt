I'm turning 33 at the end of this month and i feel i'm doneAfter struggling years upon years with depression, Asperger's and the shame of repeatedly been sexually abused as kid at the age of 5 and the fact that i can't hold a job for very long, i'm really struggling with wanting to stay her in this life anymore. Every day is torture.  

Being 33, not having a job or a place of my own and constantly being told i should find a job or that i'm a looser and the fact that i went to a "special" school as a kid combined with therapy that gives me nothing is really fucking with me these days.

Even worse is all this pizzagate bullshit everyone i know is posting on facebook and bringing back all the really fucked up an detailed memories of my own experience of firsthand child abuse.

Every day i'm reminded of that some people see me as a looser and that i'm never going to own a home or become anything even though meny people know of my Asperger's and my social awkward ways...

I'm never going to be able to pay off my debts, so why bother with anything in life if i can't even hold a job and constantly being tormented by my surroundings? Why couldn't my life start out normal...

Sorry if this sounds grammatically messy, but english is not my main language and i have been drinking
