I'm not sure what this post is about butI'm a teen, and lord am I having a hard time with finding a will to live. I don't have really any close friends, maybe a couple, but I'm not their first choice. It sucks being the last choice in your friend group, which is why I don't talk to anyone outside of school anymore. I don't have any motivation to do anything academic wise. it's not that I'm dumb, I'm kinda smart, just nothing interests me and everything's done last minute. I'm ugly as hell, and I hate the fact that people have to look at me. I don't know what I have to live for, and I feel selfish for saying that. I don't have any mental or physical illness, and nothing traumatic has happened to me. I just don't want to live. I'm not gonna do anything anytime soon, at least I think, because I don't want to be that one girl who killed herself in school. I don't want any bullshit memorials or any pictures of me hung up. My parents are proud of me for the first time in my life, because I'm quiet and lock myself in my room. I don't want to end it while I'm still living with them. Also a new season of one my favorite shows is coming out this year, and as stupid as it sounds, I have that to hold on to. I'm trying to get better but once once I graduate, I'm not sure how long I'm gonna last. I don't even know if I'm exaggerating everything or what I'm really feeling, which is why I'm not talking to anyone, besides this post i guess. As I said, I don't really know why I'm posting this, I'm think just frustrated and needed to vent somewhere. Anyways, to whoever might be reading this, thank you.
