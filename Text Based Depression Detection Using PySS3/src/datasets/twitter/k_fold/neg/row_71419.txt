Please help, I'm worried for my friendI just posted this in r/depression as well. I'm sorry if this is against the rules. I'm putting it out there in whatever subreddit I think might be able to offer advice.
Hi, My friend has depression. It's severe. He's medicated. He's in therapy. It isn't enough. I understand I can't make him happy (I'm diagnosed bipolar; there is no risk of my telling him to "cheer up".). I can't make the depression go away. But at least I feel I can make his day easier on him. In the past, we've been "romantically" (I say that to represent my end, he identifies as aromantic, but does still care for me.) involved in the past and recently split up (lack of compatibility at the time), but still care for one another. From his blog, I know he feels lonely, isolated, unworthy, useless. He wants affection and attention but doesn't feel he deserves it. At least once a week, often more, he posts about thoughts of suicide, and I'm so scared he will. For the last three or four weeks (with explicit permission) I have been bringing him a note, a small gift of some kind, every morning to try and remind him about the people who care about him, who think he's worth existing. I spend time with him during the day when I can, I've told him my phone line's always open if he needs anything. I try and remind him to eat, bring him foods he likes. I've told him nothing but the truth, I've kept all the promises I make him, I give him space when he says he needs it, said that it's okay whether he wants to talk or stay quiet. Cuddled with him. I've tried to do everything I felt I needed when I was severely depressed, tempered by what I know about him. I'm so worried. Sometimes it seems like the more I try to be there for him, the less he feels he's worth it. I don't want him to kill himself and I'm scared that he might. What can I do? Please help.
