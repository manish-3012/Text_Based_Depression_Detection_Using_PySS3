Hi guys I'm drunk.Hi friends. I'm drunk right now so I apologize for any spelling errors. Long story short, I grew up in an incredibly abusive household. Basically everyone in my household abused me in one way or another. I experienced everything from physical to sexual to psychological abuse. My parents and my male siblings were the main perpetrators, but members of my community saw what I was going through and chose to ignore it and do nothing. Now I'm a sophomore in college and struggling hard because of the lasting effects of this abuse. Tonight I am drunk and honestly could go either way. I understand that I am more than what happened to me. I know that I can take this heaping pile of garbage I was given and make something beautiful. But I can't believe that I am worth that effort. I can't even convince myself that I would benefit from the use of a service dog to help me cope with my day to day battles with mental illness and long term effects of abuse because other people have it worse than me. I can't convince myself that I deserve it because I don't have a visible disability. At this point it would be easier to die than try and sort out my life and I'm really not afraid of dying anymore.
