Please HelpI'm barely holding on anymore. I hardly want to live. I want to know how to get into a psych ward, who do I call? Is it serious enough for me to be admitted? I feel like finals are gonna push me over the edge, my depression has really pushed my grades down and after all I've worked through to bring them up to "acceptable" levels, this could end it all.

I can't deal with living anymore, I'll never make it in life. But for all the people who believe in me, I'll give it another chance. I've already attempted once.
