Dying is all I think about all day and night. I was 
never like this... how do you get out of this?I want to kill myself because when I'm a waste of space. I'm 19, I live with my parents and I'm unemployed. I want to get a job but I'm a coward and I'm afraid of embarrassment and failure. But, right now, I already AM a failure. I'm so sorry, my thoughts are everywhere. If I kill myself, my parents would have so much more money for themselves and my sister. My parents love me and would be sad, but in the long run, they would have more money. 

I was never this dull, stupid, unhappy person. Please help me find some motivation in my life. All I think about is dying now. It's consuming me. 

I'm a huge disgusting coward.

Edit: I just want to say, thank you for all the support. I love this subreddit, because the people here are absolutely amazing. The advice you have all given me is realistic. I will definitely take all of them on board. You're all truly amazing human beings. I don't know you, but I know that I love you. People like you. 

Thank you everyone. I will fight hard to overcome this dark part of my life. Please spread the hope you have given me.
