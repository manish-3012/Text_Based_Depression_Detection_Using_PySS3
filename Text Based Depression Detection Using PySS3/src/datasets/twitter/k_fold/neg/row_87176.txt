when is it really too muchYou know how when you're in the thick of a, I'm not sure what to call it...maybe the moment past "mental breakdown" when you are sure this is it. The breakdown to end all breakdowns. When you're absolutely sure you just want to escape the pain that is so deep that it hurts to your bones why you cry. But then the hours and days pass. You've made it through another. Then you're hit again. Deep in the soul this time. It feels like this is really all the pain you can handle. Eventually it will be the end of the rope. That's what it always feels like but, Eventually it will be. Is it now. I wish it was before.  I wish I would have been able to follow through at any one of those other times. All I can think is how much happiness everyone will have when I am gone. But as I lay crying dry tears, I try to write my kids notes. Will they care. They will have people who are able to show them the love I have for them. I am no good crying and cold. I try to write letters but I just have flashes of the youngest giggling as I'm holding him in the wave pool. The waves going up and down as he clings to me. The joy and happiness. I want him to feel my heart when I play it over in my head. I want that on paper and in his memory of me.
