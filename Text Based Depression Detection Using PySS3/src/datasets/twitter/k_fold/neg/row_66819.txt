With a blank canvasWith a blank canvas that's 25 years old where do you go? What do you do? When do you move ? Where do you draw that last line and clock out? I don't know what's wrong with me but I got a switch flipped and just see the whole picture.. the whole damn thing and it scares the fuck out of me. The thing we call life and the journey of it and the the experiences we endure and cherish I see it all and know the time is now. 

Some dumb saying I heard once was the rear view mirror is small for a reason and the windshield is the big picture so keep looking forward.. 

I'm just tired and woke at the same time.. i see what life is and what we can do but the burden of the road of life as well is.. well something I'm honestly not sure if I can take. Call me a puss I don't care I've had people call me that to my face...  The burden I speak of is the time that comes, The time that comes for everyone you know. The heartache that hurts you that you can damn well feel. How do you do it ? That's something that scares me knowing one day my time will come and everyone I love too..
