I don't want to die, I just don't see any way out.Long story short, I convinced my parents I was going to a community college for two years when I actually just faked it. Now they're on my case about transferring and I have no idea what to do, I can't stall any more. I have a job but it's probably only for the summer and I don't think I can live on the wages (living at home). If I could move out, I would tell them but I'm too much of a pussy.
