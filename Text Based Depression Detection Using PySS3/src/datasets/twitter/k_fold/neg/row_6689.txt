I don't want to continue living. But I know that ain't right.I've always been depressed, ever since I was around 7 or so, I was born with a condition that's known as thalassemia, since then I felt I was different, it's not just my feelings. I feel detached to my parents, siblings and everyone. Everyone treats me and looks at me with pity. I just feel like a void now. Everyday is pain. The only contact I have with my parents is like they would give me money unquestioned and that's not what I want, I don't want to be ignored. I want to get better but that's not happening. Right now, I'm 17, gonna be 18 soon. My own thoughts are killing me. I can't continue. I'm still figuring out how to kick the bucket but I can't figure out any better. I have tried exercising and just not think about everything. No matter what I do, I just can't seem to find the happiness I'm looking for. I'm afraid I'm going to do something that I'll regret soon enough.
