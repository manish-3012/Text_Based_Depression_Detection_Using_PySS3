Meds + TherapyI've been struggling with this mental illness episode for over a year now. Two months ago I had an over night hospital stay, they almost me kept for two weeks but one of the doctor's deemed me safe enough to leave after one night. Since then I recently just started therapy however I'm still very suicidal and I'll. Ever since my hospital stay my mom has prevented me from seeing my doctor. She doesn't want me going on medication, despite my therapist and hospital staff recommending it. I turn 17 in less than a month. Medication isn't something I take lightly, I'm just starting to become barely functioning due to mental illness and can't stand it. I want to get better but just talking about my problems isn't gonna fix anything. If she refuses make an appointment I'll make one by myself. Am I making the right choice? I believe I'm old enough to make choices about my own health. Also is it harder to get medication prescribed when you're suicidal?
