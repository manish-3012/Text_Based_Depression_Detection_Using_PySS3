AloneAfter falling at work almost 5 years ago, needing surgery which paralyzed my arm (eventually regained feeling) and gave me Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, which along with the incredible pain and multiple other symptoms it causes and the 50+ pounds I gained with no cure, I am raising a daughter as a single mom, and haven't had a relationship with a man in since.
I am on SS/Disability and Medicare, and at this point have lost all my friends due to my employer telling them not to contact me because of the legal situation. I am SO lonely, dealing with everything, and so depressed that I know that I can't keep living this way. I question whether my daughter will be better off without me. Her father just remarried a woman with to older children that my daughter loves. She loves being with them. I can't give her that. I think about how I can situate my finances so when I go, she will be set, and nothing will be in question. I just can't keep living this way anymore.
