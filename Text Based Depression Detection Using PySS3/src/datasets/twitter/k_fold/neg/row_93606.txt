Going through a very serious existential crisis, please help me.I'm 17, a nihilist best describes me. I have 0 motivation and I'm not compelled to do anything. Life is completely pointless  and I have tried killing myself in the past... Can someone please tell why suicide is irrational and not a good decision.
