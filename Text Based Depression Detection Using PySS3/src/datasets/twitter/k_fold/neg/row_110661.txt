I donâ€™t want to be here anymore but I promisedAt therapy this week my therapist said that she wasnâ€™t sure if she should let me go home after my session. She ultimately let me go after making me promise that I wouldnâ€™t do anything before our next session and told me that she was trusting me. I feel so shitty and I donâ€™t want to break her trust but I donâ€™t know how much longer I can promise. I donâ€™t want to go to the hospital; I just want to stop existing.
