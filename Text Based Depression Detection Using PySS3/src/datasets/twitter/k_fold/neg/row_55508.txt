My dad's dying and i can't reconnect.Over the years of depression I've gradually moved away from my family. Hoping that one day, if I ever do pass on, no one will really care. After years of pushing away and a few attempts at jumping the gun on the plan, I've sufficiently removed myself from the family. I no longer get invited anywhere, no one messages me or really responds to my messages, I lean of marriages from facebook and all that. But a few years ago, my dad got hit in the head, and they thought he had a concussion. Well, from what i could understand, his brain is full of toxins from his liver. The man I've idolized my whole life is wasting away infront of me, thinking I hate him because I don't know what to say. I don't know how or what he or my step mom have been up to. But every update scares me.
