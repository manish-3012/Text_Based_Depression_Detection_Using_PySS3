How can I approach a friend who is self-harming?Under some not so important circumstances, me and an old friend have been renting a house together since the start of the year and she needs help. we've got closer since and just last night we made love for the first time and that's when I saw the cuts, on her wrists and upper thighs, she was trying to hide them during it but she knows that i saw them. This morning I heard her crying again (I hear her some nights crying) so I took the initiative and knocked on her door and when she answered I sat down with her and tried to build up trust and asked her whats wrong. The only thing I got out of her was that she is still cutting and she has been suicidal before. I didn't ask too much of her because I know people get annoyed when they try and help, I want her to come out naturally on her own and tell me whats wrong but I don't know what I can do to help her or make her feel better.

Sorry its long but I need help helping someone else.
