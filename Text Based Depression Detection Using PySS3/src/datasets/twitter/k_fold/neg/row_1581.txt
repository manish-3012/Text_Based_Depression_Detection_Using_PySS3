How to lose suicidal thoughts, you ask.You can't. There is not really a such way to lose them. You can just hold them tied up in a cage tearing them apart but they are invulnerable. Just take care of them and don't let them escape. I'm buying an electric guitar soon to start doing what I love. Hearing heavy metal, now doing it. I started to appreciate the things I love. Without heavy metal I wouldn't be able to hide this fear, rage, anxiety and maybe even depression. I think I'm struggling from a winter depression and asa spring comes over I just act normal. I'm trying to say, find a hobby. Do it. Love it. Live it. That is life. About loving what you love, lol. Without this you cannot be normal. Just try to do something you like. Even if you are bad, it doesn't matter. One thing tho. No drugs. No alcohol. No ciggarets. Nothing. People die from a painful cancer. My parents are on the edge of getting one. I can see it. 50 years old. Just be happy on your own, friends, internet friends. Anyone. If you are feeling miserable feel free to write me a message. Have a good day, and live your life the way you love.
