I think that I am going to kill myself in two weeksI feel good right now, weâ€™ll calm at least but I just donâ€™t wanna live at all. I donâ€™t want to be stoped and I wish that people leave me the choice for my own life. 
Everything is fine in my life, I have a really great family, a girlfriend, friends, good grades (that wonâ€™t last long because I donâ€™t do anything at school anymore). But I just want to die, not even just to stop existing but really to die. I want to put a rope around my neck and hang myself or cut my wrist. 

I just canâ€™t be here anymore. My closest friend killed her self a month ago, I have been depressed since Iâ€™m 7. I will disappoint my grandpa who idealize me same for my family. I donâ€™t want to see want will happen to the world tomorrow. I just want to be dead, calm for the eternity. 
Iâ€™m not searching help in this post, donâ€™t DM me. Just want wish that someone could let me know that I can die if I really want to because I canâ€™t do this anymore and I donâ€™t have the stress nor the energy or motivation to help myself. I just have an nought to end it.

Again Iâ€™m not asking for comments like Â«Â it will get better with timeÂ Â» just wanted to talk
