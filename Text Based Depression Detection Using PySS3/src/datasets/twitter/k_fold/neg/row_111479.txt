Feeling Isolated and Seeking HelpFor starters, this is a throwaway account. I follow this subreddit and even comment at times, but I havenâ€™t posted under that account.

Iâ€™m worried because my depression is getting drastically worse. Iâ€™ve dealt with it for most of my life, but these last few months, itâ€™s gotten much worse than ever before. Itâ€™s to the point now that I think about killing myself multiple times a day. I used to have a painless method in mind, but now all I focus on is whatâ€™s available and just making sure itâ€™s not something I can survive. Iâ€™m troubled enough; I donâ€™t want to have to live with the knowledge that I tried to kill myself and survived. If I hit that breaking point, I want it to be final.

Iâ€™ve lost a lot of friends over the last year. Iâ€™ve tried to finally embrace my depression and seek professional help. I tried to reach out to friends, but several of my closest friends werenâ€™t supportive. I still have a few left, but I feel like I keep pushing people away and my world is getting smaller and smaller. I don't try to push people away, but I guess people aren't used to seeing me in a vulnerable state and many of them don't react well. I want to reach out to the few friends I have left for help, but I worry I have put too much on them. Even when theyâ€™re supportive, I just feel guilty. Like I am burdening them with my troubles. Part of me feels like, since Iâ€™ve never actually attempted suicide yet, that I shouldnâ€™t bring it up because I donâ€™t know if I have it in me to follow through with it. But I feel like I do. And I feel like Iâ€™m closer than ever. And I feel like this idea that my concerns arenâ€™t valid until I actually attempt suicide just seems like Iâ€™m challenging myself to do it. Iâ€™ve tested the waters, so to speak, but never taken the plunge. I feel bad when I talk to people about my depression because people want you to get better and I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s even possible. One friend told me I wasnâ€™t me anymore. But maybe I never was the person they thought I was.

I donâ€™t necessarily want to die. I would love for my life to get better and for me to be happy again, but Iâ€™ve lost sight of what happy even looks like. I donâ€™t even know if itâ€™s possible at this point. Holding on just seems like Iâ€™m living without purpose. I believe I am a good person and try to help people, but itâ€™s gotten to the point where I can barely take care of myself at this point. Iâ€™m not good to anyone any more. I feel like Iâ€™m only hanging on because thatâ€™s what people do. We survive for the sake of survival. Even if it doesnâ€™t lead to our lives meaning anything.

Thank you to anyone that reads or responds to this. I want to be grateful to the few people that still care about me, but talking to my friends just makes me feel guilty and that makes me feel worse.
