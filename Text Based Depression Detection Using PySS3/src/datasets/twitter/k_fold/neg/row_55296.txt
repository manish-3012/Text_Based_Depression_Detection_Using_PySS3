Gunshot. "The sadness will last forever."This is quite edgyðŸ˜… but I dont consider myself that suicidal. But every now and then I have thoughts that my life is ending. 

When I listen to a certain song that conveys a melancholy emotion, I fantasize that I'm shot at the heart, killed in action. And I lay on the ground, my face lingered a remaining light, my youth is over. It's a beautiful way to die since I see this figuratively : my heart is too soft and big for this world, it had too much pain and being shot by a firearm symbolizes that it's excruciating than it ever was before. But then it's over.

And people I know, especially my loved ones had anguish in their faces that I never wish upon them. Loud cries feasting around. 

It seems like a beautiful way to die. As I take my last breath, I smiled weakly, my eyes losing its light, chanting something similar to Van Gogh's last words.

"The sadness will last forever."
