I think of ending it.I just don't see a point of living, what the fuck are we doing on a planet we fucked and still are with pollution and other shit in the middle of a galaxy with fuck all purpose? My LO teacher goes on about how we are here to take care of it but that's fucking pointless since we can't make it better because we need so many people for that but no one gives a fuck.

I just hate how pathetic I am, why should I feel sad of me imagining my parents feeling sad about me being dead since I'm such a fucking liability? It wouldn't matter when I'm gone since I won't see it happening, my fucking disgusting worthless human body will either turn into ash and be put in a fucking box and forgotten just like my grandpas (my dads dad has been in this chest for the past 2-3 years) either I'll be forgotten like that or put in the ground and left behind, then destroyed by pollution later, I have so much more to rant about but fuck this I'm finished.
