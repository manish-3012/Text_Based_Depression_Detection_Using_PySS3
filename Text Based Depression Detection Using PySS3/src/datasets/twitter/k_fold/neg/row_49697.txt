I am in an immense amount of physical and emotional pain. I need help, but all I can afford is death.My stomach hurts constantly. Probably a peptic ulcer based on my research, but I don't know for certain. I reached out for medical assistance since I can't afford health insurance, but somehow I make too much for any discounted services or financial assistance and I cannot even begin to afford the visits out of pocket, which payment is due upfront before an appointment can even be made. I have an extremely high stress job that makes me miserable, but I can't afford to quit. I have no one to help me and every time I reach out for help from my state, I'm rejected. The emotional toll this pain, the high stress and the lack of support or assistance takes on me daily is so much more than I can continue to endure. I've contemplated suicide almost daily for over a year. I don't want to hurt my family (who is below the poverty level), but my need to be pain free is beginning to outweigh my need to care for my family. No one seems to be able to help me and I've done everything I know to try and help myself. I've even attempted to take out loans to afford my medical care, but can't even get a crooked ass lender to help. I don't know what else to do and I'm so tired of suffering.
