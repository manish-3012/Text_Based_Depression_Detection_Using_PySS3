I feel like I have failed in life.Every aspect of my life feels like a failure. I have no social life. i go a dead end customer service job 5 days week. I am a 27 year old loser virgin that has never even held a female's hand. I have accepted that will always be alone. I can almost cope with the fact that no one will feel any sort of attraction towards me but I have a degree in accounting which is supposed to be a good degree to have and i have never had a single job that hasn't been a joke. Every job is dead end with zero opportunity for growth where i perform tasks that are meaningless busywork. My current job is in a good company to work for but my position is customer service rep, the most dead end worthless position in the company. I try and try to apply to any job that is even closely related to accounting the company to move up, and every time i get rejected. I think about dying every day, I have failed socially and career wise. I always thought that a degree specially in accounting would net me at least a middle class paying job but i guess not. Everyone in my team has dropped out of college or never even went to it. I feel like a clown, why did i even attend university for? I just want this worthless existence to end.
