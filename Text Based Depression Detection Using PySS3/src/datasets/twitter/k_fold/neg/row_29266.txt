Soon I wonâ€™t be able to cry anymoreFading to black, dizziness, non-existence.

This time I have five hours to complete. It will take twenty minutes to lose consciousness.

I can imagine my familyâ€™s horror and bereavement when they discover the body.

Call me a coward and idiot. I wonâ€™t be there to hear it.

My self as I know it wonâ€™t exist anymore. Itâ€™s terrifying, and itâ€™s a relief.

Wish me luck.
