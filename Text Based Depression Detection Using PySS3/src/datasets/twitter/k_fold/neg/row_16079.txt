nothing to live forI am not suicidal in the traditional sense, as in I'm not in strong pain and I don't yearn for death. But I have also come to realise there's absolutely nothing to live for in this world. There is no love, there is no kindness. Everyone is just chasing a brief emotional high and tries to get everyone else around them to provide them with it faster (using force, coercion, manipulation, deceit). Nobody works because they want to be useful or helpful. Everyone does so for their ego (I'm ok with that) and to aleviate boredom (I'm ok with that too) and very often to exercise their ability to bully and terrorize people (I'm obviously not ok with that). Generally, there's an alarming number of emotional sadists everywhere and those that aren't are just numb and closed off. 

We're supposedly living in the peaceful prosperous times in the history of humanity but that doesn't make me feel any better, just worse. What is the purpose to this world if we can tell the good from the bad but only get to experience the bad, over and over again? 

tldr, there is nothing to live for, just very brief biochemical highs that are followed by very long spells of despair when you see reality for what it is
