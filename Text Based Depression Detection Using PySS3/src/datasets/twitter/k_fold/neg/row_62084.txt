Headache is making me more suicidalI don't have headaches often but today I do. I have been depressed more than ever lately, thinking way too much of suicide. I have nothing going for me. I am 21 going to be 22 in a few months. I wish death on myself every other day. Wish I'd die in my sleep. If I did kill myself, my parents wouldnt be able to handle it. Dad might, but mom won't. They are the only ones that have been here more or less. I dont have siblings.

It's been more than a year since I have felt this way. And so much of it is to be blamed on me to be fair. I mess everything up. No friends, turned away everyone. Still do. I tried talking about my feelings on the kindvoice subreddit but I guess they couldnt give much of a shit to even listen to everything I had to say. Not the first person to do so. I have sought advice from internet strangers for a while now. People have told me to go see a shrink or something, or take meds. IDK. First of all, I am broke, second of all, idk i just wanna end it. I used to be such a happy guy. too careless.

I hate everything about myself and the ones that tried caring. even things I liked at times. IDK why I keep deliberating. I am not even afraid of dying. I always lacked motivation, maybe that's why. My head hurts :( I don't even know how to cry anymore.
