No real future for me.Being a hish school student can be hard. Being a hish school student with pushy parents is even harder. 

I'm not the best student. My grades are mostly 4 and 5. It's not enough. 

Last Thursday I fucked up my resit from maths. Also I  forgot my notebook. I did homework on a piece of paper. But my teacher collected the notebooks. Not I'm going to get 1 because of not handing it in. Last Monday we had a short test from things that were like 2 weeks ago. Of course our fantastic teacher didn't told us about it. I'm also going to get 1 for this. 

That's why I have no future.
