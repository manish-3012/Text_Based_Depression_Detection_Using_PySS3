I looked up the prices for rope and I feel like Iâ€™m going to throw upIt would be so easy. Itâ€™s so cheap. I think the small innocent child in me is gasping for air. Sheâ€™s terrified that Iâ€™m looking for rope to complete my suicide. Iâ€™m 19. Iâ€™m so alone. Tomorrow when the stores open, I will look for rope. To satisfy this clawing desire. I canâ€™t stop crying. I shut my eyes and all I see is darkness. So much for gasping for air.
