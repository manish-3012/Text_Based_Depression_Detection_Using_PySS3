its hollow.I donâ€™t have time for anything, my life feels hollow. thereâ€™s no depth to it, like a shallow pond full of mud. i feel like the npc everyone forgets about and nobody talks to. i cant get anything halfway done before giving up. every game i once liked doesnâ€™t bring me any joy anymore. every hobby i had was torn apart by the pandemic. it feels like utter shit smeared in my face.
why even try, there is no point to it.
i donâ€™t have suicidal intentions, i just want to talk. but nobody will listen. im numb like a drenched piece of cardboard. i wish that piece of cardboard was drenched in gasoline and set a blaze.
