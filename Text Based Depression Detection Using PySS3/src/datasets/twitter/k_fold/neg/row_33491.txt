I attempted suicide so many times I became resistant to my ideal method of killing me.I was allergic to something. I won't say what because it's so rare and I don't want to be identified. It causes severe swelling in my throat and could kill me. Every time I've been serious about suicide or just felt like it I've taken it. Got hospitalised for this initially. Later taking lesser amounts due to boredom or spite (not attempts) and I've felt the swelling, but it wasn't enough to kill me, or anti histamines/ steroids helped prevent it from getting too bad. Repeat about maybe 40 times.

Few weeks ago I took 150ml of the stuff. Nothing. At all. In a normal person it induces seizure and possible death. In someone allergic to it should have caused death. A few ml would have caused my death initially. But long gone.

Time to say farewell to this method. I cured myself of an allergy but I lost a very easy suicide method. Feels like I lost an old friend.
