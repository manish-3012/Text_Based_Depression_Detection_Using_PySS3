The end may be nearI've quit my job towards the end of March during this virus and foolishly tried to get unemployment and almost succeeded but they found an issue with my filing. Ever since  2018 I've wanted to quit my job and live in the woods and it seems like that will be a major possibility. I have food stamps . 

All the good in the world is great but I see the triviality of it all. And hope is like luck for many . It doesn't get better for many humans . 

If the end is near then I wish to be by myself alone in the woods and die peacefully. 

And if this is it then sorry Mara and Tara I held on as long as I could.
