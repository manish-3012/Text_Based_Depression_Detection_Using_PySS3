I just need to get this off my chestI[M21] have been having suicidal thoughts everyday for about 5 months now. After one month I started to cut myself to block these thoughts but after a few weeks the thoughts were there regardless of cutting so I managed to stop doing that. I tried to kill myself once 2 weeks ago but I could not go through with it and stopped just in time. 
I have not told anyone because I feel I would be a burden in my friends and family and because, objectively speaking, my live is not that bad. And no one really noticed that Iâ€™m down. 
I donâ€™t want to leave my family and friends behind but I canâ€™t stop my thoughts. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
