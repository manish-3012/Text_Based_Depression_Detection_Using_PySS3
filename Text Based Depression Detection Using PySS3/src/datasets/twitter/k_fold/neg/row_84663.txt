I'm so tired of livingFiancÃ© and I broke up several months ago because I was too depressed. I was depressed because she never wanted to see me and it never actually felt like she loved me. She only visited once every other week and when she did she hardly wanted anything to do with me.   

I've been getting worse since then because she was my only reason for doing anything. The last few days I've been especially feeling awful about the whole thing. I've come close to breaking down while I'm working and frequently have broken down on my breaks.   

She messaged me today out of the blue to be all buddy buddy and it only opened up some wounds that were already hurting. Then she refused to talk about things when I tried to tell her I was in a lot of pain.  

Roommates are upset because I started smoking again after the breakup and stopped tidying up. I don't see any purpose in doing anything anymore. I just want to die. The only thing keeping me alive is my mom who would die if I died. She's got medical issues and if she passes away any time soon I won't have any reason left to stick around.  

I just want someone I can love again and actually feel loved back this time. I don't think I'm ever going to find another person though, especially if even someone like her couldn't love me back.
