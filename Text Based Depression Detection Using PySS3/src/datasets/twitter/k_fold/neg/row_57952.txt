in the perceptions and experiences of life of almost everyone I know, i almost entirely do not existi remember ppl that have long forgotten me . I think of ppl that never ever think of me .i care for ppl who donâ€™t give a shit abt me, and frankly they shouldnt. Most of them i just got attached to after one conversation. They donâ€™t owe me any care at all but it still hurts bc i want them to 

Im basically a half-life, who no one knows and contributes nothing to anything, not even just a small impact on someoneâ€™s life. 

Im already non-existent to most people, so I might as well not exist physically either.
