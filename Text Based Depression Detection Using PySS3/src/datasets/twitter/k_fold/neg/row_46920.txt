My life is so empty.And the worst part is that it's not due to any outside forces. I was never neglected or abused or even really bullied when I was younger. My family love me and I'm lucky to have a roof over my head. I'm just extremely good at being a worthless waste of space all by myself. 

I have very severe anxiety, depression and BDD. Although I believe there's other issues as well. Had therapy years ago and it didn't really help, been on numerous meds since. Poor mental health meant I dropped out of school when I was 13 with zero qualifications. I'm 26 soon and the only job I've ever had lasted for 3 days.

My only achievement is that a few years ago I managed to get into a local college and was meant to be graduating this year. However thanks to corona its been pushed back to 2021. I live in a crappy small town and there are zero jobs even relating to my degree and I can't travel to other places due to my anxiety. Apart from this I have no other skills, talents or abilities of any kind. 

I've also had no friends in 13 years and my only family are my mum and younger sister whom I live with. We're super close and they're honestly the only reason I haven't killed myself. I've never been in a relationship or had sex, not even been on a single date. I wake up, do nothing all day and then sleep.

I'm. So. Tired.
