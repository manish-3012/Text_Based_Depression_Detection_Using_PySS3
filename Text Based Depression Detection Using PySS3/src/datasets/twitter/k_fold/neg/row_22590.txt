I have a planThis is the first time Iâ€™ve developed a plan to do this. Before I had random times where I was doing really poorly and almost tried to commit suicide. This time itâ€™s different. I have a plan for over a week from now. I wonâ€™t be at my college but at a hotel room elsewhere. The conference Iâ€™ll be in will distract people from coming back to the room too early. I wrote a note. I canâ€™t not go through with it this time. Iâ€™m about to graduate and I canâ€™t face the world after graduation. I have a plan this time though. This time itâ€™s real.
