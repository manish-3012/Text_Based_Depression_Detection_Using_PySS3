I'm done.I can't take this anymore. I don't know what the fuck to do with my life. What college major to study.. If I'm studying the right major, if I should drop out, if I wanna live abroad or if I'll regret my decisions.
My mind is so messed up and I've been going through these thoughts every single day for 4 months.
I need someone to counsel me through this but I've tried talking to everyone but no one could help me. The problem is I can't even help myself in the first place because I don't know what I want.
I'm 18 btw
