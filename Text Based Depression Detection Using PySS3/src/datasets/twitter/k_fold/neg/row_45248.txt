Post attempt TRIGGER WARNING    You know, just yesterday I wouldâ€™ve sworn I wasnâ€™t suicidal. Sworn that I have control. Sworn that I didnâ€™t even want to die but last night I attempted. I was drunk, the rest of the night was blackout up until part of the attack on my wrists and the moment after i took the ibuprofen and midol. 4000 mgs. The symptoms of overdosing are still strong. 


       I am a self harmer but I never /// on my wrists because thatâ€™s dangerous and I  wasnâ€™t suicidal I thought. Last night i covered my wrists but was too drunk to //// very deep.


     Iâ€™m not sure if I did damage to my internal organs. When I first woke up I had no control of my balance. Other symptoms were, really bad chills and shaking,dizziness, hard to breathe, stomach hurting horribly, panic, cramping, sweating while still cold, then later heat flashes. I was in and out of sleep all night and half the day.  Still experiencing most of these symptoms.

     My mom isnâ€™t worried because I said I have a hangover. My girlfriend ,which I have a deep connection to, knew something was wrong despite no clues and snapped me asking if i had a really bad nightmare or something. To which I replied, â€œnot a nightmare, way worse that that. I canâ€™t tell you because I feel you will tell someone out of fear for me. Im sorryâ€


       I need support from them but i know they will tell my mom and sheâ€™ll freak out and probably cry.

        So how do I feel? Horrible. I hope I donâ€™t die. I donâ€™t even know what triggered me to try to kill myself, all I know is in that moment I did want to die.  Yâ€™all can say go to the doctor all day but Iâ€™m not doing that. My dad could get the records and then get custody on the bassist that I â€œattempted suicide because sheâ€™s miserable at her momsâ€ no he gave me ptsd. He gave me anxiety. He gave me depression. Now he could be the reason I die from some type of organ failure.


     Does this even count as an attempt? I mean I was drunk and my sober brain knows how unlikely it is for ibuprofen to kill me. The //// on my wrists werenâ€™t very deep.
