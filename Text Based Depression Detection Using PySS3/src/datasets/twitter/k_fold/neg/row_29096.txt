My Life has turned around in almost all ways...but Iâ€™m still extremely suicidal.And it sucks. 
Iâ€™m in a great relationship. I finally have a group of genuine friends. I have a job I donâ€™t hate. 
I can afford my bills and shit. 
But everyday is still extremely difficult. I really donâ€™t want to be here and itâ€™s hard to say thay to my  SO. Or anyone really. 
Iâ€™ve been told I should try to be more mindful and live in the actual moments but I find myself dissociating so I donâ€™t have to think about dyingall the time. 
I never let things get too good or think how well things are going- because theyâ€™ll just turn bad. Always. And will only become worse ya know. My depression is based on future events thay will inevitably happen. So yeah, things from an outside perspective - my life is SURPRISINGLY going well for the first time in my whole ass life. And I hate it.
