Convince me before my set dateMy severe anxiety doesn't permit me to learn any essential skills. I have no friends because of my anxiety. A majority of my family hates me. We're poor as hell too. I can never experience true happiness because of my chronic depression. I can't get a job because I can't drive and because of the severity of my disorders. Therapy isn't working. And even if I wanted to continue I won't be able to afford it in a year. 

Convince me that someone with my ridiculous impairments should stay alive.
