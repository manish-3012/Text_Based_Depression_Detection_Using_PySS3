coworkers starting to say they're "worried" about meI've been working for the same company for about two years, and over the last few weeks a few of my coworkers have said that they're "worried" about me. One, who has only worked with up for about 3 months, said I seem upset and preoccupied a lot of the time. They keep saying I'm "not myself" which is true but also worries me. I sob uncontrollably and have panic attacks daily, so I have to excuse myself to the bathroom a lot which is probably the main thing they've noticed.   


I'm worried because this is what happened last time just before I had a massive breakdown and spiral and then afterwards an extremely dangerous year long manic episode. I've noticed a lot of similarities between now and then, and those 2-3 years were the worst of my life. I'm scared history is repeating itself and I don't know if I can survive this time
