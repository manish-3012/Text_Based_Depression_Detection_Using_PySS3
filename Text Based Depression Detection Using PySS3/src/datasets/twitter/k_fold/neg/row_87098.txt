Advice for Depression/Anxiety?I'm very close to killing myself. I hate almost everything about who I am and haven't been able to change that for about ten years now. However, I still have that tiny bit of hope left that there's something effective out there I haven't tried. With this last little bit of motivation I want to try to fix this one last time before I call it quits.

I've seen three different therapists over the past few years with no luck, and tried a few different medications with no results.

I would really appreciate any recommendations from personal experience of things that have helped with depression or anxiety, even a little. I'm not asking anybody on here to try and cure me, but it'd be great to find a few new paths to explore.

Thank you so much!
