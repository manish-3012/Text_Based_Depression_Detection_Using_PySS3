I'm just a big disappointment disguised as a human being.I don't know what is exactly wrong with me, but i know one thing for sure. I cant function properly like other people. I hear this from my mom all the time and i can't disagree with what she is saying because she is right. All i do is disappoint her even when i try my best. My head hurts a lot and i just want to end it all. I feel like shit and i dont want to disappoint anyone anymore. I dont want to go through anymore of whatever the hell this is. I just want to sleep and never wake up.
