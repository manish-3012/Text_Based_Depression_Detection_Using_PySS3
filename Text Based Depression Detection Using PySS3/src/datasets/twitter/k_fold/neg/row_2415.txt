I'm at the end of my tetherI'm at the end of my tether with these thoughts and urges. I just want to fade away. I feel so weak that I can't just end it right here right now. I can't even cry or express how i feel, i just lay here thinking of different ways i could end everything. I've just given up on myself now, no point in trying when i do i end up full circle back where i am now, im tired of trying.
