I think I'm going to kill myself tonight.I have nothing. I want to die, but I have been too much of a fucking coward to do it. I'm too scared to tell anyone. I was being seen at my universities counseling center but they cut me loose because they wanted me to do IOP and I couldn't afford it. I just want to fucking die. 
The only time I've been happy in the past year was when I was inpatient with norovirus and just had people care about my well-being, not being worried about how awful everything is. These are supposed to be the best years of my life. If this is as good as it gets I can't go on.
