Its true after all isnâ€™t itSo Iâ€™ve been really on about getting a girlfriend lately, and Iâ€™ve persisted for about 5 years ever since I was 14, Iâ€™ve faced rejection time after time, Iâ€™ve gotten to the meet the girl as a friend part but never past that. I tried a dating  sites, I did tinder and bumble, but I ended up using bumble because the girl messages first. I got a few likes on tinder, but I didnâ€™t like back most of them, some were 45 miles away, and 1 had kids. I found this girl on bumble, 18 same age as me, nice face, indie glasses, and not fat but curvy. I was ecstatic, I finally got the chance to meet her today, and it felt like the world was mocking and humiliating me, I think it was just my fantasizing that made her look curvy, but she ended up being a big girl, red hair, freckles, there were people I knew in that coffee shop, so I kept trying to hide. Apparently she had friends 3 tables over to protect her if I did anything, which I wouldnâ€™t dare, but still, I felt like I was an undesirable person to the people Iâ€™m attracted to. Itâ€™s not just that, she had piercings, which I canâ€™t stand, she was into photography which was really neat, but not movies or games or anything. We had practically nothing in common, life gave me the middle finger. She said I was cute, and looked better in person, which I have to doubt. Why donâ€™t more girls swipe right on me then? If this is where my life is headed, then Iâ€™m sorry, I have to end it before it gets any worse, Iâ€™ve already been let down enough times.
