What if by staying alive, I risk eventually killing someone else?The only thing I spend more time thinking about than suicide is hurting others. All the people around me, who were born normal, who inconvenience me, look down on me, mock me. What if by staying alive I'm a risk to everyone around me? Why wouldn't I kill myself in that situation? Why in the fuck would it be wrong?
