Commiserate with meThis sounds so stupid but I actually want to die because of Cyperpunk 2077. 

Imagine having nothing in your life. Nothing. No job, no purpose, no friends. All Im basically getting for Christmas this year is a scizophrenia diagnosis. 

But you have one thing. One thing you're looking forward to. And for me that was cyberpunk 2077. So my welfare payment rolls around and I'm excited. Just been taking antihistamines and sleeping lately. No point in being awake. In the few hours I am I just rewatch how I met your mother and take more pills to go back to sleep. 

Anyway. I buy this stupid game and wait three hours for it to download... Only to discover work it doesn't work on my craptop. It just launches a black screen. After going through the stages of grief I've contacted steam for a refund. But I don't even care about the money anymore. 

It's government money anyway. I'm just a leech on society and a fucking burden on my family. 

Well merry Christmas to them, maybe Ill take away that burden for Christmas this year. 

I hope you're having a better fucking day internet stranger. I really do.
