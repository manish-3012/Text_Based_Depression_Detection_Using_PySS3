I choose to kill myself.I just really don't think there's a future for me on this earth. I choose to kill myself instead of being miserable for the rest of my life, feeling unmotivated and empty every single day. I don't have any friends and the reason is obvious, I'm a loser. My life is just a mess and I can't find positive things about myself. I'm not handsome, I'm not intelligent, I can't hold a conversation with anyone.. Anyway, I won't waste time write a wall of text about how bad I feel since it's just useless and no one will answer. Just wanted to post this one last rant
