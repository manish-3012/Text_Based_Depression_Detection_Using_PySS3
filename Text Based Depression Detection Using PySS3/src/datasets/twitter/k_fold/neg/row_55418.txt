I'm 24 and I feel I'm 7 years behind people my ageIn terms of no life, no experiences, no job, etc, no friends...no responsibility. No income etc.

I'm gonna be 25 soonish, trust me, I can't take it anymore.

"Stop comparing yourself to them" I SHOULD BE THERE!!!!

"start living your life" I fucking can't for some fucking reason...

Filled with jealousy, bitterness, etc

What's the point carrying on? I'm not gonna create a family, I need meet a woman, can't do that when I never doing anything with my life. I'm insignificant. 

I've just held myself back lol...

I've been dealing with this shit for 6+ years now...the crazy thing is I don't feel sad anymore
