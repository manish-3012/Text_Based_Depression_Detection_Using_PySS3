I canâ€™t do itI wasnâ€™t able to go through, I made a noose with my belt, and began to hang myself, but the knot came undone. I fell to the floor and balled my eyes out. Iâ€™m sorry. I canâ€™t do it right now. Iâ€™m extremely miserable and it has become a pain to just exist right now, but I canâ€™t kill myself yet. I know Iâ€™m not stable and another traumatic event could easily send me over the edge.
