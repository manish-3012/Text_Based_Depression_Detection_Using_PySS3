I want to end it so badI originally had a suicide date planned for 4 years from now. Come to think of it, it will probably happen much sooner than that. Iâ€™m barely through the first semester of freshman year and I already abhor college with every fiber of my being. I am not interested in any of the classes I am taking and no career path sounds interesting for me at all. It seems like the future is setup for me to work a job Iâ€™ll absolutely hate and have no place in. The only thing I remotely enjoy nowadays is watching my favorite streamer on twitch. As sad and pathetic as this sounds, it seems like my only escape from reality, suicidal thoughts, school, and life in general. I still live with my parents and I am extremely scared of changing my major. My parents will be very angry at me if I decide to switch from nursing to something else. They donâ€™t understand my depression and suicidal thoughts either. Last year I was very desperate for emotional support and I told them about how I have been feeling. I was yelled at and lectured by them about how I shouldnâ€™t be feeling the way I feel and that I am lucky to live in a first world country with running water, power, electricity, and a roof over my head. My parents were from a third world country and they moved to america when I was a baby, to give some context to my situation. I feel so guilty for feeling this way. My parents worked for their entire lives to bring me to america. I feel like a spoiled piece of shit compared to the struggles theyâ€™ve been through to go to the US. I feel so much pressure on my shoulders to be â€œsuccessfulâ€ in my academics and my future career. I am slowly but surely losing my motivation and will to live. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before I kill myself.
