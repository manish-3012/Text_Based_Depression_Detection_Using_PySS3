My last night.If you wanna know my story check my last post. I meant to kill myself this yesterday but I wasn't alone. However tomorrow morning l will finally be. I needed to be alone to smash the lock on my step dad's gun locker and tomorrow I can finally do just that.

I might leave my suicide note here tomorrow if anyone wants to read it.

I finally will be free of everything soon. It's honestly a little comforting.
