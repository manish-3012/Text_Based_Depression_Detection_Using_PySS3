All my hope is goneEveryday is a little worse than the last. Each aspect of my life is going down fast. I could count the reasons I should be happy to be alive, but nothing brings me joy inside. 

I have a job, sure, but close to minimum wage, not the pay grade I was promised by the thousands of dollars for my education. I have a spouse and a cat and I love them, but I can't look them in the eyes when I feel nothing.

The despair I feel is too deep to try to do better. I've been giving 110% of my energy for too long, now that well has run dry. I've given up. 

It looks like I'm given up when I don't bother to go to work in the morning. I distract my mind the best I can because if I don't I'll just sit in a ball in mourning over my dreams for my life. 

Sometimes I'll forget the pain I'm in, but then that glass wall shatters. The world is getting darker, or was it always this dark and I'm just becoming more aware? 

I want to not think, I want to not feel. That's when I turn to a drink. That's when I remember that forgetting doesn't last. 

I've been broken most of my life. That joy and innocence ripped from me by a man who was supposed to protect me. Yet a decade, a court case, four therapists, prescriptions, and the illusion that I'm not hurting, but I still lose hope when I realize just how 'not alone' I am. 

I know I'm not alone and somehow that makes things worse. I'm drowning, they're drowning, we're drowning, but those that claim to care sit idle in safety and wonder why we have fallen behind. 

I'm tired.

I just.... Want to give up.
