Just sadI'm just unhappy with how my life turned out and I don't  want see it play out anymore. I feel like I'm never enough and it doesn't matter what I do. I don't know why I feel sad all the time. I don't think it gets better. I just feel numb to everything. I have to do these things to make me feel happy, but I'm never happy.
