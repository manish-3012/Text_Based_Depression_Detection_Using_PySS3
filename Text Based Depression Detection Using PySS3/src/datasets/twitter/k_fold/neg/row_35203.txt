It would be easier to just die.My brain is so complicated and troubled. Most urgently, I don't know if I'm transgender or not. I wrestle just by myself every day and it's just so stressful and it feels like no matter what I choose or no matter what happens I will always be this way. It would just be so much easier to kill myself. It isn't even the matter of me being happy. It's just that I won't suffer as much.
