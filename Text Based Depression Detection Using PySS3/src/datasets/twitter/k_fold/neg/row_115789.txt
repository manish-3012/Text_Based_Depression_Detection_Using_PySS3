I got accepted into college but they completely fucked me overI got accepted into college earlier this year, unfortunately communications 12 does not count as an alternative for English 12, which means I have to drop out of comm 12 and try to finish English 12 in the 4 months I have before graduation.

Thing is, the college already took a $500 deposit and when I tried contacting them to ask some questions everyone I talked to was extremely rude and talked down to me.

We'll see how things go the next few weeks but I'm not hopeful.
