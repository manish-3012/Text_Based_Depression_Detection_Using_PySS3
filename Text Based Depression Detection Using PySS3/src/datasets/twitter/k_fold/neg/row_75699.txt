I can't help being a piece of shitand driving everyone away. Like what the fuck is wrong with me, I fuck up everything. I make myself alone. I always say its my anxiety and depression, but fucking hell, how much of it can really make me turn into a complete selfish dipshit?    
    
Way to go ruining another fucking relationship, you dickbag. I wish I had never even gotten into this shit. I wish I had never even tried getting close to people. I ruin everything, and that's the worst part of it all. It's all *my* fault. Everyone hates me because I'm just a sack of shit.    
    
I drove my family away, I drove my friends away, I drove my SO away. Therapy is barely helping. I still want to kill myself after all these years.     
    
I'm so tired of living. I thought maybe I could wait for my grandparents and parents to get old and pass away before I off myself so they don't have to live through their lives with some shit like this. But I don't know anymore, I'm really tired of being and living.
