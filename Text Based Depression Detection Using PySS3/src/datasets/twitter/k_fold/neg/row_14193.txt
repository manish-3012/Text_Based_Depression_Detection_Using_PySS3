I don't see how it can get better at all.I just feel like I don't really have a purpose. I'm spouting shit about how everyone matters, but I'm really just as sad as they are.

 I don't know if I really have depression or not. I don't know if I'm really gay or not. I don't really know if I'm gonna make it past college. I'm scared and I feel alone, but I feel like there's nobody to blame but myself for this. 

I'm such a fucking idiot I can't figure out how to wrap a bandage around my fucking wrists. I can't figure out how to stop eating and vomiting it all back up. I don't think I even want to.

 I just don't know what to do.
