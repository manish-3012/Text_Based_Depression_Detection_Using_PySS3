Cant deal with thisWell fuck here it goes again up late can't sleep because my mind is fucking racing it's just one of those days you feel me-?

The thought of ending my life is there all the time when I wake up, when I eat, when I got to sleep it never leaves, I really don't want to die but life just keep beating me to it, you know from being emotionaly abused most of my childhood to self distraction I just can't get a break can't even feel happiness if I'm not drunk or high but even then it's just 10 minutes of being happy and after that it's wanting to die or crying my self to sleep, wish I could go to the past and fix some shit.

But for now I'm going to write some letters just in case.
