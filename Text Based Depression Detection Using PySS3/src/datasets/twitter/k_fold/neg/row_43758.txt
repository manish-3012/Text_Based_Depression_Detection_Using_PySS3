No help for the high-functioningIâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for awhile due to everything thatâ€™s been going on. Iâ€™ve been dealing with mental illnesses for years so the logical side of my mind still is able to apply that brake before I do something stupid. But emotionally, everything is just so overwhelming that Iâ€™ve been having these thoughts everyday for months. 

I know talking about suicidal thoughts is emotionally draining to your support so i try my best to cope internally and only reach out when Iâ€™m close to breaking. But people actually avoid me when I reach out (understandably, given how negative these things are) and knowing that Iâ€™ve always coped perhaps just see that I just need some time and Iâ€™ll be alright. Itâ€™s been months and I havenâ€™t been alright and i honestly feel like Iâ€™m crumbling trying to hold everything together. people seem to only want to listen and help when youâ€™re at the very extreme end, seconds away from committing suicide.
