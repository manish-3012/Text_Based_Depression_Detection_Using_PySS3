Nothing helps anymore.I've always struggled with depression. And I always told myself I'd wait until my parents passed away before doing anything about it. But I cant wait any longer. My best bet is to make it look like an accident. My friends and family would take it harder if they knew what it was and I dont want to do that. But I cant stay here anymore. I cant post anything on social media so I guess I just needed to put it out there. Could something have been done. Probably. Hell, Its not like I'm blameless, I could have done more myself. But when you're  this far in the woods may as well keep walking on the path you chose rather than turn back hoping to make it back. Nothing makes it seem worth it. Even news that should. So, it seems only fitting that I'm posting under some bullshit throwaway account to people probably on other bullshit throwaway accounts.
