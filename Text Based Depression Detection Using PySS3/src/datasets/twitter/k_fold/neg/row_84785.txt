Give me a reasonMy life is stale 
There is no fun
There is no excitement 
There is no positivity 
There is nothing but the void of sadness and an infinite plane of sorrow and melancholy 
Why shouldnâ€™t I end it all, why should I continue this running joke of living only to be fucked over again and again 
Why?
