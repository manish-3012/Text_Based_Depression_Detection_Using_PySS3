tonight is the nightI really can't take it anymore.. I can't even get out of my bed anymore. This life is extremely hard and I really can't take it. On the surface level everyone thinks I'm happy but inside I'm dead.
I've attempted in the past but I think tonight I'll correct my attempts to completion instead.

Goodbye cruel world, I will NOT see you in the morning.
