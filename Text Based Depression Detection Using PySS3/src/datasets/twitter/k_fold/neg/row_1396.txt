Donâ€™t even knowIâ€™ve fuaght depression on and on since I was a young teen . Iâ€™ve gotten close to saying fuck it and just biting the bullet . If it wasnâ€™t for my cousin who I use to live with I wouldâ€™ve . I keep trying to fight back to the dark thoughts but they keep creeping back especially now. I donâ€™t feel as close to my wife as we use to. I feel unhappy. And when I tell her she tells me sheâ€™s not doing anything wrong and itâ€™s my fault that I feel this way when Iâ€™ve explained to her how she makes me feel like this . I just want to feel important to her like I use to feel. But now I feel numb I feel like breaking down at every second I can. My boys are the only ones that keep me going . I feel like I canâ€™t even be strong enough for them . I donâ€™t know what to do.. maybe just say fuck it.
