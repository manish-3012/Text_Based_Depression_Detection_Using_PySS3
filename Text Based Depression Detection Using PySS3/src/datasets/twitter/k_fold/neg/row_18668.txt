I need some help.When I was 16 I was diagnosed with bipolar, and was medicated for a few months with no luck. I don't know if I am bipolar, but I live in a small city with terrible mental health doctors. Lately I have been a total mess (more than usual), I've been fighting non-stop with my boyfriend, avoiding my friends for made up reasons, and contemplating ending my life. I'm too much of a pansy to actually hurt myself, but I can't not think about it. I don't know what to do, but I don't want to be crazy anymore, and I don't want to end up on suicide watch at the local hospital. I have a terrible support system here, but I don't want to die.
