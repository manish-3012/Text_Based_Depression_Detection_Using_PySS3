Body Dysmorphic DisorderI can't stop obsessing about my face. Sometimes it looks fine other times it doesn't. I am doing CBT and taking SSRIs. None of it works. I've always known something must be wrong with me: 18 and never had a girlfriend -- not even as much as a hug. Today I finally received verbal proof that there is something wrong with me. I was minding my own business when I walked past two girls. One commented to the other on how skinny I am. I was just starting to feel good about myself. And just like that it all gets flushed down the toilet.

I simply can't do 60 more years of this. I'll only become more lonely with time. I've missed and will continue to miss my only time being young. I give up. I'm think I'll just swallow these bottles of Paxil and Ativan and finally be free. Maybe my mind and body won't be so fucked up in the next life. 

I've always tried to be the kindest person. I've never really said anything hurtful to anyone. Always trying to make people happy -- regardless of how they look, their gender, etc. I just wished someone would have done the same for me
