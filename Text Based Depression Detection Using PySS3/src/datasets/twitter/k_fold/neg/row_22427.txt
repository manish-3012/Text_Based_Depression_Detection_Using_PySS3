I really want to kill myself, but I am just scared what people might thinkEveryone, or the majority of the people I meet don't respect me, like me, or love me. The people I consider "friends" are only the people who pity me enough to actually talk to me. Some people are scared of me, and I don't even try and care anymore that is just who I am. People who call me a school shooter or a rapist or whatever. I don't even care anymore. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself, is that I am scared I will fail and fall even further, or that I will be successful and everyone will be happy I am dead. In class one of my teachers remarked on a professor he had that died saying, "Good, he was an asshole". I think I am scared of the pity more than that though. All the people who look at me with those eyes, head turned and a painful smile. When I die they will be the ones who think they should have done more, when really their pity hurts more than all the mean words and dirty stares. People look at me and talk to me in such a way that I feel guilty for just existing. What is even the point? I tried turning to God, but I have humiliated myself more, because nothing good has come from it. I change everything about myself and I am still barely able to function as a human being. I remember wanting to kill myself when I was in elementary school. The thoughts have not gone away sense, they have gotten worse. I don't care about a painful or scary death, but I just want nobody to know. I just want to disappear.
