I've Lost Everything and I Ruin EverythingA lot of people that post here are very young. I am hoping my age will give some perspective on how much worse things can get when you have had more years to mess up your life. I don't want to do a long rant so I will just bullet point out my current situation with this throwaway account:

* **No Job or Unemployment**: I'm almost 40 and I resigned my job due to panic months ago during the worst time in history I could have done so. I can't file for unemployment, and I am in serious debt already due to my own addictions and stupid spending and behavior. 
* **Ruined Relationship:** After I ruined my job, my relationship was also ruined. I could not pay my bills and I've left my partner in dire straits. He made me leave and move in with my parents, who are elderly and aren't prepared to care for me as an adult. I am a burden on everyone.
* **Hospitalization:** I was hospitalized a few weeks ago and this makes my financial situation much worse. I am still having bad health symptoms that keep me from looking for a new job, I'm not even sure they are related to the hospitalization, they have been ongoing since I resigned months ago. My health issues are complex, and they are because of my own choices in life.
* **No way forward:** At this point I have no options at all to move forward with my life. I have severe panic attacks all day and night, I am terrified of getting the huge hospital bill. I can't afford to see a Dr. for months now and I've had to stop taking meds I've taken for years and withdraw from addictions as well. I spend each night hoping I won't wake up in the morning, and I always wake up. I'm too messed up to look for and successfully land a new job, and I hate the jobs I am "qualified" for. 
* **All my fault**: I've realized that all the things wrong in my life are my fault, and I have always been a toxic influence on friends, family, and coworkers. I deserve everything that has happened to me, yet I am terrified of killing myself.  It is the only solution I see at this point even though I am scared, there is no way to fix all of this and put it back together. I keep looking for ways to off myself, I am really scared of messing this up and ending up in the hospital again. 

**TLDR**: I've messed up my life through my own selfish actions over many years, I've created too big of a hole to get out of finally.  There are so many more awful things I've done that would take too much space to list. Suicide is my only option, I have ruined all of my chances, my relationships, and I don't deserve to keep messing up, karma is real and it has to be paid. 

A lot of people say just try to hang in there one more night/day, I keep doing this and things keep getting worse, I also don't deserve to keep being a burden on my family. My hope at this point is that I can handle suicide and succeed so I don't have to keep waking up in this nightmare every day.  My only goal is to find a way to do it and to do it right. 

I don't feel sorry for myself, I don't feel like crying at all, I feel totally numb and worthless to the world. My current situation is all my fault and a long time in the making. I need to have the strength to end it finally and stop the chaos I have created.
