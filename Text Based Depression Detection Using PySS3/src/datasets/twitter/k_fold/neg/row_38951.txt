Iâ€™d love one good reason to not kill myselfNot that stupid shit like â€œBecause I care and you matter.â€ I donâ€™t matter, when will I ever make my impact? Never. It doesnâ€™t get better. It gets worst as time goes on. What makes me happy is what my mother is holding back. I sometimes wish I wasnâ€™t 14. I wish that I was dead. But Iâ€™m told be careful for what you wish for. My mother is selfish and doesnâ€™t care about how I feel. If she did, she would let me go back. But no one will ever understand
