today was supposed to be the day i die, but i did not go through with iti had everything in place. i had a noose, i destroyed all of my written notes that explain why iâ€™m hurting (iâ€™m not giving them any reason why i am killing myself) and left a small â€œfuck you allâ€ note on my table. i was so ready. but then, i realized my plan of leaving everything behind me. like, go to a whole new place and sever my ties with everyone in my family (it disgusts me to say that filthy word). i realize i donâ€™t want to die yet, not until i hurt them more than they ever hurt me. they are emotionally sadistic pieces of shits. and somehow, i long for them to be on their fucking death beds and there are two ways i can do: not show up, or show up and just laugh at them and not give them the opportunity to apologize. 

and yes, as iâ€™m writing this, i figured iâ€™m turning into them. but idc anymore. life is unkind to me, so why should i be kind to it?

but now, i have to go on and make a way to make my plan a reality.
