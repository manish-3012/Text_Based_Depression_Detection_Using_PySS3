hi RedditI'm not even sure what to say. I read all the stories on here and /r/depression and I know I have no reason to hate myself and look hopefully at a rifle. I've never told anyone besides my loving girlfriend about how I feel and even she doesn't know all my thoughts. So here I am, typing disorganized thoughts that no one will ever care about. I've felt empty and lonely almost 2 years. I have no reason to be like this, my parents love me, I'm an upcoming freshman varsity runner, I made it to a FBLA state conference, and I have an amazing girlfriend... But yet every day I come home and I just want to end it all and stop the thoughts in my head. The only reason I'm here is for my love and my family. I have so many thoughts just torturing me constantly and I just let them bottle up and manifest. I will never tell my parents because I know we can't afford any therapy or medication. I doubt I would need any this is probably just a phase or something. I'll continue to cry myself to sleep now and pray I don't wake up. Thank you to that one person who read this that probably doesn't care anyway and thinks I'm a whiny bitch boy.
