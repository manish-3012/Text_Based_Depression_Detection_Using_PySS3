I feel like I won't be able to take it anymoreI'm trying so hard to fight against depression, but I always lose. Things get better for a while and then, all of a sudden, I'm again without hope and wanting to kill myself 24/7. I'm alive because somehow I'm always able to postpone the date I plan to die, but the more time passes the more I'm convinced that I should have already killed myself. I keep on living, but there's nothing really good about it.
