I can't make my life any betterI can't bring myself to keep going. I have work tomorrow and even doing that is bringing me lower. I'm drowning in debt and I'll probably be homeless in the next couple months or so. I'm 24 years old and I don't think a single person loves or ever will love me. When I was young I thought I would have a big family. I don't think I'll ever get there. There's no reason to keep going anymore. What is any of this for? My happiness doesn't matter and I don't think I bring happiness to anyone either. I don't have a plan to kill myself and I'm too afraid to do it. I'm trapped.
