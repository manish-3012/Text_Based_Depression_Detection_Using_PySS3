I don't know what to doI don't know what to do or what to say right now. Been really frustrated and lonely and feeling like no one understands me. Things aren't as easy for me as they are for other people. Socializing has always been a bit of a struggle for me. I don't know what else to say. I just want to find what I'm looking for.
