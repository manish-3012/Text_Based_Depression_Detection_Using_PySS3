I donâ€™t even know anymoreIâ€™m really frustrated and tired, Iâ€™ve been like this for 5 months and Iâ€™ve fallen way down. Iâ€™m only 17 with my whole life ahead of me and yet here I am, Depressed and suicidal cause of things that scarred me (PTSD, Parents divorce, and etc). Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself more then once and I never seem to pull through, Iâ€™m really just waiting for the day when I actually do it. But I know I have caring friends and family that I wouldnâ€™t wanna lose just because of a stupid decision. I donâ€™t know, I hate to say this but I even question about how they really feel about me and just doing that makes me feel worse. I really donâ€™t know anymore, I tried to think and clear my thoughts, I tried to reflect but I canâ€™t come to a compromise. I wish I didnâ€™t have to suffer anymore, I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. Iâ€™m way to stubborn to try and do anything else to help myself but what can I do. At this point using whatâ€™s left of my pride and Killing myself is the only option I have, itâ€™s all my fault.
