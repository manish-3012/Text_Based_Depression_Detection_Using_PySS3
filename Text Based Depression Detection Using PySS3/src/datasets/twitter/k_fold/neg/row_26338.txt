I am afraidHi. It's been a year or so since my depression diagnosis and now I think it has become major depression. I feel like im losing control of my body and mind, my memory is randomly weak, every decision paralyses me, I cannot move and I always wait for those moments when i can shut my brain off either my fatique, alcohol, drugs and lots of nicotine. 
I feel like i have a small window everyday when i am myself, i can exercise and compose my music, but everytime it gets smaller; maybe an hour or two in a good day. I am wasting my life and health away and im afraid of my pressing thoughts of killing myself. My interest in guitar has faded a lot and i really cant take - it's washing my identity away. I feel cold chills constantly, random migraines, stomach aches. I cant socialize normally and if i dont i feel terribly alone. I rarely laugh and always as a distraction and the only emotion that i can experience is when i force myself to cry. 

Everyday im further losing any control that i had and im approaching a place of actually trying to harm myself fatally.
