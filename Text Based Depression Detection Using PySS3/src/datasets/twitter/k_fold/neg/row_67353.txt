Does Xanax make it easier?For exsanguination, that is. I've terrible anxiety, and a particular obsession with cardiac function. It doesn't help that a cardiologist told me yesterday that I may have a weakened heart after performing an echocardiogram. I'm now on a heart monitor with further testing lined up after Christmas. Reading further into the stages of blood loss, it seems I can expect my heart and anxiety to really give me trouble as I approach death. I don't want to stop the act because of my nervousness. Would Xanax be an effective tool to manage my unrest so that I can follow through with my intentions?
