i can no longer do thishey sorry I just need to let everything out. honestly I'm not sure how much more of this I can take. i feel like I've lost everyone. i feel like I have no one anymore. I'm exhausted. I'm so close to just killing myself already. i lied to everyone. i told my grandmother I stopped harming myself but I haven't. she was so relieved when I said no. she was about to cry. but I lied. i just hate myself. Im a terrible person. everyone is slowly leaving me and I deserve it. i deserve all this suffering. im tired of being told that I should die and being told I'm going to hell because of my sexuality and gender. people are telling me to die and no one cares. it's taking over my mind and I think their right. I tell my grandfather about how I wanted to kill myself and he said he doesn't care and I should do it because only cowards kill themselves. Iam losing all my friends. It's all my fault. I can't properly share my emotions. i just ignore them. I isolate myself from all of them. but they don't care anyways. they have each other and other people. as long as they think I'm okay it's good. but really I'm suffering and I'm so close to killing myself right now. I think they all have other friends. they deserve better. i should kill myself so no one has to put up with me. I can't put up with myself. i ruined everything. it's all my fault. this is what I get. i just need to die to end this all. im sorry
