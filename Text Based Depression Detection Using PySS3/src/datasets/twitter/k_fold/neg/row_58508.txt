Failing School, rest of my family and friends doing really well, getting depressed and insulted by teachersWhen I started school my parents were divorcing, so doing work felt impossible for me. Now I can't get out of that state, my grades are barely scraping by, my  siblings/friends are all getting A's, and even B's in their worst subjects. Whenever I try to answer a question one of my teachers just starts screaming at me. 
Suicide has been on and off, sometimes I'm feeling normal, then as soon as something goes wrong It just gets worse and worse,,, Now Is one of the worst times the the point I feel a need to ask for help.
