"It gets better" "You'll find happiness eventually" and other optimistic tropes I entirely disagree with.First off, I'm m 21 and I live in the US. I don't know if that bit of information matters, but there it is anyway.

Moving past that though... I'd like to talk about my own feeling that the kinds of statements listed in my title and those like it just seem wrong to me. They may work for some people, they may get them through life, they may even come true for some or even most. I've lived my entire life in a chronic state of unhappiness. And I do mean my entire life. I've had a boat load and a half of family issues, I have a personality disorder, I've had my issues in school and with people, friends and romantic relationships. And though I certainly can't tell the future I don't see how I ever really find happiness. It's hard to explain in a space like this... But I look at it this way:

There are 7.5 billion people on the planet. Statistically speaking, some of them just won't ever be happy, especially when you're like me and don't have a belief in any higher power that will guarantee happiness at some point so long as you do "the right things" in life. With that belief in mind, my past in consideration and just the general pattern of my life thus far, I don't see a better option than suicide. I can try this or do that, go to therapy (because it's worked so well since grade school) or do any number of things and still end up chronically unhappy with life. Still feel empty inside, still feel empty, directionless and wholistically without a purpose or I can just skip a few steps and end the mind numbing madness now. It's my life after all... I get that I only have one, that there's no coming back, no respawn or reset button. I don't care... I'm just tired.
