Survived many attempts. Currently at a crossroadsSo Iâ€™ve struggled with being suicidal since I was 14. Iâ€™ve attempted many times some were stopped, others didnâ€™t work. I sunk into drug and alcohol addiction and many of my attempts involved being drunk or high. I recently lost one of my best friends (someone I loved dearly) to addiction. She was the only person I had met that understood me completely. The beginning of this year my friend from growing up tried to kill herself and told me when she was doing it. She didnâ€™t want me to save her saying â€œyou out of all people would understandâ€ and I did but I went and saved her anyways. Now sheâ€™s still a depressed alcoholic and I have mixed feelings cause why the fuck did I save her just so she could continue to suffer, but I know it was the right thing to do. But anyways I tried to kill myself after that and failed, then a few weeks later my friend died of an OD. I tried to get sober after all that cause I realized if I continued my addiction I would die from either suicide or an od. I went to rehab and moved to live with my parents. Iâ€™ve been mostly sober (I smoke weed cause it helps with my suicidal thoughts, as Iâ€™m not acting on them). But I just want to die. I feel like Iâ€™ve traumatized myself with all these attempts. I canâ€™t get past the thoughts that I donâ€™t want anything in this life. I just want to feel loved and I have felt loved in the past but it was never enough or is gone now. I know Iâ€™m just rambling but I know I canâ€™t do this to the people that care about me. Iâ€™ve been on the other side of suicide and I know how shitty it is to lose people. But fuck why canâ€™t I just not always be in pain. I feel like I am waiting for someone to just kill me so itâ€™s less painful on the people who care. Like I feel like going back to drugs so that maybe Iâ€™ll just die from that and itâ€™ll be less tragic. But thatâ€™s so depressing. I want to be happy. I want to love and be loved back. I want to be strong. But thatâ€™s just not my reality
