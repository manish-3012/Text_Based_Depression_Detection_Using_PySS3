I have no reason to liveHi, I'm not sure if anyone out here will read this or care, but if you do thank you.

I'm a 24 year old female and I am very suicidal, I'm scared that my will to live is dwindling faster each day. My whole life is a mess and I desperately need help.

I have always struggled with anxiety and depression but I went to university and I had a job and it kept my mind focussed and busy. But in May, I lost my mother who was my whole world and my depression got so bad that I couldn't leave my house. I lost my job and I've been unemployed since. 

One of the main reasons I haven't killed myself yet was my mother, and now that she's gone I just don't see what I have to live for? What's making this a million times worse is, I literally have no money. I am in so much debt, in the tens of thousands- mainly due to taking care of my mum when she was sick and having to take out pay day loans to pay my bills. 

I am stuck in such a rut. I want to live, I really do but I just feel like there is no hope. I know that money isn't everything but my debts are crippling me and ruining my life even more. I am truly at a loss and have no one to speak to about this.
