I still remember...I remember Tempest Smith. 16 years later. And I think to myself that when I was her age (I literally was in 2001...she'd be 28 now like me) I could have done the same. I never did but 16 years later, I still remember her...and I cry...

Someone will remember you, and will cry as well. It may not seem like it now, but someone will. Don't stop fighting, because someday it will be better. It just may take awhile.
