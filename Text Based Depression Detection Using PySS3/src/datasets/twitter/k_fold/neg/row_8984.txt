I'm no longer suicidal....and I don't think I ever was. You see, I think what drove me to considering suicide was the erroneous belief that somehow my death means something to someone. It doesn't. Or at least to the people that I want it to mean something to. Nowadays I don't really care about others or what they think of me being dead. Honestly, the reason I wanted to kill myself was because I was depressed that I had no friends coupled with the fact that I wanted someone to care that I was gone. But as you can see, those two things contradict each other. If I don't have people that like me, there is no one who is gonna care if I'm gone. And if I'm gone, there is a 100% chance that things won't get better. But you know what? Screw that. I don't need friends. I think it's pretty self demeaning to compare your self worth to how many other people like you. If I end up getting friends, a girlfriend, or whatever, then great. If not, so be it. I don't really care that much anymore. Something is better than nothing. A life is better than no life. At least I can FEEL something. Even if it is non stop pain and misery. It's what keeps me going.
