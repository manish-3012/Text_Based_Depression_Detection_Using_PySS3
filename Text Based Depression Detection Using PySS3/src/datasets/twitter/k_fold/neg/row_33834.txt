Rather to kill myself than becoming slowly insaneI am slowly becoming insane. My mood is getting slowly out of control. Laughting incontrollable, unable to control my mood...

Reasons? My life was full of dispair so far. Not even a single success. Dooomed to fail. I failed through the final exams twice. Cant even study anthing now. Written over 30 applications not even a signle one is gonna take me. My parents is blaming me daily about my failture. Every day they keep telling me how hard I failed, how my life would have changed if I would pass them. Everything I have achieved are getting forgotten winning international and national competitions in Math. The only thing that they remember is that I am nothing but a failture....

I want to end this. Just end everything.
