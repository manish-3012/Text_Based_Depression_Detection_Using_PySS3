honestly been starting to think that no one cares and iâ€™m meant to die this earlylife just keeps throwing bullshit after bullshit at me and iâ€™m so done trying to keep up. no one cares. i canâ€™t really explain it but even around family 24/7 i feel so alone. no one really knows me, even though iâ€™ve tried so much. everyone either leaves or doesnâ€™t care enough. iâ€™m done seeking help, nobody cares until youâ€™re gone. i just wish someone would walk up to me, hold me, tell me they care and theyâ€™ll be here for me. but no one will because everyone else is so self absorbed. i spend hours caring about other people, listening to their problems, but as soon as i need help everyoneâ€™s gone. so many other people deserve such a great life and i wish i could give them all a piece of mine and just fade away. fuck this place
