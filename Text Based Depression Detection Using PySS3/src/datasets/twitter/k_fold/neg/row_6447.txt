I just made my mind to give upI blocked all the numbers in my phone who would try to find me, Iâ€™ve thought this out plenty. Iâ€™m just broken and I donâ€™t have it in me to keep trying to wake up to fight broken every day. Iâ€™ve taken enough fentanyl to do the job, and Iâ€™m parked someone no one would look. So itâ€™s a waiting game at this point. 

I donâ€™t know what my point in writing this is but if anyone could give me some company in words for a little Iâ€™d appreciate it
