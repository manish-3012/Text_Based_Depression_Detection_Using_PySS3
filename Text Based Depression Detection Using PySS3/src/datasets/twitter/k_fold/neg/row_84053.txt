I don't know what to do anymoreI feel so alone.
In the past 2 years I've had 3 people cut me out of their lives completely (1 with no warning whatsoever, it was a complete ghosting) because *they* couldn't cope with how severe my depression has gotten.
I'm on Sertraline (Zoloft) 100mg, and I've just been enrolled onto a course for CBT, but I've been jobless for 3 months now and all of my best friends and family live in other towns.

Some days when I get up before noon, shower, have breakfast, and leave my flat - whether to go into town, sit in a cafe with a book for an hour, or even if it's just to take the bins out - I feel the clouds parting and get a little perspective again.
Today, however, has been one of those rare, awful days where I've done everything I can and instead it's just sapped me of all my energy and positivity; I just ugly cried for a straight half hour and now I'm lying on my bed staring at the walls, trying to think of anything but how I might go through with.... well, you know What, if it ever came to that.

Please, if any of you have anything supportive to say, or any advice at all, I'd love to hear from you.
