I just don't think I can do the divorceThe relationship has been broken for a long time (14 years  total; 6+ years unhappy) so no heartbreak over that that but the details kill me, as does the bleak future.

I just can't deal with the asset reallocation, the shitty 1-bd/1-bath that I'll have to do for a bit, the maybe re-invest in a property in a neighborhood I like but has priced me out, the prospect of dating in my late 40s... I just don't want it. Nothing sounds good there.

Even my best friend, trying to cheer me up about prospects says how good a catch I am since I'm not hooked on opiods - that's the BEST thing I have going for me? Either prospects are grim or I'm a serious loser. I just lost 85 pounds... I was feeling pretty good, til then. I thought I might be a decent 45yo guy. Guess not.

I don't hate my soon to be ex either. If I just offed myself and she got the insurance, I'm fine with that. There's no one else in my life that could benefit. I'm not bitter.

I just feel like... give it enough time and I'm eating a bullet... why not let someone benefit?
