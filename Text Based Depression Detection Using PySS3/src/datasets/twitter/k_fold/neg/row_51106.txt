Iâ€™m sick of the cycleHonestly, Iâ€™m super broke. Iâ€™m 27 and live in my parents basement, unable to afford rent because I work a low paying job. Iâ€™m so broke and I recently got injured and now am out of work for a couple weeks. It sounds stupid and shallow to even want to die because of finances but I feel like a complete loser. I used to be self sufficient, I was doing great for a while, I lived out of state in a place I loved. Now Iâ€™m back home and I really am a shell of my former self. I have a girlfriend I love and while she says she loves me rich or poor, and I try to provide as much as I can and take us out and do stuff, I just feel like less of a man for being always short money or broke. I hide it a lot of the time, but I just canâ€™t help but feel like Iâ€™m inadequate. I donâ€™t know anymore, I just want the pain to go away. Iâ€™m in school, I feel like I should have had my shit figured out in my early 20s but here I am.
