Worries arenâ€™t enough anymore

First off, I want to start by saying that I have experienced suicidal thoughts in the past, and I still have quite serious bouts of depression and self harm sometimes, but for the most part I no longer have suicidal thoughts. But this post isnâ€™t just about me, itâ€™s me seeking advice. Recently I found out that my girlfriend is suicidal and has already planned how she is going to kill herself. She suffers from severe anxiety and she seems to self harm quite a lot as I notice new cuts on her arms every time I see her... She often has panic attacks seemingly out of nowhere, sometimes I think they are because she struggles to deal with social situations though. We have a great group of friends that make her happy when she is with them but she believes that none of them truly care about her. She also has a very difficult relationship with her family which makes her feel like they donâ€™t care either. As much as I try to help her Iâ€™m scared as hell that one day maybe it wonâ€™t be enough and that sheâ€™ll go without telling me, she doesnâ€™t want me to blame myself but I feel like it might push me over the edge, Maybe it sounds selfish but I want whatâ€™s best for her and just need help on how to help her, she refuses to get professional help which I can understand as because of her anxiety she struggles to trust and open up to people, but I feel like at this point there isnâ€™t much I can do other than encourage her to see a professional. Hearing her say â€œI donâ€™t want to be here anymoreâ€ completely broke my heart and I feel like I wouldnâ€™t be able to live with myself if she was gone. 

Iâ€™ll probably delete this post when I wake up in the morning but for just now itâ€™s here.
