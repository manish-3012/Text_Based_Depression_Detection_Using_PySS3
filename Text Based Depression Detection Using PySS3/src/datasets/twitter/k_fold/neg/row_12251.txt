Well here I am againCurled up knees to chest in a bathtub of lukewarm water, crying my eyes out. I can feel my stomach caving in and out. Mostly over my ex who left me a year ago and has happily been with someone else ever since. And everyday I miss him and wish I could go back. He was perfect, he made my life worthwhile, and I wasnâ€™t enough, no matter how hard I tried. Now heâ€™s gone. Heâ€™s not coming back.

For a while I was okay, after trying 4 medications I was having some success with Cymbalta, but the side effects became too much for me and I tampered myself off. And now Iâ€™m back to waiting to die. Itâ€™s good to know that medication was just an illusion, and Iâ€™ve realistically made zero progress in moving forward. 
No friends who care, no money at all, a shit part time job, parents who have admitted Iâ€™m a burden to them. An ugly failure, waste of a life. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because I donâ€™t want anything to happen to my pet if I go, I love her too much.
