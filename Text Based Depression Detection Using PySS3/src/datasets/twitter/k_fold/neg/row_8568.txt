I have a final exam tomorrow. Iâ€™ve been studying all week doing practice problems with friends. Iâ€™m on academic probation and letâ€™s just say school was the only reason why I felt like fighting to live. But if I flunk out and am kicked out what good am I? To anyone?Everyone was proud of me and looking up to me, but now I just feel empty, cold even. Like if I bomb this final Iâ€™m just going to end it. 

Every now and then I have thoughts about driving off a cliff. Just drinking on the edge and going full throttle. I try to distract myself and sometimes talk to loved ones, but I donâ€™t want people to worry about me. Iâ€™ve always felt alone despite having many ppl Ik fuck with me heavy.

Even so, I just feel numb and life kinda seems meh rn. I have no idea what Iâ€™m going to do.
