A bad life.My life has always one way or another been terrible. Each day either a new challenge or a new reason to feel like shit. Scratch that actually every single day is a new reason to feel like shit.




I'll give some background, my parents don't love me, my friends don't care about me, er...the one friend I have doesn't care about me, I have no one who ever really talks to me so I spend most of my time alone even when I try to meet new people...




According to my friend and family and people who I've awkwardly asked before,I'm not very attractive. I have a abnormally large nose and I guess as they say weirdly seperated eyes. wish I could fix it somehow? I'm also very short at 5'2 which is always fun I guess.





Life is not very good, I would say it all went down after I had turned 12 years ago. And now I am in a shit hole. Distractions don't really work, they never did. I've always been bullied at school which isnt enjoyable.
