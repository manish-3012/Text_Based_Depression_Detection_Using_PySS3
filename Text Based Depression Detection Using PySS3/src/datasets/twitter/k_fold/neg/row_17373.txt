Iâ€™m gonna try and liveRecently Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of thinking. Iâ€™ve talked to some friends and mulled things over in my head and I want to live. Iâ€™ve made two posts here, one of which spoke about how I was going to commit suicide that night. I changed my mind and Iâ€™m gonna try and do this myself. Sure, I should seek help but for now Iâ€™m gonna try this out myself. My depression and suicidal thoughts have all come from many things, but itâ€™s mainly my self image. I hate my personality, thought process, emotions and every aspect of my mind. Same for my body. I self harmed specifically as a mental and physical punishment to force myself into acting normal and changing my personality. As bad as that sounds, itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve grown to do. So, I decided to buy a pull up bar. This way, I can self harm in a more â€˜productiveâ€™ way I guess because of the muscle pain. I know it sounds weird, but itâ€™ll help. I used to go to the gym for the same reasons. I really should seek help, but for now Iâ€™m just gonna see if I can get through this. I hope this is sincerely the last thing I ever post here.
