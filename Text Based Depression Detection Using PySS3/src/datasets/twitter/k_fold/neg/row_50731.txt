Cant stop thinking about how much I hate myselfI don't know when it started, but at some point in the last few years I started telling myself "I hate myself." when ever I felt shitty. It escalated from that to physically saying that under my breath when no one can hear me. Since then it's not only become an "i feel shitty"-mantra, but evolved from "I hate myself" to "I wish I was dead" to "I want to fucking die" to "I want to kill myself." Thing is, once I say or even think one of those phrases, it's like a gong went off in a cavern. Just reverberations of "I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself. I wish I was dead. Fuck I hate myself. I want to kill myself...." I catch myself saying it out loud without meaning to. I've started to actually think about how to do it.  I can't make the fucking phrase stop going through my head. The worst part of all of this is that I am so well off. I have a good family. I exercise. I eat healthy. I have a girlfriend, dogs. Fuck. And all I can think is how I absolutely despise myself. My earliest memories are literally of realizing that I am not important (specifically I literally stopped what I was doing and thought to myself something along the lines of "who do you think you are? you aren't harry potter. you aren't special.") On top of all that I am so stressed by (relatively minor) debt and my innate inability to make deadlines for whatever reason. I have all these nice things and I still fucking hate myself. I don't get it. fuck.
