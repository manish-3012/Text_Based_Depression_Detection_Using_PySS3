To much to handleI don't even know what to right here. I'm to fearful to commit suicide, but I don't want to live. I've written countless poems about committing suicide and how it would give me freedom from this nightmarish life. In less than two months I've lost my girlfriend, my job, my health, my home, and all the little self respect and confidence I've had. I can't keep living this nightmare. I understand the meanings about every song about suicide and wish I could actually go through with it. My ex was the only one that cared for me, my parents don't even care about me. I was depressed for 4 years, my ex new right away, and my parents wouldn't have known unless I told them. I feel like I'm done with this life, I have no reason to live so why should I? 

I'm giving up on poems


Alone

Rejection by your peers,
Living through everyday fears,
Enough to draw salty tears,
Feeling pain over the years,

Time of happiness; briefly granted,
Signs of change implanted,
Views of insight suddenly slanted,
Never again to be replanted,

Quivering my change of life,
Showing the world your strife,
Those that harbour you in rife,
A solution unsolvable with a knife,

No one stands next to me,
Alone is the most I can ever be,
I am you; I know you'd disagree,
I am you; the part you refuse to see,
