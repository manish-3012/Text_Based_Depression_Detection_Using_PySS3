She beat me and my father and constantly shouted at us throughout my childhood, and now wonders why we aren't close and why I don't seem to love herMy mother used to throw things at us, hit us, and she constantly berates us for any wrongdoing, and she never lets anything go. Now that I'm older, she wonders why Im not as loving towards her as I used to be. I know I'm not perfect. I'm so far out from perfect. I'm a loser and a thief and an irritable asshole. I've cost too much time and money. My mother (rightfully) wishes she never had me and that she had my cousin instead. The worst part is that I love her, but I can't get that feeling of resentment to go away, and most days, I don't want it to. It hurts so bad. I'm just an absolute waste of space that'll spend all its life going nowhere. I want my last thoughts to be of the times my girlfriend and I spent together. All I want is to be happy.
