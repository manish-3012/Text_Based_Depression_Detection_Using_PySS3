I feel off...I feel nothing lately... When night falls I'm depressed... 

I don't have anyone to be with! My relationship with my parents is not good! Feels like I need a dog or a girlfriend to be with!

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips? So that I can get out of this situation? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm a porn addict and trying to escape from it and I end up relapsing to porn which makes me suicidal again!
