I Wish I Had the Power to Change.It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive. 

I wish I had the power to change. I drift in and out of lives and never end things properly. It's better to forget me but I'll never forget them. I hope it hurts them less than it hurts me. 

But with age, it gets harder and harder to execute. I left my mother, my father, my sisters, my brothers, my friends. And they refuse to forget me, no matter the distance. 

I just want everything to end, I'm so tired of fighting. Each day is a drag without any signs of promise. I feel so close to the cowards way out, but I can't yet. There are still lives I haven't faded out of.

But how am I to stay when every night my blade goes a little deeper? When it drifts away from the safer zones and dances along my veins? I remind myself that there's still time because I haven't settled everything yet. But my selfish nature has a mind of its own at times.

I can't forgive anyone, especially my mother. I don't know how to and I don't want to. It's so useless, how do I go on?

I need help or I need to start planning a date. 

Pursuing therapy tomorrow.
