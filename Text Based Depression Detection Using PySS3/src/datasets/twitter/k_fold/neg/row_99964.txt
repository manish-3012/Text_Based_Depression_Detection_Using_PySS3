I Wish I'd Pulled the Trigger in 2016This is a suicidal ideation relapse. I went almost 6 months in a state of what I perceived as "change." I thought life was getting better, but this black cloud lurked inside me waiting for an opportunity to peak its head out and remind me that I am worthless and hopeless and unlovable.  
November 2016:  
I sat at my desk, loaded my pistol, and pushed the barrel against my temple with every intention of killing myself.  
Thoughts of absolute failure and loss encompassed me. I could see my ex fiance's face telling me she didn't love me anymore. Telling me I couldn't be in my unborn baby boy's life.  
I'd worked and gone to school full time to support us. I wanted to be a dad. I wanted the family I never had. I would give my child the life I couldn't have. One full of love. One with a real dad who wouldn't leave him abandoned and feeling like nobody ever cared.  
My friends kept telling me things would get better, but they haven't. It's been almost 4 years. I can't get past this. The damage this did to my psyche seems to be permanent. I can't handle stress, I can't build relationships. I don't trust anyone. I'm always expecting failure and loss. People always leave. I'm not worth committing to in any type of relationship, romantic or platonic.  
Four years later, I somehow graduated from university with almost perfect grades. It meant nothing without people. I celebrated alone with a six pack. Not much of a celebration when a six pack is a nightly ritual. No other way to sleep. Now I drink just to survive.   
I want to die, but I can't do it, so I'm killing myself slowly by not taking care of my body. I'm very actively choosing the most unhealthy things. I don't drink water to the point of headaches and extreme dehydration. I drink every day. Some days I eat almost nothing. I tell myself that it will shorten my life and I won't have to keep enduring the pain.  
Nobody would even know if I died. Even if they found out, they wouldn't care. I hate this place, and I don't know why people find me so worthless. I do everything I can to meet expectations, but I'm not good enough.  
I'm going to try to gain the courage to poison myself or slice an artery or something.
