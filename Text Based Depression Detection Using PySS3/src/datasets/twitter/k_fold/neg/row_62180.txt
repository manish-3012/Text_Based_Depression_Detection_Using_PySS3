I don't think I'll make it through the weekendI don't think life has anything to offer me, I'm simply incapable to interact correctly with people, I'm diagnosed with depression since I was 14, and been on treatment since then. But I'm tired... I have no reasons to keep on with this, but for some reason I thought about posting here. I don't think it will change anything though, I'll be dead before Monday probably, and it may be for good.
