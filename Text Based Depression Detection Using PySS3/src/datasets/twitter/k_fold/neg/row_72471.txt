My friend says he's having suicidal thoughts and I don't know what to do.I don't know if this is the right subreddit, so I apologize in advance.

My friend just recently texted me. He asked for advice on how to suppress suicidal thoughts. This came as a shock to me, as he showed signs of depression before but I never thought it would escalate this much.

Now, I am kind of freaking out. I know suicide is a serious thing, but I don't know what to do. Part of the reason why is because of his age. He's only 14. The only thing I can think of as to why he is so depressed is that he recently broke up with his girlfriend. I don't know what to do. I f he's serious, how do I help him?
