Just really tiredI just cannot deal with anything. Mental illnesses completely take my fucking energy and make it so that getting a job is impossible (that and every single attempt to get a job is never good enough to the people in charge of giving them out). I'm 24 and forced to live with bigoted parents who deny who I am at every single chance they get as a result and try to force their reality and their perceptions of who I am onto me. I cannot get out of here no matter how hard I try.

I lost my grandma last month. I'm now dealing with potentially having to give up a cat that I love the most. I haven't gotten a single message from some people close to me in two weeks. Their social media is so quiet and this is very unusual. It's tempting to just walk down to the pond and either drown or let the gators make me into a meal. Whatever comes first. It's tempting to just go and find a way to catch COVID-19, isolate myself, and die of that. I haven't decided. I'm thinking of not eating or drinking anything until at least one of those people comes back or someone affiliated with them let's me know all is well. That'll kill me if they never come back, too. I am so tired.
