About to go to the garage and keep the car runningIâ€™ve always suffered with depression since high school, and always thought things would get better with time. This past year alone things have only become worse. The girl I was in love with cheated on me and told me it was my fault. The job I got after college has been miserable and the thought of going back another day makes me feel ill. And the worst part is where I moved, I donâ€™t know a single person. So all of this on top of being alone every night has given me clarity that Iâ€™m just not meant to be here anymore.

I honestly donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting on here, but I guess itâ€™s just good to get everything off my chest before itâ€™s over.
