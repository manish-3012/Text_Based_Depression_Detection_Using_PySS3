Been unemployed 1 yearI still don't know what I want to do with my life. I dont want to do anything. College is damn expensive and I dont like any courses or programs. Depression makes me not interested in anything so that's how I know. Depression is here forever. Am I really destined to be a homeless dude forever. What a joke
