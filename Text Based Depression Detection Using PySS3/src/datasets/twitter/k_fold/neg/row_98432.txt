Can't do itAll I do is chain smoke cigarettes and wait for the days to end so I can try and hang myself at night while my housemates are sleeping. I've tried partial suspension about 20 times but it just doesn't work. So last night I planned to try from the pergola outside again. I tried once before but the pain was unbearable and I didn't pass out like all accounts say I should. I spent too long writing a suicide letter and before I knew it it was 6am. I knew the others would be up for work soon so the hanging was out of the question. I think about death all day every day and have for months. 2018 was the worst year of my life and 2019 is passing by just the same.  I have no hope that anything will ever get better. Lately I've been taking large doses of seroquel to put me to sleep.  I slept 26 hours earlier in the week and last night missed another entire a day. I went to bed at 8am and woke up at 3:30pm the following day. I have a ticket to a show tonight, but I don't want to go alone.  It's just humiliating. I don't enjoy anything anymore,  not even music. I hate that I have to go on like this. I spend 3-4 nights of every week at my dads house,  just hiding from my life. But he has lived a long miserable life himself and it's a bleak glimpse into my own future. I used to be an incredible person. Now I'm nothing. Every minute of every day is agony. I just want it to end. I'm tired of posting the same old things.  I just wish I could be successful in ending my life. I hate what I've done and I hate who I am. Nothing gives me any relief.
