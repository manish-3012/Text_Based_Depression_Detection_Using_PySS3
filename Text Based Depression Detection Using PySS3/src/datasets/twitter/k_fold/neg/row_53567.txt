I hate everyone &amp; everythingI canâ€™t get a grip of happiness anymore because Iâ€™ve been losing best friends &amp; close ones so many times before i canâ€™t trust people. I canâ€™t open up to anybody about my suicidal thoughts or when i have a mental breakdown. Iâ€™m too scared of what theyâ€™ll think of me. Iâ€™m always held up to be the tough one or the strong one. Iâ€™ve been losing family members &amp; friends left &amp; right. Itâ€™s like my whole world is falling apart &amp; i have no one by my side. Even when i found someone i can be happy with, that was tainted &amp; now Iâ€™m here trying to fix the pieces to the best of my abilities but Iâ€™m hearing negative comments &amp; negative responses. Like if these people knew half the shit Iâ€™ve been through in life theyâ€™d understand. But no they rather see me suffer just so they can prove to me that i was in the wrong. I finally opened up to someone about my scars &amp; suicide attempts but now Iâ€™m losing them because i canâ€™t trust that person anymore. Why is it that every time i find something good itâ€™s a lie. Why canâ€™t i be happy for a minute, why do i always have to cry &amp; want to die. I was offered help years ago but pulled out because i was making people look bad. I canâ€™t even get help anymore. Every single day i get closer &amp; closer to actually finishing what i shouldâ€™ve done years ago.
