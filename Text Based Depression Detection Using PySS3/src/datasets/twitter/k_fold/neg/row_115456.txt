What's the point of living if we're all going to dieI'm not a depressed or a suicidal person, in fact, I'm pretty happy with what I have in General, but thinking about death really puts me down. I have a purpose and I work towards my goals everyday but still, I feel like I want to achieve everything, know everything, but I only have life to do it and it's impossible, everything I'm gonna do, everything I'm gonna achieve, everyone I know, all I know, it's all going to disappear someday, life will go on and in a few hundred years we'll all be of the past, I'm not trying to sound pathetic but doesn't it bother you when you think about that? What's the point of living if we're all going to die?
