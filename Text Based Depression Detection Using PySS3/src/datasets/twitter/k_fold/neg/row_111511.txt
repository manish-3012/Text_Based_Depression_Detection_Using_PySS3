its not me, its my friend...not so long ago, my friend told me that she was cutting herself and that she had suicidal thoughts. quite recently i had to stop her from throwing herself in front of a car. she is in middle school and her parenting situation is VERY bad. her only reason for her self harm is that 'no one cares' even though most of her friends and I especially, do.
