I wish I was deadIâ€™ve tried my hardest for so long. But after decades of being bullied, emotionally abused by family and â€œfriends,â€ and being betrayed by the people I care about most, I just have zero will to live anymore. I try my hardest to make sure every one of my few friends gets along. But people disappearing at random, saying stuff behind my back, and just trashing me make it very hard. I saw myself as a fighter. But enough is enough. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going to go walk out the door and kill myself, but if I had the option of someone snapping their fingers and me being dead, Iâ€™d take it 100% of the time.
