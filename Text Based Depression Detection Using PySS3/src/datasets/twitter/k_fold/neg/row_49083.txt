Suicide is not always selfish. Stop pretending that it is.With the exception of people who have people who directly depend on them then which it is. 
Personally I think that if someone is at the point where they feel like they have tried all options to try to improve their lives itâ€™s more selfish to make someone to continue a life that doesnâ€™t bring them any thing. 

Most of the time people know when someone is in a bad state but choose to not act on that knowledge then act like have lost everything when they lose someone. They would have had their chance but chose to not act.
