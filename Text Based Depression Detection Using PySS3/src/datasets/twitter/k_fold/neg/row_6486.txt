Give me a good reasonI have been single for 7 years. Most of my friends wont even call me unless i reach out to them first. Even then when i hang out with them most of them get angry at me. I have no prospects for future relationships and little chance of making new friends. My parents and sister would be sad if i was gone. I have maybe 2 friends that would be sad if i was gone. My life is not the worst, as i am not disabled or have any sort of specific problems. I am rather intelligent and i am somewhat phyiscally fit. I have many skills which could be utilized for financial gain. I am sure i could become some kind of entreprenuer or a doctor or something if i applied myself. But i am not happy. I dont really know the last time i actually was happy. The only thing i can see my for my future is the constant drip of mediocrity and unfulfillment. Why should i continue going through the motions and living is misery just to make sure the handful of people who will get over my death will never have to?
