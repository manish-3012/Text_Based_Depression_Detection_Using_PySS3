Meh, can't seem to find "it"Okay by "it" I mean something that interests me, what do I wanna do. Motivation to get up in the morning, the urge to go out and do whatever the hell it is people do. As days go by I just want yell at everyone to shut up so I can be selfish to just have complete silence only to be left alone with thoughts of why do I find such comfort in it? Pretty sure it's cause I'm just sick of people talking about random shit, being hypocrites or whatever the role the day has them for. I don't wanna move, work, or even socialize these days. Only reason I even move is cause people wouldn't banging on my hatch till I'm out. Sorry about what seems like a rant but I'm not trying to make it sound that way, just that I'm just annoyed by everything it feels like. Death itself seem relaxing like how much would one less person make a difference .why not disappear?
