I don't knowI don't know who else to talk to so.. I'll just post here I guess. I might not answer messages, I'm pretty.. I don't even know the words to use. I feel defeated.

I'm pretty sure that my boyfriend (27)  intentionally leaves me broke.. He works a full time job making 25+ bucks an hour, over 40 hours a week. I'm a 20 year old girl and we just had our first baby a year ago, so I've been on assistance. Whenever we need to buy things, my cards are always used and I'm never repaid like he claims.. 

Anyway, today we fought because he wouldn't leave me some cash so I could buy tampons, (I'm completely out right now.) He refused, accusing me of wanting the money for a date. (???) I got upset and practically begged him to leave the cash so I wasn't in a mess all day while dealing with our son. He ended up getting so angry that he shoved me, threw a box of silverware at me, (we've just moved into our new apartment) and dislocated my jaw. 

Thank god my son was still asleep.. I've called two women's shelters, both of whom didn't have room for us.. They didn't even seem to care. I called two suicide prevention lines, and both times I got "This number is not in service." My phone is working and I know those are the correct numbers.. 

It feels like life is telling me to quit. My boyfriend is amazing towards my son, so if I were gone I know he would be okay.. My parents have walked away, I have no other family that would miss me. I can't see why I shouldn't wait until my son is with someone else, and then just quietly lie down and die. Even typing it out makes my whole body warm, fuzzy and tingly. It would be so.. peaceful. I want to go now. 

No one will even remember my name
