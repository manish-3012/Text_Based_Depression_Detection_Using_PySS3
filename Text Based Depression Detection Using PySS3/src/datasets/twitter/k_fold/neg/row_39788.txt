Today I prayed for death on my walk home from the bar.I watched a girl who used to be super into me dancing with another guy who she's definitely off fucking right now.  I tried to shake it off, and briefly talked to another girl who I think may kind of be into me.  I talked to a few other girls, but nothing panned out.  I haven't had a girlfriend in years.  I can't fall asleep if I don't get high first, because I hate my life.  I'm successful in many ways, and, if wasn't so depressed, professionally, at least, I'd be set, but I can't pull a 40 hour week because I spend all of my time thinking about how I just want to hit the reset button and not lead a lame life anymore.

I feel like I have few real friends, and that that's how it's always been.  Like my parents are "rooting for me," but think that as long as my mom loves me, that that's enough for me to build a life out of.

I'm broke.

I'm fat.

I haven't been laid in like a year, and last time it was with a fat chick.

I'm not the sort to kill myself.. but I really don't see my life ever changing for the better.
