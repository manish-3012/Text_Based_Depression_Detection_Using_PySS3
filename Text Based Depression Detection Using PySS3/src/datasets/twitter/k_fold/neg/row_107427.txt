If I'm dead, would I be free?If I was to die, I wouldn't have to worry about anything anymore. I don't have to care what people think of me and won't have to take everyone's abuse. No one cares about me and I don't think I have a purpose for living anymore. I find myself a burdon on everyone and lost my will to live a long time ago.

Everytime I tell someone this, they just say I want attention. My mom says if I'm really suicidal, I should just do it. And anyone that tries to "help" me says the same generic crap.

So why should I not commit suicide? I have nothing to live for. If I was gone, it'd probably make everyone happy. Like I said, I would be free from all the pain I get every day.

Thanks for reading this btw, it means a lot :)
