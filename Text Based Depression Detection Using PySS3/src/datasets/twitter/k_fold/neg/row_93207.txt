that's it I'm ending it. I ruin everything by being alive. finally got the proof I needed that everyone would be better off if I was dead.the only reason I'm still alive is my niece.  I love her like she was my own daughter. her dad committed suicide so the only reason I've been fighting this long is because I thought if I did too she would internalize it.

this weekend is her 13th birthday. I wanted more than anything to make it something she'd never forget.  so I planned this big weekend in nyc, spent like $1500.  originally it was supposed to be my me, my niece and my sister (her mom). then my mom wanted to come (read: typical jewish mother with the nagging to the tenth power).  then my sister couldn't come last minute.  I was already not doing well before we left, but since weve been here all she does is yell at me about everything; how much money I spend, my health (physical side effects of my depression) to the point I broke down crying in times square.  I tried to hold it in for hours but I broke.  and now I ruined my niece's birthday.

clearly I am making her life worse not better by being here. so that's it.  I'm ending it.  now I just have to figure out how to tie loose ends.  note/no note?  will my niece still get my life insurance? (ive been paying on it for several years in the hopes it would set her and my nephews up for life (about 600k)).  and most importantly, how do I do it so that someone will take care of my dog?  if I'm not found for a few weeks?  can I put him in a kennel and have them call my next of kin?

any advice is appreciated.  and if you made it to the end of this diatribe, thank you.  the world needs more people like you and less like me.
