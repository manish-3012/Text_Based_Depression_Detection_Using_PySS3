I really did tryI wanted to love myself. and be happy with who I am. I really did. But I donâ€™t think iâ€™ll ever will and Iâ€™m tired of living this way. I donâ€™t see another option. I think suicide is the only way iâ€™ll be free and happy of myself. The thing is I just canâ€™t do it all of a sudden. I guess iâ€™ll take some time to really numb myself, accept it, and drift of entirely from life until I can finally go through with it. I will never be happy alive with this body. My days are numbered.
