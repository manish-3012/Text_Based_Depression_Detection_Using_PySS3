can't stop fantasizing about my optionsthis October I'll be going to Vegas to see my favorite band of all time. at the end of this month, my partner will be leaving the country on a business trip. I'll be alone in Vegas and I promised myself I wouldn't do anything while my partner is away, but I think being alone far away from anyone I know is perfect. 

i don't want to ruin the trip for my partner as they are going to a country they love. I don't want my roommates to find me. and experiencing one last cool thing before I go will be nice. idk. anyway, I think I'm done with this life. I've had enough.
