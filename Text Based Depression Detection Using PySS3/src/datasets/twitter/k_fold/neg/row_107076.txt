1 yearIn about 2 months it will be 1 year since my suicide attempt, and in march it would be 1 year since I got out of an impatient mental health facility. 
A lot of me wants to try again, I feel uncomfortable in my own body and feel too miserable to even live anymore. 
Its been a couple weeks since I last self harmed and the urge is so strong. I've tried so much to stop myself and hold it together but I'm lost, scared and helpless. I don't know what to do.
