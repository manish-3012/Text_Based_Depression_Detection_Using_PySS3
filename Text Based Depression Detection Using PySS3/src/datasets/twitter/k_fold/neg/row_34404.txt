A requestHey SW, I need your help. Last night I came across a post on SW right before I fell asleep, so I didn't comment fearing that he/she might want to talk while I was sleeping. The user mentioned how they felt like drinking chemicals under the sink to commit suicide and that they were thinking about going to therapy if they didn't do that. Well, I can't find that post any more and it worries me because I had intended on leaving a reply for them, as no one else had commented or upvoted the post. I looked at the user's other posts last night and one of them mentioned winning a Halo tournament or something like that and I believe the username started with an "h". Any help in locating this user would be greatly appreciated; I wish I had said something to them last night. Thanks.
