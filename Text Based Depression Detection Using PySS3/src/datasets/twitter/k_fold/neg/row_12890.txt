Can't stop thinking about my mistakesLast year at my school, I was bullied constantly by a kid and his group of friends. They would call me a fag, tell me to kill myself, and threaten my life. Some of the kids would even get physical with me and hit me. Every day I was being shoved up against a locker or being "five starred." I had enough of the bullying and went to the teachers at my school. The teachers did absolutely nothing and the kids made up a lie saying that I had used the n-word. This was completely false, as I am not racist and have never been racist. The teachers bought it and I was to be suspended from school. This caused an emotional strain on both me and my parents because I never really got in trouble at school, and was known for being the smart kid. Upon my 3-day suspension being over, I was called into a meeting at with all the teachers at my school. The told me I could admit that I lied or risk expulsion. The kids that I "bullied" just happened to be very influential at the school, and one of them had his last name on the athletic center. I held my ground and refused to cave in to the teachers questions. They then said because I was dishonest the needed to revaluate the situation. I got news that I had been expelled a few days later and was devastated. I loved school and learning, and I felt like harming myself. I was depressed for weeks and wanted to kill myself. My mother was impacted by this because of all the stress it put on her. She now has health problems and I feel it is all my fault. Even though this happened a year ago I cannot stop thinking about it.
