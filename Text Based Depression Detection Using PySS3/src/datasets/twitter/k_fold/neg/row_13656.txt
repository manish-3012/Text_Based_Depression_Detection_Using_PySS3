How do people actually go through with it?I'm just scared of hanging myself but I know it's something I must do rather than want to do. Besides my problems are permanent and can't be fixed so it's not a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

I need to hang myself soon but can't. I'm restricted on medication to once a week I'm going to take it all now see what happens
