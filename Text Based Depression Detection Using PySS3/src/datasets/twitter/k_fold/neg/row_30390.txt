14, i think tonight i might fuck it upEDIT: I am currently drunk. I am sorry to say I will be taking sky life. 


TL;DR at bottom



follow up to previous post

emma is no longer really responding to my messages, i think she is busy because she's not in the same city but i get really anxious about girls and it makes me jealous and super dreadful

i don't really know what to do anymore

tonight im having a few drinks to feel better but im probably gonna end up killing myself because i will be drunk, i dont really care anymore

im so fucking lonely that i feel nonchalant to everything and even my loneliness

not really worried about hurting the people around me except for my mom - for some reason i feel bad for this drug addicted piece of shit

i would feel really bad for my dad - i have autism, i got it from him, he has high functioning autism (i do too, i'm 14 in high school)

he has been put down his whole life, scammed by his mother at ages 4-12 by purchasing things with his social security, he could never have good credit afterward

he scored a perfect score on a test but 2 kids with an almost perfect score got extra points (scored above perfect) because they were black (while in this city black was the majority) and my dad got 0 scholarships following it

my dad learns 24/7 and i'd really hate to fuck with his life

i'm not saying that he is the smartest person that i know, not because he is my dad, because he's actually the smartest fucking person i know

he was accused (falsely, like said, my mother is a fucking NUTJOB) of beating my mom (they are "divorced" but never were married) and then his second wife same thing and now he is seeing a third girl

i feel bad for him, but all i wanted was to really matter to more than my dad

i could be an all a student but my teachers constantly give me zeros on shit that i actually do, i haven't looked at my grades in a few weeks because it just fucks me up

TLDR gonna get drunk and kill myself tonight

goodnight reddit, hopefully its my last
