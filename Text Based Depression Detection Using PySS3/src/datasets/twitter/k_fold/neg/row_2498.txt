My cat is my suicide prevention tool &lt;3 - a pet could change your lifeI read this article in the Metro today and just thought about how true it was:

My cat isn't a "therapy cat" (tbh, I'm surprised anyone has managed to train a cat for an actual purpose) but is 100% the reason I am here today. I adopted him in 2014 during a very low period despite people telling me it "wasn't the right time". All I can say is that people know what is best for them and I needed something to love. Trust your own instincts.

He is the reason I get out of the bed in the morning, and the reason I go to work. He is there when I go to sleep and when I wake up. I've cried into his fur a thousand times and he soaks up my tears. I tell him he is my little baby and that I will always be here to look after him. And in making that promise, I know I have to be here for him. I couldn't bear the thought of leaving him alone.

There's simply no room to consider suicide now. He is my life. In time I will adopt more animals because I know when he passes it will hit me hard. But as long as I have something furry in my life to give my love to, it tethers me to this world.

Sometimes I might think I want to die, but mostly I know I don't want to die. My purring ball of fur reminds me every day that I can't just quit. He keeps me going. If you are in the position to get a cat, I would recommend it above all things.
