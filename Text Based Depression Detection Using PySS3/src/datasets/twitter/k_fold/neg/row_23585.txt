Philosopy and suicideDisclaimer: the purpose of this post is not doing some campaign like "don't commit suicide".         I'm not the right person to talk about that and really I think this is not the right place to talk about that. (And english is my second language so I apologize in advance for possible errors.)

Generally people commit suicide to end their psychological pain.
You commit suicide because you presume that after your death all the pain and the suffering which made you deciding to end your life will end and you will be finally in peace.                    According to this, the soul dies with the body.       So your pain will end with your life.
But what evidences do we have about that?
What makes suicidals so sure that the death of the body will be also the death of their troubled mind? Do we have some information about what will happen after our death?
What if our soul was immortal, like Plato asserted? If it was, we couldn't do anything to stop our pain, not even die.
