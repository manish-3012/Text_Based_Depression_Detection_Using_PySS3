The only reason why I'm still alive is my familySo I thought over it and I came to the clue that I need to tell someone ... I'm currently 16 ( getting 17 next week ) and have nothing to live for except my sister's my little brother and my loving mother 
Everyone else from my family doesn't want to have anything to do with us. For example my grandma she does anything she can to play me and my brother against my sister and my mother 
My dad avoids paying child support sins he divorced my mother. 
I don't have any job or idea what I want to do with my life I hate myself and don't want anyone to worry about me cause every time when I find someone who I think I can trust and tell him/her about it they just say the usual bulshit like " don't say something like that / man up / good joke " and so one and so on 
And then after tow days or so after telling what's up they just start ghosting and never talk again 
I just can't trust people anymore
I just want to be happy again and don't worry what I want to do with my life 
I hate myself and society 
I want to turn back time and life in a time where you just could go raid another village and die in honor 
I don't want anyone to feel sad for me but it would be great if someone could tell me something that can help me getting happy again
