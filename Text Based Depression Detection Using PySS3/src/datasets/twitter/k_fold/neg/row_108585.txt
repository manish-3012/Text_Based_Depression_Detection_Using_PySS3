I just need to hang out for a dayI have too many friends who drink. They seem to be able to handle it so naturally. I'm not that way at all. I've gotten drunk with my friends, and they're all off to bed. I'm here once more, wondering if and when I should kill myself. I won't, but I would really appreciate if someone could check in with me in the morning, maybe someone who has experience with alcohol and suicidal tendencies? I know I will feel ashamed tomorrow, so please be kind. I've just grown so tired of trying to hide this from people I know and love.
