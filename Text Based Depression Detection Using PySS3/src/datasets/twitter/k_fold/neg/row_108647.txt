Please help me. Iâ€™ve reached my breaking point and Iâ€™m going to end my life.Iâ€™m so sorry to everyone who I am hurting. Iâ€™ve been wrestling with this for longer than anybody has known and I donâ€™t want anybody to think that they could have done something to stop me. This is only my fault for not being strong enough to hold on for you. I have been so deeply depressed for the last two years and I canâ€™t even begin to describe what it feels like. I had never really understood why people hurt themselves until I started feeling this way. And now look at me. Iâ€™m in so much pain and I hope you all will realize that Iâ€™m happy now. Iâ€™m sad that I need to leave everybody who loves me, but please feel better knowing that I donâ€™t hurt anymore. Iâ€™ve been hurting in an excruciating way for so long and itâ€™s over. Iâ€™m free.
