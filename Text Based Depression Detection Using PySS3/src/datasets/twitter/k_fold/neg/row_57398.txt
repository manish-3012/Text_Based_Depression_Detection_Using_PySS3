What am I supposed to doRight now I feel alone. I had one of the worst days of my life yesterday, every attempt I have at regular conversation with my ex they assume Iâ€™m just trying to persuade them to get back with me when Iâ€™m honestly just trying to be nice. Theyâ€™re going to end up walking away from me. I move out of my home in about a month to my own home, alone for the first time- Iâ€™m not in a mental state to live alone but I canâ€™t go back now. I miss my father. He is not deceased but as a child into my teenage years I couldnâ€™t stand the man, I ruined our relationship. I just wanna be. I donâ€™t know where but not here
