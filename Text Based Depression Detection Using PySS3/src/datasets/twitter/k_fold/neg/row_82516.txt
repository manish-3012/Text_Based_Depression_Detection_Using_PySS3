No matter how hard I try, Iâ€™ll never be good enough.Iâ€™ve made multiple posts on reddit about whether Iâ€™m ugly or not and I always get a similar response. â€œYouâ€™re interesting lookingâ€, â€œ Youâ€™re unique lookingâ€, or â€œYouâ€™re unattractiveâ€. All I want is to be beautiful. I want other people to perceive me in that way, but I feel like itâ€™s pointless. 

I made an onlyfans account to boost my self esteem since I never had much issues with my body, but if anything, itâ€™s made me hate my body as well. I constantly compare myself to other girls who have hundreds and even thousands of fans, while only have  eight. I had nine but lost one today so I feel like giving up at this point. 

The worst part was that I was practicing meditation, mirror work, and reciting positive affirmations, but this one situation was enough to erase all the work I did. Iâ€™m suicidal all over again and at this point Iâ€™m planning to just try again.
