im tired if the unending soundjust a rant hopefully. I have severe tinnitus its been there for weeks now and I can't sleep at night, my body is always on fight or flight ,mode whenever I hear the sound. I love my parents, I have supportive friends but the sound really got me want to kill myself. I don't want to die, I just want the sound to be gone. But I guess I have no choice. I can't live with this torture for the rest of my life.
