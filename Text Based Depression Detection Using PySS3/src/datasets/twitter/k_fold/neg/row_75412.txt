I feel like I'm in a plastic bubble with millions of people screaming at me from outside of the bubble.My head is playing games with me. I feel like someone is suffocating me. I just need to die right now. I'm so scared that I'm going to regret this. I don't know if I'm making sense. I took pills and smoked weed. My face is on fire. I can't sort out my own thoughts.  I need help.
