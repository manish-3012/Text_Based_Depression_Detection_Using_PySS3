Being a grownup is a lonely thingI make so many mistakes. 

When you are grownup, you don't have anyone to blame but yourself. When you are grownup, you have to fix your own mistakes. When you are grownup, you are responsible for everything you do. It's crushing, it's lonely, and it's confusing.

You think you are making the right choice and it's the wrong choice. You think you're doing the right thing, and it's the wrong thing. You spend days, weeks, months, sometimes years, working on how to make life better for you family, and you fail. Over and over and over again.

Christmas is the worst. There's nothing like Christmas to make you feel like a horrible parent.

I am so tired, so alone, and yet I have to keep going day after day after day. I keep waiting for the silver lining, but right now I'm slogging through an endless sea of gray.
