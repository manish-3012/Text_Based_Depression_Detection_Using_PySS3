Should I continue living.Iâ€™ve been through a lot compared to others, but compared to people on here, I donâ€™t think so. I think Iâ€™m just being a brat, or something. Maybe I shouldnâ€™t even post this. Might as well, anyways. Iâ€™ve been through a lot, says everyone I know, but have I? Iâ€™ve had been thinking about suicide for a while know I guess I just want to end everything, not just the pain of living. But living itself. Because I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m worthy of it. Because Iâ€™m so worthless I donâ€™t even deserve the title of being worthless, I donâ€™t even deserve to get help do I,
