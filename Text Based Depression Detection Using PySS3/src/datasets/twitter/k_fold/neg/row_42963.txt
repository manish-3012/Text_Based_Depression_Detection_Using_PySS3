Need to talk to someoneSitting here with a knife considering just ending it all, I'm so lonely and I've tried.. Listened to people telling me to "give it time", I've given it 3 years and sure I've had decent days but nothing has changed in my life, still sad, lonely, and have no actual friends. I wish I could just man up and fucking kill myself instead of telling myself I'll do it another day.
