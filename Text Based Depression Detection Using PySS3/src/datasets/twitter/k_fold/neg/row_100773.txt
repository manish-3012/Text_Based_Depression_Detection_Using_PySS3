Iâ€™m going to work yo the courage to kill myself tonightBeen getting fucked in the ass by life for the past 5 years. Every time I feel like I hit rock bottom, somehow my life finds a way to get worse. Iâ€™m only 23 and Iâ€™ve never done anything successful. Finally felt happy for the first time in a very long time last week all to be reminded of how much of a shit show my life really is. Rent is due tomorrow and Iâ€™m sick of this shit.
