Everything is just a void, I don't want this anymore.My life is useless, boring, I've always been told to work hard have a family and die peacefully, yet how hard I try it's never good enough, I graduated top of my class and they still blame me for everything, call me a failure, useless, a deadbeat I always finished my homework, even when I had a fever I went to school and work. I've had so much pressure that it's just a void now, a useless thing that's called life, everyday its the same thing, guilt, questioning, and suicidal thoughts, every time something good happened in my life I never cared because I knew it wasn't gonna last.

I fucking hate this life that I'm living, so I'm just gonna end it tomorrow by jumping of off a building and hopefully die fast, but who cared, if I die I die.

that's all that matters.

I'll update if I don't do it and decide to continue this useless piece of shit called my life.
