Donâ€™t really know where to go from here.I think about ending my life everyday. Iâ€™ve been here before, on and off through the years. I always end up back here. Maybe I canâ€™t do it anymore. The only person Iâ€™ve ever let see the real me loves me less and less by the day. I mess everything up, I canâ€™t think of a single thing I donâ€™t suck at doing. I isolated myself from anyone who has ever given a fuck about me. I hate every aspect of myself. I donâ€™t feel like I cut out for life.
