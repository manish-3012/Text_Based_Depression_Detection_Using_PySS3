â€œA strange game. The only winning move is not to play.â€I did not ask to be brought onto this planet to be forced into living a meaningless existence for decades, just for the sake of the happiness of the people who decided to snap me into this world from the void. The world is pointless and exhausting. There is no winning move for me in this game.
