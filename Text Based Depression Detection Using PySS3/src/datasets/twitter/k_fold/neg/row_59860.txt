Don't Wanna Get Help Due To Potential HospitalizationLong stories get short, that shit's not cheap, &amp; I don't wanna put my mom in anymore debt than she already is, because that'll just make me feel even worse. We don't have good insurance. &amp; plus, I don't wanna go to a hospital for a few days, or anything like that, either. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've all heard it, "Life gets better." Call me selfish, I don't care. I just wanna go bye-bye. Ever since I was little, I've always subtly prayed to just not wake up. I only have one friend, &amp; I always just end up feeling like a complete disappointment, even though they may say otherwise. I can only joke about all of my self-harm to try to cope, because I don't have the courage to actually tell people about it (all of my cuts are mostly on my thighs, nowadays, so nobody can really see them), but that doesn't work, either, because everyone just thinks I'm "mocking people who are actually in pain," or something. I love my friend like a motherfucker (sorry for my language), &amp; just the thought of even remotely upsetting them is starting to make me tear up, because they're (literally) the only as to why I'm actually still here. Anyways, I might just start to make them kinda get sick of me, so we can stop becoming friends, then I can finally do it. I'd rather do it while we're not friends, so they'd probably never even find out, instead of doing it while I still got one person actually gives a frig about me.
