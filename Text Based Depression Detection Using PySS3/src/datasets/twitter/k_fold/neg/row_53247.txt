I don't want to become "that guy."I don't want to be hell for my parents by going in and out of hospitals and attempting suicide repeatedly. I've been to two mental hospitals and obviously that hasn't gotten me too far seeing as I'm here. I feel like I have no one to talk to anymore, and let me explain why, detailing every person.

My parents: They'll take me to a hospital, cancel trips, keep me in their sight.

My friend A: I know her in person, but I feel like she's continuously becoming worse and worse of a person.

My friend K: She's an online friend, but she's so young, and she doesn't have too long to live due to a terminal illness. I don't want her worrying about me.

My friend Sh: She's an online friend, and she's currently unavailible due to computer issues. She won't respond to her phone right now, not sure why.

My friend Sa: I know her in person, we don't talk much. I don't want to use her as someone I only talk to when I need help.

My therapist: She'll want me to go to a hospital.

Now, let me explain my story. I attempted to kill myself not too long ago this year. I don't want to try it again, but I'm quickly running out of options. Life isn't getting any better. I'm only 18, just graduated high school. College is going to be a drag, getting a job is unlikely.

You might be wondering what I mean when I talk about "friend A." Well, the more I get to know most people, the more I dislike them. That level of dislike commonly gets to a level of hatred. I'm just sick of everyone.

I've tried meeting people in ways that are possible for me. I've tried every dating site under the sun. I'm just lonely as fuck and sick of it. I know this probably doesn't make a lot of sense but feel free to pick my brain and I'll try explaining things better. I'm just looking for some kind of help.
