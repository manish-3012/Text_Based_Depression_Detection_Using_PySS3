Birthday on Friday. Gonna kill myselfHey Reddit. First post here. I've been feeling depressed/suicidal for three whole years now. I'm fifteen, sixteen on Friday, and I'm honestly just done with feeling empty, useless, and hated by everyone. No one in school, bar a single best friend of mine, would give a rat's ass. They all detest me anyway. My family would shed tears, but not all of them. Planning to kill myself on my birthday. So at roughly 3am on the 5th of August (technically after my birthday), I'll either head down to the bridge over the highway with the can of cider, have a drink and then throw myself off of it (80ish feet into moving traffic) or I'll sneak up to the attic, grab my dad's shotgun and a shell, have that drink, head out to the shed and paint the walls. I've was told I had epilepsy three years ago, so that   took a lot of the fun out of life. Apparently my meds can make me tired and irritable, so I've been a dickhead to pretty much everyone in school, and in my family, for three years (probably why they hate me). Sorry to my best mate (I won't say his name) and to my family in advance. You guys can post below which way I should die.


EDIT: I've decided to speak to my doctor about how I feel. My medicine is going to be changed. Thanks for the kind words. Hopefully the change in medicine will sort out my depression
