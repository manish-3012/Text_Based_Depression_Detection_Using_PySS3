I can't go on anymore.I don't even know what to say. I'm just fucking exhausted. I have nothing to live for. I'm a failure on every level. I've been depressed since I can remember (I'm 28 now). I can't get over this girl I loved 4 years ago. She broke me. I developed a big drinking problem to deal with these feelings or my lack of feelings. I go through a case of beer a day or I go through withdrawals which are not very pleasant to say the least. I have zero friends. I'm so fucking alone. That's probably the worst thing about my existence. No friends, no family, no girlfriends (lol). Most guys my age are married with kids and I'm googling where to rent helium tanks. I already have a cpap mask. It's sure fire and painless. I think I'm gonna do it tomorrow. I really can't go on anymore.
