The time has come.I personally feel, that the time has finally come for me to take some of my Oxy's, and slit my wrist finally.  I am making plans to write out my "good byes" tonight and then get ready for this all to be over. I can't handle this anymore. it is all getting too much. I'm tired of being Tired all the time and not having anything to look forward to in this life.
