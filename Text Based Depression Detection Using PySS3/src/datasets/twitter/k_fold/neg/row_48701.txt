Said no to suicide.... now not sure how to say yes to life.First off, I have to say a thank you. Without /SuicideWatch, /Depression and the #reddit-depression IRC chat I don't think I'd be about to write this. 

Now in a way it feels really good to know I beat the urge, however now that fight is over, I'm feeling weighed down by so many other fights. By myself I'm starting to feel good. Once I'm surrounded by others wanting things of me or just wanting me to be normal however I'm falling apart. I lose the ability to make conversation. I lose all my energy and it doesn't take long before I want to self harm in some way (I've got it down to scratching, punching or drawing on me, but seriously that still makes me feel like I'm mad..)

So obviously as you can tell my coping mechanisms are pretty useless so again this fool is here asking for help. What steps can I take this shocked, cat caught in the headlights state to go away and start getting to be me once more?
