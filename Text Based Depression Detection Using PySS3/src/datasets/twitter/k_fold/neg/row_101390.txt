I haven't talked to someone outside my family for almost 2 yearsMy dad left when I was young and my mum has been forced to deal with the financial burden of two children. Until recently I went to a nice school, but then my grandfather died and my mother ran out of savings and I had to leave. I'm not allowed to talk with my friends and so I'm just at home. I've never been able to diagnose what I have but it was something close to an eating disorder which then developed into something close to depression. I couldn't afford to finish high school so now I'm 18 with no financial means or qualifications to move forward with my life. 

I feel as though I'm existing instead of living, but I have no reason to stay alive. I'm scared of committing suicide and then accidentally not dying, like surviving jumping in front of a train, which is the only reason I haven't done it yet. Everywhere I go, I see people saying "it gets better", or "God only gives you what you can handle", but it's just getting worse. 

Every day I slowly feel more empty. I don't feel real anymore, like I could just die and the world would move on. Sure my mum would be sad, but I'm sure she'd get over it. I've kept going all this time but it's not getting better, if anything, it's getting worse. I don't know what I'm living for anymore. I don't want to die, but sometimes I drop to a point where it's all I can think about. How do I live?
