A Few Words*â€œAnyone desperate enough for suicide...should be desperate enough to go to creative extremes to solve problems: elope at midnight, stow away on the boat to New Zealand and start over, do what they always wanted to do but were afraid to try.â€*  ~Richard Bach

I've never Been suicidal myself but I've always thought this quote to be true.  When a friend of mine was suicidal  i tried getting this idea through to him.  At the time it seemed like it was something he thought more of as he brought it up a few time later on.  I don't know how effective it's was, but he's been doing better now and i like to think our talking helped a bit.  So i thought I'd share

Side note: I've never been on r/suicidewatch so sorry if this quote iswell known here or considered cliche
