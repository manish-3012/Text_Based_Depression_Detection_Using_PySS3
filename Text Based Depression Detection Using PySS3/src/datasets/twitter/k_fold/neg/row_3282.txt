I'm bored off my balls and tiredLife is too fucking boring tbh, you only enjoy the first 10 or so years of your life, after that it's constant hell in school, then college, then working at a boring job from 9 to 5 not making enough to do what you want to do in life. Maybe If I was rich I could enjoy life the way I always wanted to. But right now it's just a constant rat race, and it probably always will be.
