How to tell someone you want to dieIâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday for the past 4 years and somehow Iâ€™m still here mostly because I canâ€™t do it to my boyfriend. I love him so much but I donâ€™t know how to tell him Iâ€™m an extremely suicidal person who breaks down at least once a week wishing I could take a miracle death pill. Weâ€™ve been dating for 2 years and he knows about my depression but I donâ€™t think he knows how bad it is. I feel like I canâ€™t tell him bc if I do die he will blame himself for knowing and I canâ€™t be a burden to another person. Can anyone relate here? I donâ€™t need convincing to stay alive bc Iâ€™m too afraid to end it rn. Just need advice on this.
