Iâ€™ve been thinking about it constantlyMost everyone hates me in my life and Iâ€™m nothing but a constant annoyance to most people, the more I think about suicide I think the better it would be for those around me. I donâ€™t understand what to do anymore Iâ€™ve just shut off every emotion at this point and showed only happiness because my depression would just annoy others and I donâ€™t want to get people involved in my mess, I donâ€™t know whether or not Iâ€™ll do it but as days pass I think more and more about killing myself. The nonstop repeat in my head of no one would miss you and just do it already.
