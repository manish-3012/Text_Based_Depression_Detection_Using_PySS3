And so it comes back to this feeling againIâ€™m so sick of feeling this way. Iâ€™m exhausting myself. Why canâ€™t I just do the deed already? Iâ€™ve been feeling it building and building in epic proportions and emotionally draining me. I cannot deal with this anymore.  Why canâ€™t I just die and get it over with? Iâ€™m sick of the suicidal thoughts and the voices in my head telling me that itâ€™s the only way. Iâ€™m scared because one day they will win. I shouldnâ€™t have to fight this hard just to survive. I canâ€™t exist anymore with these thoughts in my head. 

Do you know what itâ€™s like to completely lose faith in humanity? Do you know what itâ€™s like when all you feel about yourself is shame and ugliness only to have people just blatantly tell your wrong and canâ€™t provide an explanation? Iâ€™m so sick of being wrong in everyday things. 

I burnt dinner and my husband was totally ok with it, but Iâ€™m not. 

I overachieve at work and get noticed for it in a good way. Why canâ€™t I accept that? Why do i feel like everyone is lying to me ? I canâ€™t deal with the dishonesty I think exists that isnâ€™t real to begin with.  

This is the most confusing Iâ€™ve ever felt and canâ€™t make sense of anything. All I know is that I want to to die and end this insanity. 

I promised I wouldnâ€™t cut myself anymore or try to OD on pills again or use any other method to off myself. 

I feel it coming to a boil.... promises can be broken... maybe Iâ€™ll die in my sleep tonight.  Damn promises.i hate that I agreed to that promise. Worst decision ever, stupid survival instinct ruined my life.
