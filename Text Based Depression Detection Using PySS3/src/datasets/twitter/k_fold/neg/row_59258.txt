I tried my best but today was the last straw I posted here few days ago, I tried to keep fighting against my problems, but now I'm doomed and I'm making everyone I love pay for my actions.
 I want to thank everyone who took time to help me on Friday, I received so many heartwarming messages, but I can't go against the odds. Sorry.
