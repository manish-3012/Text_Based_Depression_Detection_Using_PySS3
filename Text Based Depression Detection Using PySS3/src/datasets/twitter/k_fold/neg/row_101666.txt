not worth your time but posted anywaylong shitty story short, on Jan 23 I tried to kill myself ended up in the physic ward for the worst 2 weeks of my life. I did everything possible to get released quickly i've been attending therapy weekly but, tonight I gotta be honest and say its not working. I still just want to die!!! Im trying giving what I can im trying actively trying but tonight... I don't drink but tonight is my first time alone since the 23 and im completely throwing everyone's trust in me away and getting smashed. I wanna say im not gonna cut until i pass out.. I wanna say ill find hope in something.. there's so much I want to be different but I just can't.. reddit im here im a person just like anyone reading this some of you may relate and if so im sorry I don't wish this type of pain and hopelessness on anyone but if you don't and what I say can't be grasped then I envy you. I find peace that some people out in this world have good things happen to them or even if they don't and they simply have the strength to keep moving to keep there heads up.. 25 years I had that but fuck something happened to me im just so weak and that makes me feel so much guilt.. I know im being selfish but Ahhhh! I just don't have anything in me anymore.
