8 more daysback in september i planned that i would kill myself on november 17, 8 days from now. then i was feeling so sad every day, i think it was a month straight of me crying at like the same time every night for hours, staying up until 7 on the morning, canceling plans, interacting with no one. but even with all that, it seemed so clear to me that i should end my life. like it was definitely the right decision. now, i'm not sad, i just kind of don't feel anything. nothing really makes me sad or happy and i can't even cry anymore.  and it's like this:

i feel like i've forgotten why i so desperately needed to kill myself, but for some reason, i feel like i'm still willing to do it. like, i don't know if it makes sense, but i'm not sad and i'm not at peace, but if i had a gun in my hand right now, i honestly think shooting myself in the heart wouldn't be a stretch. the idea of it doesn't make me feel anything. i don't know what i'll do in 8 days and i'm not asking for anything, i think i just needed to rant
