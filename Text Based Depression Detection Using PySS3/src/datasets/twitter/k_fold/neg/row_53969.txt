Advice please: son's gf of 10 months told me that she has been cutting and thinking about killing herself. They've lived together 6 monthsI've never had anyone say this to me.  She doesn't have any family that are worth anything. She's got a history of depression and anxiety.  She's 20. She's been with my 18 yr old son for 10 mths.  

Back in June she accidentally got pregnant.  She was open to the idea of keeping it but my son (senior this year)  just couldn't do it .  The primary reasons were,  too young,  money,  fairly new relationship,  and his dad is a cop and he's very scared of him.  My ex holds things over his head to intimidate him,  like taking his car,  watching every penny he spends,  ect..  So they had an abortion.  Now she thinks about it daily,  it was about 8 weeks ago.  She says that she wishes she could see her baby.  My ex husband found out about the baby anyway,  so she thinks she did it for nothing. 

She's got insurance but she told me seeing a counselor was about $80 a visit,  so she stopped bc $$$. She isn't on anything for depression.  

She's reaching out to me bc her mom has schizophrenia and her and I have grown close.  

Please help me.  I offered to take her to a hospital or stress center.  She declined.  My son stayed w me last night bc they were fighting.  She told me she asked him to stay here again tonight.  I'm so worried
