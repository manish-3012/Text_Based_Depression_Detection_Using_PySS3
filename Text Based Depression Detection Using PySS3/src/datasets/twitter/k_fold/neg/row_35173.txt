Porn addiction - want to die but cant kill myselfim at my limit its like im in a bad dream while im awake, 5/ 6 hours pass and i wake up from it..  

im barely making it to work ruining my relationship with fiance 

i cant seem to control it and have nowhere to turn i feel like the addiction is a symptom of depression but i cant be sure 

i went to a therapist but i freeze up and cant say anything 

so then i get guilty as if i dont want to actually get better
