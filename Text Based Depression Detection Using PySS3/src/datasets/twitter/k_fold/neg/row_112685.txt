I am not mad at the worldI have tried so hard to do the right thing or what others want of me but it isn't enough. I feel completely alone and nothing fixes this. I do not feel anything good from my friends or family, but this does not make me hate them or the world I am in. I failed. Everything that I tried to do, I failed at. I have nothing left for me. I am just sad how my 100% is not enough, and that is okay. I just want to die and then the pain will be over. I do not want to hurt others. They might have put me in this spot but that is okay. I will just be gone and then it is over for me. I hope they understand.
