My entire existence is just a flaw. There's nothing I want more than to die, and only then will i be happyThere isn't anything positive about me. All I do is spread misery to everyone around me, and that's all I know how to do. When I imagine death, I actually feel happy. If I end it all, then I would be doing the world a favor. I'm a waste of life, and this waste needs to be disposed of.
