I think I am going to kill myself this fridayI already bought my ticket for the new star wars movie and Im planning on killing myself after watching. I love star wars and Ive been delaying my suicide to watch the conclusion of the saga. If I don't kill myself this friday next deadline is my 21th birthday in february.  
  
I already had a lot of reasons to kill myself but recently my exam results for the 17th century prose and poetry class were announced and I got 11/100 meaning I need to get 76/100 at the finals to not fail at this class which is just impossible. I've already failed at 2 classes so my education life that I wasn't very hopeful from the begining just got a lot harder and also my parents are going to be pissed.  
  
This is just one of the reasons ofc, if you wanna hear I have 1000 more in the back of my mind.  
  
**I really dont wanna kill myself but the life that im living is really hard in a very specific way and I cant handle it by myself.**
