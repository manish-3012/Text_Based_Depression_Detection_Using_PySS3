Probably attempting tonightExistence is extremely painful and all through the years I've never found anything that made it more bearable.

Would 1800mg of bupropion kill me? Or would I need to mix in other drugs?

Thanks

Edit: gotta love all the Reddit white knights who get their kicks out of trying to talk down suicidal people. I just want to die, if you're not here to help with that don't bother, lmao.
