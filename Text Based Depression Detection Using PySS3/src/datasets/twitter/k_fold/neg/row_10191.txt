Someday Iâ€™ll disappear.Nobody needs to know. These moments when Iâ€™m all alone with myself. When I just sit and stare. And try to find a connection to this world. To this life. I try to remember how it felt when I felt joy or felt passionate about... anything. I try to remember how to laugh from the bottom of my soul. I try... but no matter how hard I try, the only thing that resonates in my mind is one simple and truthful fact: 

It doesnâ€™t matter anymore. 

In these moments I sit and stare and wish I would have the courage to just walk out of my apartment, find the next bridge and jump. I already thought about so many ways, pills, jumping, cutting my wrists. I just canâ€™t. Too afraid of everything. 

If a fairy would show up and offer me to just leave this world by stepping through a magic door and while doing so any memory, any trace of me would just be deleted, damn I wouldnâ€™t hesitate for a moment. No mess left behind. No open questions. No grief. Just sweet nothing. 
As if I never existed. 

Because after all, this is the simple truth: My existence doesnâ€™t matter. And this is probably one of the few things at the moment, that doesnâ€™t make me sad. Itâ€™s just awareness. So whatâ€™s the sense in clinging to a corrupt world which is turning worse each day. Watching the stultification of shallow brain-washed people with cold hearts and self-centered minds?

I already tried what most people do. Build my own little happy world. Have a husband. Have your happy little circle of people you get along well with. Gather your beloved ones around you. Dreaming of raising a family. I failed. 
And my world shattered. 
It happens they said. So I shook off the dust and started anew only to find out how incredibly tired I grew of this world. And Iâ€™m not doing well anymore in hiding it. At some point I know for sure my new partner, too, will leave. Because how to deal with someone who has lost the ability to feel? Who has lost the lust for life?

I still manage to keep up the facade at least a bit. Yes, Iâ€™m a bit depressive again. Yes, Iâ€™m in treatment. Yes, I take my meds. Yes, they already help. Of course, it will get better. 
Nod. Smile. 

I think Iâ€™ll know when the time is right. Iâ€™ll be prepared. On that day, Iâ€™ll take a journey. Destination unknown. â€œYou know, to empty my mind and have some lone-time, donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll be back, itâ€™s the best thing to do right nowâ€.  However, thereâ€™s not many people will ask about it, if at all.

And Iâ€™ll just leave.
No mess left behind. No traces. 
Iâ€™ll be my own fairy.
