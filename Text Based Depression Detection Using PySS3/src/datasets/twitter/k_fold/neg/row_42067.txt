Contemplating SuicideThis COVID-19 pandemic is taking a toll on me. I live in a third world country who'll surely suffer after this pandemic. The recovery rates are lower than the fatality rates, hospitals being overrun etc. Lately I've been thinking just to end my life to stop my suffering and my family's. I'm just another mouth waiting to be fed, and I dont want to feel like a burden. I tried looking for ways to commit suicide at home but I couldnt find any without getting discovered and giving me a chance to live.
