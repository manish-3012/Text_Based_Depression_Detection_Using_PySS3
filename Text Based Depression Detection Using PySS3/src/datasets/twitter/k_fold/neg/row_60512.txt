IdkI just donâ€™t see the point Iâ€™ve gone to counselling itâ€™s never helped Ik it sounds stupid but I donâ€™t think anyone understands me because I donâ€™t even understand myself so how can someone whoâ€™s not in my mind know whatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™ve got anxiety and depression but my paranoia can become so fuvking extreme it single handily tore my last relationship apart and I tried so hard to get help and fix it but nothing worked and my ex never tried to help she literally just told me to get over it and when she made new friends she left me and Iâ€™ve been falling back into my depression again and I just keep falling deeper and deeper and thereâ€™s nothing I can do and I wish I had the balls to kill myself and just be gone forever but death is also so fucking scary the thought keeps me up all night so often no other thought can just overpower it I just have to wait to fall asleep from being exhausted I just want it all to end no one will ever love me again Iâ€™m fucking worthless Iâ€™m ugly Iâ€™m disgusting and my mental problems just piss people off because they donâ€™t get better over night idk this is stupid FUCK
