What I felt...When I first heard about the shooting in Connecticut, I didn't feel any sort of sympathy for the pain of the parents who lost their children. I didn't feel hatred or disgust for the shooter. I didn't feel remorse for lives lost, nor did I feel confusion or disassociation with a world gone mad.

What I felt was jealousy. I thought, why should they get the out? Why not someone who wants it? Why couldn't someone have shot me then, before the next 20 years of misery came along? WHY WASN'T IT ME? WHY CAN'T SOMEONE JUST KILL ME FOR ONCE? WHY IS IT ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE?
