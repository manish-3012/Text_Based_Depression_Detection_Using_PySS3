I'm out.I can't do this any more. I reached out for help so many times, and I was denied, berated, and ignored. I tried. I'm trying. I want to be happy, and I can't remember what that feels like. There's really no hope for the future, shit just goes downhill from here. It's been going to shit faster than ever right now, and not looking up at all. I can't deal. I have nobody to go to and nobody cares. If I try to talk to people that I thought supported me they just avoid me for weeks at a time. I've been really impulsive and unpredictable lately and hate myself for it, I'm everything I never wanted to be. I'm weak and unable to live with this, fuck
