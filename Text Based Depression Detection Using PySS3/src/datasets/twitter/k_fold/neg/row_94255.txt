An endless circle.I live in an endless circle of ups and downs. Just like everyone else. However, I am a master of keeping my mind occupied. I've been living in Denmark my whole life, and to everyone who's naive enough to believe that Denmark is so perfect as the illustration shows - you're wrong. It's a heavily controlled system with a lot of underlying corruption. I have always been more or less depressed and everything I have ever started, I've failed.


I could blame my childhood, that's the popular thing to do; both parents alcoholics, I was thrown from one school psychologist to the other, got diagnosed as a child. My mom cheated on my dad when I was a kid, my dad was in Africa as a teacher and my mom's new fuckbuddy was a pillpopping psychopath. I was unable to ever concentrate in school and got thrown the hell out on boarding school. Got thrown out from that one due to drug abuse and suicidal behaviour, attended a new one for "kids with special needs" - only accelerated my drug abuse. 

I finished that shit and got thrown back and forth between my mom and stepdad and my drunk, powerhorny father who I chose to stick with in the end, and I ditched my mom. My dad eventually kicked me out of the house as a teen, while I was starting my first real education. He closed my phone, my cards and everything was gone. I failed the education by the way. However, my mom is sober for five years and I am so proud of her.

Ever since I've been working mediocre jobs without chance of ever advancing, though I believe that my intelligence is sufficient for it. 

Now, I live in Serbia. Yes. In Serbia. Can you believe it? I am trying to obtain permits to stay, and I've been here for two months. I sold everything and left everything behind. 

When that is said, if anyone is even still reading... I am clean, I don't do drugs. I don't drink. I am crazily into fitness, nutrition and bodybuilding and I work on it every single day, yet, I am empty inside. 

But, why are we here? Why is it that we feel disappointed in ourselves and our lives? What is it exactly that we expect? Our parents didn't create us to work or to become successful. They probably made us to experience life on our own and to make of it what we want. We should all stop adopting other people's dreams and lives. 

Just that I am once again, not sure, if I truly want anything out of this. My narcissistic personality disorder helps me look at it the positive way; when I some day kill myself, I will die with abs and a round awesome squat-ass.
