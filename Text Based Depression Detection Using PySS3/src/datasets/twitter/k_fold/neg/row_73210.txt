I am going to kill myselfI fucked up badly.  I was diagnosed with Clinical depression and Dysthemic depression and severe anxiety.

Ever since I turned in my disability accommodations letter to my work they have done everything they can to write me up and stress me out, trying to find reasons to fire me.

My hours were slashed from 28 to 16 a week.  I was removed from the butcher department, my offers to be promoted are no longer ever brought up.

My accommodations letter keeps being denied and HR keeps asking for the letter to be revised to add more information, the information they are asking for is already included in the letter, so idk if they even read it.

I called in sick 4 days in a row because I was having constant panic attacks and depressive episodes.

I'm in debt to my bank because I went negative from rent check last month, I'm still negative 300 dollars.

I can'd afford to pay rent, which was due on the third.  Nobody on cragslist will buy any of my shit so I'm just fucked, on the day I'm kicked out I'm going to finally just kill myself. 

Applying for SSDI is taking forever, my managers are actively triggering my illnesses, I haven't had FUN doing anything in so fucking long. What's the point in even staying alive if I'm just going to be depressed all the time?! All I do is think about suicide.

Being outside makes me dizzy, if I'm walking to or from work I get tunnel vision, I lose my balance easy, I start to hyperventilate. I get shaky and feel ill.

why is somebody like me even still fucking alive? I fucking NEED to die,it isn't an option any more. Every day I get sicker and sicker, nothing is getting better, these fucking pills aren't helping, I'm inbetween insurances right now, I'm fucking negative in my bank so I couldn't see a doctor even if I wanted to.

And I'm gonna be fucking homeless soon, Can't afford rent or to move my shit soI'm just losing it all, losing the deposit, my pets.

I literally have no reason to keep on living
