There are few who would careI truly believe that only my core family would genuenly care if i killed myself. Im sure people would be sad, but they would overcome it and go back to their daily lives pretty fast. I have had little to no meaning for any of my friends in their lives, and im certain they would handle me killing myself pretty easy.
