The biggest lie I was ever told was that people treat others the way they want to be treated.People will treat you like shit regardless. You can give your best to people and they will still treat you how they want to. I am done trying to be good to people who arenâ€™t good to me. The funny part is after itâ€™s all said and done, you will still feel like the bad guy even though you werenâ€™t in that situation. I just donâ€™t care enough to live in a world that doesnâ€™t care about me.
