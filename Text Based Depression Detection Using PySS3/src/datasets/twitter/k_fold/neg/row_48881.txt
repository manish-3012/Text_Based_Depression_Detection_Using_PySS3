I'm completely fuckedDepressed and anxious 24/7. Got nothing. My social skills are really bad and I feel too awkward and uncomfortable to get better. I hate socializing. I feel self conscious around everyone and my social anxiety won't go away. I don't know why I feel like this. But I can't smile at people. I can't have normal conversations with people. And now it's too late. There is no hope for my life anymore. I don't have any faith in myself and I just wish I was dead. I don't even know why I'm posting this. Life is a nightmare and it will never get better.life will never get better no matter what I do. I'm too stupid and I can't accept my life and I can't accept reality. I just want it all to be over but as much as I want to complain there's no one to talk to about it it's so obvious and just true that talk doesn't fucking matter. Only actions and what is real matters as I can't accept reality.
