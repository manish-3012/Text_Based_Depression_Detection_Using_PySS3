I'm on suicide watch for a 12yo boy please helpI've been taking care of him since he was 9 as a babysitter at least once a month. Today his parents left because they had to go to another city for a couple days and they couldn't take him. They got him to my place which I've done plenty times before.

Now I've seen his scars and I've heard him cry and I wanted to talk about it to him but I didn't know how.

Today he tried to hang myself in my house.

He tied himself to my bedroom's fan with a belt. He actually did it.

I came in and got him down quickly and he doesn't seem physically hurt.

I'm not calling the cops. He's told me not to and I don't wanna upset him. He's sleeping peacefully and I wanna give him at least some rest and all my undivided attention for some time. But I'm not sure how to handle this. 

I'm not usually someone who tells someone when to die and when not to. But he's a good kid. He's just a kid. Please.
