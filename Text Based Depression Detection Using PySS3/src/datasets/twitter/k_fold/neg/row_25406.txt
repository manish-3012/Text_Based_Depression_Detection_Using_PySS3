Today I couldnt stop thinking about how much I wanna dieThis year has been overall just terrible. My savings went to shit, the kitten i was taking care of died and i got pneumonia because of covid. 

I wish I died honestly. I feel so fucking bad. I'm annoyance to everyone. Everyone would just be better without me. I make terrible decisions and just... Idk. I dont think I can't do this anymore.

I just want to die. I dont have the strenght to keep up. I can't do it, I just can't. I'm tired.
