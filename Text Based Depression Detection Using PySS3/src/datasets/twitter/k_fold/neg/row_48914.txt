Iâ€™m tiredI have never really posted much on social media because Iâ€™m terrified to, but I really need to talk to someone rn. I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m so tired and empty all of the time. I feel like an empty shell and thereâ€™s no one to reach out to. Iâ€™ve tried to reach out to teacherâ€™s at school but they just end up telling my abusive parents who yell at me for it. Or Iâ€™ll go to a psych ward for a week and end up lying my way through it because I know the longer I stay the worse itâ€™s going to be at home. I donâ€™t have any close friends or family to talk to. I am in so much pain all the time. I just want someone to be there for me but I donâ€™t know anyone who would. Iâ€™m scared and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll make it past this year. Iâ€™m sorry this whole post is really dumb and Iâ€™m sorry for wasting peopleâ€™s time.
