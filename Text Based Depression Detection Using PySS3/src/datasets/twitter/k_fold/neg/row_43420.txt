I dont wanna live without him.My ex broke up with me through text a week ago and hasnt responded to me since the breakup text. He was keeping me alive. He was one of my best friends. He was my favorite person. I'm gonna end it all by next month. I'm sure hes moving on, and I wont be able to bear seeing him with another girl.
