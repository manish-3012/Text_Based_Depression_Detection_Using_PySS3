what to do? Person does not want to talk to hotline or here. (do not upvote or comment on this!)His job is on the line by talking about suicide and his boss finding out.

He called me, I don't know him other than our very short conversation, but I do have his phone number and city, state. He actually lives very close to me.

When we got off of the phone, he was talking about going to work tomorrow, so I do not think that he is thinking of doing this tonight. I am just not sure what to do. I could give his number to a hotline and they would call (I would think). But I will not give his number to the police, as then he would be fired for sure.

Please PM me with answers if possible. I have no idea what to do here
