Idk what to title thisThis isn't really a goodbye, I'm gonna do it sometime, once I know the people around me are okay. I don't need convincing out of it, I just wanna say look after each other. Message someone you know isn't doing great, make some new friends. Spread happiness, even if it's just so they don't have to feel like you.
Thank you reddit for being a cool enough place, I've enjoyed it.
