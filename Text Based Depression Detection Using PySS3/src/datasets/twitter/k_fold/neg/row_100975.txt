Life: it's pointless... or maybe it's just that I don't see it.I don't see the point in life. Or is it that others don't see how pointless it is? Suicide? In consideration. 
Why is life pointless? It just is. You live to die. You live to learn to work to die. You live just to serve the needs of society or whatever to die. Some people say you can get lots of good out of life. I don't see that. Friends, family, woo-hoo? No. In the end you die, you lose them all. It's the same, earlier or later. Maybe dying earlier is even better, since you will have a weaker bond and the separation won't be as painful. You get little good things out of life, but you do get a lot of bad things. Sadness, learn, and eventually work. That's life.. It's.. pointless. Why am I doing all this? Why am I even living? It's not like I'm being negative, it's the truth. Why don't others see it? After you read this, people that give support on reddit, do you see how pointless life is? Do you understand? Does someone understand?
Life is so pointless. And what do you do when something is pointless? Quit. Right? Death. But I'm missing the guts.. if I was braver.. and had more options... maybe I'm already gone? 
Life is so pointless... who understands?
