I've messed up and found myself down a simialir path. Please, any help is appreciated.Please don't scroll away. My SO and I had a bad fight. The type where you walk away from without resolving. The type where one party wants to talk it out but the other won't listen, just want to go to bed. I'm shit out from him, he blamed my drinking this night, with friends, to be why he won't talk to me. And the same cycle of thoughts from before are bugging me. I'd attempted suicide once before.  SO doesn't know. I haven't had the courage to tell him. But fights like this. Fights where I'm shut out and left. It comes back. The same thoughts. The same hurt. I'm sorry to bother anyone so late at night. But any help would be kind. I'm sorry.
