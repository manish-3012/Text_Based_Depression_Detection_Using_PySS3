what can i possibly do at this pointi am too lonely. it is because my life is of no worth; this is not a personal situation where the universe selects me and tells me 'fuck you'. i feel that people who eat by themselves on our campus cafeteria are just as worthless (most probably, yeah there are loners or people recharching here and there but those for whom loneliness has become chronic are losers to me). my despair and sadness is also excarbarated by the fact that i know i am one of them. i am on my way to becoming a lonely, pathetic, repulsive *engineer* who hates his life. i cannot change it; i tried too much.

i wanted to be a writer; but hey! i am dogshit, i do not have the capabilities nor the potential nor the brain temperament of a great artist. if i felt confidence in that, maybe life would be worth suffering through but this... just seems like not shooting a dog in great pain. i am not religious or anything; and believe that death will be just like sleeping when you do not dream. 

i cannot possibly see myself being liked by people; let alone having a girlfriend. i am a lost cause and do not really know if i should "just keep going bro."  right now, when i consider the fact that i might not wake up tomorrow; it does not really bum me out. 

i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely. i. am. lonely.



in fact i am so lonely that this post will not receive any feedback. and it will make my day if it does so (not putting this for people to pity me)
