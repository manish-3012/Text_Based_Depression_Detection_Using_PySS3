Sheâ€™s gone now.Itâ€™s fucking stupid. We werenâ€™t even together long. She doesnâ€™t care about me. Itâ€™s gone. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™ve never wanted to fucking die so much in my fucking life. Love is fucking pointless. Iâ€™m just going to fucking do it.  I canâ€™t take this fucking pain anymore.
