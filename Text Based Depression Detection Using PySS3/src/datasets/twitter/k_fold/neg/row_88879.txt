hell is my destinationI am the worst person that could have ever lived in this world. I hurt her and broke her emotionally and promised her broken promises. I screwed up and now the person that i loved is hurting so much because of me. She taught me true love and i repaid it with false love. Because of that I destroyed her and I can't fix it. Everyday it is very tempting for me to kill myself. Death is really appealing to someone like me who is a scumbag, an asshole, or whatever. I just want to wander somewhere where no one will find me and end it there. I have no will to live because of what I did.
