Itâ€™s been said to death, but suicide can affect people you donâ€™t even consider.A family friend of mine committed suicide this morning. She was my neighbor growing up. She worked as a stylist and always encouraged me to express myself. As a kid, she would invite me and my brother over to swim in her pool. When I was experimenting with my gender expression in high school, she cut my hair and dyed it fun colors for me and always made me feel great about myself. As a young adult when I was battling depression, she invited me out to her horse farm and gave me an excuse to spend time outside. I have nothing but fond memories of her. Nobody knew about her depression. This morning she took her own life. When my brother called to tell me, I was at work. I had to step away and cry in the bathroom because it just broke my heart. Now Iâ€™m sitting here in shock, writing this post to help me process my feelings.

If anyone reads this, please understand that more people care about you, love you, and appreciate you than you might realize. I doubt that she thought of me in her last moments, but I will never stop thinking about her and the impact she left on me.
