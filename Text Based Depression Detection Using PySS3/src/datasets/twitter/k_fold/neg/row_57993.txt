First attempt last nightSorry. After all the stress from work, and moving to a new place and no bed to sleep on yet, and me dumping my girlfriend because I was fed u with myself. I couldn't control my anger. Days on end taking massive amounts of mushrooms, LSD, DMTketamine, and whippits tryng to solve life through substance abuse. I was done. I called my girlfriend back to one down because I didn't know what to do. She came running. When she arrived I was tripping so hard on ketamine for 3 days straight with no sleep. After a while it gets very emotional. It was 4am. She was tired so went to sleep. She couldn't fix this feeling I had inside of me that I wanted to end myself. I even told her. So It came time. I ate 20 Xanax and layed in the bath and ran the water. I had a little bath pillow so I could fall asleep easier. I get in. So comfy and warm. I fall asleep crossing my fingers....

I wake up in my bed with my girlfriend crying next to me. Saying she woke up and couldn't find me and finally found me in the bath with water up to my nose passed the fuck out. If I was left any longer I would have died. She said she woke me up by screaming at me and I gasped water into my lungs. I was ok though. When she told me what happened I began crying and I decided to leave the new house. We hopped in the car and started driving to see my family that I moved away from years ago because I was trying to work and make money in the city. I am here now. I am ok. I regret what I did. I don't think I'll get that depressed again, at least I hope not.

Life is hard. I love you all. Keep truckin.
