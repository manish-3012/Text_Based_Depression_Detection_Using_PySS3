It doesn't seem like no one relates to me on here or in the real world.I have severe depression, ocd, social anxiety, misophonia and deal with suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I have acne and facial scarring that keeps me locked in my room pretty much 24/7. Since high school(21 now) I haven't done a thing except play video games and browse the web. 

Everyone I see on here and the people I know are successful in someway: have good jobs, college grads and have relationships. Me? I am just a loser who deals with pain and suffering daily. I guess I am just a bitter nobody who is destined to failure.

Please do not suggest drugs because I am already on a high dose of zoloft and I am still miserable. I also tried xanax, effexor, citalopram and those don't help either. I believe drugs help those people whose lives are somewhat normal to begin with.

I have already found a painless way to die and will do it very soon.
