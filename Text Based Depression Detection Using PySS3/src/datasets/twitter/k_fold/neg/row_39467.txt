I know what makes me tick, I can make the ticking stop.Im a senior in high school and I tried to buy rope over lunch break today. I was too heavy for the rope that came in packaging,  so I wouldve had to get an employee to cut larger rope for me but I was too scared of what they would say if they saw a sad kid trying to buy rope. Ive developed a nervous tick in my face over the last few months. I blink a lot and my hands shake. Its terrible to live with and my parents and doctor just blame it on lack of sleep. I dont sleep much due to the depression. Ive been depressed for 4 years and suicidal for 2. A tad over dramatic but i had a girlfriend for a while but we were both suicidal and she ended it to focus on herself and now I have art class with her (where we met last year) and i have to see her everyday and it makes the ticking even worse. It was just a high school relationship so im pretty over it but still get jealous seeing her talk to other guys. Im a bit obsessive i guess. Were also going into the same post secondary program so ill have to see her for even longer. My grades kind of suck but i know i can fix that if i felt like applying myself. Regardless, i just want everything to stop. No more ticking, no more excuses for the scratches i give to myself on my hands, no more faking smiles. I pretty much only like playing video games at this point (LoL fan if you couldnt tell) and as you can see im favoring suicide at this point. Thanks for reading my rather boring story :p guess its a little nice to let everything out.
