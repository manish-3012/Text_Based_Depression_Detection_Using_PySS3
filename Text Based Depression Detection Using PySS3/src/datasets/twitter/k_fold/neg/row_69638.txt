Afraid I'm going to kill myself if this continue.Im a student. Struggeling in life for the past decade. I have noone to talk to. My grades are going to hell. I've lost contact with all of my friends. I have nothing but debt. It's not "im not sure if I will be able to deal with this.". It's "i'm sure Im going to kill myself if this continue.".   


What can i do.
