Fiance cheated, plus recently siblings died, mother died, father died, lost my job. Thrown out by fiancÃ©, staying in hotel. Wanting to kill myselfI think the title says it all. I'm not that strong a person anyway. I'm not strong enough to cope with this. All the "you leave him and gain your self-respect" is great for 99% of people but the biggest enemy for me right now is loneliness and without him I have nothing, even if he cheated on me.

The only thing stopping me is fear of Hell or similar (residual curiosity about next dimension). 

Otherwise I would be throwing together a quick will and then going to buy some Fentanyl. I might still do that, I don't think a God will really begrudge me ending things when things are so horrible right now. No, I am not strong enough to get through this.

If I were beautiful I could perhaps instead pick up a quick rebound so I am less lonely but I have gained 40lbs and my skin is a mess.

I was depressed as it was before everything in the title.
