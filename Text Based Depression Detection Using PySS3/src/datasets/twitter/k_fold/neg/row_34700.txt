Tired.I just want to stop worrying about today and about tomorrow. I'm tired of thinking that I'm not good enough. I'm weak-willed and thin-skinned and I would never survive in the real world. I just want peace of mind instead of distracting myself with temporary pleasures.

Most of us gave up on happy endings long ago. But that's okay. I just want it to end quietly. And end soon.
