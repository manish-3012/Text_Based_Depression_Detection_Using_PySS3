I think I am too sensitive for this world, I can't take it anymore.I am an extremely empathetic and compassionate person. Normally these would be good traits, but it's ruining my life. I absolutely cannot tolerate thinking about other people suffering or being hurt. But it's all that occupies my mind. I think about things like how many people are starving today, how many animals are being hurt today, how many people died today, and just suffering in general.  I also concern myself with family members, for example my aunt's dog ran away and it destroyed me and I'd never even met the dog. I always feel this strange feeling in the pit of my stomach that I can't even describe. When I sense the suffering of another being, may it be a human, an animal, even the lowest forms of life that can feel pain, it's like I almost experience it myself. 

My boyfriend tries to tell me stuff like "with the compassion you have, you are a unique gift to the world" and "this world is broken and is waiting for the light that is you" and those things help temporarily but I still feel so much pain.

Ironically, I want to die which many of you will say increases suffering. It won't. I'm a burden to this world. I have severe narcolepsy and can't do a damn thing for myself, though I've gained slight independence because of my service dog. 

I just need help, I don't know how to live with these feelings.
