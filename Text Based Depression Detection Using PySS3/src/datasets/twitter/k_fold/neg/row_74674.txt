is just me or does it get worse when your alonemy mum works and doesn't home until like 7:30pm and my step dad doesn't get home until like 5pm so i'm home alone all day, no siblings and all my friends have rejected me so i have no one to talk to. im alone all the time and the thought of cutting and/or burning myself is on my mind all the time. why does everyone leave me? why am i always so alone? but if someone needs me im there for them, but their never there for me. is anyone ever gonna be able to help, or even try?
