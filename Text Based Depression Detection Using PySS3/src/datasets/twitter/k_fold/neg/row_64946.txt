Trying hard to hold onRight now the only thing keeping me going are my two cats. I come home and they are so glad to see me and immediately want to cuddle and what not. A few days ago I tried giving them away so that I could finally be free to leave. Nobody wanted them but it's getting harder to hold on. 

I struggle with addiction (porn and alcohol), feel like a failure in my graduate program (going on 4 years for a normally 2 year Masters), not excited about my career prospects, but most of all, am only loved by 2 people... my parents. 

Everyday I think about the love of my life that I lost, it's been over a year now but the pain of them leaving me is only getting worse as the days go on. I tried moving on, it didn't work at all, I would sleep with people and even dated one for a while but it just made me feel more empty. Now I get zero attention from the other sex anyway. I tried being a good friend to the love of my life for most of the past year but realized that I was putting all the effort and getting none in return. Now they are moving to a foreign city with someone they have seen in person only maybe 3 times (friend of a friend apparently).

Right now my cats are the only thing keeping me from (rhetorically) pulling the trigger.
