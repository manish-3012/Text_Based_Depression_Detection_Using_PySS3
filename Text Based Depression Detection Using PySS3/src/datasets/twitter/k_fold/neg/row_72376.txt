Tired of tryingI feel like I was never suppose to exist in the first place, like I never should of been born. I don't know why I was born. I have no purpose here, except it seems to suffer. I'm 34 and a drug addict. I've never held down a job for very long even before I was an addict. I can remember from a very young age wanting to die. All I can feel inside is complete and utter despair.

I've always felt like this, always. I can't take it anymore, I don't want to. I guess, I just don't see the point in trying anymore. I have never accomplished anything nor will I. So, again, I don't see the point in trying. 

I will never be normal and I don't understand why I can't be. I'm tired of fighting my addiction, my depression, my anxiety and my suicidal ideations. I think my mom is probably the only person that cares about me and I know that after a while her pain for my loss will lessen. I had a dog that loved me but I had to give him back to my ex because I can't even take care of myself and that hurt a lot.

I don't know, I feel like I can't fully articulate the pain inside of me and how truly tired I am of living but this will have to do. I plan on ending it tomorrow night. I'm not entirely sure why I'm putting this on here, I guess it's just nice to let someone know.
