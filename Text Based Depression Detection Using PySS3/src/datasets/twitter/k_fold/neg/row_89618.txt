give me a reasoni'm 28, never had a gf. i have no friends. my family doesn't care about me. i'm the scapegoat for everything. They probably are right. i hate myself so much.  i feel sexually attracted to all kind of things i should not. i'm not capable of finishing anything. i study since 2011 and far away from graduation. i don't even own a driver's license. i heavily feel uncomfortable being in a group of people. i fail at life in every way possible. i'm probably mentally ill but don't know it yet. i really have nothing.
