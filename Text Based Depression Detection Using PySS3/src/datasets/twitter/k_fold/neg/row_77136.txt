i dont have any reason to live but i dont have a sad lifei dont even bother making a throwaway
i literally dont have any reasons to live. I dont enjoy anything in life, not kidding, anything. I dont enjoy any if my old hobbies from before, video games, anime, tv shows, or even talking to people. Everything is painfully unfun. I am homeschooled and dont have any motivation to study and i am plain stupid. The only thing i want to achieve in life is to get money. I dont want a family or a partner or anything. I annoy most people and they only talk to me because of my gender. I go to therapist but i cant talk about my feelings at all. I am extremely close to suicide and sometimes panic because i dont have any way to do it. I dont get meds that would let me die without pain, but i am too scared to cut my hands till i bleed out. I dont know what to do or if its the right sub. Please dont say its gonna get better because it wont, its really not worth living and people wont miss me, though i am not sad because of that.
