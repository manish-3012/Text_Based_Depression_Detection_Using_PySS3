I'm still ashamed of what I did 1 year agoI've been through some old conversations on my phone

I saw people trying to reach out to me after I made a public suicide note and then posting pics.

I behaved completely irrational. I'm ashamed l don't even browse social media anymore.

I don't know if I ever will get through this. I just want to disappear.

I wish I never took an Ambien pill in my life. I became dependent on it, when I sleepwalked I took even more
It made me agressive, irrational and obsessive, coupled with antipsychotics and antidepressants
