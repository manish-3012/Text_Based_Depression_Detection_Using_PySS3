I'm suicidal but I'm not.Like, I wanna die but I couldn't kill myself. Tbh, if someone killed me, I wouldn't care.

I'm becoming paranoid that all my friends hate me. I've convinced myself I'm a terrible person. That I'm the worst person. I believe myself to be terrible. My mask has been lifting recently. Things I enjoy aren't fun and tbh, I don't really wanna live. I'm tired. 

The joys of life \o/
