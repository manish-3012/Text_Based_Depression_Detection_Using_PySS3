I don't know what to doI fucked around last semester and am now on academic probation. My parents can't stand me. I'm surrounded by people, go to parties every weekend, have friends and still feel so terribly alone. 

I can't find motivation anymore. For anything. I can't see the point. I feel hopeless and it scares me.
