Sitting In My ClosetI am alone. I just got home to my apartment and nobody has asked me about my day. About how I am. Nobody cares. I have a girlfriend and I think she hates me. All my friends use me for my money or for a place to stay when they have nowhere else; really, I don't have any friends any more. She was my best friend but she's tired of how often I fuck up. I can't get a car because of shitty credit and I don't have any more time to try and save for one. For a year and a few months I've had to rely on her and everyone else to take me places, everywhere but work, which I walk to. Only now, my knees won't work right without an intense amount of pain. I'll spare any more of my sob story. All I know is that nobody will miss me when I'm gone, not even my dog, who's terrified of me for some reason and loves my girlfriend more than me.

I'm making this post not really asking for help, because I'm beyond that point; I'm here more to thank everyone, all of Reddit, for being there. Always making me laugh, always a place to learn new shit and kill time. Thank you so much. To the trolls and mods and everyone with another story to tell or another fuck up to share. Thank you. &lt;3
