I donâ€™t know what is wrong with meI have so many great supporting people in my life. A roof over my head. A perfect girlfriend. Thereâ€™s nothing I could really need. And yet Iâ€™m so fucking miserable. Iâ€™ve been going to therapy for months and months Iâ€™m on medication but nothing helps. I canâ€™t keep a fucking job bc of this stupid fucking depression. Itâ€™s impossible to even do the things I enjoy. Or at least used to enjoy at one point in life. I have no goals or ambitions thereâ€™s nothing I want to live for. Thereâ€™s nothing that can make me want to get out of bed everyday and live life. And yet for some fucking reason I still do. Iâ€™m so tired of living just bc the people around me want me to. I want a reason to live for myself but I see none at all. I thought I was getting better but Iâ€™m no different than I was when this all started. Iâ€™m just the same worthless piece of shit Iâ€™ve always been. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m typing this or posting it. Ig I just want someone to read it. I donâ€™t even care if I get a response. I just wish I didnâ€™t have to go through a fucking war in my head everyday
