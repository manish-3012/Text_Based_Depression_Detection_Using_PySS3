Iâ€™m exhausted, my best friend of five years said she doesnâ€™t care if I feel suicidal. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m gonna hurt myself, I just wanted my best friend there. But sheâ€™s replaced me as Iâ€™m going through the hardest point of my life, Iâ€™m so depressed.Itâ€™s like sheâ€™s the one person in the world I really want to care. And she just keeps moving away from me. I have no family or anything Iâ€™m just me. And she can have any friends she wants. So Iâ€™m just the garbage that gets tossed to the curb. Iâ€™m so hurt. Not to mention itâ€™s just been a really hard month of not having enough food in the house and just all together struggling. Like Iâ€™d love an actual warm meal. Walking home three miles in the dark and cold everynight from work itâ€™s just so hard. I just canâ€™t seem to get ahead in life and Iâ€™m just so tired. It just feels like I canâ€™t do anything right. And now my best friend doesnâ€™t even want me. She wonâ€™t say it but sheâ€™s just slowly phasing me out. Itâ€™s like how many blows can I take. And now the lonely holidays begin
