Every waking moment is unbearable, still thinking of dyingEvery single moment I am awake is misery. It has become unbearable. I feel so sad and disappointed in my existence and I do not see a way out. I am never going to find a man who loves me and wants to stick with me, I'm ugly (can't fix ugly with weight loss), single mom, poor, no job. No reason to live. STILL can't find anyone on Tinder, how pathetic is that?? My life is a waste of space and resources. Wish I had the courage to die.
