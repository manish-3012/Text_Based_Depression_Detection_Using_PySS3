Shits too overwhelming, don't know if can handle itEvery thing is too overwhelming, I've been suffering from an unidentified psychotic illness for a few year and I've always manage to stay alive somehow. But the last few weeks have been too much, about 70% of the day I can't tell if I'm dreaming or not. It's getting outa hand, Don't know how much longer I can deal with this shit.
