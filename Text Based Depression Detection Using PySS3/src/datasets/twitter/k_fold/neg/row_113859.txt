I wrote a song describing my feelings. 

Song: Suicide Note

Dear God,

Kill me, kill me,

Kill me right here and now.

Iâ€™m waiting for a sign,

When are the stars gonna align?  
Iâ€™ve been living and crying and wanting to die,

Yet you seem to want me to live by your side.

I know that itâ€™s selfish, I know that itâ€™s wrong.

But canâ€™t you just-

**KILL ME, KILL ME.**

**Kill me right here and now.**

**Iâ€™m waiting for a sign,**

**When are the stars gonna align?**

I feel so pathetic, I feel so depressed.

With you by my side, itâ€™ll all go away.

The feelings, the tears, the waves of despair.

But thatâ€™s all a lie cause youâ€™re never there.

The desperate cries, the inhumane lies,

Everything weâ€™ve both said.

My mind and my body, theyâ€™re both in kahoots,

And they both know Iâ€™m better off dead.

So, Dear God..

**KILL ME, KILL ME,**

**KILL ME RIGHT HERE AND NOW.**

**Iâ€™M WAITING FOR A SIGN,** 

**WHEN ARE THE STARS GONNA ALIGN?**

**Iâ€™VE BEEN WANTING TO DO IT,**

**Iâ€™M STILL WAITING FOR A SIGN.**

**BUT PLEASE, DONâ€™T MAKE ME TAKE AWAY THIS LIFE OF..**

**Mineâ€¦**

Thereâ€™s nothing I can do, other than scream and shout.

But when itâ€™s all over, Iâ€™ll be happy, no doubt.

My family, please know, it was never your fault. 

Iâ€™m just too weak to stand it..
