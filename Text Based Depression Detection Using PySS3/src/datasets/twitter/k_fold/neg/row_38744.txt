My goodbye postThis post will just blend in with the rest of them so i donâ€™t expect anyone to see it. iâ€™m simply posting this so i can get a word out because i have no one left in the world that will listen. i have nothing in this world. i am alone and always will be alone. my life is meaningless. ill be pulling the trigger very soon, i just had to put something out to give me some closure.
