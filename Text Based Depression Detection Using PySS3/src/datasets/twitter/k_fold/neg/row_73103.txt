Iâ€™m thinking about killing myself again after ages of not being actively suicidalItâ€™s just been a hard few weeks and everything is turning into shit again. I canâ€™t get good sleep at night because I keep on waking up in the middle of the night with thoughts about how Iâ€™m such a failure and that everything would be okay if I just hung myself. Iâ€™m feeling actively suicidal again and IDK what to do
