I don't want to live anymore.Crime. Starving kids. People who kill and abuse others for the betterment of their own pocket. The fact that I could just be walking down the street and could be shot. The fact that the police are wasting money on a war against drugs whilst rape and murder go unpunished. The fact that I probably will never find a lover. The fact that I'll never have friends. The fact that I can barely afford food anymore.

The fact that I have nothing to live for.

The cons outweigh the pros. By a lot. Why shouldn't I kill myself? There's no reason for me not to.
