Having one of my "episodes" at the moment so i wrote this to more easily convey how im feeling  

â€žJohnny's hellâ€œ

The table is where he sat nightly,every night justâ€¦ more lonely than the last and always just thinking â€žwhen will it end?, if everâ€œ. The wind's slow and ambient blowing outside his apartment window, â€ž9th floorâ€œ he thought to himself â€ževent he wind barely comes up here so why would anyone else?â€œ, he stared out at the night for a bit â€žwhat is there to it even? What exactly is there to life that i'm not able to see that seemingly everyone else is?â€œ. â€žit's my fault for this i know that much, but i'm still not a monster though,am i?â€œ â€žDo i feel too little or too much?, i wish it was the first oneâ€œ he pondered.

â€žIs it too late for me?â€œ his thoughts intensified as they always did, â€žCould i have changed if i took action sooner? Can i still change now? Where would i even start?â€œ his thoughts got worse when he opened his phones camera and saw himself â€žUgly,too skinny,just **worthless**â€œ he got up and went to his nightstand,

â€žlexaproâ€œ he smiled â€ždoes nothing but i still buy into it's lie, it's lie of â€žhelpingâ€œ meâ€œâ€œ21 years of a waste of life aren't going to be solved with pillsâ€œ his expression changed, from a stoic nothingness to a deep sadness â€ž21 years, huh first time thinking about just how many that is, how much did my parents think i'd achieve i wonder, ah doesnt matter now does itâ€œ he threw the pills back into the nightstand, his expression getting more and more sad and disturbed. He walked over to his small apartment's window and looked down, â€žI wonderâ€œ he thought â€žwould it hurt at this height or would it just fade into darkness, would there be anything afterwards?, not with my luck, nothing nice at leastâ€œ. â€žStill, it would release me, release me from this hell im living in, no one would even care would they, sure they'd pretend for the sake of â€žmoralityâ€œ but i know, i know they would give a single fuck in the endâ€œ he opened the window fully â€ževen if they would they would forget, everyone forgets and i wouldn't be an exception, just another marter for people, another broken cog that couldn't be fixed and would be â€žresting in peaceâ€œ, well, at least i hope it would finally be peace but beggars can't be choosersâ€œ. â€žHow would the person or people that find me feel?, ah i can't care anymore ive done it too much already, maybe just this time, maybe il think of myselfâ€œ.

And so, the 9th floor lost one of it's residents.
