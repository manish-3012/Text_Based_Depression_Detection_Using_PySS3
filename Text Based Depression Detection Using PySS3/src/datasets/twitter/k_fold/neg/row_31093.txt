Rocket man.I did really bad on my final exam that I worked extremely hard for, and I think I have nothing worth living for. Iâ€™ve had to career change numerous times and now if this new path isnâ€™t working I feel like my time here is done. 

I have a brain condition that is incurable and it affects my everyday life. Iâ€™m not sure how to keep going. Death seems so attractive right now. I have another final tomorrow and I donâ€™t want to be around for it.
