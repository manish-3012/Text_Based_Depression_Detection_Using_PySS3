My body is breaking down.I'm mentally and physically exhausted. I'm tired of waking up every day in pain. I'm tired of being lonely. I'm tired of hating the people around me but being the goofy silly fun one to hide how I feel on the inside. I'm tired of calling in sick from work to sit on my couch and think about the best way to let go. I'm just tired.
