Please help..Recently I've been struggling with my college dissertation. My dissertation involving coding and it is just garbage ( Im an engineering bachelor) and i've reached a point where i dont even know where to start, the advisor is just fucking helpless, I even did invest a lot since he stated that he knew my topic (he nominated the topic). I followed his guidance, but he actually did nothing to help when i got stucj. So everyday I have to try my best, search for guidances on the internets, and it's extremely hard to understand these things. Only half-way until my final draft and just realized i actually didnt progress anything at all. My whole time amount invested just turned out to be a huge waste. Its extremely stressful just thinking about it..It's really hopeless.. 
And now it is accompanied with the so called "family issue", i had some family arguments and my mom said that she wished she had never given birth to me ( my parents divorced )...
I've been asking for help from some friends, acknowledging that they have their problems too, and they tried to act like they were giving a hand, but behind my back they actually didnt give a shit. They left me out in any discussion, and i just discovered it, it was not a surprise but it did disgust me a bit, since i hoped they really helped and i enjoyed the moment we discuss our dissertations together.
Now, I have mental breakdown, like more than five times on a daily basis or so, whenever i try to continue doing my dissertation.
I'm desperately contemplating suicide for quite a time, and it seems that i wont be able to progress further in my life, seriously, what should i do.. i really just cant stop thinking of it.. i feel hopeless, like everything is turning their back against me, i cannot confide this to anyone and currently choose to suffer in silence. I just have no idea what to do now.
Should i continue, or just go off with my life...
Pls.. help.
