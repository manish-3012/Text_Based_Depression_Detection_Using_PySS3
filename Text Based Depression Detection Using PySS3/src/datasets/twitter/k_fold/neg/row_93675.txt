Im curiousI don't want to kill my self because I'm sad or any of that bullshit, I just want to know what happens, I don't believe in religious beliefs but I want to know what happens, but what's also driving me is stress, I'm tired of everything and I don't care about anything anymore. I just want to find out and feel it
