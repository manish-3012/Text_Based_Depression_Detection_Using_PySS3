It's starting up again...I've attempted suicide twice. Each release from the hospital is followed with that hopeful, "This is it! I'll really be okay this time!"

But it's starting up again. The heavy depression. The dissociation. The anxiety. The impulse pounding in my head to go, climb to the rooftop. Go, buy a bottle of aspirin. Go, wrap a rope around my neck.

And it's just getting worse and worse and I feel like I have no control over it. I'm already mixing pills and alcohol to feel numb.

And I'm in a state where nobody knows me, far from home, far from loved ones. All alone in a hotel room, just waiting for that impulse to take over. 

Help.
