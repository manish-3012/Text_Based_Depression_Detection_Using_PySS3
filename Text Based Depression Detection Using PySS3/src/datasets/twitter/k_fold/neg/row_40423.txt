I'm just so lonely.I was at pep band tonight. Sitting with my section among other people (who I know and would consider friends). None of them talked to me, except one guy who asked me to move so someone else could sit where I was. 

It's really fucking painful. I'm at a new school, and even though it's already second semester, I don't know anybody. All my friends go to another school across town, and they're all so busy with their own shit that they don't talk to me either. I thought it was starting to connect with people but tonight showed me that I really don't matter to them.

It feels so stupid writing this out. I'm sorry
