I don't even know what to say.I don't even know what to say to anyone. What to tell anyone, I can't fall asleep. I hate dreaming. They remind me of the things I lost, the people I failed, and the ones I hate. 

I have this constant heartache that won't go away. I don't want to do anything. Not even lie in my bed and just being there. Staring at the ceiling. 

All is lost. There's nothing left. I wish I could say sorry to everyone. I just want to disappear from this life. I have failed them. I have failed myself. 
I don't think I will regret dying. I just want to go. 23 years. Yeah I guess it was okay. It was fun while it lasted I guess. 

To that one person in my life, I want to confess. Wish you were here with me. You did hurt me. I didn't let it show but yes you did. I know you didn't mean to. I don't see humans as creatures who can control their hearts. Make them do what they want to. I don't know why but I feel hurt to this day because of you.

I wish you were here to hold my hands. I want you to know its not because of you. Its because I failed. I failed. 
This world no longer makes sense to me. I guess it was never meant to be. What's the point of anything anymore. 

My friends are gone, my heart is void of warmth, I never really had a family. I want to call you right now. But no...that will just make you think I did it because of you. I don't want that burden on you. Its been 2 years, it hurts to admit but I miss you. Especially right now. No one but you. 

Hope you live a good life ahead. And yeah to that one friend of mine. You too. Thanks for the company.
