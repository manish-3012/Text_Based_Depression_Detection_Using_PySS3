I took 17 sleeping pills and fell asleep for a whole dayI wanted to sleep and never wake up but I did wake up, in that time the only person I called while i was awake was my girlfriend who I'm lucky as fuck to still have although I keep telling her I don't deserve shit. My mom grabbed my phone while I was asleep saw her texts and she called her and she found out what I did. Now members of my family are coming home crying asking if I'm okay and flying and driving from everywhere just as an inconvenience from their lives to see if I'm okay and it's making me feel worse and worse. I don't want them to do this for me, I don't want my mom to treat me to dinner and talk to me about life lessons cause I already regret doing it. I don't want my sister to take me to go see cherry blossoms during spring this Sunday.. my mom told everyone and I kinda hate myself for making her have to do that. Now I just feel guilty and worse. I just want to be alone and gather myself and appreciate how lucky I am and instead people are acting really overly concerned and it just makes me feel more worthless.

Now it's making me think that I can't really fuck it up the next time I do something like that because I'm only gonna make things worse. Or better yet I shouldn't really do it again but it was pretty sudden, I just snapped and decided that I wanted to die and it almost felt calming that I'm actually gonna not wake up if it worked..
