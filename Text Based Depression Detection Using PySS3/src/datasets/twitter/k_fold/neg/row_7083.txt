I don't want to live in a world populated by sociopathsEvery person who I have trusted throughout my life has just tried to hurt me in some way or use me for personal gain. For the past year I had been convinced that it's all in my head; that I'm the problem and that was the happiest fucking year of my life. I thought "Hey, if I change my attitude and just keep trying, it'll all work out." I had genuine hope for the first time in my life but then something happened today. Something super insignificant but it sent me over the edge. That's because it made me realize I have never actually seen any evidence that people can genuinely care about each other beyond what's on the surface or what they can gain from each other. I don't know what to believe anymore. I don't want to live in a world where people only see each other as objects.

Please, I just want to believe that there is more to society than this. How do I believe? How do I keep going?
