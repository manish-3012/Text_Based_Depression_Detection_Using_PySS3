Tonight probablyMade a post here last week, just for the sake of telling someone. I'll just link to it for context. It's not very read-worthy tho.

The deadline for my thesis is in 5 days, problem is that I've got witten down jack shit. Bigger problem is that this is the third time in six years that I fuck up my year while pretending and lying myself stuck. Don't want to go through the dust anymore or live to see my parents' reaction to it. If you think that this is pure egoism, you're right, I don't want to be an egoistic pos anymore neither..

They won't sympathize a bit if I'd tell them, especially not if I add that my alternative is suicide again. I'm aware that I will devastate everyone who cares about me - not that many people anyway -, but I won't *know* that when I'm not here anymore. 

I've got a window of opportunity tonight. After a concert, though I'm still doubting whether or not I should go, and do whatever I'm planning to do afterwards, or whether I'd just go on with it. 

Thanks, and bye probably.
