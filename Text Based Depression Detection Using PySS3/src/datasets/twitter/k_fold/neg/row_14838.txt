Too afraid to jumpIâ€™m In a seventh floor window, trying to find the courage to jump. I can end everything, no more 2021 bullshit, no more pain, no more depression. Iâ€™m scared of the fact that if I do this wrong I might end seriously impaired for the rest of my life but I know I canâ€™t make it through another day.
