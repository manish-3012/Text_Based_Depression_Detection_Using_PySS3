I'm so tiredFirst of all, English is not my native language, so sorry.

I'm female in my late twenties. I've never had a boyfriend, never kissed anyone and obviously never had sex. I'm ugly and lonely. Living with my parents, because I can't afford any rent. I feel really miserable and disgusting, I feel that every person would throw up with disgust after touching me or maybe even seeing me.

I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia, and it's really hard. I can't believe myself, I feel like I'm not alone even in my head. Everything is so unreal... And so on. I can't stand it. I tried different meds, but quit them.

I don't want to fight anymore. I'm so tired. World will be better without me. Everyone would be happy. But I'm too chicken to kill myself, so I guess I'll let my illness to kill me? Maybe one day I'll kill myself spontaneously. I don't know. I'm a little sad that I'll never be loved... I'll never live with someone I love. I'll never feel safe at home (my parents are really abusive). But I just can't do it anymore.

Thank you for reading &lt;3
