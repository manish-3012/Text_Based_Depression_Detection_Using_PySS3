I've spent the last fifteen minutes googling variations of 'How to die'My boyfriends asleep on webcam 2000 miles away and he has no idea. Well he knows I'm depressed and suicidal but he doesn't know what I'm doing. I'm tired of living. Everything about it hurts. He's my only reason for living and he's suicidal too, except he has more guts than I do. I'm scared for the day he kills himself and I''m alone. Nothing feels good anymore. All I can do is sleep and fantasize about death. I'm failing all of my classes...fuck, even the one thing that used to make me feel better (cutting) doesn't help. I want to wake my boyfriend up, tell him goodbye, then go drink some bleach and run away to a place no one'll find me. This will probably get lost in here but I don't care. I want to kill myself so bad.
