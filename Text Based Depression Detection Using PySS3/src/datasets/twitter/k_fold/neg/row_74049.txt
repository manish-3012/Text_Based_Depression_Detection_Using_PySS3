I donâ€™t want to do it. I have people I love I donâ€™t want to leave behind.I feel so disappointed in myself. I just let myself go and now my grades in school are suffering. It hurts to wake up again and again and again to endure ridicule and pain. They would have never suspected I feel suicidal, I just donâ€™t show any signs that makes people catch on. I donâ€™t have a choice.. if it means I wonâ€™t be letting anyone down then thatâ€™s alright with me. I know Iâ€™m gonna be missed but I donâ€™t care at this point. Iâ€™m just a shame to be alive. I let them down and myself too. Bye.
