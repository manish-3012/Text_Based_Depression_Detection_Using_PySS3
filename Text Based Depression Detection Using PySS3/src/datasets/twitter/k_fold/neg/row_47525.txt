I have no friends. Left my only one because he treated me like dogshit. I fucking hate being alone.And i can't fucking make friends. I don't want your advice on making friends, i dont want to be your friend, i dont care. Im done. Im too anxious, too socially awkward, too depressed, too fucked up to make friends. I clung onto the only one I had and he abused me. I fucking hate being alone! I'm so fucking frustrated with my life. This isn't my only problem i just don't feel like writing them out for the ten thousandth fucking time. Im done im so fucking done. I hate everything.
