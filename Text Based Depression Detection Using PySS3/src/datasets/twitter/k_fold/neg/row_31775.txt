You can do it, all of you can19f 
Ive been depressed for 2 years, cutting, drinking and suicide attempts multiple times
I finally accepted that im loved and i must continue even if its hard, i will make it because i wasnt born by my mom just to kill myself.
I have a couple of people close to me(my mom, my dog, my bestfriend) even my dad and my sister who watch me from heaven, i love them and i wont do anything stupid anymore
I had plans for this week to do it, my dog saved me, he s an angel... i thank him and my mom and my friend.
So guys, if i can, you can, you can make it through this dark times, and if you want to talk you can text me here, ill respond and we can share.
