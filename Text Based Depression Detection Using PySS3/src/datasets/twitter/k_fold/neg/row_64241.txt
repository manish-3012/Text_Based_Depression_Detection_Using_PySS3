The thoughts are back..After a pretty heavy argument with my now ex which resulted in her leaving me, the thoughts are back.. I've been fine for months and now they're back, I've been crying until I feel numb, my eyes are burning.. I'm cold, I can't do this.

please.

Help me.

Edit: thank you all so much for your advice, it means more to me than you will ever know.
