Fat and want to end it.out of a family of 10, I am the fat black sheep, Even if i lost all the weight, which i have been trying to do for the past 3 years, max weight loss was 50 pounds, after 6 months of 1200 calories. Its getting hard for me to sleep, and i feel like i am loosing my mind, random strangers mock me, and rude ass koreans at the korean market called me a fat pig in korean, I said fuck you in korean, and they shut up. so ha. but anyways. My teachers knew i was smarter than the rest, but i skipped school all the time due to bullies, Now i have just turned 20, and my younger and older brothers are doing much better than me in life and are thin, and normal. I am thinking of seeing the sunset in the mountains. It would be nice, i love nature. But i am fat I am fat. . I feel like all my Friends have left me, my parents have unrealistic expectations, wanting me to get a job, when i cant even go in public anymore, I dont laugh anymore. I think it is better if i wasn't here, and i am doubtful anyone would miss me.
