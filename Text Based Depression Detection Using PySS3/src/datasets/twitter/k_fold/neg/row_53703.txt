I feel guilty for being happyI donâ€™t feel anything and every emotion I have feels fake or forced. I have the most boring personality and Iâ€™m really unattractive so I put a front on. The thing is, I never take it off. I enjoy crying, though when I let myself cry Iâ€™m reminding myself of all the shitty things I am, so I feel even pathetic for feeling glad that Iâ€™m crying. My bestfriend, soulmate and my home who was my older sister passed away when I was 14 and ever since then Iâ€™ve felt lost. I realised nobody cares about me, Iâ€™ve failed all classes since I was 5 and dropped out so I have no hope for the future. I know nobody will love me enough to spend the rest of their life with me as Iâ€™ve never been anyoneâ€™s first choice so whatâ€™s the point  I donâ€™t know who I am, though I know I donâ€™t have to know because Iâ€™m just going to end up dying at my own hands one day. Iâ€™m always anxious, i canâ€™t even be with my long time friend without watching every thing I say and feeling as if Iâ€™m acting as someone in a movie which is so energy draining. Iâ€™d try to be myself, but I canâ€™t as I donâ€™t know who I am. One day Iâ€™ll go back to reality and finally do it. On top of that Iâ€™m incredibly ugly. I faced binge ed, anorexia and bulimia yet never got to my goal weights so Iâ€™m even a failure at my own mental illness. My mum thinks she cares for me but I know she doesnâ€™t. As sick as it sounds I know that if I were to die she would never feel as heartbroken as she did for my sister. Sheâ€™s disappointed in me as my younger siblings are too, and my grandparents who hate me. Theyâ€™ve never shown any love for me yet are more than okay with expressing their love for my cousins and siblings. My siblings love me but know Iâ€™m pathetic, they know I stay in my room all day feeling sorry for myself. I really just want out of life. Iâ€™m so insecure and canâ€™t connect with anyone ever. All I feel empathy for are people who are struggling and animals. I genuinely would be glad to see all wealthy people die so everyone who were born unlucky into life can flourish. Weâ€™ve built a society on this earth, I wish it could all vanish and everyone would live freely, that we didnâ€™t have faces or bodies and couldnâ€™t judge one another based off appearance as appearance can define weather you have a good life or a shitty one. And Iâ€™m so envious of those who were born lucky.

However, I know that will never happen. So basically I wish i could gather the courage to exit my fakeness and made up over exaggeration of myself, jump off a building or put a gun to my head. Nobody will care. I see the same 4 people everyday, they donâ€™t even give a shit about me. No friends. Iâ€™m excited for the day.
