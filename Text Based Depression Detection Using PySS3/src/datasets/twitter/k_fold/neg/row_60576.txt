All of my bridges are burnt and I'm out of luckAfter 22 years, after my parents' divorce, after working so hard, I was prepared to move my career forward and get married. That was 2 years ago, when my 4-year girlfriend left out of the blue. Since then I've had absolutely no success in moving on romantically, I've struggled massively to fit in in the new town that graduate work demanded I move to, and I have no way to turn back home to suggest anything is wrong since my every other sibling has been a huge fuck up and all the chips are basically on me. I loved what I had, I was the happiest man on Earth, and suddenly none of the friends I try to make care enough to work with me with my issues and nobody shows the slightest interest despite working millions of times harder than I ever had. I just feel like all of it in the last 2 years is proof that at that moment when she left, I simply broke as a human. I never had a problem with any of these things, and ever since then I struggle with every social thing on Earth. I know all of the same traits are in me, and they clearly don't show anymore no matter what I do. Professional career means nothing, I have absolutely nobody anymore, not since that day.
