Iâ€™d rather slit my wrist than live another day as meIâ€™ve been depressed before but nothing like this. I canâ€™t bare to live another second. Being alive makes me sick to my stomach, I just want to die. 

I was supposed to graduate with my AA this semester and and transfer to USF. But now Iâ€™m going to fail the class I need for my AA and I assume my acceptance to USF will be revoked after that. Iâ€™d rather kill myself than tell my dad I failed a class and canâ€™t go to USF. Iâ€™ve fucked up a lot in school and now this is big. My dad gets very mad and he will be so angry and my life will be over. My life has been such shit Iâ€™ve been so depressed and neglected my schooling this semester. 

All I want to do is die. Iâ€™m ok with it I think, itâ€™s just a matter of me doing it.
