Can't have knives at my place anymore. Sorry for the vent, this weekend was rough. (xpost from r/depression)My state of mind has been all over the place. I had a really scary night on Friday, I had an overwhelming urge to stick a knife in my chest. I'm no stranger to suicidal thoughts, but it's never been this strong or violent before.

&amp;nbsp;

It got to the point where I wanted to get rid of all my kitchen knives, but was too scared to go anywhere near them. It was terrifying, I had to get out of there. I spent the night at my boyfriend's place. He knew something was up (I was a wreck, and he was out with friends when I texted him) but I told him I just wasn't feeling well and didn't want to be alone.

&amp;nbsp;

I spent most of the weekend either with him or blazed out of my mind watching movies and playing video games and checking my phone at the same time to keep myself distracted, which honestly worked pretty well. I didn't think about suicide unless I was by myself and slowed down or got too sober.

&amp;nbsp;

Leading up to this I was really dreading going to a party I was invited to Friday night, and also possibly going out of town to visit my sisters Saturday. Saying "dread" doesn't really do it justice, there was a point where I felt like would literally rather die than go. The last thing I wanted was to be seen, and I knew they would want to go out to a club and get all glammed up and take lots of pictures.

&amp;nbsp;

I have zero clothes for that sort of thing, my wardrobe is pretty much the same as when I was on a barista budget, I look and feel super awkward in pictures like that, and I've been losing more and more hair (from stress I guess? had bloodwork done and there weren't abnormalities). I'm down to less than half of what I used to have, clumps come out every time I shower or touch my hair.

&amp;nbsp;

My sisters both look incredible, their selfie game is on point, they're both in super good shape, and have a great sense of style, confidence, etc... I just didn't want to be the awkward bummed girl bringing everyone down. If by some miracle I had made it there, playing along would have felt like torture and would have taken absolutely everything I had.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the most disturbing parts of this was feeling *good* less than 24 hours after all this. I mean, I was working hard to distract myself from those thoughts and was high as a kite, but it still doesn't make any damn sense. Sobbing and panicking because I felt like I *needed* to stab myself, then laughing and joking with my boyfriend the next day made me feel even more insane.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm at work this morning and I feel safe, I don't have the urge anymore. I just feel like a psycho for being able to be all bubbly with my coworkers after the weekend I had. It feels automatic, I sit up straight and this big smile takes over my face as soon as anyone comes over to my cube, and then the moment they leave I instantly go back to slouchy neutral/exhausted zombie mode.

&amp;nbsp;

It feels gross and inauthentic, but it's the norm for me here and I'd rather feel this way than have to think of a blatant lie to tell people that explains why I'm not my normal cheerful self. I honestly don't know if I could control it enough to switch it "off" anyways.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry for the wall of text. Just had to get this out. I am getting help, I have a great psychologist and I'm trying *another* fucking kind of medication with a new psychiatrist. Just got a new diagnosis of being Cycolthymic (like bipoler lite?) instead of just Chronic Depression and General Anxiety Disorder. Fun fun.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** Going from wanting to stab yourself in the chest to feeling okay is exhausting. If you feel or have felt anything like this, my hat's off to you. This is the f*cking worst, and you're a badass for still being alive.
