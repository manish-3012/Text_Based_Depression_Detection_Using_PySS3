Depression is literally deteriorating my brainI can't think straight. I can't make decisions anymore, even if it's something simple like what to have for dinner. My short term and long term memory is getting worse. Why be alive anymore? I don't want to be here anymore. It's not worth it. I just want the encouragement to end my life.
