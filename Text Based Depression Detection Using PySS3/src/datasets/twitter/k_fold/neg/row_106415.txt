I have a child with a woman I don't love and I'm stuck in relationship prison. Ending my life is the only fair way outIn a relationship with a woman who has a vastly different linguistic and cultural background to me. Neither of us is remotely fluent in each others language but the relationship somehow worked for the first two or three years.

But I slowly came to realize I wasn't in love anymore. I was staying in the relationship out of a combination of fear of being alone and lack of courage to finish it. 

We continued having sex once or twice each week even while I didn't feel happy. Our contraceptive method failed and now we have a child together.

I am 29 but I never thought I'd be a Dad. I love my daughter and she is nine months old. I find the loss of individual identity as a parent very challenging but there are positives to being a Dad.

Any positives though are outweighed by the fact I am stuck in relationship prison. It would be unfair and a dereliction of duty as a dad to end it with my partner now. It would also mean possibly losing access to my child and having her grow in from a different country to me. So I need to stay with my partner.

But staying in this relationship is making me miserable. We barely talk to each other except when playing with our baby. I think daily of how unhappy I am.

I envy every single person who is in a happy, passionate relationship in which they have fulfilling conversations with their partners.

Deep down I want to be single while also playing a big part in raising my child. But this is not possible. I am caught between a rock and a hard place.

I wake up every day knowing it'll be a struggle not to end it and I see taking my life as the only reasonable way out. If I am not meant to ever be happy, then I'd rather not live. As much as I love my baby it is impossible to feel happiness in an unhappy relationship. My child would be better off in the long run without the negativity of an unhappy parent.
