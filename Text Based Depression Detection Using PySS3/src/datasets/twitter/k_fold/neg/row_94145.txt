I don't deserve to be left alone or forgaveI fucked up, a lot, multiple times. I'm an addict, I feel like a fucking beast. I hate what I'm doing, I hate myself, I hate how much I hurt the ones I love, I hate it. And my brain doesn't want to stop doing this shit. I think the answer might just be to die and put an end to it. I'll stop hurting others, I'll stop doing shit all the time, everythine would be better. I hate myself I wanna fucking die, why is everything so hard, why am I such a piece of shit
