Just found out my 13yo brother tried to kill himselfI just got home for winter break and knew my brother had been depressed. The day after I got back my mom told me my brother tried to hang himself. I am in shock and need help. 4 months ago he was the happiest person I know, he had nothing to stress about (of course he did in his mind) and school was a breeze for him. Then all the sudden he started hating it and would not get happy about anything. He is the most important thing to me and I just don't know what to think, he is so little. If anyone has advice or experience with this please help
