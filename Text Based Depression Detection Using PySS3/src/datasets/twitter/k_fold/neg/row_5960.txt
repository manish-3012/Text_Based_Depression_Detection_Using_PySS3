I'm not sure how I made it this far.I was first depressed back in 2013 when I was a sophomore in high school. When my brother killed himself in 2016, I was in disbelief. Why couldn't it just be me instead?

I think I'm wasting my time living right now and this world is getting fucked over really fast. Everything seems to be pointing toward suicide right now.

I have no motivation to move out of my parents' house and do something. I have no motivation at all. So I might as well make everyone's life easier by eliminating a problem.

I don't feel depressed right now, I'm just starting to think it's in the best interest. Like I've never had sex and I probably never will. I'm wasting everyone's fucking time right now. I just wish suicide wasn't so difficult to reach because of regulations.
