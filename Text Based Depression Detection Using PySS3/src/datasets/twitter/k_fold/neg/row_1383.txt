It's all hopelessI came to Reddit hoping to find others that felt like me so we could share our stories and vent to each other. But what's the point in it at all. I'll just leave this app again since my attempts at friendship failed with me getting ghosted. I don't know why it has to be so hard. I hate it. I wish I could just give up completely. I wish I wasn't afraid to die.
