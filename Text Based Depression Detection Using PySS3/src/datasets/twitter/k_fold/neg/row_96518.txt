answers anyoneI keep thinking about my family and what their faces would look like and it stops me. Only I can't stand this bottomless, unrelenting pain any longer. I wish I could rationalize this off as a state of mind or a temporary emotion, but its not true. I have tried over and over to climb out of this, but my life is absolutely empty in every aspect. At 27 I've never had a relationship, no lasting friendships, no job prospects, binge eating disorder, ptsd and of course clinical depression. Some of this was bad luck, but of course the blame rests on me-I've been depressed for at least 10 years and my grades, career, relationships have suffered for it. I'm exhausted, and death would be... grace. But then I think of my brother and mom finding me. HOW CAN I GET OUT OF THIS!?
