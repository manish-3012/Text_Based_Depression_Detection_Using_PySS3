iâ€™m strugglingiâ€™m having such a hard time wanting to be here, ive been self harming again and it fucking sucks.. the one person i think who cares and loves me never comforts me ever and i just constantly feel like im messing up. i donâ€™t know if i want to die but i just donâ€™t want to be me anymore. i hate everything about myself and i wish i could be someone else. i just feel so stupid and worthless and iâ€™m so sorry to everyone.
