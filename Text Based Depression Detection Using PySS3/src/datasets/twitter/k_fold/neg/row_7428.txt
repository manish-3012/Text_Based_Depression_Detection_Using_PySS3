im really freaking out.Today was the worst day ever for mental health. I dont know why but this morning through this evening ive just had this horrible feeling in my stomach like i was constantly anxious my family noticed i would zone out and they would ask me if i was ok, i told them that today just "felt off" but i didnt tell them about the once again suicidal thoughts that were started to creep into my mind. About 15 minutes ago it reached its peak where i was basically hyperventilating while making my own makeshift noose and even went as far as to "test it" by putting enough of my body weight down on it where i felt dizzy like when you stand up too fast. I took it off and am now where i am now, sitting on a chair in my room writing this up. Im scared, these thoughts feel like theyre driing me crazy.

I dont know if i really have my depression or that its my anxiety making me think i have depression. Ill probably delete this post later, im not really thinking on ending it anytime soon, i just felt that i really needed to let all these feelings out to a bunch of people on the internet. Ill  send my mom a text about this, because i trust her the most out of all my family members, my dads always been icky about the topic of depression and anxiety. Im sorry if this upsets anyone, i just had to write it all down somewhere.
