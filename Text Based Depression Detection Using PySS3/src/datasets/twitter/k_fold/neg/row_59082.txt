What's the point if no one wants you here?I'm a waste of space, my family reminds me all day, every day. I am mentally/verbally abused, sometimes physically. I am failing school and have depression.

My mom locks up all the pills because my older sister tried oding three times, I guess a noose will do, it's more lethal too if they don't find you in time.
