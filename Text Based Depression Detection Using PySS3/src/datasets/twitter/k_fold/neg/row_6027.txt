My Life is UnnecessaryHey. These past few years, I've been trying to get out of my depression/anxiety. I've had two suicide attempts, one hospitalization, and one brief stint in an out-patient program in that time.

Nothing is helping me. I have only a handful of friends left. I feel like I don't deserve to be happy and that living out my life is just as bad as suicide.

I'm just gonna keep going to work everyday and try not to share my unhappiness with people.

Thank you for reading. I hope your day is a great one.
