Hit rock bottom. Again.Life has been ok of late. I've started college again after nearly a decade out and I've applied to uni for next year. But I've been jobless for nearly 2 months and my overdraft is well over its limit. 

I called the bank to put a stopper on the charges which they did but I keep getting letters and texts telling me I'm over my overdraft and if I don't pay it by x time there will be more charges.

Every day I get rejection messages from employers with really unhelpful feedback such as "you've had too many jobs, get a job that you stick at for a few years". How can I do that if I get turned down immediately?

Or "I was really impressed by your application but you're going to uni next year so we don't want you" great.

My girlfriend is currently paying for everything but it's taking its toll on both her and our relationship. I feel like going back to school was a huge mistake and I should have just grinded out the next 50 years in a shitty job. 

I have a long history of depression but haven't had suicidal thoughts in months. Meds don't help. Therapy doesn't help. And apparently making positive changes doesn't help. 

This is a tough time and maybe I'll get through it, but all I can think about right now is the easy way out. That way I'll never end up on this position again. I need help, but I feel like I'm out of options.
