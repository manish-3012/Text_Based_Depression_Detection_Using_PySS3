All the fucking chatlines are full or region lockedIt's either "there's no one to help you" or "we only help Americans lol sorry" 

No way I'm talking on the phone, nor am I texting, I don't like the idea of strangers having my phone number

My friend just gets pissed off when I'm depressed around her or ignores me, my parents are no different

I only see my therapist once a month and I haven't seen her at all this month

Fuck it
