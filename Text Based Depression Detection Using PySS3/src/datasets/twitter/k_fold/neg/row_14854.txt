Knowing how bad place the world is makes it difficult for me to enjoy life.This is kinda a weird thing, thats giving me anxiety, I litreally feel guilty to enjoy my life and live without a worry cause im not doing badly, but I know many people who are doing badly and I know how bad place the world is and how millions are suffering from day to day. 
The world is a fucked up place and there is nothing I can do about it, its built in the human nature, there will always be evil. But the problem is I feel guilty that Id have a really good life compared to most people, but im wasting it and cant enjoy it
. How can I ignore the world and live like a happy camper not giving a damn of whats going on? I just cant enjoy my life knowing how filthy its out there.
