My grandma died and I feel like I'm not allowed to feel suicidal.My grandma was taken off of life support and died the same day my niece was born. All of the attention is on them atm and that's understandable...but no one has even asked me if I'm okay yet or listened to anything I have to say and it honestly hurts. I was literally preparing to kill myself last week and then this happened and I dont want my mom to go through that but I cant just not feel it. Idk what to do.
