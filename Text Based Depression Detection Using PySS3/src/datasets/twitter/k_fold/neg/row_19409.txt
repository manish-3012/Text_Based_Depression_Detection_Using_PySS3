Why have I been feeling like this?I have a family and friends that love me, a roof over my head and no financial problems, and yet I feel like I just don't belong. I shouldn't be here and I need to escape.

I have thought about just standing on the edge, looking down to where I will fall, and why not? What is the point of living. If I jumped right there and then, I wouldn't feel anything, I wouldn't think anything.

I'm not sure why I'm feeling like this, I'm not sure what I want in life or what the point in life itself is.
