Drained.Iâ€™m not living the life I wanted to live, because now I realise itâ€™s all idealistic shit thatâ€™s never going to happen. Every day is the same. I do nothing. I feel like Iâ€™m slowly rotting away. I have friends, I love them so much. But they donâ€™t feel the same way. Iâ€™m just the npc in their lives. A side character. Iâ€™ll never be part of the main cast. They all have people who matter to them and itâ€™s a wonder I even have friends. Nothing I say or do will ever be right- because itâ€™s only in my dreams- which are slowly ageing and decomposing into the depths of my sick mind.
