This will be the fourth time I've tried to commit suicide. This will be the fourth time I've tried to commit suicide and hopefully my final. I am a College Rugby Player, Natural body builder, and well I'm a Mormon. I was abused my whole childhood and last year I was diagnosed with severe depression. The closest thing I have ever had to a positive father figure is dying of cancer.  A few months ago (online) I met the love of my life. She's a Mormon rugby player body builder from Chicago who has also had problems with suicidal depression. I've always been there for her and completely honest with how I feel about her. However, whenever I have a low day she ignores me. She says that she just doesn't understand how I  can feel this way about her and that she doesn't feel the same way. I just wish you could understand what this girl means to me. She's more than a dumb crush. She represents hope.  I'm constantly alone and I'm afraid that I have lost all hope. So I'm going to drive to see her and ask her to be my girl. If she says no, I'll drive home put a bullet in my brain.  I figured what do I have to lose? She could say yes? I guess it's a more exciting way to go than trying to hang myself again. I'm aware that I am a horrible person. I am sorry.
