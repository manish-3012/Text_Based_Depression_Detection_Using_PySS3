I want to die. If I had a gun in my hand I would kill myself without hesitation I've been with an abusive, controlling boyfriend for the past 4 years, and even ran away from home to be with him. My family is just as bad, if not worse. I have no one to turn to. He broke up with me on Valentine's day, which actually made me happy, but yesterday I went to my only friend's house (a guy that we are both friends with), and today I was yelled at and given 2 weeks to leave because of it. I have no money, no where to go. My family called me a dead weight hanging around everyone's necks and they're right. I won't be able to survive by myself so why wait? I've never been this certain before that I want to take my life. I don't have a future. I'm a failure of a person and I only drag the people around me down as well. The saddest part is I don't think anyone will care when I go. Hell, if I waited until I get kicked out in 2 weeks, no one would probably find or care to look for my body. I don't mind if nobody here cares. But I've lost my way and I can't find it anymore, and I think it's best if I take myself out so I don't cause any more misery to the people I love.
