Genuine questions I would like an opinion on from multiple people.I'm debating on killing myself soon, as I don't have another choice. 
- Should I break up with someone before I kill myself?
- Is it bad to write a suicide note to no one specific when you've got a boyfriend of almost 3 years? 
- Do I write each person I'm in contact with a note? 
- How do I know I'm close enough to someone to include them in a note?
