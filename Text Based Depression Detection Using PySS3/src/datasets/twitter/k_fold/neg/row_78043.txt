I've convinced myself to do itI've always had the steady drumbeat pulsating in the back of my mind in a sort of abstract way. The constant drone of "you're a piece of shit, kill yourself, you're a piece of shit, kill yourself, you're a piece of shit, kill yourself". It rarely felt like much of a real concrete desire. Then a couple days ago I sat down and made a list of requirements for how I need to go out. My partner can't be the one who finds me, I can't leave the blame on other people, and it needs to be quick. I wrote that list, took a walk, and by the time I got home I had a plan. I didn't even fully realize I had planned it out until tonight. My friend commented on how I seem much better and happier and asked what had changed. I did some self-reflection and realized I knew exactly what had changed.

Anyway I think I'm going out tonight. Thanks for helping through these last couple years, r/SW.
