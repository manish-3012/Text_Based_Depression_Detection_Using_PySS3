-RANT-I wish I was normal. God, I want it so bad. I can see other people, I can hear them, but it's like I'm looking through one-way glass.  I feel like I'm screaming but no one hears, or no-one cares. And I'm not sure which one I prefer. It's such a lonely feeling knowing that I'm the only one in a room that wants to die. I know that no one in this building has gotten rushed to the ER because adults thought I was going to end myself. Sometimes I can almost forget that I was taken into a police vehicle. Sometimes I almost forget having to lie on mental health test. I almost forget the disappointed looks from my family. They always tell you "*We won't judge you".* Guess what? They are lying. You can't tell me you don't think less of me now. My friends/family don't understand. I've already told one and their reaction was basically "oh that sucks." They went back to talking about themselves after. So much for the "we'll always support you" attitude. I just feel so tired when people tell me they'll support me. Then treat me like an animal for feeling this way/telling them about it. It sounds bad but, I want to be the one telling people *I'll support you hon.* And then never actually do it.

Note: Hey! It's my first time posting  :')
