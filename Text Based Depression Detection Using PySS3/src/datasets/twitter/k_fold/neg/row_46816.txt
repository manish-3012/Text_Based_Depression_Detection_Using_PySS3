I was meant to be unlovable forever, and that's something I cannot live with.I just want to love and be loved. I just want to know what it feels like when you're the only thing she gives attention to. I want to know what it feels like when your happiness makes her happy. I want to know what it feels like to be kissed deeply by someone who's truly kind and calming. Someone who truly sympathises with my fucked up nature. I've always been repulsively ugly and obese, and my mind is just as disgustingly fucked up as my body. No girl has, does, or ever will like me. No girl can. And its ok, I dont blame them... I was never meant to be loved. I was meant to be alone. But it fucking hurts ok? I cant help but scream and put my pistol to my head whenever I think about cuddling with a girl, feeling her body against me, hearing her low whispers. It hurts. It pains so much. And no one even gets it. "You're just being whiny about being single." "Women are useless anyway." "Get over it." Even my therapist has given up on me and it hurts it fukcing hurts so fucking much
