There's 3 ways this ends1) I continue going to school everyday, with the rate of how much my hatred for life expands this is pretty much certain to lead to...
2) Suicide, I can't be happy and life is incredibly painful and tiring.
3) I run away from home, and now I've swapped the pressure of school for the worse pressure of being homeless, even more certain to lead to suicide again.

My life is just a waiting game till I hate life enough to end it.
