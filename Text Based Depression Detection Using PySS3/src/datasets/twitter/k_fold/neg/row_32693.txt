Doesn't feel like there's anything tying me to this world anymoreI like to watch the river flow. I can now be certain there's no one who cares about me. There is no goal in life. It's all just different ways to waste time. A person has no chance to use time in a meaningful way, since there's nothing meaningful to be done. The universe is fleeting. There is no reason to waste your time. Ending your time is the best way to avoid wasting time that you didn't ask for and don't know what to do with.
