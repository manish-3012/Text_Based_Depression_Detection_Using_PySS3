There isn't any point to my lifeAfter I went to college in August, I realized how tremendously pathetic I am compared to other people. I sort of broke down my first semester,  I only passed 2/5 of my classes and now if I don't do much better this semester I'll be kicked out.

And I fucking wish that was the end of my problems.

I don't have any friends. I haven't been on any dates. My roommate fucking left between semesters to go live with his actual friend, and even though he still lives in my building I haven't seen him since. I'm ugly as sin, with a disgusting amount of acne no matter what combinations of products I put on it, thin-ass hair that is probably one year from just falling off my head, skinny ass arms but I'm gaining weight in my thighs and gut because I can't bring myself to fucking exercise once in a while.

None of my childhood friends go to my college because I have no childhood friends, growing up I moved every 1-3 years so I got used to not making long-term friendships. The only people that care about my existence at all are my parents and my sister, and I'm lying to them every damn day. They think I got Bs and Cs last semester instead of Ds and Fs because I can't bear to disappoint them so badly. they think I have friends, I've invented fictitious people in my phone calls to them so they don't think I'm so fucking lonely. Thank god they live in a different country so I don't have to worry about them showing up.

My grandpa, who in other circumstances might care about me, is dying from brain cancer. He can barely remember who I am, and can't remember my name most of the time I talk to him. coincidentally, my grandma died of the same brain cancer and I don't have to be a doctor to realize that means that if I somehow keep living one day I'll have to watch my mom go through the same terrible bullshit of mentally and physically shutting down slowly over a period of 6 months. And If I somehow make it to my older years I'll probably have the same thing happen to me.

If I'm destined to forget my life what is the point of living it. If I can't actually share my life with someone or make a difference in other people's lives what is the point of living. Why should I drag out this miserable bullshit, what is the point of not just chugging some pills and bleach right fucking now
