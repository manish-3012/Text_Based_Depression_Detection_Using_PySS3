Last leg before hospitalization, donâ€™t know what to do anymore, feel like Iâ€™m two peopleIâ€™m 21F, been fighting depression and anxiety since I was 14 and anorexic. Iâ€™m not anorexic now, but Iâ€™m deeply suicidal. Iâ€™ve been doing therapy, individual and group for three years now, medication for a year and a half, and I got an ESA. Iâ€™ve done every self-help thing in the book short of checking myself into a hospital. Iâ€™m building a great career and will hopefully graduate college in a year and then I already have some job opportunities lined up. I used to be almost always depressed and suicidal, but after lots of work Iâ€™m generally a positive person and I like who I am. 

Despite all this, I have depressive episodes where I become extremely suicidal. Theyâ€™re happening more and more regularly, and at this point it just feels like Iâ€™m fighting a losing battle. If I can do all of this hard work and still fall apart with any bit of external or internal resistance, then maybe Iâ€™m not strong enough to be here. I just canâ€™t imagine Iâ€™ll be able to do well in school once classes start in a week while Iâ€™m also fighting myself just to stay alive. 

Last week my housing that I was supposed to move into tried to cancel my contract because of my ESA. That triggered an extreme episode where I couldnâ€™t breathe and researched methods. Yesterday I moved in (landlord learned its super illegal to terminate based on those grounds) and one of the girls I share the place with has approached me and asked some specific guidelines that she wants my ESA and me to follow, and used almost the exact language that the landlord used on the phone when trying to cancel my contract, making me think that my landlord essentially talked shit about me to the other tenants. 

This ESA is the main thing keeping me on the winning side of my battle with suicide ideation, as I know I canâ€™t leave her behind and she gives me purpose, and now I might need to rehome her or risk losing my housing, which also would make me lose my schooling because my school has weird housing policies. 

Drove to my grandmas house three hours away so I can be around people and less likely to kill myself. Parents are threatening hospitalization and Iâ€™m almost wondering if theyâ€™re right. But that feels like if Iâ€™m locking myself away from the world I might as well just kill myself anyways.

I just feel like everything is trying to tell me to kill myself and that if I can work so hard and still have debilitating suicidal episodes, then whatâ€™s the point of fighting. How long do I have to fight against myself until I reach a point where I can finally relax? If thereâ€™s no end to this ideation then why am I even fighting.
