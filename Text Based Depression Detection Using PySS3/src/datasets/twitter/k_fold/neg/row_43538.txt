Why are you depressed?I know a lot of us canâ€™t answer the question of why we are depressed when people ask us. Putting these painful and deep feelings and thoughts into words is almost impossible at times.. but I ask the question just to see if it will get some of us brainstorming.. and picking apart our thoughts to see what we believe the root cause is..

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m depressed because of my anger issues. Or if my anger issues have caused depression.

I am 34 years old and for as long as I can remember, I have struggled with controlling my temper. This quality has led to many failed romantic relationships.. which has left me feeling alone and ashamed. The feeling of shame and depression from those losses led to isolation and disinterest in my normal hobbies.. which has led to comfort and the feeling of safety only when Iâ€™m at home.. which has led to loneliness because I live alone.

Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m just living in this vicious cycle. It has officially been 3 weeks since I have seen one person I know outside of my coworkers on one occasion. The other 20 days I saw not one friend or family member. I wake up.. walk to my home office, work for 10 hours, and watch 5 hours of TV (that I can barely remember Bc my mind is so distracted with racing thoughts). While doing this Iâ€™m drinking glass(Es) of wine just so I can sleep enough to wake up and repeat the same cycle again.

Iâ€™ve been coasting through life for the majority of the past ..5,6,7 years and Iâ€™m just so truly.. empty.
