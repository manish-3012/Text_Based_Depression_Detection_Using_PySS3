I think I'm a terrible personI'm a terrible person because I think bad thoughts and I'm a bad person because of them. Maybe I even consider doing bad things. I didn't though. But still I don't think I'm deserving of love. My family doesn't deserve me. So maybe I should just go die and cease existing.
