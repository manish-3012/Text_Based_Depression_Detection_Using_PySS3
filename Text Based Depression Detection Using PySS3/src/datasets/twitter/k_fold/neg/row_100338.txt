Do I tell my girlfriendI am going to kill myself tomorrow night (today is my mothers birthday and I want to be considerate and wait a day) and I currently have a girldfriend who knows how sad and miserable I feel.  Should I:

1) have the decency to tell her and breakup with her then kill my self 

2) just kill myself and let her figure it out 

I'm very stressed out by this because I really don't want to make her miserable as well but my choice has been made. What do I do? 

Additional details: she basically lives with me at this point and I haven't told anyone else because I really don't want people to interrupt my plan.
