I just fucking hate my life.*Everybody fucking hates me.*

My family mocks me for trying to desperately cling onto the friends I met online.

They take me as a fucking joke.

I want to kill myself. Or to be killed by somebody else.

I hide my computer in fear my posts on r/SuicideWatch will be found, but I want to keep posting because this is the only place I can...Vent.

Everything sucks. High school, sucks. My face, sucks. My fucking art, sucks. My life, SUCKS!

I just want to be happy. But, there may be a better solution. I can make others happy. I notice everything goes well when I am not around. Maybe, I should keep it that way. The hell do I have to lose? Friends? Don't have any. Pets? They fucking avoid me and try to bite my fingers off, despite my love and care. Family? They hate me, mock me, and want to throw me to the fucking curb.

Why the hell was I even born.

And, if God was "real", many others like me wouldn't feel this way. *I* ***don't fucking want to feel this way.***

# And why me? Why am I so ugly? Why am I bullied? Why do I care more about others than myself? Why? Why is the world so cruel? It's falling apart. I caused it. I want to die...Just...To die.
