I've honestly felt like I didn't want to be alive since my memory first came online as a kid.I'm hitting my 20th year, no matter what happy things I fill my life with,  significant others, money, sunlight, exercise, all the shit that supposed to make humans feel good, sex, food, at the end of every fucking day, I just want out. I grew up hating myself, years of therapy, being a pill zombie when I was little, I could ignore it. I could cloud it. During high school I went to more therapy, more pills, none of it worked. I would quit because they would make things worse, but I'm still broken. Defective. Trash. I hate it. I hate me. I don't know what to do and I'm currently trying to hang myself but I keep pussing out right when I stop breathing and I'm so sick of this I just don't know who to turn to or what to do I'm just sick of being... Defective.
