What is wrong with me? I deserve this?Hi, I thnk there's something very wrong with me, I was in a relationship with the love of my life, for some reaason I go insecure and would threaten to break up with her at times, I know now this was a mechanism I used sub conciously to 'test' if she still loves me..
However one time she didn't beg for me back, and now i'm all alone and i don't know what to do...we were still talking but I made it worse by accusing her of being cold and evil etc
Now I can't sleep, and every day I feel ill, i don't know what i've done and I feel like I need to punish myself for causing this...but at the same time im so angry at her that she can just cut me off like this, she doesn't ever want to talk to me again...
I've struggled with hating myself my entire life, now I got my first real job coming up in ten days and I don't know if I can do it without her...I feel so fucking awful i just want to die, i don't even know how long I acn keep going without sleep and gagging and retching constantly, please someone convince me a reason not to eat like 100 ritalin...

There was problems with the relationship...but i'm so pathetic, I feel like I need her, I feel like no one eslse will want me again, I can't hop into bed without breaking down and dreaming of her...please someone talk to me, truth is I don't even want to die, but there's moments my brain betrays me and I find myself looking for bleach in the bathroom at 5am, anyway im not even sure what im doing here i just want somewhere to write...it's so hard being told someone loves you, to being told they want nothing to do with you in 1 week, i don't think i can deal with this...
