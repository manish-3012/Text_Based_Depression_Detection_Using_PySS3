Every time there's even a slight bit of conflict in my life, my brain goes to itLately I've been so damned hypersensitive to everything that the moment something goes wrong, I just shut down. I know it's all bullshit inside my head, but that doesn't help the churning in the stomach, the tightening of the throat and all that very much. While I won't go into detail as to what method I used earlier, I found myself tiptoeing just on the edge of losing consciousness, and it felt... nice. I couldn't do it then since it was the middle of the day, and if I really wanted to go through with it, someone would've found me. I just worry about how frequently my mind keeps going to it, and now the fact that I'm "playing around" with it. I certainly can't afford care, and in my town there's nothing (trust me, I checked). No car either. I worry for the day when it's no hope either.
