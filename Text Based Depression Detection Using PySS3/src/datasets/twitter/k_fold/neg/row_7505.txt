I'd really like to gain to courage to do thisMy life is an endless loop of failure. I'm really tired of giving my Truman show audience the satisfaction of watching my suffer, build hope, then suffer some more. I KNOW I can't have what I want out of life. I KNOW things aren't going to change and I just want to be pushed over the edge so I can GTFO of here.
