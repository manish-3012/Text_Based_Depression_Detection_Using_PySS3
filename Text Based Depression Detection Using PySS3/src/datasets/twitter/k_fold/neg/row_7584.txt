A fun science lessonHuman synapses grow and develop according to the activities we engage in throughout our lives. So if you grew up playing basketball, your brain is going to be far better at doing it than other people since it had all that time to adapt to the activity. 

This process stops however at 18-21. By that point, your brain will have already adapted to whatever you have done the past two decades of your meaningless existence. If you try to adopt a new task late in life, it will be significantly harder to do than when you were 5 years old because of this. Ever wonder why Jedi weren't trained beyond infancy or why the best people of any field practiced their field at a very young age? Now you know. 

So if you're like me, you will have played video games and watched Television the past 19 years. Meaning everytime you try to convince yourself to do anything, you have to face the fact anything you do outside being pathetic will be, at best, mediocre or average compared to others who do the same task. Because unlike you, they were adapting their brains to tasks you didn't know existed for 2 decades or more while you pointed your existence toward a screen. 

So you're destined to be mediocre at best forever. Yay. If you enjoyed this science lesson, please leave a like at the end of this post so I'll at least have something to be proud of the moment I jump off my god damn roof and paint the asphalt with my brains. Thanks for listening.
