Is not having the drive to live the same as being suicidal?I've never really had any dreams of being or doing anything. As I've gotten older it's made waking up and doing anything that much harder. Lately I've been neglecting to shower for days at a time, I only seem to eat every other day, and when I do it tends to be small portions. I've considered suicide for a long time, but I've never quite been able to go along with it. I don't know what I'm really looking for here but I thought I should at least get some unbiased opinions or something.

Thanks for the words people, you helped in ways you can't even know.
