I'm scared to feel happySometimes I wake up, lay in bed and just think I want to die then spend the next couple of hours thinking about how to do so. Sometimes I wake up and feel a little hope. And sometimes I wake up and I canâ€™t help but think of last nights nightmare. My dreams are so uncomfortable and horribly vivid. Theyâ€™re so vivid that I think about my dreams through out the whole day because theyâ€™re so uncomfortably real that I feel like it happenedâ€¦ Anyways throughout the whole day Iâ€™m just an emotional roller coaster Iâ€™m fine, Iâ€™m sad, Iâ€™m crazy, Iâ€™m hopeful (this is rare), Iâ€™m sane, Iâ€™m insane, Iâ€™m nothing, and I feel nothing. The times I feel happy or hope I get scared. Iâ€™m scared of getting too happy then falling back down into my deep depression. Itâ€™s false hope that Iâ€™m setting up for myself. I recently left college after my first semester because I couldnâ€™t cope with my depression. Everyone tells me that I need to get mentally better before I make decisions, but I canâ€™t help but think about my future and what Iâ€™m going to do next. My mind is constantly running and thinking. Even when I have nothing to think about I realize that a song is playing in my head. I inevitably think about going back to college and even research some new colleges to attend, but then I just get so scared all of a sudden and I feel pathetic and bad for myself. I then flashback to the person I was earlier this year. I was excited for college, my depression was controllable, and I was on the right track, everything was fine! I just want to be that person again. How did I end up like this? How did I change myself without my consent, without my knowledge? I had my life in control and now I have no control. I was certain about my future and now I have no certainty at all. So this is why Iâ€™m scared to feel happy. Iâ€™m scared to get better because I know that my depression will come back. I donâ€™t want to stay on this roller coaster. I want to get off. I NEED to get off. For my sanity. I beg God to push me off of this roller coaster. Iâ€™ve been fighting so hard to control my depression and Iâ€™ve had my successes and failures. But I donâ€™t want to keep fighting. I donâ€™t want to try anymore. I feel like I cant. Iâ€™m currently on three anti-depressants and I can feel them working. I can feel parts of me dying because of the medication Iâ€™m on. I donâ€™t want them to work, I donâ€™t want to get better because I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I canâ€™t cry anymore, I canâ€™t feel my emotions flow out of me through my tears. I loved crying, I loved releasing my sadness and I canâ€™t anymore. I feel INSANE. I feel like somethings wrong in my body. Why canâ€™t I cry? I feel sad all the time, but I donâ€™t know why. I feel stuck in this world. I feel stuck in my mind and body. I want to break out and be free. Arenâ€™t people supposed to love life? Arenâ€™t people supposed to want to live? I donâ€™t want to live another day. I just want everything to end so I can finally be free.
