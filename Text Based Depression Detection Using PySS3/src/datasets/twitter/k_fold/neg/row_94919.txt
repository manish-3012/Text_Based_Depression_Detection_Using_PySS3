This will only mean something if you want to help YOURSELF.I know I will never commit suicide. And not because I'm too afraid but because I know I'm stronger than that. But sometimes I do fantasize about it. A few seconds of pain for an eternity of peace. Sounds like a fair trade. Just ending it would be so easy. I don't have to think about anything anymore, worry about anything, stress myself out over nothing. The endless nights of crying would be over. Not existing. It sounds so peaceful. My mind could be at rest. I understand now, why so many people do it. Its heartbreaking. I hope they are at peace now. But if you're reading this I can tell you its not worth it. Go on, tell me all the reasons why I don't have the right to tell people what to do with THEIR life. Tell me how I'm about to contradict myself whatever. Doesn't matter. I DO understand how it feels. Do not take your life. Everything seems like its pointing towards that I know. Oh I know. If you won't continue to lead your life for anyone or anything else at least  continue to live for the simple fact that I'm telling you to. Who am I to tell you what to do. Nobody I agree, but I too am in your position. And I will say it again. I will NOT take my own life. Say the same for yourself. I post this knowing that many of you who will read this are at the very lowest and most hopeless point of your life and I accept that my words don't mean a percent of anything. But these words will only mean something if you want to help yourself.
