idk -- 25 m / missouri / lostqim not sure if this is the right place to post. i am not sure id ever be selfish enough to kill myself... but i keep thinking about it lately. i have nothing happy in my life... nothing.

i have a few great friends that are there for me, but for some reason i dont value it enough. i respect them, i love them for the fact that i know how much they do for me... but it doesnt seem to matter.

-my parents are in the middle of an awful divorce
-my younger brother and i dont speak.
-i cant drive.
-i am currently living at my fathers place while him and my mother go through the divorce... no friends close and he ususally ignores me or treats me like a pawn.
-i do not have a job, i was fired a month ago for reasons not really of my control.
-the girl i like doesnt care about me, granted... we never really had a relationship. i was too emotionally invested without any reason.

i get it. i know i am putting myself out there, i know there are people worse off than i am... i know i should feel lucky to be so educated, and skilled... to be healthy... but i feel so empty, so disconnected from the world. some days i wake up and bike as hard as i can, as far as i can because i have nothing else... i come home and there is NOTHING.

ive always felt suicide is so fucking selfish, i just dont know how to right this ship.
