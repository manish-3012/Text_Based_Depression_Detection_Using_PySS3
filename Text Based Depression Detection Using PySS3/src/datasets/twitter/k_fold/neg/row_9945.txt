It's so hard.It's so hard, knowing tomorrow is going to be my last birthday ever.

It's so hard, talking with my mom about when I'm celebrating it. 

It's so hard, making plans for a future you don't want.

It's so hard, lacking the intent to go on.

It's so hard, continuing.

It's so hard, living.

It's so hard.

Just. So hard.
