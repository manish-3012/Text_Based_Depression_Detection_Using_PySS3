I think i'm going to off myself after the new year toast.At around 0:30 my parents will go to visit my sister who lives 40 minutes away.

The only method I have is hanging. There's a very high possibility that I will chicken out like it happened before. 

The desire to die is as high on this day than the rest of the year but the strength to actually go through the process is low.

I wish I didn't care about my parents finding me with the feet on the air. I really don't want them to affect them for the rest of their lives. They are good people.

To quote Queen, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all...

EDIT: I couldn't fucking do it. I got drunk until I fell asleep. 

People that say suicidal people are cowards don't know how much it takes to actually follow through. 

I made a post about it on r/depression, in case you carehttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7nf6m2/i_have_finally_come_to_the_realization_that_ill/
