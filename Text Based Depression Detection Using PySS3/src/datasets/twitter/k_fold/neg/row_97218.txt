I think there's definitely something wrong with meIdk if I'm posting in the right place but I feel like there's just been something wrong with me for awhile now. Sometimes I just don't care so much that I think if I died tomorrow I wouldn't care cuz I have no aspirations. I'm not suicidal but I just don't know what's wrong with me. Also my logical side prevents me from getting help so idk what to do anymore. I don't really want to talk to anyone I know about this or go to the doctors cuz my logical side will just manipulate the DSM5 answers to suit however I feel that day. And I'm pretty sure I put on a really good facade that no one really notices or would believe me if I said I had a problem.  Coming here was a big step only cuz I wanted opinions outside of my brain. But like I said if I died tomorrow, went into a coma etc I would not be sad or regretful cuz I have no aspirations or things to look forward to. I just don't care...
