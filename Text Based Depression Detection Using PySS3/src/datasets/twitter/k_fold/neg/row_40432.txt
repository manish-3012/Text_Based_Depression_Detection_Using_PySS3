I can't handle it anymoreI just can't.  I fucked up, I'm a leech on my parents and I'm going to be a leech on society the rest of my fucking life.  I keep trying to force myself to grow and I fail.  Every fucking time.  I don't have a way to do it right now, but holy shit do I wish I could just end it all right now.  It's better than going through life hating every fucking inch of myself.
