Run away from an abusive household, now I will become homeless in two days. No family, no friends. So tired of everything.Life has just been so incredibly unfair to me. I tried so hard to be happy and to find peace and love. You can't even imagine all the shit that I had to go through to not lose my mind after being raised by a narcissist mother. I run away from home one week ago because she didn't let me sleep  in days. This last Monday I got scammed by a shitty hostel for half of my money and Booking doesn't give me an answer. Now I have like $20usd left and no place to go, so I will become homeless in two days. I'm also living in a third world country, and with my luck I will probably get stabbed and robbed the first fucking night. I didn't ask for a ticket to this hell of life. I'm really tired of everything going wrong year after year.
