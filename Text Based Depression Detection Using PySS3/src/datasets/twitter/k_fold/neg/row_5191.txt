I hate myself so muchI hate myself. I hate my life. I hate feeling like this. I hate that I can't control myself. I hate that I have people who care, killing would be so much easier if they didn't. I hate that I have so much hate. I fucking hate this so much. I hate that I'm so scared of pain I can't even do self harm to feel better. I feel empty yet so angry and sad at the same time.
