I don't know what to do, I feel numb all the time(Throw away account) Lately, I have felt numb and sensitive to everything. I try so hard to be an extroverted, positive person to my peers just to feel something, but when I head to the restroom after much socializing, I feel nauseous and on the verge of breaking down. Truthfully, I tried masturbating and listened to music to make myself feel better, but it doesn't work. My favorite, happy songs literally gives me a headache. My brain feels numb but my chest hurts badly. I feel like I can't take it anymore. I feel like I deserve to die. I feel like I don't deserve to live in this life anymore.  I feel like no one would really care if I died. I cry too much every night and day. I lay off my school assignments because of headaches. I never really eat at all, and if I do, I feel immediately nauseous and on the verge of puking. 

I don't know what to do. I keep pushing away from my friends because of my tiredness and sad energy. I feel so sad and bedridden all the time. I even quit my job because of my mental health. I self harm by punching my body and the wall. Since I am under 21 (in CA), I sometimes steal my mother's cigarettes to temporarily feel better, but that in of itself is temporary. I wish I never existed, but I really don't know what to do. A part of me wants to live, but these depressive episodes make me want to die. When I talk to my customers, I become happy and cheery, but on the inside I want to collapse and faint. I don't know who to tell. I told one person and they brushed it off. I feel like I might go delusional if I don't tell somebody. I am sorry if this is all over the place, I really need to let this off my mind for a bit.
