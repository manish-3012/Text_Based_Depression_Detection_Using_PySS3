The world has ruined my lifeThe world has ruined my life and they need to pay for it. Everyone treats me like crap while they treat everyone else just fine. They all have friends and dates and spouses and I got no one because they all treat me like crap. No one wants anything to do with me. No one wants to be my friend. No one wants to be my girlfriend. Everyone just leaves me no matter what. I didnâ€™t do anything to deserve this. There is just a no point in me living with everyone treating me like crap. Iâ€™ll show them what happens when u treat someone like this their entire life
