I want someone to talk to right now.I'm not suicidal. I haven't even considered ending my life. But the thought of suicide interests me, and I like to think about it in every way imaginary. I'm feeling pretty shitty right now after returning from a night out and just want someone to talk to. Someone to discuss everything from noise music to philosophical discussions regarding Descartes or Plato. Someone that understands me. I'm sorry, if I'm abusing this subreddit, but I couldn't think of another place to write this. Excuse my weird sentence structures as English is my second language.
