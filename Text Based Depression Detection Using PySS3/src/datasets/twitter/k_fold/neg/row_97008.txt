Procrastinated my suicide so much that my entourage managed to contact me after 2 weeks of cutting contactWell my brother rightfully gave me shit for it but he said something that isn't even related and is probably my most sensitive point and honestly i'd be vivid about it if I wasn't too tired to fight about it,it doesn't matter anymore. Now i'm just really upset and feeling even shittier.

I'll stop chickening out and put an end to it
