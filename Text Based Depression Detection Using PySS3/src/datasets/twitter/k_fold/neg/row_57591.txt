Sleepwalking into deathI could have at least tried to put it off for a few years, but now am about to be homeless and will soon be dead thereafter.  Another Dumb Way to Die.  Why, why, why didnâ€™t I thoroughly think it through and really act when I could?  Made myself useless.  Too many stupid acts.  Pride goeth before my fall.  One day soon Iâ€™ll stop posting, and then my story will be clearly seen as pathetic!!!
