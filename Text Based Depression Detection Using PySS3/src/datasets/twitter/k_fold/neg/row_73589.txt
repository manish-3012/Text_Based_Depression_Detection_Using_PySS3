Genuinely tired of trying to be happyI honestly donâ€™t even know where to begin. I look at my life, and itâ€™s not terrible. It had its ups and itâ€™s downs, but it couldâ€™ve been worse. Iâ€™ve got a job that I love, I love with 3 amazing roommates, and I have even been seeing someone! But now matter what I do, no matter how happy I seem in public, as soon as Iâ€™m alone Iâ€™m brought back to the reality that I am not happy. I have no idea what to do. I feel like everything I do has to be perfect, and even the slightest mistakes drive me insane. Iâ€™ve just been so judgements of myself. I feel like no one cares about me, not that they even know how I feel. I donâ€™t want to be a burden on the people in my life. I do t want to be a bother. Thatâ€™s all I feel like, all the time. Iâ€™ve had thoughts of ending it crop up recently, seemingly out of the blue. I struggled with heavy depression going through high school, but I seemed to overcome it on me own at the time. Maybe itâ€™s just repressed feelings? I donâ€™t know. It just doesnt feel worth it anymore. Anyways, I know this post is all over the place but thanks for listening.
