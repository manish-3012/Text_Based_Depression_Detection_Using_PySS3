I'm seriously thinking of killing myself.I really don't care. I've been in the sadness and weeping frame of mind before. The fear of doing it but never able to push the thought away. 

Lately it just seems like its what I should do. Like something on an itinerary: buy milk; do dishes; kill self. Except why bother with the milk and dishes? Might as well save the effort. Just takes some pills, play a video game until I fall asleep, and there it is. Nothingness. 

I don't fear non-existence. I don't want to *be* anymore. I'm calm, I'm cool, and I'm considering suicide.

People would miss me, but I don't care anymore. My fiancee would be better off. 

This isn't how people are supposed to be. Snap me out of it. Or don't.
