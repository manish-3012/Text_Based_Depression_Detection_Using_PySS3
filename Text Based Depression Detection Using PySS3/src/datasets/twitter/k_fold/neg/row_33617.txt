My roommate told me he wanted to kill himselfMy roommate told me that he wanted to kill himself. He didn't want to tell me why, and didn't want professional help when I asked for it. Is there any way possible I could help him? I'm not asking for a guide, but just want advice to gain several perspectives on how I could possibly help him out...
