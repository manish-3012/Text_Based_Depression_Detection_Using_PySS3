My god the world is so shitTheres so much corruption
So much greed


The more this year goes on the more i feel more comfortable with the idea of ending it all. I want to stay informed but honestly its killing me. But the guilt of stepping back kills me more.

Its the thought of knowing I'll never amount to anything. And i have no control over what happens in regards to the economy ineveitably crashing or just the whole pandemic rn

Its hard to see the good anymore. The 2 things keeping me alive are my foance and the fact that there isnt a painless way to die. Thats it.
