I know you'll find your own way, when I'm not with you.My Nan died this summer. I got dumped recently. 

I've been considering suicide for years. 

Everything's dark, I can see nothing. My life's been in shambles and this is merely the straw to break the camels back. I won't need to worry about any of this bullshit anymore if I am dead. What's the point in trying anything if I always get shot down when I am finally getting anywhere? Where do I go? What the fuck is the point in being here anymore? I used to have answers to these even on my darkest days, but the answers have faded. I have no answers anymore. In death, I will finally be set free from this accursed, miserable world.. Yet I couldn't seem to bring myself to end it. This is probably above Reddit's paygrade but I need help, I feel so alone..
