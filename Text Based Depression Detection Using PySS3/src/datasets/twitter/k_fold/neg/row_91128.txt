People keep telling me "one person isn't worth your life"(Check past post for backstory) 
I disagree. I don't want to share any memories with any other girl but my ex. The way I see it is my life isn't worth living without her in it. And the way things are looking she isn't going to be back in my life so why should I continue doing what I'm doing?
