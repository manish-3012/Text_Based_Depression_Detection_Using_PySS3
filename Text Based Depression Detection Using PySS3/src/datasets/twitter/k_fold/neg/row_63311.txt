Why does everything hurt so muchWhy is it so hard to simply find peace. Even when I'm sitting at home, knowing that I don't have anything to do for the day, that I just can't relax, unwind, nor find peace with myself.

I'm constantly under barrage from my brain no matter the situation. I'm worthless, I'm a loser, I'm so, so lonely.

I can't watch anime much anymore since it's just downtime for my brain to pick on me.

I can't play most games anymore without thinking of what it'd be like with my old best friend, instead of being on my own.

I can't even do things like stretch or exercise at home without my brain flooding me of thoughts of people laughing at me, even though no one can see me.

Why must everything be so painful ;(
