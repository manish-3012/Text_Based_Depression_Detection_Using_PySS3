I'm in a lot of physical painMy stomach hurts near constantly, I've been dealing with this pain for going on 3 years now. It's landed me in the ER more times then I care to mention. The only thing Docs tell me is GERD, I got prescribed pills that don\\t work, sent home, and referred to a specialiast I can't afford to go see.   


I don't want to die I'm just tired of living in constant pain.   


I've already started texting all my friends and telling them how much I care about them, tryinbg to make it seem more like a drunk text then anything alarming.    


I repeat I don't want to die, I just want the pain to stop and I have no where else to turn.
