I'm depressed. It never gets better.Throught my years, I grew up without much of a choice. I grew with strict financial upbringing (Chinese blood parent)  I couldnâ€™t what major I wanted and I wasn't even allowed to have a boyfriend even though my brothers already had girlfriends of their own. Bear in my mind, I was already grown and have several responsibilities that I handle on my own. Because of this, I couldnâ€™t complain. I hated myself for not standing up on my own and frequently, I cry more at night. I get thoughts of suicide and running away, hurting myself more in the process. I've been used and I hate myself really badly at this point.

Edit: I'm getting a better after ranting out my thoughts plus the reddit community here giving help and advices. Just go to show I'm not truly alone. Huge thanks for the help guys.
