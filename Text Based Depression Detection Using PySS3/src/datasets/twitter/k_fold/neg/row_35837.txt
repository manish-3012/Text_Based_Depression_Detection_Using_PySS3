I used to think about suicide. Then I realized death is nothingnessMy reasons for thinking about suicide might be silly for others. My reasons were boredom and mediocrity. When I was young, everybody including myself, believed I had great potential for success. But family circumstances prevented me from reaching that potential. I live a normal life, struggling like most people. I felt that that equated to failure. I wanted to die instead of having to work until I am 60 and just getting by. That's how I saw my future and I felt it wasn't worth living.

I still enjoy the little things though. A comfortable bed, watching my favorite shows, good food, a few treasured friends. If I kill myself, then what? Nothing. I, unlike others who want suicide, am healthy and not in pain. Would I really want to exchange those little things to nothingness? Even if at times I am burdened with regrets and self pity, there are still things worth living for and I only recently realized that it doesn't have to be those big things in life like a successful career or expensive travels. It's amazing that I am able to release myself from suicidal thoughts because of the little things. Those little things that I won't exchange from the nothingness of death.
