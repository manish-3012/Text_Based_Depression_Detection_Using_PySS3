gone too far.ah, im here. i guess not much will get accomplished by posting this, but fuck it. 


im very fucked up. mentally and physically. i stopped caring, though. or maybe itâ€™s the opposite. i donâ€™t know.

i can feel myself getting worse, with depression and what-not. itâ€™s now become a chore to get up and go to the bathroom, or get up at all for that matter.

i got my hands on a razor blade, i think you know what came next. my whole body is covered in cuts, some deeper than others. 

nobody cares about me, not anymore. ive pushed away everyone. the people who claim to â€˜careâ€™, theyâ€™re fake. my lover broke up with me because of my depression. that might sound vague. they broke up with me because i never talked to them. 

itâ€™s reasonable, but they know im shit at communicating. hell, they tried to help me, but they never really loved me. i canâ€™t take this shit anymore.
my family hates me, my friends are fake. ive got no one to live for. ive gone too far.

i canâ€™t fucking take this bullshit anymore. ive reached my limit. i canâ€™t fight anymore. the only reason im posting this, is to find hope. hope that makes me want to live. but for now, 

im done. i surrender.
