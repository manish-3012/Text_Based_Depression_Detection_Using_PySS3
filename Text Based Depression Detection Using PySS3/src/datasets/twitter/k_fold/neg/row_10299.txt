I donâ€™t want to suffer anymoreI try not to tell my friends and family how I feel anymore but itâ€™s overwhelming. Iâ€™m bipolar and the mood swings are killer. I donâ€™t wanna suffer anymore. But I love my boyfriend, so so so much, I canâ€™t imagine being dead and never seeing him again. Heâ€™s the reason Iâ€™ve held on.

It just hurts a lot and I donâ€™t wanna hurt forever
