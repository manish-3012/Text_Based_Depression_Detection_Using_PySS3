I'm about done - ventShit Idc. My "friends" don't even listen any more. I fail at everything I try, nothing entertains me anymore, let alone feeling even just a little bit full filed, I'm tired, I'm so tired of everything, physically, mentally, emotionally. I'm running out of excuses to not kill myself. I have nothing to look forward to. I'm just so tired.
