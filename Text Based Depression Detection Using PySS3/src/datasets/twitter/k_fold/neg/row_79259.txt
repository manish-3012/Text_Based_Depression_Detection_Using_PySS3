Need help. Just Lost ANOTHER job &amp; Feeling worthlessHey. I live alone and I didn't really know where to reach so I am posting here hoping for suggestions and answers.

I am 26 years old and I have HF Autism, Asperger Syndrome and Sever Depression. I am really upset because I just lost yet ANOTHER job do to the symptoms of my Autism. Here is a little background on everywhere I have been fired from so far.

Best Buy, Kroger, Cellairis, Computer Discount (Local PC repair) Office Max, Dillard's, Super Nerds (Local Cell Phone Repair), Verizon Wireless

I really don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I am just not employable. I have considered ending my life over the repeated job losses. I'd rather be dead than on the street because I wouldn't know how to survive... The only job I have lasted more than 1 year at was office max and that was with a manager that had training on autism. When that manager left the new manager fired me inside of a MONTH. I really just don't know what to do. How can I continue to live a normal life when I can not work? I don't wanna end up on the streets but I feel like I am the butt of some cruel plan that society has for people with disabilities. I am too smart to get SSI but too weird to have a job. I applied for SSI and got denied...

Whats the point in living when I am not allowed to be a member of society?
