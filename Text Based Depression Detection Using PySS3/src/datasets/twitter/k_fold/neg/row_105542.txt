People only give a shit about child abuse when the victim is still a child.No one gives a shit what happens to that child when he grows up. No one cares about what trauma happened in the past. They'll tell you empty promises when you're still a small child, but no one gives a shit once you're old.   


"Pain is a part of life."  


If what I experienced was a part of life then that is a life I cannot bear to live. Ever.  


Death is much better.  


If I was to tell people about even a single bit of the physical and sexual and mental abuse that I went through when I was still just a child then everyone would be up in arms.  


But now that I'm almost an adult, no one gives a shit.
