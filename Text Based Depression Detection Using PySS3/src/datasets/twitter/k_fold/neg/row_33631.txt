Advice?What's keeping alive is that I'm too scared to die
I don't like to compared, not given responsibilitie.
Getting loved is something I don't deserve. 
What's the point of living this life. I don't care.
I can give my heart, my eyes, my organs to someone who needs it, who has a vision. It's hard to say these things out loud because I'm too scared to lose everyone which leads to me dying. Therefore I'm too scared to die and forever stuck in this miserable feeling.
