I'm so pissed at myself.I never realized how much I wanted to die until I realized I was a fucking moron to think that a paperclip in an outlet would kill me. Turns out, it's highly non-lethal and only hurts like hell, but it doesn't kill you. I had 2 paperclips that I knew I would use for something, but not that. There's not a damn rope in the house, I don't know where the guns are, none of the kitchen knives would be even remotely sharp enough to slit my throat with; I need this. I'm a failure and I'm afraid I'm going to do terrible shit to someone and ruin their life without even knowing it. I need to be put down.
