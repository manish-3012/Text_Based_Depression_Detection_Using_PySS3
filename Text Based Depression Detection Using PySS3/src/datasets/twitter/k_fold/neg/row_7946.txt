I canâ€™t believe thisMy mom just called me. I answered and turns out, it was accidental. She didnâ€™t know. But I went to talk and happened to hear my boyfriendâ€™s name. And then my mom and sisterâ€™s voices. 
â€œHow long does she think J will keep putting up with herâ€ â€œHe tries his hardest to keep her happyâ€ â€œAll she does is mope aroundâ€ â€œGood people get tired tooâ€

Iâ€™m fucking depressed. And you guys have the fucking nerve to sit in my face and try to comfort me and tell me Iâ€™m making progress. Iâ€™m endlessly grateful for my boyfriend because he has been there when yâ€™all havenâ€™t. When yâ€™all turned against me, he was there. 

Itâ€™s been exactly 2 years since my granny passed. Iâ€™m still mourning. And I wake up to them talking shit about me as if Iâ€™m nothing. I feel sick. Iâ€™m tired and Iâ€™m sick of this.
