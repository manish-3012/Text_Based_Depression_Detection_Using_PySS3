AbandonedMy beautiful girl friend who I want to share everything with has not only left me but has cut me off. I dont even get to listen to her voice anymore. Im super attached at a level I think people wouldn't understand. I still have her unwashed clothes after months.

I would have never have left her, never abandon her. We we're inseparable. She left for school and that all changed. I needed her attention. She found me in a time in my life when I needed her the most. 
She's gone now. She doesn't even check on me anymore. 
I've cut myself open to try and get her attention. To try and show her I need her attention. I am so attached to my gf.
The way I feel now is vindictive. She doesn't even msg me to check up on me at all. It hurts. I feel like killing myself, maybe run my car into a pole or put a gun to my head. Then she would never be able to ask me what I was feeling. She would never be able to ask me what I had for breakfast or  how my day was at work. She would never get to ask me anything again. Since I must be a nuisance I will just remove myself. Everything i'm feeling for her will be gone with me. She will never know how attached I was and never be able to talk to me again. I stay high 24/7 to numb what I feeling. As i type this im proned for anxiety tremors. I really dont know how much longer I got. I just thought I'd share this. I really need her. If i cant have her I dont want to live anymore.
