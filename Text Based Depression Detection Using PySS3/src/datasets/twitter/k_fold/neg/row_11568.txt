angry, sad, hopeless. Feeling like there's not much option otherwise.I really just feel like I try to make friends and meet people and no one ever really feels interested in meeting me. I get blown off a lot. And I wish I could say that that's all it is but I just don't feel like anyone finds me worthwhile anymore. I just overall feel like everyone they know would be better off with out me. Not really sure what else to do. I just wish that I felt better. Ha.
