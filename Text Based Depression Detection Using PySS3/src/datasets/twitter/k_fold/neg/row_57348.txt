Can somebody please please please talk to me?I just need somebody with great emotional strength so they can put up with my bullshit. I've been constantly thinking about suicide for a long time now. What usually happens is this:

* feel suicidal
* look up suicide methods on google
* instead find inspiration, reasons to live, or people that care
* no suicidal thoughts for 2-3 hours
* suicidal thoughts slowly creep back, or something triggers them
* repeat

I don't know how much longer I'm going to last. I think for now im just going to sleep.
