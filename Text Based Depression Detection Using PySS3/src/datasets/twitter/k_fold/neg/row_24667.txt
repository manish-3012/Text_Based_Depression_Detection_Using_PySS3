I'm going to play chicken with a train tonightThis is how it ends. I'm sure of it. But I'm scared. That's why I'm going to buy a bottle of vodka and drink until all I can do is hit the gas. This will be for the best. Everyone will move on and I'll end all of my suffering. It has to be this way. I just need to accept that.
