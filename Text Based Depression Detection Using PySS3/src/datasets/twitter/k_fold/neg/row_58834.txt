Just so tiredI feel hopeless. I've been on every drug. I've had ECT and TMS. Nothing helps. I've been trying to just stay busy to distract myself from the suicidal thoughts. The last week has been bad and then last night I had a now former friend mock me for taking issue to his statement of "Not all men" when he was asking about my history of being raped. This is a person I see every day in nursing school and Idk why but this has just pushed me beyond my current coping ability. I am trying hard to ignore my suicidal thoughts but so much of me just wants to take an antiemetic and overdose on meds. Nothing violent. Just permanent sleep. I'm so tired :'(
