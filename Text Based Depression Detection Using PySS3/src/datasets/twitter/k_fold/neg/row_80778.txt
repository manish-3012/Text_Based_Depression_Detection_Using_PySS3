I am very suicidal... And I'm alone for a few days..Also my teeth are hurting, I don't know why

My gums hurt so bad I can hardly eat and I have a sore on each side of my tongue. In the back of my mouth it feels like a tooth is rubbing a hole in my cheek... This discomfort is... 

I'm just in an awful place. I'm completely alone. I'm so stupid.
