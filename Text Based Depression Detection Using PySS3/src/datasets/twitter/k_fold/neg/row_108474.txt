I just want to dissappearNormally once a day, at night, I'll end up crying. Crying uncontrollably, loudly, and pathetically. This has become my life, and I hate it. I just want to disappear, I guess you could call me suicidal. I've tried once before, but didn't work unfortunately. I'm to much of a pussy to try again though, because anytime I do I get scared. Scared of the after life and what could happen, but I just dont want to be here. Not that my life is bad, Ive got friends I think and a family kinda. I just want to be alone forever, with no one else. But at the same time I just want someone to talk to and understand that I'm not trying to be an attention seeker or making things up. I just dont know, this doesnt really make any logical sense. Goodnight.
