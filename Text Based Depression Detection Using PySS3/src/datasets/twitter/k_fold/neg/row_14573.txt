Talk to me :)I'm a 19 year old guy. I've been depressed for almost 2 years now. The last happy memories I have are from 2016. I haven't done anything the last 2 years, I've been trying to not think about the future and life day to day. I haven't had any real suicidal thoughts, I sometimes wished I was dead but I never thought of killing myself. This changed the last week, it's almost all I can think off. There's still a lot of things I want to do in life (I'm only 19 and haven't done much), but I have this feeling that they will never happen anyways. I scheduled an apointment with my doctor tomorrow in the hope she can help me with finding a therapist/psychiatrist. So I need someone to talk to me and help me with my suicidal thoughts this night.
