I had the most terrifying dream, and Iâ€™m scared and I feel aloneAll I saw was my funeral, just a long shot of it, a bunch of people surrounding the center. Thatâ€™s all it was for hours, just an ominous shot of that. Suddenly everything faded to black. It was like I was trapped in this thick ooze of darkness, I could physically feel stuff around me, and then I heard a loud noise, I donâ€™t know what it was but it sounded like a wooden barrel falling or a box being dropped, and I saw my friend fall down in a noose. I donâ€™t know why I dreamt something so fucked up, her face was cold and dead and I feel so fucking scared from it. I feel alone and trapped because I donâ€™t have anyone to distract me from this and itâ€™s 12pm and Iâ€™m freaking out because Iâ€™m so fucking scared. Someone, please help.
