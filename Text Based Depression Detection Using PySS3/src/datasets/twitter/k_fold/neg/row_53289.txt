Yesterday we lost our brother.Yesterday after a week of no communication we became very worried about my brother-inlaw.  We contacted his neighbor and he was found in his house.  Yesterday was his 31st birthday. He was my close friend and I considered him my little brother.  I will miss him for as long as I draw breath.

I just wanted to come here and remind everyone that our time here is very short and please if you do nothing else today tell the people you hold dear how much you love them.  And if you are thinking about taking your life please reach out to someone, believe me someone out there loves you very much.   I don't know any of you but I love you, please take care of one another.

I will not be answering any questions, I just wanted to share.
