MmIâ€™m only 17.. I want to fucking end it right now and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me?? Maybe the fear of the unknown, fear of death??
All I know is that I donâ€™t have any control over anything and Iâ€™m gonna end up dead one way or another why would I continue my suffering if itâ€™s just gonna continue forever. Life is hard, I canâ€™t enjoy anything..... but Iâ€™m also scared that Iâ€™m gonna kms,, like Iâ€™m gonna lose control.
