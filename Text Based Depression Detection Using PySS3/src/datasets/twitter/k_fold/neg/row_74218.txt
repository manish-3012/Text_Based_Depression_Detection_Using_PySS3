2:30 am. Knives on the table. Pills brimming my glass. Dear reddit,

I am 24 and haven't done anything with my life. All my friends are gone. My girlfriend, who was the world to me, left me for a threat I had seen coming. I have no talents. I have no money. The only people who talk to me are my parents. I'm six foot three, fairly attractive, and someone with capacity for above average thought. But I'm invisible. People hate me immediately. I try to go out and meet friends. But I am just an old creep with no redeeming qualities. I've even tried meeting people online. 

It's hopeless. I have perspective on the human condition, and the futility of life. I wanted to live a good one before I died. But I'm a ghost. And I can't feel anything anymore. I became a cutter just to get the sensation. But I'm finally ready. 

I don't need a suicide hotline or Jesus. I just need someone who gives a fuck. This is my last try.
