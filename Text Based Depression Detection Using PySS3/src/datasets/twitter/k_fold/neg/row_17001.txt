Everything in weird shades of greyIâ€™ve been organizing everything mindlessly and getting everything in order. I donâ€™t know how to really put everything into words. I think about it every day and itâ€™s become exhausting. Iâ€™m just tired of being tired. I feel like Iâ€™ve given so much strength and now it feels like I donâ€™t have anymore strength left for myself.
