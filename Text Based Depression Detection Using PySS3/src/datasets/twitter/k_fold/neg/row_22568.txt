I need help...Iâ€™m always feeling depressed.... I live a life no one else knows but me, I try to stop the addiction I have but I canâ€™t, i always think about ending it but I donâ€™t have the guts to. One of these days I feel like Iâ€™m just going to do it and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to stop myself from it. Money is the biggest issue I have in my life because I spend it all on on my addiction and Iâ€™m barely getting by in life because of it.... I lie to my parents, I lie to my siblings, and I lie to everyone... no one understands why I have no money and I always make up bullshit for it. My head just always hurts when I think about everything that Iâ€™m fucked for and I feel like I will never change and this is my cry for help... I break down when Iâ€™m by myself and I know people care about me but it seems like they only care about me when I am benefiting them... Iâ€™m sorry to my family, and people that care about me that all I have done is ever lie to you and you still donâ€™t know about it....
