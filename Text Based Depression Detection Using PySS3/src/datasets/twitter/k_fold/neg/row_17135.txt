I hate being called selfishMy very best friend said that if I'd killed myself he'd be sad. He also said I couldn't do something so selfish because it would hurt him and I have never wanted to hurt him, ever. But, lately? I've been thinking and thinking and thinking about it even more so than usual. My old manager at work noticed I had depression and he also said I was being selfish since so many people care. He didn't know that no one cares because if they did I wouldn't spend so many night alone in the cold.
