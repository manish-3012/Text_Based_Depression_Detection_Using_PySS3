I'm done.Thanks to everyone that tried to help, but I've made up my mind. Life is not for me. I've been hated since I came into this world, and I'm sure that will continue, so I'll just save everyone the trouble of having to endure me. I just really do not want to be here anymore every day is torture and it's not like I have anyone in my life, and people shame me for going to the one place that helps, so that leaves me alone. There's nothing to say, I've just decided to end it, no one will care, life goes on.
