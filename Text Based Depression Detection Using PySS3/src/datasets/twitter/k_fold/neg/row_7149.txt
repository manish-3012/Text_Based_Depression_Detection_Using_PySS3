I popped a bunch of anti-depressants and anxiety pills on an impulse.I was on an anxiety related medication a year ago and had some pills leftover after the medication course was over - which I didn't think much about. Last few months, I have kept cycling between really low and high moods. And I had a low mood for the past few days; but today the dam just broke. In between the incessant crying, I don't know what came over me; I just popped in all the pills that were leftover. Thankfully, there were only about 7-8 left. That is still about 4 times the recommended dosage, but apart from some drowsiness, I am mostly fine.

The problem is that at the time when I was gulping them down I was fervently looking for more. Had there been more I may have, may have taken all of them.

I am not suicidal. At least I don't think I am. This was more of an impulse coming from a really low point. I just can't seem to catch a break and now to add to it I am terrified that slowly and steadily the last 'barriers' that I have against getting serious suicidal thoughts are slowly getting eroded.

And that is just making things worse. I have tried exercising regularly, maintaining good diet and the lot. But I keep falling back in the ditch.
