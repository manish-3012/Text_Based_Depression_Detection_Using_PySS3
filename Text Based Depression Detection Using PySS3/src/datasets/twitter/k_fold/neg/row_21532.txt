Sometimes I wish someone would kidnap or murder me so I didnâ€™t have to deal with the responsibility.Iâ€™m really low mentally at the moment, Iâ€™m not at the worst Iâ€™ve ever been but Iâ€™m crazy overwhelmed and really feeling like just not being alive anymore. 

The whole process of ending it is so long and the probabilities are stacked against your favour though, now sometimes I just wish someone else would do it for me.
