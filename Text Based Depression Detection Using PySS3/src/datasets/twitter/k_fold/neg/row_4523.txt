Im a guy (15) and i've been feeling fucking awfulIm a guy (15) and i've been feeling fucking awful for 7 months now, for the first few months to be able to look happy all the time i had to go somewhere away from everyone to just cry, cause im very shy to show any other feelings than happiness, and it would't probably matter anyways cause whenever i try to talk to any of my friends, family, they just say "yeah yeah thats awful" and change the subject.
For the next few months i stopped trying to talk about this with anyone and i didn't feel anything. I fidn't feel happy sad just empty. Sure the little things made me happy, but there was this emptiness lurking behind that.
And a few days ago this girl i knew for a few years told me she had feelings for me, we set up a date, and i caught feelings. Big mistake. Next she says, it was a mistake and she didnt have any feelings for me.

Lately ive just been getting worse i need to go somewhere alone to cry to get through the day,started cutting myself with shards of glass, i guess the cutting is a call for help cause i cant find the courage to talk to anyone anymore.
This is probabaly my last attmpt to let it out before i start doing dumb fucking shit, couse i have nothing else left to do. 
So if anyone sees this i hope you actually listened unlike my friends and family.
