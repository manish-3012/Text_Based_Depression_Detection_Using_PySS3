Tried to kill myself todayI tried to kill myself earlier today. I had the perfect plan. There is a big tree at the side of the road about a mile before my work. All I had to do was floor it and run into the tree. Instant death, hopefully. Life insurance payout for my family, maybe. I've read that if there is no note it is hard to prove a car crash is a suicide.

But, I could not do it. I got close. I aimed and accelerated, but at the last moment, I pulled back onto the road. I was angry at myself for not being able to go through with it. 

I have had this plan for about a week now. Every time, I could not do it. I got the closest today. I even did some practice. On my way to work today, I tried what it would feel like to veer off the road. Not all the way. Just a couple of feet onto the shoulder. It was trippy, even though I immediately got back on the road.

I don't know if I will ever be able to do it. Things can't get much worse than they are now. Well, I suppose things could always get worse. What does "rock bottom" feel like? I'm probably not there yet, as I still have a job and a car and food and shelter. But, damn, it feels so close.
