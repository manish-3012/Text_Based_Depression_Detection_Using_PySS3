I'm done. I can't keep this going and I don't want to.Everything in my life seems to find a way to turn to ash. As a child I was raped by another man. Nothing was done about it. He has a family now. He's never paid for his crime. I was abused at home, bullied at school by students and faculty. Despite that, I managed to survive school long enough to join the military. I thought that would be the turning point in my life. I was wrong. Since then I've been homeless, my best friend was killed over there a month before coming home, I haven't held a relationship down since 2009, I have no money despite having spent $160k on my education, I was just offered a job on April 1st only to find out three days later that it was a mistake. Last year I was dating a woman who decided she didn't need to tell me she has herpes and now I'm stuck with this disease for the rest of my life. On top of that, the girl I had started seeing a few weeks ago came down with flu like symptoms, and the most we've done is kiss which tells me that I not only have this fucking virus on my best parts, but on my mouth as well. The odds of that happening are near zero from one exposure, but that's my luck. And now I gave it to her. She's home sick and I can't even bring myself to tell her what this could mean.

Everything turns to ash. I haven't had a single sustained success in my entire life. Nothing. I can't do this anymore. I've fought this for so long and so hard. I'm just exhausted. I don't have the energy left to do this. All I ever wanted was to be a father and a husband, and i can do neither because of this silly disease. I can't kiss my children. I can't make love to a woman. I can't do anything without risking giving this to people. I can never have a normal life again. I can never have the life I worked toward. So what's the point.
