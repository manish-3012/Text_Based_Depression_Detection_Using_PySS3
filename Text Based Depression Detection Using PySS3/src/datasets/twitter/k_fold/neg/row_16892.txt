I won't do itI wish I could. 


I'll cut, and drink a bottle of Nyquil,  but in the back of my mind I know it's not enough.  


I don't think I'll ever be able to get to that time I did die. 



And it's comforting in a way. 


I'll pseudo die, blood, nyquil, whatever else I can get my hands on.


But I won't hurt my mom,  who'd be the one to find me. 



I want to stop hurting so much.


Don't bother talking to me tonight.  I needed to get that out in a place I Won't be ridiculed.

thank you all for what you do
