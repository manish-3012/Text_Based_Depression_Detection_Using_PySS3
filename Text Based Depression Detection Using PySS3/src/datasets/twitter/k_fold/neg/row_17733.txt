My path is mine and mine alone...My path is mine and mine alone
I walk the path of the lone wolf
No place I will call home
From high up on icy mountain
I howl my melancholy question
And ponder the question
Which I fear more
The answer, or the return


I shan't ever feel the warmth of love again
For I am cold and lonely
Though my will remains unbroken
My hope lay shattered in pieces
On that warm July day
When my love of my life left me
Left me with a cold chill I couldn't shake
On such a warm day

These seizures and pains lay my body broken
If only I had a token of hope
Maybe I wouldn't have laid me down to rest
In the lands of the hereafter
With all those who came before me
Aside lay here drawing nearer to thee
My final breath nearing me
My pack that I abandoned comes to me

From high on lonely mountain
I howl my melancholy question
And know my answer
To the question
I fear the return
As I walk down the icy path
I look to my left then my right
And see that I am walking forever alone
For the path of the lone wolf
Is mine and mine alone
