Will 2000 mg of Lamictal, 6000 mg of Zoloft, and 6,000 mg of Quetiapine/Seroquel XR be enough to kill mefrom what i've read none of them are enough alone but i'm hoping combined they'll put me out of my misery. I want to be 100% this is gonna kill my because no way in hell do I want to survive with a ton of fucked up disabilities
