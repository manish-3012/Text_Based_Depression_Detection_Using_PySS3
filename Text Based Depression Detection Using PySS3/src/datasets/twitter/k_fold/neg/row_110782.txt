Im thinking about suicide.Im 190 pound sophomore male. I have 1.88 GPA and all I do is get my parents mad. All I do in school is talk to my friends. The friends I have are slowly leaving me. I dont know what I want to be in the future. My chest aches everytime I think about suicide or my family being happy without me. I just dont know what to do with life, like I have no ambition whatsoever and dont know what to be when I grow up. I wont help or contribute to society. Im useless. All I do is eat up its resources. I know my story doesnt seem as bad as others, but since im useless, it looks like im gonna kms. TTKMSS
