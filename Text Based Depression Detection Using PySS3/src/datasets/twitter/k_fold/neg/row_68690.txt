i need advice about my friend plsmy best friend, you could say she is literally the love of my life, struggles with suicidal thoughts. she had a really bad struggle last week and has not been the same since. she doesnâ€™t live close to me. so the only way to talk is texting and what not. 

we used to talk all day, everyday and now i barely hear from her. i am trying to give her space, but i feel so helpless. i feel selfish for texting her, even once a day. but all i wanna know is if she is there, if she is doing okay, if she is taking care of herself. 

what do i do? how is the best way to support her? i donâ€™t wanna lose her- and that goes in all forms of her not being here or not being able to have the same relationship. 

my heart is just hurting so much for her.
