WhyI should be happy. I was born into this world with loving parents, all my limbs, and a good metabolism in a first-world country. My parents are successful and have their whole lives planned out. So why do I feel so empty? Thatâ€™s a rhetorical question, I donâ€™t want an answer. 
I still live with my parents, as Iâ€™m still in school, and this virus shit has got me trapped inside with them. Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, but a week more of this just might be my breaking point. Maybe they do know whatâ€™s best for me. But right now, Iâ€™m just sick of it all. 
Nothing caused my depression, though. Thatâ€™s the thing. Iâ€™ve been feeling like this since elementary school. And because Iâ€™ve been given all these privileges in life, it would be like spitting in the face of everyone whoâ€™s ever loved me. 
I miss feeling like I had something to live for. Iâ€™m young and kind and I have my whole life ahead of me, but I canâ€™t help thinking Iâ€™ll be dead before graduation. 
I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s just a brain dump of all this. Sorry.
