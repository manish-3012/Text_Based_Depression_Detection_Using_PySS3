I don't want to dieI don't, but there ain't no other option.

There's much more to say than what I've posted down there, but I'm too lethargic/whatever to bother, and nobody's gonna read it anyway, so wtf.

My mom's abusive, paranoid, and tries to control every one of my steps. (I'm 24). This goes so far as that she'll guilt trip me for cutting my hair.

I would like to move out. I can't.

I'm depressed. I can't work (depression + OCD) and am supposed to get 350 euros in benefits per month. Cool. What the hell am I supposed to do with those? Live in a cabin in the woods? Whoever can pay an apartment and food with 350 euros? (Most single apartments here cost about 350 euros alone - or more.)

Very little excites me any more. It's hard to even do the things I used to love doing - because damn, why would I bother? I don't have any friends, don't have any relatives, and I'm stuck home 24/7. I have about 57 euros on my bank account left, and when those are gone, well. SHRUG.

I'd like to travel... maybe... but then again how, with 50 euros? Lol. I'm so pathetic it's ridiculous.

I don't know if I'll make it through the night.
