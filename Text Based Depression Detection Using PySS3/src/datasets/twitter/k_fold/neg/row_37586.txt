Looking for an outI need help...I tried to commit years ago and the rope broke. I keep having nightmares to try again and how to do it successfully, my doctor doesnâ€™t believe me nobody does I do not know where to turn. Iâ€™m sending the goodbyes now idk if this is the right thing to do, but hopefully itâ€™ll end the pain. The suicide hotline didnâ€™t help all I need is someone to help
