NHS information - URGENT!!!Guys, my friend is really bad right now. After several panic attacks in the last months, he had a heart attack yesterday and he's saying he's gonna kill himself today. 

The situation evolved from a general idea to a date. Though he doesn't specify how, he's is in a hospital and I'm not sure how much he told the doctor - if you are in common area, there's plenty of ways to do it in a hospital.  

I don't know what else to do! 

He lives in Scotland and I'm in Poland right now. I tried to contact my country's embassy without success. I tried to get in touch with UK hotlines without success.

Next step is to call UK authorities. I think the best way to do it is calling the hospital he's and inform them of his plans. I don't know about NHS, but where I'm from, if a person informs that has a suicidal plan, the hospital is obliged to protect her. 

Someone knows how it works for NHS? Specifically Scotland?

Thank you for the help.
