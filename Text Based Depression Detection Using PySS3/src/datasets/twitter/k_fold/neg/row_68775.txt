Planning on doing somethingI have been struggling with depression since November 2017. Ever since that time I have been at university and I have had a friend which has been there for me every since it started. She went to doctors appointments with me when I got diagnosed, came into my room whenever I was crying. She was very much like a sister to me. Helped me out a lot and we even washed each otherâ€™s dishes and stuff for each other and made the same meals. She did snake me out a lot however by telling a flatmate who bullied me about my mental illness about all of the traumatic things I was going through and I was upset about this. We had a lot of arguments about this and then much bigger arguments about smaller stuff happened. I went too far one month ago and told her that she didnâ€™t care, that she wants me dead and even said I would record my suicide and send it to her. I was drunk which is no excuse and I would take back every word I said that night if I had the chance. She has blocked me on everything and can never speak to her. I have apologised on the day that she went home but she was having none of it. I have sent her a card and flowers for her birthday tomorrow which probably wonâ€™t solve anything however Iâ€™m also planning on killing myself as I feel like it will make her happy. I really wish my brain wasnâ€™t like this and I have a lot of people that do care about me. I put so much trust in to her and I know that she hates me when she was like a sister to me.
