Having a bad time.My feelings keep bouncing from soul crushing misery, to intense rage, and being void of anything at all(not in that order) sometimes with the twist of being a mixture between them. I feel like the very few people who care no longer do cause I'm an asshole. I have no future, all my dreams feel unachievable, and I'm completely alone. The only thing that changes if I'm gone is less problems for everyone else
