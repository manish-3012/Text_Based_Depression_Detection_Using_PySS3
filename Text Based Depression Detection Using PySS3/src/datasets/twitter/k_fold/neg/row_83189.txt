Suicide as the diseaseI think society's understanding of suicide is defined by the act of killing oneself which leads to misinformation about suicide. Most people who talk about suicide do not go through with it but some do. Why? 

Most people can drink and not become an alcoholic, but some do. Why? 

The idea is one is pre-disposed to these issues either through nature or nurture or a combination of the two. But we now understand alcoholism and addiction as a "disease".

So is suicide a disease? Is depression a symptom of the disease of pre-disposition to suicidal ideation or is suicide a symptom of the disease of depression? 

For myself, I have experienced depression and "suicidal tendencies". Sometimes they come together, sometimes they happen seperately. I believe my depression has taken a different path than the suicidal ideation.

My depression is passive, perhaps easy for myself to make light of and use various coping techniques to work through a "bad feeling".

But the idea of suicide is progressively pervasive with a slow descent into feelings that did not exist with just depression alone. It removes all emotion and feeling and thought other than death. All the energy, all the drive, the very will to live. 

I used to believe I wanted to die. Now I know that I will. But I feel out of control because I will never decide today is the day, I will never create a whole dog and pony show or even say goodbye. One day i am just going to wake up and end it. It could be a perfectly fine day, I could have money in the bank, food on my plate, a place to live and in a blink it will be all over. 

Depression and I are friends, suicide will not stop until I am dead.
