depression How does an adult living alone tell their extremely judgmental, religious, belittling family that they've been trying to kill themselves and will likely succeed someday?I haven't seen or spoken to my family (or anyone) in 4 months, but I miss them and worry about them all day, every day. It kills me to not know if they're alright or not, and they probably think I'm dead or hate me for losing contact and moving without telling anyone. I was supposed to be dead by now and still want to die without hurting them, but my will to make sure they've been good is very strong (my parents are past their 70s). Every day I feel like shit, can't sleep and think I deserve to die, but I need to offer a truthful explanation if I were to see them again...I know they would laugh and belittle me if I told them why I disappeared. I'm so torn. They like to blame me for whatever happens, even if I got hit by truck that was driven by a drunk driver and jumped the curb while I was leaving a grocery store. This is humiliating.

They've never really known about my severe depression and constant suicidal thoughts, because I've always been very ashamed. But I was diagnosed 7 years ago.
