I think I might die this yearI can't deal with this anymore. Can't deal with the immense loneliness, the feeling of being a failure no one really cares about, feeling like I was basically fucked from the start when the first sexual abuse happened. How I try so hard to be a kind person and then have someone yell at me be a they have a bad day so it's ok to spit on me. People I deemed my friends just up and left me. I won't get therapy until next year because of long queues to get help, and I won't even get someone to talk to in the meantime because my therapist doesn't believe I actually have depression, despite it being diagnosed by her colleague.

My dream is to help people, to spread kindness, but I guess my place in life is to be bullied till I take my life and then be forgotten.
