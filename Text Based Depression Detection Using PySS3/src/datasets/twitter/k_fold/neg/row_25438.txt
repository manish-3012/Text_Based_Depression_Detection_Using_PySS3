Severe Anhedonia and Social AnxietyI'm 21 going on 22 this coming April. Life is hard. Life is a disappointment. Life is boring. especially when I'm losing interest in everything I have ever found interesting - guitar, girls, music, movies, tv, food. The world seems really dark in this state, having nothing to live for and when I don't even care anymore if i lose everything i have right now. It's extremely tiring to just wake up from bed, get dressed and go to my part-time job. Sometimes i stay in the office an hour above required because I have no where to be.

Having social anxiety doesn't help. I pretend I'm fine everywhere i go with fake smiles and fake uplifting tones. When no one is looking i turn around and reveal my emotionless face. I have no reply when someone talks to me. My mind is blank. I'm tired. Tired of when I'm talking, my 'friends' may stop talking but they don't listen at all. They just continue on with their story and forget everything I said. I'm tired of this. I keep the around just so i don't feel embarrassed when i walk around alone. So I can tell my parents i have somewhere else to be rather than sit at home when I'm not at work.

I've attempted suicide before by overdose of pills but i was stopped by the police when one of my friends called them. Even then my parents don't understand.

The pills were from the local Mental institution for help me stabilise my mood. I hear voices in my head. They're not as bad as what some other people experience. Mine just talks to me. I wish they were actual real beings because the voices seem to care about me more than the real people around me.

I'm tired... I don't know what to do
