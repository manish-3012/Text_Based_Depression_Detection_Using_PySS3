I don't want to die, but I really want to dieI don't want anyone dealing with me being gone, even if I think they'll get over it eventually. But at the same time dying just seems like the logical option. I can't sit here and live for 70 or so miserable years, locked in some sort of prison, I need an escape. Plus, fuck everyone saying that these thoughts are temporary, like what no they're not, they've plagued mine and many other's lives for years and the only way these thoughts will be temporary is when we permanently end them
