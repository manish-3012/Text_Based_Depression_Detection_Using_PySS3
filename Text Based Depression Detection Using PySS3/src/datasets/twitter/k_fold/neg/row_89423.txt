14 (M) I've lost so muchI've lost most of my friends when they were basically stolen by someone who hated me. I've lost about everyone I love. I can't take this anymore. Everyday I wake up trying to start my day like everyone else but it's hard. I miss when people used to ask about my day. I miss when people used to start a conversation with me. I try to make new ones but nothing works. I miss when life was simpler for me and more happy. Am I a bad person for thinking about these things?
