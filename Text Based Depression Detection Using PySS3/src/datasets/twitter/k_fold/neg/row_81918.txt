Why should I keep myself alive?I'm so done with crying. Long story short, I'm friendless and my ex-friends are legitimately better off without me. This is the second group of friends I have to drop because they turned toxic or stopped caring about me. I feel like I'm cursed to never have a legitimate or lasting friendship. I'm barely passing my classes and to top it all off my dog is dying of cancer. And I feel as though I deserve all of this because for some reason every friend I have ends up hating me or abandoning me, which means I am the problem. Last year was such a good year for me, why did everything have to turn into shit this year?
I may end up deleting this later.
