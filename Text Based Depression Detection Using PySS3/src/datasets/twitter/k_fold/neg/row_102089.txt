Please respondI'm 16 years old. Things are pretty okay, bad stuffs happened to me before but nothing major. 
I can think of a million things to say for why I want to die but I don't genuinely believe in them. I think if those reasons didn't exist it would be easier to not die but I don't think they've pushed me to die, ykno.
My parents are drunk and screaming right now and it is an isolating feeling, they're general ineptitude at raising us is something that keeps me from ever having anyone to open up to. We move to much for me to have friends and they're distant from me. 
I guess if I had an audience to tell my feelings to, things would at least be better. But I don't think it would fix anything. 
I don't think their actions pushed me to this point either. I just don't have the energy to get up anymore nor do I have the patience for life to miraculously change like every inspirational YouTube video claims lol
It's just been harder for me to force myself through each day, it's getting to the point that the effort to breath feels like too much. 
I don't really want to die though, I really really really want a happy perfect life. I want a wife that loves me and kids and I want a job and I want to go to college and I want to get my driver's liscence! But they're no longer motivating me to keep going. 
I don't know if this will help, if having strangers copy paste loving messages to me will actually make me feel better. I don't think it will.
But I don't think I can go through without it unless i exhausted all options right?
I guess it'd be safe to say that you should be able to listen to the news about Louisville Kentucky and hear about me in about I'd say a day. Ill have overdosed on the pills in my medicine cabinet. 

I'm sorry if anyone is disappointed, I really did try my best. Don't be mad at me
