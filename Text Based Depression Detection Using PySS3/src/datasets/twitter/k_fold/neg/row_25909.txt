Notes?I've been contemplating suicide for five years and have been certain it's what I want for at least a year. I plan on doing it very soon. I just don't know how to say bye to the ones I love. At first I wasn't going to at all but now I feel like because I've been planning it for so long and because they all know it's coming I kind of owe it to them in a way. I obviously can't say it outright because I'll wind myself up in the hospital. Notes seem so hard. I don't know.
