I really want to end my life, but I donâ€™t want to break my momâ€™s heartAt this point in my life, Iâ€™ve been depressed for a very long time. I just canâ€™t take it anymore and I want to go out so I will no longer endure this pain. I just really want to die but I donâ€™t want to break my motherâ€™s heart. She loves me dearly and I would hate to make her cry.
