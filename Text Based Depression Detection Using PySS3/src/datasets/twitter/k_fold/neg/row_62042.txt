Stuck in a cage.Been suicidal for a week. Distractions help but when I go to bed I lie there thinking about what would happen if I just stab myself in the chest laying to my significant other. Would he think that he should've saw the signs? That my arms are always cut but I just wear long sleeves? 

When I get to these points, my thoughts overwhelm me and eventually all my feelings pour out. My mind goes at 100 miles per minute. And I can't stop them. Cutting stops them. Then all I can feel is pain. But its a good pain. Its a blessing to feel my arms sting and pulse. 

My family says I cry wolf all the time. One day, I will prove to them that I am not crying wolf. That my arms will be bloody and I will go cold. My significant other says that he wants to admit me to the hospital. For what? Them to babysit me till someone else needs a bed? The doctors and therapists only care about my health so they can get rid of me quicker. 

Therapy rarely works when you have factors like no money, no job, no car or house, no groceries, no friends, no love. Pills only stop the voices for a short amount of time. 

Someone end me already. Please..
