Iâ€™m so close to just doing iteveryday Iâ€™ve been depressed and instead of comforting me and telling me positive things everyone just tells me I need to stop crying about everything and tell me everything Iâ€™m doing wrong. I canâ€™t fucking take it anymore I canâ€™t fucking do anything right and Iâ€™m sick of being me I really canâ€™t take it I just want to rip my face apart everytime I look in the mirror because Iâ€™m just an ugly worthless fuck up. Nobody could fucking love me or be attracted to me. Thatâ€™s why even my bf has been distant and only looking at ig models and twitch thots. I donâ€™t hate them for it, they didnâ€™t do any wrong. It just hurts me so bad deep inside that Th acts what he prefers. Iâ€™ve seen what he goes for and Iâ€™m not his type. Iâ€™m not fucking worth shit to anybody and Iâ€™m not thick enough to be pretty and my nose is too fucking big. Iâ€™m just gonna steak my stepdads fun and blow my fucking brains out, maybe then someone will understand ITS NOT AS EASY AS JUST FUCKING STOPPING IT AND BEING HAPPY. THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF MENTALI LLNESS ITS IRRATIONAL AND THE WAY YOUR BRAIN IS FUCKING WIRED. THERES NO CURE FOR ME OTHER THAN THIS FUCKING BULLET IM GONNA PAINT THE WOODS WITH. I physically canâ€™t be happy, I donâ€™t laugh or smile genuinely anymore itâ€™s all fake, the only time I get adrenaline rush is when Iâ€™m driving fast or when I think of killing myself. Life isnâ€™t worth shit to me anymore because Iâ€™m not worth it. Iâ€™d be so much happier dead but at the same time Iâ€™m so so fucking scared to do it. What if I feel that pain forever? What if I actually survived? Then what? Mental hospital and inpatient care? Iâ€™d literally rather fucking die. Iâ€™ve seen people get treated so badly at those places and itâ€™s because the workers donâ€™t gaf. if a doctor canâ€™t help me gain weight, or be happy with myself or give me plastic surgery or cure my depression Iâ€™m just gonna kill myself because living in this fucking nightmare of being too ugly is the worst. Itâ€™s sounds so vain and dumb but it really eats and eats away at your thoughts and confidence and eventually your will to live (in my experience). why canâ€™t I just fucking be pretty WHY IS THAT SO FUCKING HARD WHY CANT I BE CONSIDERED BEAUTIFUL IS IT BECAUSE MY ASS IS TOO BONEY OR MY TITS ARE TOO FLAT? MY NOSE TO BIG AND TEETH TOO CROOKED? Iâ€™ve seen women with these features but the way they all form them always ends up beautifully except for me. Everything on me looks out of place and I feel like a Picasso painting. Life isnâ€™t worth it being an ugly.
