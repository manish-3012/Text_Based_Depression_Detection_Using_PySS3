Suicidal Iguana seems like a more fitting username nowHello everybody,

Iâ€™ve always tried to remain optimistic, but all the negative aspects of my life have built up to the point where I desperately want to take my life. My parents are always bickering these days. Iâ€™m constantly under pressure to do well in schools and on the SAT, and if I donâ€™t do perfect on these things my dad yells at me or tells me Iâ€™m useless. Every day at school, I get bullied and yelled at during gym by my classmates for sucking athletically and making them lose. My parents donâ€™t let me date and so I always have to make up excuses with girls about why I canâ€™t talk to them. Iâ€™ve lost interest in every possible career option and I donâ€™t see myself ever being happy with any job I take. Perhaps my problems seem trivial. I hope I donâ€™t come across as insensitive, but I just want some advice or someone to talk to before I take my own life.

Please.
