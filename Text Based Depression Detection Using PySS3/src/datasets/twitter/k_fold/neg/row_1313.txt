i dont see myself surviving in this worldi dont want to bore you with the details of my life, so ill try to quickly explain my situation and my current fears. i have a tendency to talk somewhat cryptically but im going to try really hard to stay focused. please bear with me!

ive struggled with depression and social anxiety all my life. i am 26 years old and i live with my parents, and am currently unemployed, although i have worked in the past. i recently applied and was accepted to college. the plan currently stands that i am going to rent a very small apartment with my friend. this would be the first time i have lived away from home

i dont have a lot of money and i heard through a mutual friend that my future roomate is worried i wont be able to afford the rent due to my work history. this is a valid concern, seeing as all the jobs i have had i have quit (3)

the thing that terrifies me is that all of the jobs that i have experience in make me absolutely miserable, and the prospect of working a job AND attending classes at college seems as if it would break me

i dont know if the financial aid i will be granted will be enough. i dont know if i am making the right choice in even going to college. i dont know if moving in with my friend will be a mistake. i dont know how i am going to survive if the only jobs that people will hire me for make me suicidal

im just scared. im trying to be brave. i know im 26 and an 'adult' but i feel so far behind everyone else. life isnt a race and i try not to compare myself to others, but still. there are so many people around me who make me feel like a failure because im not employed or think say im lazy

i just find it hard to imagine a realistic future for myself. im sorry if my problems seem trivial. i guess i dont really know anything

i never asked to be born but everyone acts as if i owe them something
