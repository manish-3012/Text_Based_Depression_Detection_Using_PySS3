I'm tired of trying, I'm ready to just give up.I've been muddling on like this for so long, just pretending like I'll ever be able to pick up the pieces. I think it's just too late for me, we're at the end of the line and it's just time for me to get off this train. I just want to sleep, just call it quits and stop treading water. No one's coming to save me and I can't save myself, I'm only delaying the inevitable.
