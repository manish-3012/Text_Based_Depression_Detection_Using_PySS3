I was contemplating suicide this morning. Found out later today that one of my family members attempted to kill them selves last night.I've been having a rough few years and every time I think I'm getting close to something good in my life it gets kicked out from under me. The past few days have been especially bad. I slept about 3 hours last night and woke up at 2am. I went for a drive and was contemplating suicide (not then but at a later time). I decided to go into work like normal but a few hours into work I found out that one of my immediate family members tried to OD on meds last night. Luckily they survived but it seemed so weird that I would be having those thoughts at the same time. I don't feel suicidal right now I just feel really weird about the whole situation. I just needed to write this because I can't really talk to anyone else about it.
