Does anyone ever completely stop feeling suicidal?I've wanted to die for almost 9 years or so, and even though I've been too afraid of the risks of a failed attempt to try too often, and though I sometimes don't think about suicide for long periods of time, at any point of time in the last 9 years if I were ever given an opportunity of an easy, guaranteed death, I would be 100% okay with it. Have any of you managed to fully get over this and have started to actually want to live? Or is this like a permanent thing
