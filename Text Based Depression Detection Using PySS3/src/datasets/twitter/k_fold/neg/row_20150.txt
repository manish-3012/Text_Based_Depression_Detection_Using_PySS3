On getting admitted to hospitalI live in the UK, not sure whether it's the same elsewhere, but there's something I don't quite get about the system. As far as I understand it, the only way of getting immediate help i.e. hospital, failing an actual suicide attempt, is show up to the doctor and say "I am going to kill myself today/tomorrow by doing [method]". Otherwise, from my experience, it's pretty much hmm here's a slight med adjustment see how you feel come back in a month. Whilst I appreciate there simply isn't enough space in hospitals, I also don't really understand how the scenario above could ever occur. Surely if you'd made the decision, you wouldn't make a doctor's appointment on the day to tell them? Has anyone here had experience of being in that situation?
