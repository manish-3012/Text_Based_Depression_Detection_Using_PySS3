Got illegally arrested by cops after getting super pissed after being stopped for no reason. Felt pretty suicidal and got sent to mental hospital. Lost job and insurance so talked way out of mental hospital. Feeling suicidal now and am thinking need to do it this timeSo was already on edge prior to cop b.s. but the whole situation pushed me a bit too far. I landed in a mental hospital for 9 days and then talked my way out cause I don't know how I will afford it. Cop arrested me after I freaked out when he stopped me when I was just walking by. He decided to stop me cause I apparently live in a "high crime area" and I pretty much went off on him since he had no right to stop me. Lost my job and feel like I'm going insane from boredom. Got sent to mental hospital by cops, but got stuck with the tab. Now I have no job, owe $3000, can't afford a lawyer, and am too tired to try anymore. Not sure what to do, cause didn't really get the help I needed but can't seem to figure out how to pay for the hospital without destroying my finances. Actually following through this time is starting to seem like a very good idea since the hospital pretty much made me realize I am going to be alone and miserable for the rest of my life. not sure what to do......
