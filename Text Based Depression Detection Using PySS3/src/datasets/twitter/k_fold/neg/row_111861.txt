ECT was my last resort...now what?Last year, I experienced some traumatic events that pushed my lifelong depression into rock bottom. I decided to get ECT when the intensity of my PTSD died down instead of choosing to end my life (I didn't want to hurt my husband). Since February, I've received many rounds of ECT, was put on many psychiatric medications, and I've been going through tons of therapy. 
I still have PTSD symptoms, even though it's been a year since the trauma. The worst of it is the insomnia. During the trauma (it lasted over a month), I got very little sleep. I would sleep for a couple hours a night, and I got no sleep during the last week. Now, I'm unable to sleep without the aid of sedatives. I get nightmares when I do sleep. My psychiatrist has offered me anything and everything to help, but pills are not a replacement for life. I vomit all of the time, I'm lethargic, I'm unable to stay healthy no matter how healthy I try to be...and I try very hard.
I've come to the conclusion that suicide is the only logical solution for myself and my husband...who is completely drained from my depression. I realize that my being alive is hurting him as much as it's hurting me. 

I'm willing to try anything. What options do I have to help my mental illness when I've tried everything already?
