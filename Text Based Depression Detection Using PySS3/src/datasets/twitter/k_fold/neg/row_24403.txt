The fucking demons are back...Idk what to do anymore... 

My life just seems pointless. Like all I do is exist and somehow, by having done nothing at all, Iâ€™ve pissed off everyone to the point where it doesnâ€™t matter what I do, I wonâ€™t be cared about or missed. 

Today, the demons returned, telling me that Iâ€™d be better off dead and that Iâ€™d only be doing the world a favor. That once Iâ€™m gone the worlds issues would be solved, and nobody would notice my death. Iâ€™d be lucky if I just got thrown into the river by my town. Iâ€™m sure that none of my â€˜friendsâ€™ or my family would care

Cutting is worthless. It doesnâ€™t help. Theyâ€™re past that anyway. They say that as long as I live, Iâ€™m nothing but a burden and even in death that by change. I really just want to find a way to kill myself


Just to end this constant loop of suffering
