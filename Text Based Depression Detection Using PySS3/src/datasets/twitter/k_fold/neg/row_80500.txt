Today (June 6) was my 18th birthdayI didn't do anything.  I have posted here before but I'm using a throwaway.

I've talked about my shitty childhood, how I was forced to abandon all my friends at an early age by my mother, go to a school where I was bullied, for three years alone, spent every single day waking up,  going to school, hating myself for never standing up for myself, then coming home and laying in bed all day.  I talked about the time where I was holding my dad's cancer meds, ready to overdose when I decided I had to make the change myself.  I talked about the transition and the literal pain I went through to make a friend, and then how my mother, now diagnosed with bipolar disorder, called him, threatened him, lied to his parents, and embarrassed me, and how he consequentially abandoned me and told all his friends, making it difficult to make friends again.  I was 'that sheltered kid whose mom called all his friends and freaked out'.  Now I'm 18, I've had no friends for the last 4 years, every time I made them I quickly lost them because of my mother.  I don't really do anything, I sort of just lay in bed, my parents know but try to ignore me and they're probably going to kick me out soon because now they can.  I've still got the cancer meds and I'm thinking the only way I can send a message, or get revenge or something, would be suicide.  I don't really see the point of going on, I'm too damaged to make friends, I haven't even tried in the last year because I know how it ends all too well, stinging, cringey embarrassment.  I haven't really had a childhood or a life in general and if I'm alone there's no way I'll make it anywhere, I don't have any connections, friends, family, once I'm gone, I really have no where to go, but where I am is just as bad.
