Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for a few years. I think Iâ€™m at the end.Iâ€™ve always been quiet and kinda a loner since I can remember. I had friends in high school but we werenâ€™t really close. I think they stuck around out of just being nice people who didnâ€™t want to exclude the weirdo.
Iâ€™ve had one serious relationship that ended because of infidelity(not mine). Just want to add that these suicidal thoughts donâ€™t stem from that experience, didnâ€™t help but itâ€™s not the root cause.
I have family but weâ€™re not really close. The most important people in my life are my nieces and nephew, theyâ€™re all still young so they shouldnâ€™t know what happened and will be able forget me. The eldest might remember a little but heâ€™s tough.
I was waiting until my parents died because I couldnâ€™t do that to them but itâ€™s gotten worse. I was always able to hide but I find myself crying during the day and just staring at a wall. Itâ€™s like a blank page covered in fog. 
I donâ€™t know if I believe in an afterlife but even if I do end up in whatever hell is I know I deserve it.
I tried getting healthy and working out. Now Iâ€™m just as depressed but slightly jacked. 
I think Iâ€™m at the end.
