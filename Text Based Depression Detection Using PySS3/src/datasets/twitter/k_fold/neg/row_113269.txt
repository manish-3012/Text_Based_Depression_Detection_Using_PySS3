Vicious mood swings, I've become so sensitive. I guess I just need some input.I have been getting better, I think. Really, it's not so much that I get the thoughts, I don't feel like I do like I have before. But right now I feel terrible. 

Earlier in the day, I got the slightest hint of that "rush of happiness" I've been missing for so long. It made me hopeful. I really did feel better because I talked to my dad and told him about panic attacks I'd get since he saw me get one twice in a day. He is a smart guy so when I told him i thought they were due to a traumatic event that occurred in April he  didn't solve the problem or anything but hearing him speak about the problem and kind of define in clear terms I hadn't considered really helped, I haven't panicked since then I feel because I know more about why it was happening, and the panic attacks seem to be what triggered the thoughts. This is all pretty much to say, I was on the up in a great way. I started exercising and eating better. Not manic, but naturally happier. 

But ever since the thoughts I've become more sensitive to the thought of suicide, when it is brought up I guess. I know that me noticing it more is confirmation bias, and not that it is their fault or it should be censored, but they way people address it kinda gets to me. Every armchair intellectual speaks to how noble suicide is, and there's this undertone I sometimes pick up on that it is inevitable for some people. It just gets to me, especially since one of the hardest parts of my thoughts have been the idea that they are inevitable, that I can't avoid it. When I read or think these things, though I don't think suicide is noble, it puts me in a mood I am uncomfortable with. It's hard to say, maybe it just makes me sad and upset since I don't really feel suicidal during them but they make me think I haven't really gotten better, and just generally pessimistic. These things affect me so much I think because of how traumatic the thoughts were, and what set me off right now is that I was reading about how roof access isn't allowed from some place I was looking at living, and I thought to myself, "I may jump from a roof, or through a window." It wasn't planning, I really want to get over this, I have never wanted to die, my suicidal thoughts aren't about escaping from pain but really just feeling hopeless about everything. I guess it made me scared that I would become uncontrollable or unstoppably suicidal, and not as reasonable as I am right now.

-doing better mostly
-I can get bad moods that put me in a bad state of mind usually when suicide is mentioned.
-scared I will become uncontrollably suicidal at one point, that I am "destined" to kill myself (Not exactly but it kind of sums up a fear).

Thanks.
