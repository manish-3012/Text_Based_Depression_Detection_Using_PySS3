Iâ€™m over itIâ€™ve been really depressed since I was 15, hospitalized once around then, and then medicated ever since. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist and was trying to set myself up for therapy and had a job. But then my mom and I got into a huge fight and I ended up moving out and back to the apartment I rent (I was only staying at my moms for some comfort and support). Now I donâ€™t have a job and am in debt and I donâ€™t know how to re-enroll back into college because I took this semester off. It feels like I have no one. If it werenâ€™t for my cat I wouldâ€™ve killed myself as soon as I got to my apartment. But I donâ€™t know what to do with my cat. And also I donâ€™t want to traumatize my landlord if he happens to come here and find me. I have citizenship in Italy and am thinking about just going there and starting over and not taking my phone or car or ever contacting anyone from the US again. Is it hard to be homeless in Italy? I have very little money
