There's nothing stopping me anymoreEvery single day I wake up, and I ask "what for?". "Why should I get up?". In this world I have absolutely nothing and no one. I have no friends, no close relatives, and the family that I stayed alive for up until now, does not want me anymore. My depression started when I went to college. My parents have pressured me to succeed all my life, I'm their trophy child. But it didn't go well in college. I failed courses, I switched majors, I isolated myself, I was lost. My parents continued to work for my education, and I tried my hardest to fight through the depression. They expected me to do great things, and have a well paying job by now (I'm 23). All I have at this point is another year left in a major that will lead to nothing substantial and no prospects of graduate school. I failed. I wasn't able to accomplish the things I set out to do. Now my parents are angry and sick of me. They want me gone. But I'm dependent on them still. But back to the question of purpose. I stopped from harming myself in the past because I knew how badly it would affect my parents. Now that I've learned that I was nothing but a commodity to them, and how much they care for me depends on my performance, I no longer care for them the same way I did. Their anger and resentment don't allow me to care the way I did. Now I have nothing stopping me from suicide. I have no purpose left here in this world. I wanted to leave many years ago, but there was still meaning to my life because of family. Now there isn't. Now there is nothing stopping me. I can finally leave. Why am I typing this? I have no clue. Maybe I'm just venting. Maybe I just need someone to read this. I'm very thankful if you did.
