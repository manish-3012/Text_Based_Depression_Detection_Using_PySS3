I'm [26] always tired and sad? Even more so nowadays.I'm so tired.. both mentally and physically. I'm always heartbroken, unsatisfied and upset with myself.  Quarantine isn't helping either.. it's making me realize how monotonous my life is and that there's nothing to look forward to each day.

I'm losing motivation to play my favorite games, work, talk with friends, and even cook (which is usually my favorite thing to do). I want to cry every single day, I want to sleep all the time. I'm lost..

It's really hard to stay positive when everything around you seems to be calling apart. 

I'm just so unhappy with everything and everyday is me closer to wanting to end it all. I'm not looking for attention, I just wanted to share my thoughts.
