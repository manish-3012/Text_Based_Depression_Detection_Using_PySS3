6am VentHey so idk itâ€™s 6am and I have horrible depression anxiety and insomnia this will be long and rambly Iâ€™ve honestly just been so damn low lately but itâ€™s so weird because Iâ€™m in one of the happiest positions Iâ€™ve ever been in in my life Iâ€™ve got a good relationship Iâ€™m living with my partner and finally away from my old toxic house hold but Iâ€™ve been so stuck in my head honestly Iâ€™m getting so bad my ideations both homicidal and suicidal are coming back doing the dishes is scary cause Iâ€™m doing them one minute then the next Iâ€™m getting these vivid ass visions where Iâ€™m just cutting the shit out of my wrists with it.. my girlfriend comes out of a toxic 10 year relationship and Iâ€™m trying my best but tbh I never really cared about much before but all of a sudden because of her itâ€™s like damn I need to care about her and other things and I do but itâ€™s hard because as sheâ€™s dealing with her baggage Iâ€™m dealing with mine I was cheated on and sheâ€™s done some stuff my ex did and itâ€™s given me anxiety because it would suck if she hurt me like that sheâ€™s reassured me as I need it but the way my mind is itâ€™s all screwed up and a futile effort because I always over think and I feel like Iâ€™m a bit much because sheâ€™s told me she wouldnâ€™t cheat on me and I do believe her but I canâ€™t help but think maybe she will or sheâ€™ll get tired of me or idk I donâ€™t have a good view of myself never really have tbh i feel like she deserves so much more I feel like a piece of shit because I have spinal stenosis and itâ€™s chronic pain is horrible sometimes itâ€™s so bad where I canâ€™t even move Iâ€™m literally paralyzed and this has put more stress on us because sheâ€™s wanted to go out and take pictures go to meow wolf do things etc but the sad reality is that I canâ€™t itâ€™s hard to even go to the bathroom without being out of breath and having pain the bathroom isnâ€™t far either and I canâ€™t work because of this that brings us to the ex again at least with him she knew she was gonna be good money is a constant struggle Iâ€™m usually in the negative but he was going to school getting degrees Iâ€™ve dropped out canâ€™t get work canâ€™t move much without pain she seems to be pulling away a bit too and itâ€™s making me over compensate by saying I love her a lot and I feel like I may be smothering her cause my anxiety on why sheâ€™s pulling away she doesnâ€™t say I love you after we kiss and go to bed I have to start most interactions we used to be really sexual and gitty about stuff but now if I touch her or anything she giggles and pulls herself away so I donâ€™t do anything anymore sheâ€™s stopped wearing the ring I got her almost exclusivley now and just many more things even little things all just stack up in the end and it all just makes me feel like the biggest pos ever thatâ€™s not worthy of her Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m trying...
