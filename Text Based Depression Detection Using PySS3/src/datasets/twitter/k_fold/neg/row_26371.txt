Does anyone just get... Bored?I have been suicidal for a few years now and it seems as though I may be losing the only hope of living very shortly. To be honest... If it wasn't for this one thing that keeps me happy I would have no reason to live. I find myself just... Laying on my couch thinking.. What is the point really. I can't bring myself to do anything, I haven't been able to eat so now I have dropped under 100 pounds... There is just.. Nothing I want to do. A good chunk of my thoughts are just constantly thinking that I just straight up don't want to be alive... I feel like I am dying slowly on the inside and that my actual death would just... Lift all of that from me. Ever since I was a teenager I have had this ghost haunting me. There is much more than this feeling that makes me want to end it all... But I thought I should ask you guys if you ever feel the same because at least then you may be able to relate.
