I want to die but I cantI should have done it when I was a kid. I knew my outcome would be bad when I was very little. People hurt me. People failed to protect me. It only gets worse the more I prolong it. I'll hurt a lot of people. I'll fucking ruin their lives. Nothing is fun anymore. I look forward to nothing. I hurt the woman I loved. I keep making things worse. I know it will be bad if I die but how many more awful things will happen if I don't? My kids will be fucked up if I do. That's what I tell myself. I can't stop thinking about it. Every object I look at i think of how i could kill myself with it. If I'm next to something sharp I think about plunging it into my neck. I truly hate myself. I want punishment. I want someone to beat the shit out of me. I smoke cigarettes and fantasize about getting cancer. I'm so fucked up.
