I am going to kill myself tomorrow from being tormented by hallucinations and isolationI have been snowed in in a cabin for days and when it was not snowed in I was and still am in complete isolation. I moved out here to the woods thinking it would be a blessing for my job as a lumber worker so I wouldn't have to drive out here from the city for work. Bad mistake. This isolation has made me completely lose my mind.

Im hearing and seeing things, seeing people and shadow figures that aren't there, seeing faces on everything, hearing loud knocking and banging on my door and windows and I can't take it. I need to get away but the mountain roads are rough and I can't drive on them.

I can't take it, I need to escape this hell so tomorrow I plan on shooting myself. Goodbye. I can't take it anymore. I am tormented and damned
