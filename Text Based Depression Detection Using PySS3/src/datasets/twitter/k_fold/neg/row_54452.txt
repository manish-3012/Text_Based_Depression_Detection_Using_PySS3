I keep hearing "It will get better.."........but When?i'm ready to go. i keep reading through posts on here and one of the most common suggestions is to just hold out, it gets better. its only getting worse for me. i don't understand how it just "gets better"... am i going to magically wake up with self confidence and no anxiety? i turned 27 four months ago and i wanted to kill myself. i told myself to wait til im 29 to kill myself. maybe ill be ok by then, maybe ill have figured out a few ways to find happiness and self worth. i don't want to live painfully the rest of my time waiting for it to get better. i feel like i could save myself alot of pain and misery and just go peacefully on my terms. lately i don't want to wait two more years. i went from thinking about suicide to crying all night 2-3 times a week posting on here. i don't want to die i just don't want to exist.
