I'm so fucking doneAll of it. Everything. I can't stand it anymore. Ive been talking myself down from doing it but I'm running out of reasons. I've had a shit life and all ive done is fuck up one thing after the other. Nobody will be home for awhile, I think. I have time. 

I'm so tired of my parent's abuse, their manipulation, their incessant need to make sure I feel like shit. I'm so fucking tired of it. If I leave, they'll just call me a coward. They have everyone on their side, everyone against me. Because i, what, stood up for myself? It's bullshit. I'm so tired of being afraid to exist. Afraid to do anything. They make sure that I'm afraid to leave my room, even if they're not here. I just don't want to exist anymore. I'm so tired of this.

I'm not trying to "prove" something by killing myself, I just want to be fucking dead. If I survive they'll twist this like I'm just a fucking idiot, but they're angels from heaven here to saaaaave me. As if they arent the ones I want to get away from so badly I'll roll the dice on the afterlife.
