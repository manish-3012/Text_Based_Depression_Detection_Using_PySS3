Iâ€™m in a bad place and have no one to talk to.Short story is Iâ€™m married to a narcissist. We have a daughter whoâ€™s almost 3. As Iâ€™ve slowly realized that Iâ€™m not crazy and itâ€™s just her narcissistic abuse thatâ€™s making me think Iâ€™m crazy, Iâ€™ve been handling things a lot better the last few years. I havenâ€™t had these thoughts in a long time. Problem is when I envision a future without my wife, it is something that doesnâ€™t make me very sad. But when I envision a future where I donâ€™t see my daughter everyday, I fall apart. I love that little girl so much. Iâ€™ve endured the last 3 years of abuse so I can have an active role in her life. Today my wife started in with the same bullshit she always does and Iâ€™m snapping. If it wasnâ€™t for my daughter, I would check out today. But even taking her into consideration, Iâ€™m still having thoughts. I donâ€™t like how this feels and donâ€™t want to feel this way but I feel trapped. Thanks for reading.
