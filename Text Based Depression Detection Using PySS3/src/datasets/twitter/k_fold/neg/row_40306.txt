the world/ppl only cares about what you can give themi been on this planet for 35yrs. one thing i learned, ppl only care if u have something to give them. I'm so tired of this, i wish i wasn't born this way. i just don't care about being productive and doing what im told. i just wanna connect with ppl, it's all i want but i can't connect with anyone. it's awful, i feel trapped inside my head. 

what the hell are u suppose to do if u wanna connect with ppl but nobody wants to connect with u? there's no point of living like this
