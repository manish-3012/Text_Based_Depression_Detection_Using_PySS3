I love my dog so muchHe's been abandoned by a bunch of people, so I.don't want to do that to him.

Trying to chill bc I remember being happy, sometimes. But economically, I just got my PhD, and there is still no path forward.

I'm hungry. I'm getting horrifically screwed over by my bosses. 

They are rewarding themselves for it.

Tired of exhausting myself for people who don't deserve it. And competing against people whose advantages (like, some people have parents?) give them access I to things I am never going to have.

I've fought, hard, all my life.

Idk why.

I thought there might be something to reach. Inside people? But it's really just shallow greed and ego, everywhere.

But, I love my dog so much. Trying to hang-in for him.
