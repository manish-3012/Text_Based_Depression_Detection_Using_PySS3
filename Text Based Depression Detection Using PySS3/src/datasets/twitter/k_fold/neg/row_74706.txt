The infection is spreading.Recently, I came with terms to the psychotic side of my depression. The first thing I ever hallucinated was a policeman yelling at me to get on the ground, the second was a pair of dislocated inky hands that choked me around the neck. 
Now, the main thing I see is parasites crawling under my skin, making it bulge and cause bruises as they eat their way through my veins. Usually I'd want this sort of thing to stop, but I'm beyond caring.
The maggots -said parasites- seem particularly fond of my throat and making it itch. It hurts. I hope they make me scratch my throat out so I just die.
