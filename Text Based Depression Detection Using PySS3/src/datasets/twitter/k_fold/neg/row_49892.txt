I wish I had killed myself 5 years agoI know people like to call themselves failures and most of the time it's their self-hatred talking. But in this case that's not really the whole story. I was so depressed at 16 I had to be put in an institution, I flunked the 10th grade and was kicked out of school. 
I decided to enroll in a highschool for grownups, and what follows is 4 years of flunking the grade over and over again. I'm 21, and currently in the 11th grade.
But I'm already fucking up. I can't go to school because I'm do scared of flunking, but I keep flunking cuz I don't go to school.
My family, my friends they all have faith in me. They all support me, despite me failing so many times already.
I hate myself, because despite knowing the issue and knowing exactly how to solve the situation, I can't.
I keep finding myself rewinding and thinking of what my life would have been like If I hadn't failed.
All of my friends are in college or studying to be specialists. I feel left behind, I feel like a total loser.

I despise my family for the way they handled my depression and anxiety when I was a teen. 

I'll never be anything or anyone noteworthy. I'll just keep failing til people lose faith. The way I see it, I'm dying already, just much slower than I'd like. I want to give up already but I can't.

I wish I had killed myself when I was 16 because if I did it now the damage to the people around me would be too severe. I have no right to be like this. I have a family that loves me, good friends and a job that I like.

Despite all that, I'm still that same 16 year old who was terrified of going to school and being invisible.
Things around me may change, but I never will, I'll always stay as pathetic as I am.

Thank you for reading, I'm sorry to waste your time.
