SelfishI hate when people tell me what about the people you love? Don't you think of them?. 

Of course. But I'm in the mind set of it'll be my problem no longer once I'm gone. I mean honestly, why would I care if I'm gone. I have no feelings. No life. The world will continue without me. Like it does when someone dies. It doesn't stop. 

Another thing that makes me upset is telling me I'm selfish. For trying to kill myself. But what's more selfish? Me trying to escape and putting that on the people who love me? Or having those people make me go through torment for their happiness? I just want to go away and die. I hate it here. 

One last thing. I lost my faith. In everything. I was a Christian. God doesn't communicate with me no matter if I pray day in and out. I use to feel him. Now I think maybe I was tricking my brain. If He loves us. If he knows everything, future and all. Why make a person who at the end will be sent to hell because they broke a rule that he could've stopped? Or prevented it by not bringing them into this world. I feel that's really cruel, if there is a being out there.
