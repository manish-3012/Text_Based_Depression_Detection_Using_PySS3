i am tired of livingi donâ€™t think i can do this anymore. 
i wish i wasnâ€™t scared to die because iâ€™m tired of waking up each day and feeling like this. i feel like thereâ€™s no point. iâ€™m so self-destructive, i ruin good relationships with good people. i donâ€™t have anything good going for me anymore and i donâ€™t want to live. i canâ€™t. i have struggled with mental illness for 6 years and i am only 18. i can barely get out of bed in the morning anymore and frequently donâ€™t make it to class. 

why canâ€™t i just have the courage to end this
