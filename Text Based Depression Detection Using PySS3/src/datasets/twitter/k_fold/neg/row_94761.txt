I'm such a useless failure that I became a father with a woman I don't love. Killing myself is the only solution.My life is a failure. I can't see a hope of it ever changing either; I'm too deep in the shit. 

I had a child with someone I shouldn't have, I wasted my intelligence (booksmart rather than emotionally smart as evidenced by having a kid with the wrong person at the wrong time). I earn utterly shit money compared to the people I was in university with ($20k per year vs ~$70k).

My 30th birthday is coming up soon and I'm nowhere in life. I'm still living at home with the partner I don't love and my kid and my dysfunctional parents (who don't love each other) because who the hell can afford property or even rent on $20k per year. 

I have no real interest in trying a different career either because I don't like people, and every job that pays well involves people and meetings and offices and presentations. I'm not cut out for any of it.

The fact my mother doesn't love my father is only catching up with me lately because I'm starting to look deep within for things that explain why I'm such a useless person. I still remember her saying when I was 10 that she married the first man she met. They are somehow still together.

I could scream with how much I hate who I am. I have started to see killing myself as the only decent thing I could do.

I can't even end the relationship with my partner because she'd get the first flight back to her country, 14 hours away from me. If I dump her, I don't get to see my daughter grow up. Committing suicide seems the only reasonable solution that benefits everyone.
