How do I get the courage to commit suicide?How do I get past my own body protecting me and keeping me alive? I have nobody to talk to, no job skills, and no highschool diploma. I am disabled but I cannot even get disability. 

I want to commit suicide, I have wanted to for a long time. I have nobody to tlak to and the doctors here will never provide adequate help. ow do I push myself past that point?
