There is so much in my head I can't shut it upWhy am I posting this. No one gives a shit. I'm a fuckup. I don't have any goals or ambitions. Haven't had that kind of hope for some time now. I'm just cold. I've given up.

Every day I try to think of a way to get hold of some heavier drugs so that I can truly escape my own mind and feel really good at least once before I die. I've given up anyway, why not live a little, some pleasure before the forever rest. Legal shit won't do though. I've tried it all. Caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, self harm, "sugar highs", huffing anything with chemicals in it, sucking on a fucking can of whipcream cause the gas inside makes you lightheaded. Yes I'm stupid. Probably stupider after all that too, how many braincells wasted.

But all it does is create addiction, building up the tolerance, eventually just giving me additional pain instead of any relief. 

I was fucked up from the start, I've fucked myself up even more over the years. Was gonna graduate this year, I won't tho. Fucked that up. This was my second chance too, had to redo a whole year. Fucked it up. There is so much in my head but I can't escape from myself. I'm disgusting inside and out. I need to escape. I'm at the end of a rope. Just tell me I'm not alone at least
