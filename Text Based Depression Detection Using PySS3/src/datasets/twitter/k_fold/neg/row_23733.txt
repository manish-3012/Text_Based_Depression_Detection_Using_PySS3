I donâ€™t see myself living past 19iâ€™ve never pictured a future. whenever i try and figure out a my future, i just catch myself staring into nothingness. thereâ€™s absolutely nothing. i donâ€™t have a future. iâ€™m going to kill myself before 19. im trying to get help, it isnâ€™t working. i need something to scare me into living. I DO want a future. but i just hate my life so goddamn much. i have a deep hatred of my existence.
