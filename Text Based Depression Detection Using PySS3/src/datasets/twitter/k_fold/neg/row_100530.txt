I'm a bad personI deal with anger a lot. I eventually hurt everyone who I become close to. I recently made friends with a 2 girls and was the happiest I've ever been. Then in the time of her greatest need I failed her and made many mistakes and said the wrong things. She literally ran away from me. I haven't gotten the chance to apologize because she told me not to text her and that she needs space. Because I've wronged this one friend the other friend has developed a different view of me and we're not friends anymore either. I hurt the person with whom I shared more about myself than I have everyone in my life combined. To the point where there is no repairing the relationship, it's over. Then today I found out I need to leave right after I take my midterm tomorrow and go back home to watch my one of my dogs be euthanized, I love my dogs more than literally anything or anyone in the world. I hurt my friends, and they ran away. I have no purpose and no friends. I am broken and by far the lowest I've ever been.
