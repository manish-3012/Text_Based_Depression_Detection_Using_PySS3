I might die.I'm not depressed.

I've been dealing with a problem for so long that I can see very rationally that there's no way out from it. I've been thrashing against it for years now and I'm exhausted, defeated, hopeless, regretful, sad, and so upset. I can distract myself from it for a few days or a few weeks, but it's always there. I don't want to live in distraction.

This is so far from the life I loved. I'm so sad that I feel that I have to leave behind the people I love.

I have tried so many things.

If this happens, I want it to be clear that reckless medical professionals did this to me. This is no one else's fault.

I'm so sorry.
