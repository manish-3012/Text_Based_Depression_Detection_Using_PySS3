I feel like I've exhausted every optionCalled the crises line a couple of months ago and got assigned a case manager to oversee everything with weekly check-ins, weekly psych appointments, and a fucking psychiatrist who listened way better than all the ones I've ever had..

They transferred me because I guess it's only a temporary thing, so here I am left with a new psychiatrist who doesn't fucking listen, medication that doesn't fucking work and is making me worse, and I am over here so fucking close to just being done with life entirely. 

I'm breaking more and more and slowly losing every ounce of willpower I have left. They gave me resources that I've called and thanks to a waiting list I can't get in soon at all.

My grandfather died Christmas and I know I haven't processed that at all. Let alone barely able to manage to take care of myself at all. 

I need fucking help and I feel like I'm basically screaming to a void where my days are slowly getting worse and worse as I'm losing sleep and my ability to eat to even stay alive. I'm stuck reliving trauma over and over to insane amounts and it's probably from opening up trauma with a therapist and then moving and now I have no one to help me process this shit. 

I just can't do this anymore. Living is pure fucking misery right now. I hate this. I can't do this much longer with my own brain fucking overloading me with all this bullshit.
