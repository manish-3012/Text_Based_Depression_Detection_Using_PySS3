Im suicidal becuse of my gradesI like to see smile on my moms face when i tell her a good grade i got in school,but when i get a bad grade,i just dont know how to tell her,i always try to get out of conversation by telling her what happened today,my grades are not good but not bad,in subjects like math (physics,chemistry)i got D's,in other subjects like german i got D, in English A ,Serbian D ,Art A ,workout (idk name of that) A, Music C, Biology B,History C,Geography B.
Im not sure if i typed grades right, i was thinking it goes like
A-5
B-4
C-3
D-2
F-1
But no mether how much i study,my grades are always the same.
