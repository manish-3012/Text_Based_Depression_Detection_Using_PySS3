The Straw That Broke The Camel's Back...First of all, I'm done with judgement. IF YOU THINK THIS IS ATTENTION WHORING, GET THE FUCK AWAY AND **LEAVE ME ALONE.** I--- I've been here before. Not with this account, but numerous times. I'm... I'm done. I'm 14m (15 in mid december) and I give up. I already fucked up my grades in high school... I'm greedy... I'm a douchebag... I'm annoying... I don't even know how I managed to find a girlfriend. I love her more than anything, because she loves me back... You can call me a terrible person. I laugh at death. I have always found death intriguing, and I'm ready to experience it first hand. My parents are terrible to me... at least that is what I think. My peers judge me... my parents judge me... the only people that actually really understand me anymore are my big sister (28) and my girlfriend of seven months. I've never been diagnosed, but I'm pretty sure I've been depressed since elementary school. I just... I'm done with it. I just want to sleep... sleep forever... sleep through my life.

I just... I can't do this any longer. I can't endure this... I always fear about us... my generation... how we're all idiots... how I feel that only about 15% of us know what to do in a bad situation... I fear my future is black. I fear that we're going to fuck up. I'm afraid because of us.

I'm sorry. My brain is wandering and I am just typing what I think. Everything is a blur... I just want to end it. I figured very soon here I will do it. I will swallow all the pills in our house that I can find, slice my wrists, and then shoot myself in the head.

I just wish that I could go away. I've heard to live your childhood as long as possible, because adulthood sucks. My childhood sucks. I just want to be an adult... this sounds foolish and naive, but I just want to live with her. She's my life. I want to just... wake up and see her. She comforts me. She's the one reason why I don't want to take the plunge into the unknown. I have too much stress in my life. I just wish that I could just... let go. But that seems impossible at this point... The only way to escape the pain is to end it. I've self harmed once, and that was a cut with scissors on my left hand. It didn't hurt... it felt nice. It was an escape. I know there are other ways to cope, but I'm... done. My parents don't even know I'm depressed. The only people that know that are my girlfriend and my best bro from another mother, friends since we were children. I can't do anything. Please... somebody... help. I just... I can't do it anymore. I don't know what to do. I don't want pity posts... I want serious posts. Please, somebody, help me. I don't know where to turn or where to go anymore. My mind is blank, my body is numb, and my heart is dark. Soon I will meet with the end and part.
