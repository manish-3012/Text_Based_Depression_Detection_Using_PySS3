So it's time.Thank you for creating a space where scared people can write. I'm desperate for help but can't get it, and just turning off the lights feels like the safest thing to do. I have a big heart and love people so much ,but my time here is over.  

*Thank you to those of you who responded when I needed you most. A few days after writing this I got the help I needed and have support services helping me to rebuild my life. I've battled alcoholism for a long time, and now things are being taken care of. Thanks for being here. You guys that are hear to listen don't know just how incredible you are. That you each take time out of your days to look out for others gladdens my heart. Thank you :)
