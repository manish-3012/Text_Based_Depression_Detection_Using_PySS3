The end, it's near.I'm sitting here alone. You know, that *kind* of alone which just *eats away* at your soul? That kind where I just stare outside at the trees, nothing else, just thinking about the way out of this. It's a long story but basically we're moving soon to a different country but basically reality hit me hard and I don't know anyone there. *at all*. I hate my life and recently had alot of suicidal thoughts [I've dealt with bulling everyday, my parents splitting and basically verbal abuse when I was younger] and have been depressed since I was 10. I've always been that 'odd one out', never been able to fit into the crowd and I'm sick and tired of all this bullcrap and I just want it to go away. I'm sitting here in tears with a rope and chair, ready to leave this god forsaken world. 

See you on the other side folks.
