Reasons to live?I just wonder why I am still here.
 I have been Suicidal all my life, my first thought of Suicide came to me very early. 
It's not that I don't have friends, but I just  stay awake  in the Night and always think about Suicide as a way to enjoy eternal Silence like sleeping. Everything would go away.
And it's gotten worse I've been talking to some Girls in my class who also feel to much pressure and sometimes think about Suicide as an exit.
