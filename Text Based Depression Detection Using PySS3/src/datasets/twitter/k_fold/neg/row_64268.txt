only couple inches away from deathumm so here it goes I have a gun only couple inches away from me and I just want to do it. But I am deciding to maybe try one last time to get help. lets see why I want to die tonight and every other night. I failed basic training right after I left high school to join because of a shoulder injure but I still blame myself for it. Since I came back I been going to college but coronavirus happened and that all went bad. I gained so much weight about 40 pounds as I have got an addiction with food since being back and can't stop eating to the point of me just throwing up. I have no friends that I can connect with or have any friends at all. my gf broke up with me before I left for basic I think 2 hours before I was to leave so that was great. and haven't been able to talk or even have the courage to be with any girl since then. I keep thinking everyone is just going to betray me in the end. I tired to look up ways to die but most likely you end up in hospital fucked up for life. so gun might be the best way I thought. I always act happy in front of everyone or try to vibe with their energy but I just cry for hours when alone. I just want to shut the world off and be stoic or an introvert but then people start saying stop acting like that because you should be happy or its not normal but it's how I want to be. Sure most people are going through worse things in the world but I guess this is my limit which makes me weak I guess. I think the worst part is just seeing everyone happy with their friends or gf/bfand laughing and having fun. I been looking at that gun for about 3 weeks now thinking about doing it every night but then I saw post of people and seeing it helped them I thought I might try to. sorry about the long post. thank you for reading.
