Losing Hope EverydayMy mother is emotionally cold after being left 4 times in her life (twice of which while I have been alive.) I have moved schools/towns against my will for the past 3 years, yearly. I still miss my past love to death, whom I pushed away through selfish young actions at age 17. I turn 19 next month. I am about to begin University. But still, I am so empty. I have never had a father connect to me, I have never had a tender mother, I have lost many friends to the pace of life. I don't even want to question why it seems people love to let me disappear, because that is just more I can not (really none of us can)  solve. I have no true passions, and I rely largely on weed to patch my mood, which living in an illegal state, isn't always possible. I just want relief from the pain in my chest. I want direction, I want to give someone my energy, I want peace of mind, and I want redemption. I want to wake up everyday knowing what the fuck I am supposed to be doing in this life. But alas, all I see is a sunrise and a sunset. Superficial hoops that we must jump through on this journey, which simply determine how comfortably we rest our heads when the time comes. Shits bleak and I want to cease to exist. The only thing stopping me is my mother, as she's the only one left for me. I just need to hear something, maybe from those of you a bit further down the road than me. I've tried so hard to stay strong, but at this point I feel like I'm WAITING for myself to get worse, in hopes that one day I'll have the courage to send myself somewhere I'll find peace.
