My abusive, evil step-dad might cause me to kill myself.Iâ€™m a 17 year old girl. My dad killed himself when I was 14, and then my mom got married to this stupid fuck. He seemed fine at first, but heâ€™s the most evil man Iâ€™ve ever met. I hate him with all of my heart.

He clearly just married my mom because he thought we had money. With time, he became more and more verbally abusive towards her. Eventually, he beat her brutally in a hotel room, so now my mom is divorcing him. She was covered in bruises and her knee was fucked up. She said she didnâ€™t fight back, because she was certain he wouldâ€™ve killed her if she had. 

She filed a police report and a judge issued a warrant for his arrest almost two months ago. This happened in another county, so his county is supposed to arrest him and take him to the other one. The problem is, he lives in a small town and he is good friends with the sheriff, so they havenâ€™t arrested him yet. They served him an order of protection but DIDNT FUCKING ARREST HIM! He has an active warrant and they are supposed to arrest him whenever they see him. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of waiting for these crooked ass fucks to do their job. Itâ€™s clear theyâ€™re showing him preferential treatment because of his family name. 

To give you perspective, he counter filed an order of protection against my mom. In our county, it took them 1 day to serve it. It took his county 3 weeks and thatâ€™s only because my mom called them and told them she was scared for her life. They were supposed to arrest him as well but didnâ€™t.

Worst of all, heâ€™s actually accusing my mom of beating *him* up. How fucking pathetic. A 210 lb 6â€™3â€ man saying a 5â€™7â€ 140 lb woman could beat him up... what a dumbass. And itâ€™s funny because he would always brag about â€œnever losing a fightâ€ and what a badass he is. Heâ€™s probably bruising himself right now so he can have fake evidence against her. Thatâ€™s how crazy and evil he is. 

Multiple times he has groped my bottom and breasts, but I still havenâ€™t told anyone, because Iâ€™m too embarrassed and I couldnâ€™t handle having to testify due to my horrific anxiety. Itâ€™d kill my mom if she knew. Also, I know everyone will say Iâ€™m just making it up at this point to make him look bad. Fuck this. It made sense when I discovered he had gotten a DUI with 2 seventeen year olds in the car when he was 45. Heâ€™s just a predator. People like him donâ€™t even deserve to live. 

I just fucking hate everything. Iâ€™m done. Fuck my step dad. Fuck [redacted] Countyâ€™s Sheriff Office. Fuck everything.
