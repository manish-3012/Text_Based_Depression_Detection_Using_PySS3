Not "sad"? or w/eMy suicidal ideations and actions don't seem to match up with other people or what the countless social workers/ psychiatrists/ etc. ask me after the fact.

1. I don't want to die out of desperation or anything really. It's more, I feel done, almost content. I've done mostly everything I wanted, I don't really care to do anything else.

2. Whenever I "fail" at suicide, I'm not that bummed out, I'm just like, ok, I can keep living for a while. (b/c they're always like 'Do you still feel suicidal???' ... like, it doesn't work like that for me.)

3. I above all do not want to die. It scares me so much. But b/c I am eventually, I'd rather have some ownership over it.
