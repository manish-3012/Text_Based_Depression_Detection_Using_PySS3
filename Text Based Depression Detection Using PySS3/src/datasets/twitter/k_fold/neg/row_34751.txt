Can't see any hope for the futureRecently my life has fallen apart; i'm dropping out of uni because i hate my degree, i don't have much of a social life and although my family will probably be supportive i just feel overwhelmingly guilty for letting them and myself down. I'm not hopeful about my career prospects without a degree but at 21 years old i feel like the chance to achieve one has slipped through my fingers. I don't know whether i would commit suicide or not (due to the pain it would cause my family) but I just have this overwhelming longing not to exist; to never have been born. I've suffered with depression since i was a teenager and medication has no effect, so i really don't see any way for life to improve. I'm not really sure what i hope to accomplish by posting this; i guess i just need to vent. Also any guidance would appreciated if you've been in a similar position.
