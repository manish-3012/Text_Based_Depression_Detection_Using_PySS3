No other way outim being psychologically abused by my narcissistic parents and everyone ive turned to for help like police, cps, teachers, therapists, doctors, etc havent helped. i thought i could survive til im 18 but my doctor has said he thinks my parents should get conservatorship over me when im 18 because of my mental illnesses and because my parents claim i cant take care of myself and im a danger to myself. they fail to mention my self harm and suicidal feelings are cos of them. i would have no independence or control over my life. i cant keep going if i cant even look forward to being independent.
