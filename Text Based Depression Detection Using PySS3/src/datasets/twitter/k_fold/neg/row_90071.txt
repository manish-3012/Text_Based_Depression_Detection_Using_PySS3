Iâ€™m running out of things that are keeping me hereHello again! Iâ€™m so sorry if constantly posting here makes me look like an attention whore but this is how I really feel. Iâ€™m so scared and tired at the same time. I did more research recently and I found out that my chosen career isnâ€™t as good as I thought it was. Several years of planning going towards this career and it all falls apart. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I keep messing one of my classes as well and I think Iâ€™m actually going to fail tomorrow and get kicked out. 

Iâ€™ve been trying my best to reach out to people just to talk but I just get ghosted and I donâ€™t know why. I think Iâ€™m a bad person and I deserve this. I canâ€™t feel happy anymore. My career was almost the only reason why I chose to stay here but itâ€™s all a lie. This little world that I fabricated for myself so I wouldnâ€™t have to face the reality that Iâ€™m a failure has completely fallen apart. No one wants to help. I donâ€™t know what to do.
