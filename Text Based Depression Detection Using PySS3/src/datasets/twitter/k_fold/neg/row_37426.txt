I think I want to do it. Sorry for the misspellings Iâ€™m a fuckinh idiotEveryoneâ€™s hates me. My boyfriend keeps saying bc I broke rules he gets to go break rules Iâ€™ve apologized but he it doesnâ€™t matter to hi. . I have BPD and Iâ€™ve been having a lot of trouble lately with controlling myself . I keep thinking of all the ways I can do it. But Iâ€™m worried about my cats . I keep thinking what if I take pills or what if I just did anything how can I do. Iâ€™m so worthless I ruin everything good. I try so hard to be goof and I give so much I love so hard but I donâ€™t think I want to be here anymore . I truly think I might do it tonight or soon. I truly ruin everything I canâ€™t even make the person I love the most happy I tried to do something nice for my boyfriend today I took him out to eat but then he was upset about something and I denied it bc I was sure I was right and I inisrupted him and now heâ€™s angry and says I fucked it up and heâ€™s right I fucked it up like I fuck up everyging.
Is it my time to go? Have I reached my expiration? It seems like itâ€™s the end of me . I ruin everything and canâ€™t make the people I love happy, Iâ€™m bad at school Iâ€™m bad at life . Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m damaged goods whatâ€™s the point anymore.. 
I think itâ€™s my time maybe.. Idek why Iâ€™m writing this no one cares anymore Iâ€™m sure a whole bunch of strangers could care less. Iâ€™m so sorry to anyone who has to read this. Iâ€™m sorry for wasting your time like I waste everyone elseâ€™s..
