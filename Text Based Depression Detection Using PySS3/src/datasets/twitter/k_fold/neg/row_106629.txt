I don't belong hereHello everyone. So basically this will be a rant about what's going through my head in the last months. Maybe there are people like me somewhere.. So, I've reached the point that I don't see a reason to stay on this planet/continue living anymore. At the end everything is useless and I can't contribute anything that would be helpful on a greater scale. Nothing really matters. I'm (we?) are trapped in this awful void without a reason. Some people suggest finding something that could make you happy or something that gives you a reason to live will help but I don't think this works for me. I can't ignore that there is no greater reason to live. In my opinion everyone just tries to ignore that there is no reason behind everything. I'm able to avoid negative thoughts for a short time but there is no escape. I tried almost everything. Working out, eating healthy, taking meds and therapy. Nothing really helped.. And don't get me wrong I haven't given up yet. I'm still going "strong". Surprisingly I haven't given up completely yet. But if my current state of mind won't change I can't imagine myself being alive in 5 years. I feel like an alien trapped in this horrible world. Sorry if I made any grammar mistakes. I hope someone understands me.. It's really hard to write down my thoughts.
