How to get the balls to do it?Go ahead.  Try to save me.  Nothing you do will change my situation.  It's not like I can't be persuaded, I've tried it all.  After several months I've decided I'm fucking done.  I've reached out several times to family, psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, suicide hotlines/chats, you name it, for something different to try.  Every time I try something new that fails, I lose what little hope is left.  Things just don't work for me.  Read my past post history if you want to know more.  Nothing much has changed recently.  I'll try and keep this short.  My life is uneventful.  I have every reason to be happy in my situation, but I have Bipolar II.  And of all the things that I could do, I've decided to post shit on Reddit.  I'm a fucking genius!  If I don't reply in the next day or so, chances are I've grown a pair.  Good luck.
