I can't hold on anymore. I'm sick of being the guy who sits in the corner, unable to comprehend a thought. I'm sick of being constantly scorned; of being let go by people who apparently care deeply for him. I'm sick of seeing the girl I adore pretend she gives a fuck and then ignore my pleas. 
I'm sick of trying to break my own static nature, of breaking writer's block, of breaking terminal boredom. I'm sick of seeing people's parties with their photographs, ones I never knew about.
I'm sick of not having money.
I'm sick of seeing my best friends scorn me for silence.

There is no use. Nothing is helping. No comforting arms, no people reaching out. Just loneliness, nothingness.
