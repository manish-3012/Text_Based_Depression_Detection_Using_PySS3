To be honest I'm lonelyI'm not sure. Alls I know is I'v had the best/worst year of my life. I'v made a ton of new friends, got a 4.4GPA, playing three sports I love. Yet, a good friend of mine took her own life. The girl I love thinks I'm crazy. Despite being happy 90% of the day every night I end up laying here depressed wanting to cry. I just don't know what to do to make it stop. Every night its so constant, I get haunted by my own thoughts and I put myself through so much fucking pain. I seriously don't know what to do I'v tried talking to friends. It gets worse every night too. More pain/Harder to sleep. I feel insane, and I'm worried I am and I'm the only one who can't see it...Then I isolate myself because I don't want to hurt people around me which makes it worse.  and I just need someone to talk to, to vent, to get advice, to help.
