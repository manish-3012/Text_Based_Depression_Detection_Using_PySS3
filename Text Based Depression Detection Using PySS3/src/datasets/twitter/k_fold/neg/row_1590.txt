I'm killing myself on my birthday.My birthday is this coming Saturday, September 26th. I'm killing myself when the sun sets. I don't want people to celebrate my life. I hate my life. I cant do this anymore. I'm sorry dad. I'm sorry mom. I'm sorry siblings, even though some of you arent old enough to realize what this means. I'm sorry Matt. I'm sorry Raun. I'm sorry Ethan. I'm sorry Aidan. I'm sorry Brandon. I'm sorry James. I'm sorry Evelyn. I'm sorry Damian. I don't know how to do this anymore. Everything over the past few months has destroyed me even more than I was before. I'm sorry for being a burden. For everyone I didnt mention, I'm sorry. I wish I wasnt like this. I wish I was more capable. I wish I wasnt a failure at 15. For anyone who reads this post, please, make the most of your life. I didn't. I'm sorry.
