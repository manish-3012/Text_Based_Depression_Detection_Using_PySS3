Why am I such a coward to end it all when thatâ€™s all I want?I have been trying to kill myself since I was 9. The constant thoughts race through my mind. The constant shaking that runs through me. Constant anxiety and depression is all I deal with everyday. The psychological issues that have followed me to adulthood from my childhood. The constant thought of wondering what is wrong with me. What did I do wrong?? The thought of death is always there. Iâ€™m not afraid to die. I lost my father the day I was born. Spent the first year of my life starving to death in an orphanage in the middle of Siberia. I was adopted. And the psychological pain that comes from that is still here. It haunts me everyday. I lost my best friend 6 months ago after he got hit by a car and another friend of mine on January 10th to suicide. Why am I too much of a coward when all I want to do is go be with them? I got into a massive fight with my mom on Saturday and wanted to jump off a bridge into the freeway. The thought of failing scares me. I just want to done with. Nobody gives two fucks about me or how I feel. Maybe I need to stop being a little bitch and just do it. They say itâ€™s selfish, â€œitâ€™s a selfish thing to doâ€ but itâ€™s so fucking selfish too, to force someone to live a life they donâ€™t want to. Honestly Iâ€™m done.. Iâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t take it anymore.
