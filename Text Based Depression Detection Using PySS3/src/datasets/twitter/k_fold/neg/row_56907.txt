Just one more...Ill probably never check this account again but i need to get some shit off my chest and i hope this helps. Im a worthless pos 28 year old. I cant find a job but luckily I have a mom who loves me and is willing to pay for me to survive.  I usually go hungry for 3-4 days at a time and the water i drink isnt fit for human consumption. Thats irrelevant to why im posting though. When I was around 16 I tortured a guinea pig to death. I kept pouring cologne on him and lighting it. His name was jonny. I guess at some point i felt bad and tried to cover him up. I woke up the next morning and when i went to touch him he was cold. I think about it every day. I dont sleep well. Also i wet the bed til i was like 12. Arent those two things like halfway to a serial killler? I constantly think about cutting people who have fucked me in the past. I never really think about actually killing them i just think about cutting them deep. Then when i think of that i think of jonny and i wonder why im here. Im obviously a psychopath that has a little more control than others so why shouldnt i just kill myself before i lose said control and hurt someone? EDIT: forgot to say but i turned to drugs and alcohol. So yes im a pos junkie and it still isnt enough.
