i want to fucking kill myselfthis has been ongoing. i usually don't want to kill myself but i think about death way too much. i don't think i'm "suicidal" but i definitely think about killing myself very often. i have a great life and a great family, but small things trigger me and make me want to die or run away to get away from things. i'm scared of society and i'm scared of my future, and there's no escape from either. time goes too fast for me to comprehend, and i don't think i could ever do anything productive with my life. if there was a way to kill myself without hurting any of my friends or family, i would 100% do it, but only 50% of the time. i frequently have extreme highs and lows in terms of self-esteem and mood, but it's not anything that anyone else can tell. i tend to hide what i'm actually feelings from everyone because i feel that no one can fully comprehend and understand what i'm saying. i think the phrase "i want to fucking kill myself" too often to be healthy, but i don't actually want to kill myself half of the time. help.
