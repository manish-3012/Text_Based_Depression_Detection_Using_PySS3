Fed upMy worst nightmare came true 3 days ago I was about to go through with killing myself. I was sitting on my bed with a belt around my neck but something convinced me not to do it I think it was fear. I really want to get over this depression because I see no point living I used to have dreams I wanted to fulfill now I just waste away in my house doing nothing.
