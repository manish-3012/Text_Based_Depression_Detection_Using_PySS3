Can't find a god damn job. Thinking of ending this shitty life.Finished grad school May, fucked my career choices up to now. Seeing all my college classmates in super high paying jobs that I can no longer get into due to poor career choices made. 

Fucking life sucks, single, probably getting kicked out of my apartment in a few months. 

Gonna end this shit if I can't turn this around in a month or two.
