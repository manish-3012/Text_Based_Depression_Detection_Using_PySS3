I don't see the point anymoreEver since last November I've started to get extremely depressed what caused this depression was the feeling that nobody wanted to be around me even though a lot of ppl were talking to me and I did get a gf that only lasted one month before I cut it off because she wasn't really making my situation better, the other reason why I started was because I was also diagnosed with lupus, a autoimmune disease. And I'm thinking about what is the point of living if I'm gonna die a probably painful death anyway, I tried looking at the positives but quite frankly I can't really find a happy ending to my life... Sure I'm very kind and friendly with people but apparently I'm also destined to be alone with no friends.. Oh and have a painful life of dealing with lupus until I die because of it, I just don't see the point anymore... Thinking about taking pills and going to sleep forever... Because sleep is the only peace I get nowadays
