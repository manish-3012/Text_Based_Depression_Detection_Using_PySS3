When being toxic doesn't work?I am in the process of alienating everyone and there's only a couple of family members left.  I met one today and was as horribly toxic as I knew how to be: clingy one minute and dismissive the next, only talking about myself and my woes, talking over her, interupting, just about every annoying trait you can get.  She just dismissed it as 'a bad day' and in fact stayed longer than usual to 'help me air my feelings'.   God, why won't people get the message?!
