I hate myself and want to dieIm sick of ruining every relationship I have, Im tired of hurting people. I deserve to be alone. I deserve to die. I hate myself. What right do I even have to hurt others and make them feel bad? I hate myself. I want to kill myself. I just want to stop existing. I dont even care wether its from a slow and painful death (cause I deserve it) or not. I just want a way out. I have to try again. I have to. I cant be here anymore. I cant keep hurting others. I cant keep feeling exhausted and numb. I just cant.
