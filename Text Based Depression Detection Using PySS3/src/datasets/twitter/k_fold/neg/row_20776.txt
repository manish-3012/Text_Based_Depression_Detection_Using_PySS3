I'm not worth what i get.Hello, my birth name is Tia and I am a transgender, and I feel like I am not worth being alive because of that. I feel like that because I'm trans I am a degenerate and I have a severe mental disability and I should be a girl because thats what I was born as, as the rest of the internet and a few of my peers have told me. I feel like I should just swallow a bunch of pills and end my pathetic life. I am just too sad to continue my life.
