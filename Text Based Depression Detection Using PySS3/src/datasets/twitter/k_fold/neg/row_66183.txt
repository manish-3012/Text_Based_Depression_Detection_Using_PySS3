I'm a lieEvery day I put a fake smile a fake personality and fake laugh day after day for years every day was the same wondering if the day was the "day" the day when I will be set free from myself the day I can show what has been locked away for years behind  the smile people saw daily just one of the only reasons I'm still going is seeing others smile because of me knowing I made some one smile knowing i might have made their day better  .
