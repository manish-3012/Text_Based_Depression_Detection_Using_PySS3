thanks dudewas already suicidal tonight. someone calls me a 'school sh\*oter' on instagram. thanks dude. makes me feel great. 

i tell my friend that i was going to overdose. she says "oh", completely uninterested. 

its little things like this that get me into this state. 

i did the math- i dont have enough pills to overdose.

i cant keep fucking living like this. its not even living its just a miserable in-between state of existence. 

i want to fucking end myself and cause myself pain, but at the same time, im scared of the pain. i just want to die.
