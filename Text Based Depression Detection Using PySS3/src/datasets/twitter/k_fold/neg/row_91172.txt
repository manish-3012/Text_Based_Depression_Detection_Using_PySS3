I have no hope.I really don't, I look a head and I see no happiness for me in any part of my life. I keep screwing up in school. I can't get one thing to go my way I'm just filling apart mentally. I don't think I could kill myself but I really want to die. I do hope I'm brave enough one day. I used to fear death but now I wish for it. My best days are behind me and I'm only 21. I feel like a failure and I'm breaking down. I've either accomplished the things I've wanted in life or they just will never happen. I'm tired, I'm afraid to talk to my friends or family about it. I just need a break and some sleep. But I don't ever get a break there is always something for me to do. Work, school, and when I'm "off" I have homework, housework. I'm in so much pain every day and I'm not allowed to show it. I just want to sleep man.
