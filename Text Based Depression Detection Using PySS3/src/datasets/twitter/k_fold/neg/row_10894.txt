Tired of effortI sit here at 35 years old, becoming more aware of my irrelevance to most everyone and hopelessness in life. I am a childhood abuse survivor; someone whose father never wanted me and whose mother first discarded me, then took me back and passed away shortly after. Iâ€™ve been relegated to secondary status in every meaningful relationship in my life - romantic, family and friend - and feel that seeking meaningful relationships is just hopeless at this point. I donâ€™t feel like living anymore, and there is really nobody in my life right now that I can talk to about it anymore.
