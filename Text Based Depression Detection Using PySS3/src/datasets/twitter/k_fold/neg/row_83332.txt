What dying will feel like?Okay guys we don't actually know what it feels like to die because the ones who have done it can't come back and tell us.

I don't actually thinks it's that bad. I think dying will be a lot easier than how we think. 

If we're taking about suicide...

Then I think dying is easy and you just have to go through a few minutes of feeling uncomfortable (depending on the method) and not painful.

Obviously if you cut your wrists it's going to cause pain. But drowning or poisoning or overdose you gotta endure feeling uncomfortable or panicked but it won't be painful.

Anyone else agree?
