I want to kill myselfhave only despair and hopeless left in me, I think I'm ugly, unloved and a waste. I've thought about suicide and now it's start to make more sense on why I should kill myself. If you only get pain in life and nothing els then why not kill yourself, sure family and friends will miss me but they're also the problem and talking about it is gonna make it worse and the friends I have will just get another person to replace me, like the girl I liked completely denied me and the person who she likes(my best friend) he just acts all nice and supportive because he has to or he'll look like a bad guy. So why not just end it even if there is no afterlife and just a void it's still better than this
