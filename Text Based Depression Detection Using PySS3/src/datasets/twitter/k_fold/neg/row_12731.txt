I contemplated suicide and now I fear for my life.Thoughts are rushing through my mind and I just want it to end. I was almost ready to jump out of my window to escape this deafening madness. I feel like I'm going insane. Nothing makes sense and I feel disconnected with my surroundings. 
I don't know what to do and I fear for my life and wellbeing.
