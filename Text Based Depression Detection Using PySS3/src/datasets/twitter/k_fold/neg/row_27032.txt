Just here.Can someone give some reasons? I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'll never be mentally healthy. I scared the one girl I cared about. She left. I don't know if I can do this. She was the only thing in my life I felt was stable. I don't deserve her, or even love. I hate myself, and my stupid OCD, anxiety, and depression.
