I had a britney spears style breakdownHad a Christmas party at work yesterday and got pretty drunk, I ended up crying into my managers arms after bottling in so much stuff. Then got into the worst fight ever with my mum whom I never fight with. It was mainly because my mum had been asking me for money that I can barely afford to give away this is what broke me at the Christmas party and for some reason ended in my tears and fight. I am not at all the kind of person to behave like I did. I even ended up cutting myself with the intention of leading it to suicide. I fucked up so bad and have extreme social anxiety and honestly I've been in bed all day thinking about how the fuck to make things right again. I barely ever speak to my parents about stuff and last night my Dad had to come and help as well. I feel bad that I bottle in so much stuff and now telling everyone what was going on I feel like I've fucked my life up considerably. Feel like I need to disappear.
