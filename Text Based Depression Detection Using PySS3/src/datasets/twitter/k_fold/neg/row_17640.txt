I've ruined my lifeI've successfully destroyed myself. It seems to be the only thing I have ever been good at. I spent a year destroying my mind with drugs and pills and another year drowning my failures in whiskey and vodka. It's cost me all of my friends, my home and I drove away the love of my life. I don't want to kill myself but I was it to end. I want to fall asleep without waking up knowing that my life I'd now only a nightmare of cleaning up the disaster I created. I had paradise and I threw it away for the sake of a good time. Now I'm living on whatever people who pity me will give me. All in all I'm worthless, I can work to make myself better but I know I'll only fall back into my own devices. I've tried medications, retilin, bupropion, colonopin, stratera. All its served to do is drive me into insanity. Tearing out drywall and attacking people who care about me. How can I move forward when I can barely survive myself. Therapy doesn't help, they all just say the same shit, "stay with it, it'll get better" well it doesn't. I'm the shame of my friends and family and nothing would please me more that to simply cease this torturous existance.
