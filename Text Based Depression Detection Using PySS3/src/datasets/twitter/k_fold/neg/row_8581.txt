So parents are the worst now, and responsible for everything?Sorry, if I have to break it to you, BUT even if it might be the case fot some of the parents it's not always true. I'm hurt by what someone said in a group chat, that parents are the worst. I lost my brother through suicide a little bit over two years ago, I've also been suicidal for a long time. BUT NEVER WAS IT MY PARENTS FAULT. they are hurting so much, and I always have to think about if another parent sees a comment like this "parents are the worst", that's hurtful and can make parents suicidal too. I'M SORRY FOR THIS RANT but I'm angry, emotional and hurt. Thinking of my brother. Love you always, you're my other half.
