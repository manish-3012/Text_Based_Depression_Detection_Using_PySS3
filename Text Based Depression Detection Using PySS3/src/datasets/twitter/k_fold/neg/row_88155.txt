I don't want to live in this competitive countryI'm 18. I study in Grade 12 in Singapore. Sorry if my English is not good enough to understand. I have a lot of pressure when I'm in school. People care so much about GPA and academic result. When I come back home I have to read a lot of books because if I got bad score, my  teachers and my parents would get upset and angry. I once failed a math exam, my friends looked at me and asked me what's wrong? Everyone in class need to be perfect. After finish school we have to go to extra class until 7 p.m. So I feel like I don't want to do that anymore but I can't escape it either! Sometimes I feel tired but I can't rest. My parents have a high expectation and I think they will be mad at me if I tell them I don't want to study hard like other friends. I envy people in other countries that they don't have to study hard and be perfect in everything like us. When I tell people here that I want to write a novel, singing or drawing, they immedietly think that I'm stupid and crazy. I'm so tired! I feel like I have no choice. Do you believe in reincarnation? I just want to escape from here..
