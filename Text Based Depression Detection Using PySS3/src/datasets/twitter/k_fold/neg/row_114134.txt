I'm all alone, and I want to dieI'm a 23 yr old f and I've struggled with depression my whole life.  2.5 years ago my little sister was murdered.  So that just deepened my depression.  The weird thing is that right after she died I went into this long period of shock where life seemed to be normal... Well as normal as my always intoxicated life had been before she died.  I drank a lot I went out a lot I did a lot of drugs.. anything to get away from the emptiness I felt.  It was easier those months because I had friends that didn't let me be alone during that period.  But now it's years later and I'm all alone, I've withdrawn from my friends, gained weight, and don't leave my house unless my boyfriend dragged me out or if I had work. Now my boyfriend(who had proposed) says he doesn't want me bc I'm a mess.  But in the beginning of our relationship he said he liked me because he felt like he had to take care of me.  And now I'm too much because I'm needy and did need him to take care.kf me mostly emotionally.  I don't want to get fucked up anymore I just want to be loved and the person who said he loved me doesn't anymore and I'm not that close with my family or my friends and I really have no one else. He wants me out of the apartment and I don't have anywhere else to go and I just want to die.  No one would know... Not for a while.. no one would care or miss me.  And I don't wanna be in the streets and death sounds like the best solution.  I'm terrified of bringing this to a hotline because I've been on a 5150 hold before and I don't want to go back.  I'm just alone and so sad and I just want my.sister back because she was the only person who loved me for me.no matter what.
