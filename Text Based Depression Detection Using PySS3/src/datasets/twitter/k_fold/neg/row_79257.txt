I was happy before and now Iâ€™m not. Fuck this world.I have a lengthy pocket knife in my room right now and I just canâ€™t stop thinking about how easy it would be to just open it up and plunge it into my chest or neck. How did I go from being a sympathetic, motivated, driven teenager to a cold hearted and down and out 20 year old who has yet to either pass a single college class or make a new friend since high school? How the fuck did it get like this? Hell I know for a fact that even the people I know from those happier days see me differently now. They see how much I have changed for the worse, and have they tried to help? â€˜Course not! Instead they chose to start treating me like Iâ€™m some ridiculous incompetent idiot. Iâ€™m starting to think they were all just leeches that fed off of my old happy self. Iâ€™m just fucking done. I canâ€™t get anything going so why try? Iâ€™m done.
