I don't know what to do anymore. I deserve where I am but I can't handle it.Hello,

I've been struggling with depression for years and it has been incredibly hard to deal with right now. I live by myself in a messy apartment and have been only going to work and playing video games for the past 2 years. I've gotten fatter, my back aches constantly and have a couple acquaintences as friends. I work as a teaching assistant overseas and I rarely have significant work to do so I just browse reddit whenever I don't need to plan classes or teach them. I rarely exercise and have problems eating well. Whenever I think about doing something good for myself I feel so anxious and just think 'what's the point?'. I have been an unknowing arse to most people around me and creepily tried to hit on any attractive girl that I know, to little success. I rarely work hard and think I deserve better treatment and pity, but I really don't. Where I am is my own doing which began with an unfortunately isolated childhood with frequent bullying. I really just want to end it all but I want to hang on just in case there's an out somewhere that will make me better. I currently am on medication and plan to see a therapist in a couple days.

Thanks.
