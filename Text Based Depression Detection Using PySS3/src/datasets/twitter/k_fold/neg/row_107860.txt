Not even the hotline wants to talk to meI decided to text the hotline as I have done before. I personally think is bs but at the same time no one else wants to talk to me so itâ€™s the best Iâ€™ve got. It said assigning but I was never assigned to anyone. Even the hotline wonâ€™t talk to me. Iâ€™m so lonely I went to google translate, but in â€œI love youâ€ and â€œI care about youâ€ and pressed the speak button so a robot voice said those words to me. Thatâ€™s how lonely I am. Where I need a robot to say good things about me because no one else will.
