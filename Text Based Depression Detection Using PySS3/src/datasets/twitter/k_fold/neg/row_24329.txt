CrossroadsI feel like I'm at a crossroads. 

I have all these incredible vivid thoughts and I can tell a doctor and be medicated or write a book and change history. 

What made Plato or Socrates greats? If you threw them into poverty in a modern society wouldn't they be medicated and formed in a psychward. 

If I could somehow broadcast these ideas I feel like I could be recorded in history.
