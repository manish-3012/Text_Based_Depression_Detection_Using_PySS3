Im scared my mom is gonna see my scratchesWhen I self harm I use this cheap ass pocket knife from a gift shop. It can barely break skin and no blood comes out when I use it. So if some fucker tries to break into my house and kill me im fucked lol. 

Anyways it looks like really bad scratches. Kinda looks like dog scratches but idk if my mom will believe it was from one of our dogs. Im not even sure its "real" self harm since no blood comes out. They're all right underneath my elbow. My mom knows I struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts (we call them "crazy thoughts" because its too hard to outright say "suicidal thoughts") 

Yesterday night I came so close to attempting to kill myself. My mind was racing and I felt trapped. 

I don't know. Im scared. I'm taking medicine and I think I need to up my dose. I don't fucking know anymore.

I'm not looking for advice to hide them or nothing. Im just venting. 

I have friends to talk to but I couldn't bring myself to tell them what was going on. I was able to calm down by singing some Descendents and NOFX songs.
