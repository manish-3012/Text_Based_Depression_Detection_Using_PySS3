Is this â€œnormalâ€ ideation?Putting normal in quotation because no one is truly â€œnormal,â€ I just wonder if this is a cause for concern. 

So this has been happening ever since I can remember, and I started to notice it again in recent months. I would take walks around my neighborhood which is right next to a two-way road. I would be walking and see a car coming and have the mildest urge to step off the curb and in front of the car. 

This only happens when Iâ€™m outside. The urge isnâ€™t terribly strong, when I see a car coming I feel like stepping off the curb is like going down a roller coaster. Does anyone else have a similar experience? Should I be concerned?
