When your parents don't understand that their actions can and will directly lead to the suicide of their kid.Feels so fucking bad when you're raped as a kid and you have to see the same person who constantly disrespects your trust every weekend because you're dad is too emotionally ignorant to understand, even after multiple expressions of concern. 

Feels so fucking bad knowing that I might be stuck living with my parents for 10 more years because of the wage climate. 

I involuntarily get ptsd because my parents are too fucking retarded to make a moral stance. Taking my own life is most likely the best option for me, it's either that or me having to get years of therapy when I finally exit the situation. Love to see it happen
