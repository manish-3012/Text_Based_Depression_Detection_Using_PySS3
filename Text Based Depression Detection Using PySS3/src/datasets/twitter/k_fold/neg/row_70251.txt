Triggered and can't bounce back.Does anyone else have their anxiety triggered by a thing/situation/person, but then it was just a misunderstanding and you realize you thought wrong, but then you can't get out of the anxiety loop?

Like you're bawling and your chest hurts and logically you know everything's good because this whatever thing has been clarified/corrected/wasn't what you thought all along?
