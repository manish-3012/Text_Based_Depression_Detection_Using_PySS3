i'm going to kill myself. that's allfirst of all i'm sorry for posting this because i know no one cares or wants to read this so i'm sorry for being annoying.  
i'm fucking worthless. everyone hates me. my family hates me. my roommates hate me. everyone who meets me hates me. i don't blame them, i hate myself more than all of them combined. i'm ridiculously ugly and fat, so people hate me immediately when they see me. and on top of that i'm stupid, and i have a horrible personality. everyone wants me to die. everyone will be happier and better off once i fucking kill myself already.  
i'm so pathetic. i won't even go into the details because i'm so annoying and whiny. no one will ever love me.  
i deserve to die. i don't deserve to be happy.  
i'm cutting right now as i'm writing this, and i have 45 tylenol sitting here ready to go, so the only question is if i can stop being such a stupid worthless fucking coward and actually do something good for once in my life.  
thanks for letting me talk. again i'm sorry for being annoying, and i'm sorry to anyone who read this and had to deal with me. sorry
