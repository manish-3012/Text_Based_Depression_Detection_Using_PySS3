School sucks...I feel like my life is spiralling out of control, I don't know what to do. My parents are always fighting. My house is a shithole, nobody even cares about me. People are only friends with me out of pity. I can't describe it, not correctly. My house isn't my home, my dad isn't my father. Just... everything is there with none of the substance. Just, hollow. I can't stop thinking about what's on the other side if I do it. I have a noose in my bedroom. I keep looking at it. I don't want to go to school, I don't want to go home, I just want to be gone. I drink, I smoke, I cut, I try everything to help me end it except for ending it. I'm a coward.
