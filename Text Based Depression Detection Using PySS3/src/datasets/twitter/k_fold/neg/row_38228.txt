No title.I had friends until something better came into their life. They put me to the side and never came back, or ignore me now. 

I'm a good person. I know I am. I help with community service, put others before my needs, have a great deal of respect, and am going through college. 

However, I'm sick of myself. How I get angry and upset. Tired of feeling bad about myself. When I try to get help, it's sabatoged by others but mostly me. 

Everyone I talk to has double standards, like when they get pissed and take it out on me, I can't do much. However, if I get upset and it boils over to where I'm short with other's, they get beyond pissed and try to leave me alone without cheering me up like how I would for them.

I recently deleted everyone off all my contact things (skype, ect) and deactivated my facebook. I really can say I'm mad at the world and want to finally push myself in. I'm angry, upset, and the world was never fair so I don't know why I firmly believe 'do to others what you'd like in return' because nobody treats me that way.

I'm sick of life and my backwards thinking. I wish I had the balls to swallow all these pills near me just to end this stupid life that resulted into nothing but unhappiness for me. I hate myself.
