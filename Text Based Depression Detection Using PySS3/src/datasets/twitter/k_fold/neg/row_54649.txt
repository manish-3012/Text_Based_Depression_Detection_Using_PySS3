Every day I put the magazine in the pistol12 rounds preloaded, 9mm jacketed hollow point, every day I flip the safety off, every day I rack the slide,  one round live in the chamber, every day I sit on the edge of the bed, finger on the trigger, pistol cold and heavy against my temple.. fear.. so every day remove the magazine, and Every day I re-rack the slide, the bullet ejects and drops to the floor, every day I write the date on each newly ejected piece of unfired brass. 

One day Iâ€™m gonna stop writing dates.. either because I will have gotten better or I will have finally pulled the trigger.
