Why do i feel so alone when i have friends and family?I dont know why but when im not speaking to someone i feel like i have no friends, i feel the need to constantly be talking to someone whoever it is, there are certain people that when i speak to them i feel even better but they just dont speak to me as much as i would like...

i know sometimes im feeling suicidal and sometimes im just depressed and want to hurt myself but i really dont know where im at right now i just want to cry all the time, im a 17 year old male and alls i want to do is cry, what the fuck is up with that?

im sorry if this isnt your usual SW post but i really dont know where else to post, i have posted to /r/depression but i find it easier to talk to people here, my head is everywhere, i really dont know who i am anymore i just need help
