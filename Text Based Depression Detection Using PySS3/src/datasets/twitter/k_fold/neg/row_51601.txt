So I've started researching suicide methods...Having a really rough night. There's no one on who's interested in talking. I really wish there was someone in the room with me to talk to or just hold me. I miss that so much. :(

It's tempting. Oh so fucking tempting. After an agonizing few months I've become aware of how useless, how unloveable I am. I've pushed away the person that I love the most, I've flunked school, I've lost friends, I've fucked up my life. And I have a hard time seeing how it can get better.

 I'm not comfortable posting my entire story here because I know a few redditors IRL, and I wouldn't want them to see it (this is a throwaway account but still, they might recognize some details). I don't want to pollute the internet with my whiny garbage either, not more than necessary at least.

I don't know why I fight to keep going. It doesn't feel like there's any more hope.
