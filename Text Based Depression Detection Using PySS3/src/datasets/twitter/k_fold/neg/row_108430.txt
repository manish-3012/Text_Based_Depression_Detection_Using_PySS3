i can't do this anymorei'm always alone &amp; feel sad everyday, it gets so much it hurts &amp; i cry all the time even in public. My friends all left me bc i'm always sad &amp; tired, since i can't sleep. My family is abusive &amp; don't care about me. I have noone. I'm too scared to talk to people i never get a word out &amp; panic so i'll never make friends, it'll never get better. I can't remember the last time i was happy &amp; i can't do this anymore. I've been wanting to end my life for a very long time but now i feel closer than ever. I don't think i'll be here for more than another year at most. I went to counseling before but noone can help me.
