[16M] I dont know what else to doI dont know how to write out my thoughts well, sorry if this seems a mess.

To put things into context im From the UK so we have  freehealthcare 

Ive had anxiety and panic attacks since mid 2013, it started out as occasional anxiety. I have not seen a doctor about it mosly becuase Im too scared of the idea and becuase I thought it would get better itsself. It didnt, its just got worse and worse these past few months in particular. i cant sleep, eat or go about my life normally anymore I dont remember what it feels like not to be depressed and anxious let alone happy. I hace not seen a doctor avout this mostly becuase i was too scared to (not sure why) and what i feel lack of support from parents , i did mention seeing a doctor to them last year becuade I had anxiety, not 100% sure what they said but it was like "we dont think you need to but go if you want to, were  not stopping you"

Ive had this pain in both mylegs and groin on and off for the past year now but ive been too anxious to say anything, i dont know why. These last few days however its been really bad and today it was the worst pain ivr ever felt.  Ive tried telling my parents and asking for help but they just take some painkillers and that ineed to do more excersise..  not sure how that is possible when i cant stand up or do anything.

Thisband a combination of other things has driven me over the edge recently Im not sure that I want to die but this crippling anxiety and pain has gotten too much to bear and I just want it to end.
