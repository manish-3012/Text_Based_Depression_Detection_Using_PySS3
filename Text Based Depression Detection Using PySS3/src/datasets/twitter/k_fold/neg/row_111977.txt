Suicidal yet too weak to do itI have been feeling really suicidal lately, i feel horrible all the time, even with company and when having 'fun'. I will toy with suicidal thoughts and yet could not bring myself to do it even though i dont mind dying right now, i always go to bed hoping i would never wake up. Everytime i try to kill myself i think about the ppl that would suffer because of me and it sucks because i no longer care about most of them and sometimes the pressure get to my head and i snap. Right now im hoping one day i snap and turn into a different person and forget my depression or fall into a deep sleep and never wake up
