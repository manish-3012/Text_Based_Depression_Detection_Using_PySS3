I have to do it todayThe only thing I ever wanted was to matter to someone. I pursued crazy dreams just with the hope that someone would appreciate what I was doing, like producing music, writing poetry and aspiring to write books. Here I am as a 20 year old music major in college. In the end, people only liked what I was doing and not me. 

I donâ€™t have any family. I never knew my father. All I know is that he was a prolific drug dealer. I lost the single mother that raised me and my brother to suicide. Iâ€™ve been independent for a year now and no matter what I do, nobody accepts me for the person I truly am. Iâ€™d sell my soul just to feel love if only for a minute. I finally met someone I really liked, and it turns out she was talking to me as a joke, because apparently Iâ€™m so horridly ugly and bland. I tried so hard not to be, I worked out consistently, stayed well groomed, and always dressed the best I knew how to. None of that matters now I guess. 

I have the belt around my neck now and am just trying to work up the courage to end it. Iâ€™m so scared, but I donâ€™t see any alternative for me. Iâ€™m worthless now, and I canâ€™t imagine a world where I matter to anyone, even if I continued living. I lived and will die a failure.
