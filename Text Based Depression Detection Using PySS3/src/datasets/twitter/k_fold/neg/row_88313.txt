Nobody really gives a shit.I've learned many things during my fucked up life and one of them is that nobody actually gives a fuck about you or if you're slowly rotting away in loneliness, shame, pain and despair. Nobody fucking cares even if they say so, it's just empty words.

But at least I'm starting to accept he fact that I will die alone and in pain.

Fuck this world. Fuck my life and what I've become.
