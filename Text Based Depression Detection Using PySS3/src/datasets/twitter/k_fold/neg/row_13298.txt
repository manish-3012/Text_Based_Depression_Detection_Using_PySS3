I need help with helping my brotherMy (28F) younger brother (24M) told my mom today that he was depressed and suicidal today. She called me and we took him to the ER where they evaluated him and decided to keep him overnight. We are supporting him and helping him. My mom had to call out of an important work meeting and her work friends are concerned- does anyone know a tactful way to explain this family emergency? She wants to be honest but discreet.
