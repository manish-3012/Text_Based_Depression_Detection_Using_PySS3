I'm fucked.I posted a while back in r/survivingsuicide about my story. May 26th this year I attempted suicide and woke up two days later in a hospital on a ventilator. 

Since then, I've spent most of my time in various treatment centers. One in Tennessee and one in California. I'm now 118 days sober and objectively doing better. 

My plan was to stay in California. I'm trying to avoid Louisville, my hometown where I tried to die. Shit planning has left me close to discharging from my treatment center with no feasible manner to make living in expensive ass California work. Back to Louisville I go. 

Give me reasons why it'll go better this time. I give up. Fuck sobriety; sober or not, I'm still not seeing a reason to go on. I'll drink on the plane and die the night I get home. 

I'm fucked.
