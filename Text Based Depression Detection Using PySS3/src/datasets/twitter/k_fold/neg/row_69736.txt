Crisis textline or suicide helpline users: what was your experience?I'd really like a lot of feedback on this because I've heard mixed things about both.

Sometimes I've heard they were able to help and provide support and stability when needed.

Other times I've heard how they called emergency services on people who were not in immediate need of help, and have read from a script and such.

Just looking to get a bit more detailed info about the services here and if they helped you and how.
