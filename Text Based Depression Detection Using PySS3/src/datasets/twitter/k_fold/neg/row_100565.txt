Im patheticI have ptsd after a assault and rape in 2017. 
Im so tired of therapy, and meds thats not working, or even worse; gives me more nightmares. 
I feel like Iâ€™ve taken all the advices I can. Been inpatients, outpatiens, mindfullness, medtitation, and antipsychotica and antidepressive. 
I have now quit my job. I have worked 8 years nightshift, and I donâ€™t function anymore. I fee so ashamed for this. 
Iâ€™ve gotten a new job at daytime but idk what I want anymore. I feel like people are just gonna judge me because Im a bit wierder now. I canâ€™t handle people to close to me, Im always on guard, I get scared easly, have lots of anxety problems and no self-esteem. 
Im not even sure If I want to try this new job. Im just so tired of my everyday struggle. 
As for now all I do is try not to drink alcohol. I made it almost 1 month but failed again this saturday. 
It all just sucks right now.. 

im sorry
