Just a couple of questionsHey guys, it is great to see the connections and support that everyone has for everyone else on here.

I just have a couple of questions that I have for the internetz that I haven't been able to find online clearly , nor am I willing to ask anyone close to me.

Is it weird when you're passed the point of wanting attention from your parents and just completely rejecting them despite them wanting your attention now? Like all the 13 years of neglect and unworthiness and physical abuse doesn't just go away like a drop of a stone. Maybe I am too stubborn in thinking that this will never change and I will always remain as this dumb fuck who can't look out for himself because he is always trying to make everyone else happy since that is the only way I find peace.

Is there a for-sure way to ensure that I can pass away due to brain hypoxia ? Like if my body was randomly found, there would be no way for medics or doctors to recover me. I want to pass away but I don't want to be recovered and live a life with dead brain cells aka live with a disability ( I think that would be worse than dying ) . Maybe leaving a note on myself to let people know not to touch me might be better I guess.

I have read some great posts here that I can relate to. I will continue to read the new and different posts (and provide the good upvotes) here as I wait.
