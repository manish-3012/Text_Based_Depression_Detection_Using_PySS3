I don't know what to do any more. HELPI'm a 19 year old girl who has been through too much shit in the 19 short years i've lived. I'm a failure to my family. Both my siblings are so successful while i sit at home with no motivation feeling like cracking my head open to ease the pain. I've come to a dead end and i dont know who to turn to or what to do. I have a facebook with 400+ "friends" who dont give a shit about me. Anyone i do try and talk to and open up and explains either shuts me down or tells me they'll be there and disappear instantly after. Everyday i think, what did i do so wrong to deserve to feel like this. Ive done stuff in my past that im not proud of so all i can think is this is my karma. 

If i just pack my shit and leave NO ONE would even notice so why not leave permanently?

This is literally my last resort because the demon inside is taking over.
