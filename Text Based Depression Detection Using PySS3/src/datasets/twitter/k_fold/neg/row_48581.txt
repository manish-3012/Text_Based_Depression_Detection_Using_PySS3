i brokefor the past few years it felt like i was completely lonely nobody else thought like me or liked the things i liked and i felt like everyone around me were just the same people so i just tried to fit in so i tried completely changing my personality but i still felt lonely and the isolation got to me because i yesterday i just reached a point where i just couldnt take it anymore and my soul just poured out of my body and its hard to put the way im feeling into words but i just felt so hopeless and i felt like that voice in my head that wanted me to live was completely gone
