I miss r/SanctionedSuicide.I don't need people telling me it gets better, because I've tried and things just turn to shit after awhile. I don't need people telling me to find a therapist, because they are paid for their time and I don't want to fucking pay someone to fake care for me. I don't need pms or messages with white knights on the internet speaking words...

I need someone to fix my life because no matter what i do it turns to shit, even if i try its shit.

I want to sleep and never wake up. I'm over waking up feeling like I haven't slept at all.

I'm so tired of being me. If there is reincarnation, I hope I get reincarnated into a stable brained person, this shit is fucked.

I have so much more to rant about but im just so fucking tired.

Fuck.
