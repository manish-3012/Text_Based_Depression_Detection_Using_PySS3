I'm fucking doneI have spent years with no friends. No girls interested me. And completely out of shape. I am tired of living my life at home completely by myself just me and Netflix till I fall asleep. Then wake up and do it over. During school it was ok because I had some interaction even if they weren't real friends. But now in summer I cant do it. And I told a girl I was into her and now havent talked to her in weeks and spend every day wanting to text her
