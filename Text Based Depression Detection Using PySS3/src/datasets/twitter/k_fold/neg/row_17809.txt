Contemplating ending my life on the job.I thought about this last night. I work at a fast food place that's right on the road. I could easily run out into traffic. As I swept the lot today I glanced out here and there to observe the speed of any vehicles that may have passed. It's a 45 zone but, of course, people drive recklessly above that. It would just be so fucking easy. Plus, it's a tourist area, so add city drivers and other dumbasses to the mix. I doubt anyone would even notice my absence until the lights and sirens and rubber-neckers began to pile up. 

I'm a horrible person and I deserve to die a horrible death.
