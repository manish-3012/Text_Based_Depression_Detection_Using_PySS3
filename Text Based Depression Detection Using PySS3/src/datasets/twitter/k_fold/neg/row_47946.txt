I feel like it's my time. Thank you for being good people though and keep it up for those who can be helped. I don't have the energy or effort to explain and rationalize with people anymore so I'll make it short and sweet. I'm tired of disappointment and rejection. Plain and simple sick and tired of being handed something beautiful and constantly having it ripped away from me. As soon as I think things are good and everything is working out it all gets taken from me. I'll never know love; I'll never know peace. I will die alone and jaded. I personally choose to take the guesswork out of that equation and handle things myself. I'm pathetic and that's really all there is to it. I'm sick of being the butt end of some sick cosmic fucking joke. 

So long and thanks for the laughs Reddit, but once I get off of work tonight I'm going to go have a drink and likely jump in front of a train.


I'm tired of being disposable.  

**EDIT**- Just an update for anyone who cares or might read it. My affairs have been put in order and I'm meeting up with someone for a drink around 6 tonight, after which I will be leaving this place finally. Thanks for helping me make it this far Reddit but the tanks finally empty.
