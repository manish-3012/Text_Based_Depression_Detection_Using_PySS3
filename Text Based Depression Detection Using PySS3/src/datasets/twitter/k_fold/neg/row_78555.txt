How many times can I fail?Not a throw away account, I don't care who reads this post. 

I'm 37 years old and I can't stand failing anymore at work, at relationships and my home life. I recently got what I thought would be a great job but no joke I am not as good as I thought I would be and I'm a disappointment to my self and I made a big fuck up today and I can't bear to deal with work in the morning.

I'm lonely and stress is causing me to have rifts with my friends. It feels like I can't face them to say how bad things are going. I know they would support me but I don't want to be the friend who can't get his shit together.

My housing situation is tenuous and I don't know if I will have a place to live after next month. 

I have ideas and plans to fix all of these things but I hate dealing with stress point and it feels like if I was dead I wouldn't feel like my overall life is such a failure. 

Advice?
