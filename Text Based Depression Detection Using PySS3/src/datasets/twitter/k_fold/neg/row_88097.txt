I want to go to that bridge againThereâ€™s no point though, since I know I wonâ€™t have the guts to jump. Then people driving by will see me and call the police. Then the police will take me to the hospital and make me wait around for several hours to then sit down and have the same conversation iâ€™ve had a few times with some folk about things iâ€™ve been through before many times. Nothing will come of it though, theyâ€™ll send me home and nothing will have changed, or maybe theyâ€™ll someone come to the house and speak to me. Iâ€™ve done that two or three times before and it didnâ€™t get me anywhere. Or maybe they would prescribe me with an antidepressant that I wonâ€™t take because I seem to think that it makes me weak for some reason. I donâ€™t deserve to be alive if I canâ€™t even engage with people who want to help me get better mentally.

Itâ€™s 6 am what the fuck is wrong with me
