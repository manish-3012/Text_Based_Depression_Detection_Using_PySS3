Today's my 18th Birthday. Is it worth living after this point?I've wasted my teen years pretty much in bed being miserable. Is there anything for me in the "adult world"? I feel like I've pretty much done everything worth doing, even though I haven't, and the rest of life is just boring filler. I don't know how to feel about this, I wish I was 15 again.
