Missing work, about to get fired, and ready to go.I have depression, bipolar, and anxiety for over 15 years. I am in my late twenties. 
I have taken off the entire last week of work and am going back today. I'm going to get in trouble but most likely not fired. This will be my final warning though. I hate my job. I can't do it anymore. 
I didn't go to college and can't do much else and everything else I can do can't pay the bills like my current job. I'm going broke from my current expenses and my girlfriends spending habits. 
She owes me about $500 from last month alone that she can't pay back although she always promises she will. I'm too nice to just turn her down. 
I can't do my job anymore and the stress of being so unhappy and having suicidal thoughts is making me miss more and more work. I'm too anxious to even call the doctor, she had to call for me. I owe the doctor over $300. My credit sucks.
My rent is too expensive and the place is a dump that we moved to. We got duped.
We are fostering a dog (guess who's idea that was) that's driving both of us nuts and she knows she fucked up. 
I can't sit in this apartment anymore but I can't go back to that job. I've been trapped in this apartment for a week now. I've been on and off meds for over 15 years and the ones they put me on drove me nuts even more.
I had to stop them.Over the last few days I've been hyperventilating and having panic attacks morethan I've ever had in my entire life.
All I want to do is take some pills, put a bag over my head and put a belt around my neck and be done with it.
What do I do? I don't know how much longer I can hold on. 
A month? A week? Please help.
