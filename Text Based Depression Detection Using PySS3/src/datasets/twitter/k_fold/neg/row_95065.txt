Suicide is my only optionI am rejected by everyone I attempt to befriend. Even my own family. The only time I am welcome is when people want to bond over bullying me. I am constantly bullied by everyone everywhere I go. This will be whole life. It has been my whole life. Why even bother defending myself? It only gets worse. The world message to me is clear, "we don't want you here."
