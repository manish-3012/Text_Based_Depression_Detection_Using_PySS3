My suicide noteIâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll die tonight but thereâ€™s a good chance I hope that my note resonates with some of you. I might not know you all but I wish you well and wish you all overcome this curse. 


I overdosed today I just took 12 painkillers and plan to chug as much alcohol as I can. First off Iâ€™m sorry to have caused so much inconvenience and Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that I shouldâ€™ve never been born I simply was not meant to live and that reason and that reason alone is why I did this. Iâ€™m thankful that I was able to experience love both for my friends who I know will love beautiful fulfilling lives . To my sister Iâ€™m sorry I wonâ€™t get to see your wedding and be there for all your great moments I hope you know youâ€™re the first person Iâ€™ve ever chosen to love thank you for growing up with me. For my partner who I never thought Iâ€™d ever find. Thank you for showing me that perfection exists and I know my soul whether it continues on or not will always continue to love you. Iâ€™m sorry that I never gave what couldâ€™ve been a beautiful future together a real chance and I only hope you can understand why. If other parallel universes exist I hope that there is one where we truly lived happily ever after. Weâ€™re the only fairy tale I could ever believe in. Youâ€™ll always be my soulmate baby. I love you what Iâ€™ll miss most about this world is how beautiful I think you truly are. My love, my life I sincerely apologize. You will be my final thought, out hands clasped together and peace felt when our lips meet. Iâ€™ll never leave you my beautiful soul. I am also sorry that I will never be able to help another life or experience having a child because I know Iâ€™d try to be the best mother I could and if you exist in another reality know that even this version of me loves you very much. And to my cat Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™ll never be able to pet you again I hope you understand how much I love you too. To my parents Iâ€™ve never had anything but love and admiration for you both and Iâ€™m deeply sorry for all the pain I have and will always cause. To life Iâ€™m sorry I failed you and Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™ll never experience all the beautiful sorrow you had to offer.
