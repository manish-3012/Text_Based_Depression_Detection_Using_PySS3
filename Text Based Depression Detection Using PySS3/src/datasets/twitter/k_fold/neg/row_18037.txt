I dont know what to doIve been dealing with depression for almost 3 years, im 15 and i know that might not seem like long to some people but it is to me. My personal belief is that love is what i need, ive had 4 rejections in the last year and each one of them sent me into a spiral of suicidal tendencies. Now two girls i used to like are dating my two best friends, and i cant take it. They rub it in my face at any chance they can, this mounting with stress from schoolwork and how im failing at it is becoming unbearable. Ive attempted suicide twice before but my parents found out and stopped me. I cant go on any longer, but the thought of my parents having to deal with me being so selfish. I want to die in an accident so that nobody will think im a coward, and so that my parents wont blame themselves. I dont want to die,mi just want everything inside my head to stop. Everything ive become is a failure, i can be horrible, i zone out and end up cutting myself even when there are other people around. Im so fucked up and i dont know why. My friends wont help me because they think i do it for attention, they dont understand i cant stop myself. I hate it, i hate it all, i hate me. Please. Ive been to a doctor and i cant get medicine because im too young, ive been to a psychiatrist and it hasnt helped. Please. I dont know what to do.
