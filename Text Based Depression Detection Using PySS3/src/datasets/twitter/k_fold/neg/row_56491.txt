How do I help?I've never posted or read here before. Pretty simple question for you guys: how do I help? Are there books or articles I can read for helping friends deal with self-harm and suicide and drug abuse?

My friends all know that they can talk to me whenever. I can be a listening ear and a supportive friend. But I don't know how to help and I don't know how to stop them from cutting or worse.

Is there anywhere I can find out how to help?

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. Feel free to PM me any info too!

Cheers.
