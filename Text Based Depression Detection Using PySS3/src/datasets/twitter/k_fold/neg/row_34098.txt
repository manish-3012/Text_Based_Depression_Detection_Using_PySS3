I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this upEvery day I wake up, get ready for work and put on a happy face right before I walk in the door to see my coworkers but im always thinking about going home later that night and taking my 12 gauge under my chin and pulling the trigger. I've been like this since I was about 13 (I'm 22 now) when 2 of my older brothers were successful with suicide and later that same year my grandfather who was like the father I never had past away from cancer and I felt alone in this world with an verbally and sometimes physically abusive mother. I'm currently in a relationship and she's the only person that makes me happy and feel normal but she's also so busy with her life which is understandable that I don't get to talk to her that often and I sure as hell don't talk to her about my suicidal problems as I don't want to scare her off. As I'm sitting here on the edge of my bed, I have a loaded gun on my nightstand and I'm honestly ready to just end everything. My life started falling apart again in March earlier this year after I got laid off from my job where I was more than able to provide for myself and not need anything from anyone and now I'm back in my mothers house across the country where I don't know anyone and my mother is married to a 22 year old that I went to high school with. 
I always feel so drained mentally that I just want to end it all. I'm feeling like if things don't change soon I'm going to put a bullet in my head and call it a day. The only thing that's really stopped me so far is my girlfriend and my little sister who lives here with my mother as well (she's 7) and I don't want her to be the one to find me and have to live with the same fucked up perspective on life as I have. I'm thinking about taking a drive out to the middle of nowhere and doing it so I can be alone and don't have to worry about my little sister finding me. I don't know what to do anymore.
