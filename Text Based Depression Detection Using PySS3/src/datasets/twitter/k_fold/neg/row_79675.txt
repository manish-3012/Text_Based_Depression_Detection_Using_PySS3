Iâ€™m thinking about ending it all.This is my second post here. I come to Reddit in my time of need simply because I feel that it is my last hope. I want to end my life now. It seems so easy to just give in and let the relief of death overtake me. I would no longer have to suffer in these moments of sorrow. I would be free of stress and responsibility, I would no longer have to worry about what other people think. Things would be much easier. The despair and dread I feel in my every waking moments torture me. Iâ€™m only 13 years of age, but yet I am already a sufferer of extreme anxiety. Not normal coming-of-age anxiety, but anxiety that has plagued my mind since I could first grasp human interaction and emotion. The traumas Iâ€™ve experienced certainly have contributed as well. I also suffer from a minor form of depression. Although I was told life would get better, and easier, things seem to be going steadily downhill. Things donâ€™t seem to be getting better. Iâ€™ve decided to post here as my last sliver of hope that something, or someone, can convince me life isnâ€™t as bad as it seems. I wanted my voice to be heard. If anyone ends up reading this message, thank you for getting to this point.
