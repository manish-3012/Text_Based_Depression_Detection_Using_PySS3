someone please give me one reason not to kill myselfthat isn't my family. please. i only got two family members who'd care.

i'm ugly with a shit personality and zero social skills, my two friends don't live in my same city anymore, nor i have a partner (lmao).

i'm poor, so no traveling, or moving to a better place, or getting out of this situation.

from a shitty country where nothing happens, where cool bands come every too-many-years to make it worth it to wait for them.

with no time, since job is very demanding, so i dont have any time to develop any skill.

no chance at a better job, since i didn't get to graduate.

i'm stuck paying a several thousand dollars debt from my family, and the kicker: it's to help save the apartment where i got molested, in the building where i got raped, all as a child.

like. what could i even look forward for. as long as i'm poor im fucking stuck. can someone please just encourage me to kms or something i mean things clearly arent getting better anytime soon.
