Thinking and doing nothingI wish there was a magic pill that would make me a normal functioning human - someoneâ€™s thatâ€™s able to do what Iâ€™m supposed to and learn in class. Instead I am stuck in bed unable to even brush my teeth or eat. I am in so much pain. I hate it so much. I know there is no magic pill, and Iâ€™m not going to learn and be disciplined overnight. I honestly donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t tried to kill myself again.
