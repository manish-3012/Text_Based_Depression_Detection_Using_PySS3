My laziness saved me from suicide.This summer I wanted to kill myself.I decided to write down all of my poetry in the notebook,so there is would be something left of me.

But I couldn't find it.I needed to buy a new one,but I was to lazy to do it,so I procrastinated.

And thus I kept living.Later I managed to overcome my problems completely,and now I feel happiness,finally.

Today I found my notebook.I don't need it anymore.
