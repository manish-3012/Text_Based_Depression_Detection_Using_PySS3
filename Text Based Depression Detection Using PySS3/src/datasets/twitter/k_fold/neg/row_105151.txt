Whelp, I fucked up big time. Usually there's hope, but I'm really, truly, fucked.Throwaway because my friends know my Reddit account, and I know they don't go on this sub so I'll post here. It started on Halloween. I am a college freshman, and I have never done drugs or alcohol. All throughout high school, I appeared to be a straight-shot kinda guy. AP classes and Eagle Scout and volunteering and shit. Well, I flew home for Halloween weekend because I missed my friends and girlfriend. Anyway, after starting college, my two best friends started drinking and they decided that they'd introduce me to "the alc". I should make it apparent that I did this of my own volition and I am not blaming them. Well, I took four shots of gin and two mixers to start off with. I waited thirty minutes and the only thing that happened was my vision got slightly blurry. So, they encouraged me to take some more. I took two more, and that got me more drunk-like. I guess I just kept thinking it was a good idea to pour more and more, and by the time they figured out what I was doing and his the gin, I had taken 14 plus 3 mixers. So I guess you could say I was pretty drunk. 

Remember how I said I appeared to be a straight-shooter? Well, the emphasis there is on the "appeared". See, I am actually very very fucked up mentally. On top of depression and multiple prior suicide attempts, I am also a monster. 

I don't throw that term around lightly. You see, I show all three traits of the MacDonald Triad, aka the killer triad. In many murderers and serial killers, these three traits are present and they often serve as predictors for violent behavior. They are pyromania, animal cruelty, and persistent bed-wetting after the age of ten. I hate these parts of myself and never want to hurt or kill anyone, but I often feel like I'm not in control. 

So, in my drunken stupor, I admitted everything to my friends. I told them about my persistent fire-setting and how the fires would make me sexually aroused (don't worry I beat myself up over that). I told them about the time a fire I made caused a neighborhood to be evacuated. I also talked about killing and dissecting cats. I hate doing this because it is awful and evil, and I feel shitty afterwards. But when I try to stop myself, I can't. I also told them about my persistent thoughts of killing and/of mutilating people. 

I am not a sociopath. I feel empathy for certain people, thus by definition I cannot be. I've been fighting the dark side of myself for a very long time, and recently it felt like I was winning. But now they know everything. They've been very distant and vile towards me. My actions make me a monster, and it's very clear they hate me and don't want anything to do with me. So I've lost my only friends. And we'd been friends since 7th grade.

They told my parents. Now they're talking about it. I don't know what they're going to do to me. They sent me back to college, but time will tell if they keep me there. 

I could be looking at a long time in jail. Arson is a felony and murdering cats is definitely some kind of crime. Even if I'm just admitted into a psych ward, I can kiss college goodbye. I worked very hard to get in and I won't be able to get back, especially now that I'm known to be a mentally disturbed fucked up kid. 

My only solace is that my girlfriend doesn't know. I love her to pieces, and she loves me, but I know if she found out there was a monster in me she'd be scared and leave me. And it's only a matter of time before my friends tell her. 

I've considered killing my friends. I've considered killing myself. I've considered a lot of things. I'm lost, and my life is over. I've failed everyone who beleived in me. And the worst part? I deserved it all. 

I almost jumped today, but decided not to at the last minute. Now I'm in my dorm room crying and cutting myself and typing this out. I've told these things to my therapist before and it was no help. 

I have no hope left. I fucked up guys, I fucked up. 

tl;dr : Got drunk for first time. Admitted to felonies. Lost my friends forever. They told my parents. Facing years of imprisonment. I'm terrified and see no way out but death.
