I think I have decidedI really can't take my life anymore. I just can't. I got over the feeling of wanting to kill myself, because I really don't want to take my own life. But all that left was utter and complete dark emptiness.

Everyday, I fucking wake up. Eat breakfast. Go to work. Drink. Come home to no one. Smoke. Eat dinner. Sleep. The monotony is the only thing keeping me alive, I have something to do. But this feeling has become so intense to the point of psychical pain. I also suffer from IBD which leaves me puking bile for 3 hours a day, it has been a miserable 3 years. 

 Constantly being in physical and emotional pain is to much to bear. The physical being the IBD and the emotional from not being with anyone for quite some time, I am just such an empty shell of a person I cannot attract anything around me. I have tried taking all your advice in the past of trying to do something that makes me happy, but their is nothing. Even my favorite thing, snowboarding, brings almost 0 joy to me. When I am around my family I cannot even fake a smile anymore, I just can't. I feel like such a cockhead because it seems like I just don't care about them.

I spendt my drive home tonight semi-drunk seriously considering smashing into the highway barries at the turns. And I mean seriosuly considering it. I cannot bear to think what it would do to my family though. I almost wish I had no family so I could just do it. 

This world is fucked for people like me, I am in such a dark whole there is no fucking return at this point. No one fucking acknowledges me and I am slowly becoming paranoid and it fucking scares me.
