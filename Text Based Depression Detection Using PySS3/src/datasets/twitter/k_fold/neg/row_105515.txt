I'm tired of this bullshit hereLike you said you'd help some people wait a bit in their lives and keep going until stuff gets a bit better but my problems here are not a side effect of a mental illness or a temporary sadness, I have extremely narcissistic parents, no friends and I come from an extremely poor family, I go weeks without eating and no one says anything about it because no one cares.

I understand that you might not find it ethical to help me with a good suicide method but I want you all to understand that my suffering is just aligned with my existence here and as long as I keep waking up every single day, so will the pain and so telling me "just keep going" and that shit really only makes things worse
