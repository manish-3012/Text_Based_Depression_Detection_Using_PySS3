Please help meI don't want to die but I can't live like this anymore. My roommate is my best friend and I don't want him to have to deal with rent he can't afford after I go. But... I cannot go back to work in two days. I just can't. No work means no money and no insurance for antidepressants and my adhd meds, and without those  I am beyond fucked.

I am just too high maintenance for this world. Does anyone know what I can do? My parents are out of the picture, I have no family to stay with, no friends aside from my roommate.  He knows about all of this but he can't help me. I cannot afford counseling. I am afraid death is my only way to escape now.
