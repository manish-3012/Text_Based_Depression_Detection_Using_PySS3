Alone, in need, but not an emergency yetI would like to talk to a text service of some kind but I don't feel my situation is dire enough that I want to occupy the time of the suicide hotline workers.

Is there a chat service of some type for people who are only a little suicidal?

I'm sorry if this makes no sense.
