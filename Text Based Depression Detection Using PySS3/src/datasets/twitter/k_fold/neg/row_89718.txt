Please somebody find the fucking combination of words to make this all betterI'm 17 years old, I'm horribly depressed, and I've fucked up my brain beyond belief with psychedelic drugs. A few months ago I had my first and only seizure, and finally three fucking months later they tell me there is an abnormality in my right temporal lobe and that we need to discuss the next "steps". I'm not allowed to drive due to risk of seizures, so I can't even get my fucking license. 

I'm a fucking idiot. I value my brain so much and I just want a clear head, but I ruined it by smoking weed everyday for over a year, and doing dangerous psychedelics and way too many mushrooms. My mind is fucked now and I think in weird fucked up ways, and I still get flashbacks to my bad trips. I fucked myself up at 17. My dreams are fucking dead. I can't do anything with a fucked up brain. Several people I know of on facebook have commited suicide and OD'd of Fentanyl, and they are getting so much fucking sympathy on their walls. It's getting to me. The idea seems to perfect. I want to live so bad but I don't want to deal with this SHIT. I want to kill myself, or at least attempt to and get some help. No one is taking me seriously right now. I'm trapped in my head and nobody knows how bad my depression is. FUCK THIS FUCKS THIS FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
