Ok. I'm sorry my players.I tried to be more active in life. Make more friemds. Do more things. I dm for dnd they are great people but I'm sorry. I too broken and suicidal to be good enough for them. I'm sorry. I am just a fucked up person who needs to die. I can't be who I want to be. My pain is so much. I write shit here because maybe someone found magic and will help me. I am just lost.
