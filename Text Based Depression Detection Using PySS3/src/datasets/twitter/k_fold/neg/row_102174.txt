I donâ€™t want to live but stuck in the limbo of not wanting to die..Got my new prescription today. I took 15mg of Valium (diazepam) earlier and chased it with another 20mg plus an entire bottle of wine and 1/3 of a mini JD. 

I donâ€™t want to die.. but I donâ€™t necessarily want to live. Debt, unhappy marriage, infertility, losing my job and not being qualified to do anything else but retail, borderline personality disorder.. itâ€™s all crumbled into one. At this point the peace of death is more satisfying than worrying about where my next payment for debt is going to come from. I have no qualifications in life.. just a stupid makeup artist.... if that.

Maybe I wonâ€™t wake up this time. Iâ€™ve fucking relapsed so many times... maybe my body is just so sick and tired of it. Idk what to do.. someone, anyone please help me

Ps thank god for aut correct
