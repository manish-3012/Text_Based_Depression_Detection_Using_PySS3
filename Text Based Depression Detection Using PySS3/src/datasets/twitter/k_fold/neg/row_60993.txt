Has anyone ever admitted themselves? Did you call an ambulance? What did you do? Should I drive? I am so angry and scaredMy mom gave me a Xanax last night because she thinks all Iâ€™m experiencing is anxiety. It didnâ€™t even help. I was still shaking and upset over how badly my father has treated me. I am having suicidal thoughts and rageful thoughts against my father who abused me long term.. it was spurred by him telling me to kill myself a few days ago. the disgusting asshole doesnâ€™t even believe that I have physical pain issues, which I have freaking medical record of. Itâ€™s maddening and making me go insane. He WANTS me to die!!  and I donâ€™t have anyone else to talk to. My boyfriend of 3 years was a lot like him, and I realized I stayed with him for so long just because I thought this emotional abuse and bullshit treatment was somewhat normal but Iâ€™m realizing how terrible it is.

Do psych hospitals give you something to make you feel slightly less awful?? Do they sedate you?? Or do they just stand around and look at you? What happens? How do you pay for it? I canâ€™t deal with thes feelings anymore I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself and researching ways
