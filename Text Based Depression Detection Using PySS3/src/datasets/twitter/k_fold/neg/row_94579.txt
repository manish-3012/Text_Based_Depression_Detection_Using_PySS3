I have been planningMy life was pretty hectic. My childhood horrible and full of abuses of all kinds. I tried to be normal but developed drug habits. Had to leave and get clean, so the family I created was also a wreck and I am no longer welcomed.
 I've been clean a while, even got offered an old job back
They fired me. I have nothing. Under my "new clear thinking frshly cleared mind" I decided to eliminate the debt I created while younger. Well now I have nothing and more bills than I can think of. I friend lets me stay in his basement. My child hates visiting. My girlfriend is afraid to use the bathroom here because it is not "my house". The room is not free so that debt is adding up. I do not want to do any of this anymore. Anything. I figure Ill hang myself. Wear a diaper and put a plastic tarp down so there isnt much to clean. Nothing ever gets better. As long as I remember over my 31 ears is that I am always in pain and have never been happy.
