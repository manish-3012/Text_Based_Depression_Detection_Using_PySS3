I desperately wish I was brave enough to do the only thing that would make all the hurt and thoughts go away.If only I could do it. To not have to think back on memories all the time. Imagine new ones that are just as painful. To not be reliant on people that don't want me there, and not feel so abandoned when they want to spend time with people they love, that's not me. 

I tried so hard. I've tried counselling, medication, meditation, suicide hotlines, and chat room. Working to keep my mind occupied, "self-care". I thought at some point, something would click, and I could get better. But I can't stop feeling this love lost. I can't help wishing every day that I would be in a fatal accident, so then my family wouldn't know that I desperately wanted to be dead, but I could finally stop.
