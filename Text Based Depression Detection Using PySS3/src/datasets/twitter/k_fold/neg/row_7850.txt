The pills don't work and I desperately want it all to be overI've had depression for more than half of my life now... I just can't see the light at the end of the tunnel any more. When the fluoxetine works it turns me into an emotionless robot... when it doesn't I feel just as bad as I've always done. I don't want to live my life like this, I just want it to be over and me to be six feet under. I can't concentrate on my uni work at all (when I have the energy to get out of bed) and I spend a lot of time obsessing over how useless and disgusting and worthless I am. The person I loved the most lied to me and used me and I can't get over it... I don't feel anything for anyone any more. One of my housemates tried to hang herself a couple of weeks ago and she almost managed it and I was so so jealous... I was prescribed propanolol a while back and I kept them and it would be so easy to take enough to stop my heart.
