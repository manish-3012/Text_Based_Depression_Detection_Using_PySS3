I am pathetic and I should be deadThis is gonna sound extremely pathetic but I have an imaginary girlfriend. Itâ€™s the only thing that helps me cope with the fact that I am ugly and undesired.

In high school, I was very self conscious around the fact that I am socially awkward and ugly. In one of my classes, I sat at a table with 3 girls and they all pretty much mocked me by saying something like â€œhey, would you date /u/iwanttodie777?â€ They all started laughing pretty much in my face. I was already feeling worthless about myself, and now Iâ€™m even worse.

Now that I am in college, I avoid talking to everyone now as much as possible. I will never trust anybody anymore. 

It hurts to realize that Iâ€™ll pretty much live the rest of my life alone if I donâ€™t kill myself. Itâ€™s clear that I am ugly and undesirable to others. Most people just donâ€™t want to say it directly to my face. 

I am a complete burden to everyone. Loneliness hurts so much when people decide to call you out on it and rub it in your face. 

I hope reincarnation is real. Hopefully when I kill myself I can reincarnate as a socially competent good looking person
