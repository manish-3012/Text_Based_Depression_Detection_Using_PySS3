Don't feel anything anymoreNot hungry, or thirsty, or angry, or even sad. I just feel numb. I'm empty. I don't see why I shouldn't just jump off something 15 stories tall. Or buy some heroin and OD. I've never done drugs so it won't take much. There's no point. There's nothing. I'm nothing. I don't care about anything anymore. My life is piss and shit. So why do I have to continue to wade through shit and waste time. Especially when I'm just gonna die anyway. Continuing to live just seems like torture with extra steps.
