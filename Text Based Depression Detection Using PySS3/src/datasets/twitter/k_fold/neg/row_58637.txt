Rock-bottom againI spend a great deal of time pretending and faking myself. I have attempted numerous times to make friends, and stay sane.

My entire time in school I have been a loner, but not a loner by choice. For some reason I find myself on the outside of every person or group I encounter.

I got a job outside of school and thought that would help, I have co workers my age the only problem is that these people can drive, they are independent. My parents never went through with helping me get a license so I can't drive. These co workers are light years ahead of me with social skills.

I also can't seem to ever do a good job and often times people tell me how I am not doing enough and i will be soon fired... even in school no one in my film class nor computer class says I do a good job. I often miss questions I should have known, and I am generally made fun of because I make a mistake.

One of my goals was to become an author and after I self published my first book I didn't get any interest despite fake people telling me it was good... I wanted to give up but then I got into computer programming.

I like to think I am good at programming however when i talk to others who actually have the skill set they say I am not the type. People who know nothing about computers say I am awesome though.

I am going to be 19 in may and I don't have necessary skills to survive in this world.

For me suicide isn't going to be drastic, I will only do it once I know all my options have run out. Since I have attempted three times in my life already I fear a fourth will come up soon. I am not even sure why I am posting this, I don't know what I want. Most of the time I don't even know why I am upset.
