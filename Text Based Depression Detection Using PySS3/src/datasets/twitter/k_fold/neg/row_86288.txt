LonelyI feel so incredibly sad and lonely today. I go through my days alone, not connecting with anyone, not being touched or loved or hugged. Just existing by sleeping or laying in bed. Like a caged animal being kept alive just so I donâ€™t upset anyone by dying. I feel like my life isnâ€™t my own, and hasnâ€™t been for a long time. And Iâ€™ve forgotten how to make it my own. I am quite literally just being kept alive for others, even though they probably get more pain out of my being here than my not.
