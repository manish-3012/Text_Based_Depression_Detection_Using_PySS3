unfinished suicide &amp; being away for two months? iâ€™m fucking sorry for being alive.well.. i guess you could understand that my motive failed.. i did leave myself in a very bad condition and i had to be taken care of for this whole time... iâ€™m still constantly being watched and i have very little time alone. iâ€™m sorry that it didnâ€™t work out. iâ€™m very sorry. i just canâ€™t seem to find a totally working way out. i was so freaking close this time, but again. a failed try. iâ€™m sorry.
