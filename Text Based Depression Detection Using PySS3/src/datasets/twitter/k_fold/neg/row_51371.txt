Every time things start going up , I fuck it up personallyIâ€™m scared, I know Iâ€™m changing and improving, but that doesnâ€™t stop the fuck ups, just makes them less often, and they always still hit just as hard. Therapy scares the fuck out of me, Iv never tried it, and am looking into it, but I donâ€™t know how to bring myself to really completing the steps. Or be normal talking to a stranger, I feel super lost an inclosed, this fuck up was big, my heart feels clenched and like I need to be in a tight space to feel better. I donâ€™t know how to control the feeling or what to do about it, and it always gets worse. Idk Iâ€™m rambling I just need something.
