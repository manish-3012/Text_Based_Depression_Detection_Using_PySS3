No where else to goIâ€™ll start this off by saying that Iâ€™m 16 and today I might attempt for the 3rd time in my life. I have been going through a lot in myself. A lot of self hatred and drug abuse. I take things like ibuprofen not cause Iâ€™m in physical pain, but just cause because I have nothing better to do. Iâ€™m sick of everything and everyone. People donâ€™t even seem to care how I feel. I canâ€™t even look in the mirror anymore, canâ€™t stand looking at myself. Even being inside my own head sucks. I hate it cause I donâ€™t like anything about myself. I need someone who not only cares, but also understands what itâ€™s like to feel the way Iâ€™m feeling.
