Why even bother.19y/o m

Back in September i almost ended my life but i didn't, more and more though i keep thinking that was a mistake not to.
I got bullied for 9 years, i have never really had a friend, and besides my mom, my family doesn't even acknowledge my existence let alone that i am family.

I have tried for months to make friends but i always find myself looking like a fool. There is a Female i have a crush on but whenever i talk to her she gives one word answers and acts so uninterested in me. i try to make freinds but after a week or two we never talk again.

I am glad i have never drank or used a drug because if i did, i would probability lose control of myself and end my life, but everyday a drink looks more tempting to make me forget the pain.

I live my day hiding my feelings but when i get home i feel like the worst thing on the planet and by time i go to sleep i am near or in tears. When I wake up in the morning and feel like the physical embodiment of pain and the cycle continues. I just want it to stop, i want to give up.
