VengeanceI (15f) want to shoot up my school, hopefully have a lot of casualties if I get bombs involved, but like bombs are even harder to get than guns. Anyways. I want to kill the students in my school. The ones who live better lives than me in particular. The ones who live the typical, teenage life. The ones with the boyfriends, the ones in clubs, the ones passionate about their career and future. The ones eager to live life. Those ones specifically I want to kill. The one thing theyâ€™re soooo happy about and excited to wake up everyday. And the normies. I want to kill them all, and let their friends watch. And then kill myself. I would kill the inconsiderate teachers too. But only the ones who failed me last year. The stupid fucking neckbeard with his stupid fucking drawings who plays childrenâ€™s video games on steam like a fucking child. And the stupid fucking arrogant teacher who I will not specify, because you never know. Oh, and he has a son too. Iâ€™d take great pleasure in knowing his normie sun has to live the rest of his life with his stupid fa**ot dad dead. After this massacre, is like to end my miserable life :)
