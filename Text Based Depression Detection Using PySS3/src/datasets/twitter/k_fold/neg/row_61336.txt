Here's a song i wrote 2 years ago and i will sing it and upload it the day i planned on dyingI wrote this song in hopes of just making myself feel better cause everyone who used to praise my traits were the same people who made me feel bad about the very same traits when they stopped using me.
Here's a part of that song. 

No one really likes me
Guess im pretty ugly
I know im no good
I never understood
If i could leave i really would

Guess i'll need to be sad
Cause i can never be mad
i always used to cry
My eyes have now gone dry
They've cut my wings and now i cannot fly

They tell me go die in a ditch
It's the fourth of july 
but now it feels like a hitch
They'll see the fireworks
I'll be home i'll rehearse
How to say my last goodbyes and i'll glitch.
