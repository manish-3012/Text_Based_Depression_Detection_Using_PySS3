I'm cursed. (Venting I guess?)I swear to God above that I'm cursed to watch all my family and friends give up and kill themselves, while I somehow manage to get by. My aunt killed herself years ago, my sister and best friend both talk about killing themselves, my dad attemped, my s/o attempted, and I've lost 5 other friends to suicide.

I really can't watch this train wreck anymore I don't know what to do to cope.
