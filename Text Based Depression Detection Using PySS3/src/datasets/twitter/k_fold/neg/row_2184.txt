I hate birthdayâ€™sI hate birthdays

Its always the same I get my hopes up that something â€žmagicalâ€œ would happen but in the end itâ€™s like  any other day. I guess Iâ€™m to old to except something or to celebrate it. I spend the past birthdays with a bottle of whiskey and my messed up head. 

I turned off the option that notifies people about my birthdays on social media years ago. I wanted to see who would actually remember and well nobody did. Like this year except for my two best friends. I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™ll get always get depressed. I guess I just except to much in the end itâ€™s just a regular day and I shouldnâ€™t except people to kiss my ass just because of it. I know I sound like a child.

Also Iâ€™m kinda sad that my best gal pal, who is also my crush, forgot about it too...

Iâ€™ll most likely spend the day with my two best friends and do the same stuff we do everyday; getting stoned for like 3-4 hours and then Iâ€™m getting home and just go to bed which is depressing me but I donâ€™t know what to do else.

â€œHappyâ€ birthday to me, I guess.
