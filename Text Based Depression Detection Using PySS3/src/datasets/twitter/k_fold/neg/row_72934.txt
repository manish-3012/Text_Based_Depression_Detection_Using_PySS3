Is it time to end it?To keep this long story short I feel that I have dug myself into a hole that I can't get out of. I have dealt with social issues throughout  my 20s; never fitting in while watching my siblings rise to the top in every aspect of their lives. I have dealt with alcoholism and depression as a result of this that in turn has led me to go to four different colleges. I am now at my fifth, have an overall gpa of 1.9 combined and am nearing the end of my rope. What is even worse is that I am pursuing a social science degree so marketability is nonexistent and assuming I do finish I will be 29 and completely behind. I feel alone, have few friends and appear to have found myself in a predicament that has resulted in abysmal failure with a future that seems to have no light at the end of the tunnel.
