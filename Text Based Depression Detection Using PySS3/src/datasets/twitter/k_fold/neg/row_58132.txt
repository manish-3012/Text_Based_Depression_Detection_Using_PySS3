My friend broke our anti-suicide pact. Do I have the right to be mad?Hi,

This morning, my friend informed me through a group chat with my other friends that they were â€œcoming down off a semi-suicide attemptâ€. This upset me as, a few months ago, they talked me away from my suicidal thoughts and suggested we enter a no-suicide pact.

Yesterday, I reached out to them because they suggested that they were feeling suicidal in a post on social media. I suggested we talk it about it. I asked when they would be available to talk. They continued texting me and making social media post as normal. I texted them again and asked how they were doing. They continued to act normally. I stopped trying and hoped they were fine. It was clear they didnâ€™t want to talk it out.

Flash forward to this morning, they admitted to carrying out a â€œsemi-suicide attemptâ€. I got mad. I texted them to remind them about our pact and stated that since it didnâ€™t do anything, I was considering it null and void.

I donâ€™t want to be an asshole, but when I thought about killing myself, I always thought about how that wouldnâ€™t be honoring my friend and Iâ€™s agreement. I feel a bit cheated and useless. Iâ€™m not sure if I have a right to feel anything. I just do. 

Do I have the right to be mad? How can I not make things any worse?
