I have no one and I feel emptyHello,

Apologies if all of this sounds incredibly clichÃ© but I don't know where to go or who to talk too.

I feel nothing but an urge to just end everything. I have no friends anymore, I was made to stop speaking to them by my partner. I turned to twitter to speak to someone, anyone but he found it and so I had to get rid of it. My partner thinks I'm a "slut" because I was abused by multiple men when I was younger and refuses to trust me no matter what I do.

Nobody at my work likes me. I have severe anxiety issues due to the above and I was described by my boss as "autistic" to others. This was then made even worse when they found out about me being transgender and decided the best course of action would be to tell everyone in the office. When I'm not at work, I stay in my bedroom at home and do nothing but lie there.

I want to end it all but I can't even bring myself to self harm properly. I swallow lots of pills every other day and nothing happens. I want to cry but I can't even do that, I feel entirely numb.

Maybe I am a slut, maybe I am the weird kid at work. I don't know, I want it all to go away.

Thanks for listening. Sorry once again for sounding clichÃ© and complaining.
