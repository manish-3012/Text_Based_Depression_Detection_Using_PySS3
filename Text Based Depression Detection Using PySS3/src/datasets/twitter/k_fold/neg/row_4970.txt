Everything is getting me down. I'm at a loss for... everythingThe first thing I should probably explain is, I'm 17. It's probably somewhat pertinent.
I struggle to recall a period of time greater than 2 weeks where I haven't had everything ranging from "Stuff sucks" to "I'm really sick of this, I just want to die." thoughts or even suicide attempts.

The tl;dr of it is:

I'm in love with a girl who doesn't reciprocate it.

I can't finish anything I start. (Hobby, education,...)

I hate feeling like a constant stream of failure toward my father. He is THE greatest man I have ever met and no matter how much I want to be a success and make him proud, I always fuck things up. ALWAYS. I've been avoiding contact with him for the last 2-3 months because of this.

I hate the fact I'm overweight. I really do try to lose weight but it's a struggle and back to the second point, I can never seem to finish anything I start.

I hate the way that I can get jealous over the smallest of things.

I really don't see a point to being around here anymore. I'm just a burned upon my friends, family and even to people I haven't even met like the government who're subsidising my education (Which I've broken, again).

I'm not even sure why I'm posting. I've erased and re-written this post several times now. I don't know what I'm trying to say anymore.
The last few day have been a haze to me. I can only recall vague parts of my day and they're usually the worst. Things like, the cutting and the fact I've taken up smoking even though I find it disgusting.

My mind is a mess.
