Are suicidal thoughts ever "healthy" or therapeutic?First time posting here. I (26m) have been going through a depression for about a year and a half. I've always thought about death a lot and shrugged it off as just my own grim curiosity. I frequent r/watchpeopledie  and stuff like that so death doesn't bother me much. 

Anyways, lately I've had more and thoughts of suicide. I won't say I had thoughts of killing MYSELF, but I often find myself sitting there wondering what if? 

I honestly have never had a desire to be dead or kill myself. I have a desire to NOT be sad anymore,but I don't THINK I'd hurt myself,  I really don't know. 

So my question is...is it okay to have these thoughts? Or is that thought process something that will only bring bad things and worse thoughts?
