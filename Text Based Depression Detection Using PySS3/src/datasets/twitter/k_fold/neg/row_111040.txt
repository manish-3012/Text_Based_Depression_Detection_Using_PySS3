I'm SorryI feel like that's all that needed to be said. I have no hardship, I have no problems in comparison to those around me. By society's standards, I am succeeding. I'm in grad school, I'm intelligent, athletic, have good friends. But I'm not okay. Loss, sexual assault, stress, and exhaustion are taking their toll. So I'm sorry that I feel this way when I've got so many good things. I'm sorry I can't do better for you, for me, for anyone. I'm so sorry.
