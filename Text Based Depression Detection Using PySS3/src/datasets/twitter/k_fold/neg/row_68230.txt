17 days lefti have a limited time left.. i canâ€™t even leave home.. you should feel safe at home but i donâ€™t. itâ€™s like a hell for me...

today my friends called me crying that theyâ€™re worried about me. you donâ€™t know how hard it was to pretend. i just donâ€™t want them to get hurt.

should i just leave earlier?
