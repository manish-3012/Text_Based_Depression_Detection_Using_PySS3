I woke up this morning feeling suicidal for no apparent reason.I've always thought of suicide as not just a bad idea, but a stupid idea.  It's never worth it in the long run (okay, maybe sometimes, but not usually).

Anyway, this morning I woke up and I felt VERY depressed.  I wanted to commit suicide and I began planning it out.  I deleted my facebook account and looked up online guides to a painless death.

The problem is that I REALLY don't want to commit suicide, and I'm scared that one day I'll wake up like that and carry through with my plans!

I get high 80s-low 90s in school (grade 10), and have a girlfriend and a family and no traumatic events in my past.  I'm VERY apathetic, and when someone accidentally wrongs me I try hard not to make them feel bad about it.  I do occasionally take a few hits , but nothing else so I don't think that would have caused it.

The only other time in my life like this was when I was around 7 or 8 I seriously considered suicide because I was bored of living, but I don't feel this way anymore.

Any advice or help with this?
