Christmas depression?Before I start, I am not a native english speaker and I am far from good.
Guess everyone else has their own problems, but I rly need to get this off my chest, cos it is killing me..
My Girlfriend of 2 years and I broke up half a month ago, because IÂ´ve been super busy with work and got somewhat depressed again( I am depressed for like 7 years now, but I got some episodes, where I feel kind a ok. A month ago, I met another girl.. before you start judging me, I did never cheat in my life. I felt connected to her from the first second.. We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot. I couldnt get her out of my head.. not even now. My girlfriend and I broke up, without me telling her, that the other girl is also a reason from my perspective. Now itÂ´s this special time in the year, where I realize, how lonely I am. My parents are deworsed, so there isnt rly anything going at xmas, which means, I stay at home and drink all day or am doing drugs, which I started doing again some weeks ago (IÂ´ve been addicted in my youth). I was really looking forward to new years eve, cos I wanted to see the girl and some pals, who live far away from here, because they study. The girl wont be here, til the second of january and the other guys arenÂ´t comming home either, which means, that I will be alone, once again.. I wanted to talk to the girl, about how I feel and stuff, but I got friendzoned, before I had any chance to react.. I mean I am not bad looking and I can play the sunny guy pretty well (making jokes and being fun to be with), but she seems not to be interested.. all of this is pretty much nothing to be sad about, I guess, but with my past, my depressive thoughts and fragile mind, it really hurts me.. Even while I had my relationship, I rarely had positiv episodes. I drank and cut myself on a daily base. I really just need someone to be there.. I am too smart, to think, someone would actually care, but I donÂ´t care at the moment.. I just want someone to pretend.. someone to hold me and stop me from falling.. at this point, I would even love to see a comment.. just knowing, someone wasted their time, reading this..
