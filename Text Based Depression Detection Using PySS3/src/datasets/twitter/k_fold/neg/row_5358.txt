I'm going downhillI just want to fking die, I can't do anything in my house. My family will always do anything they can to make me feel bad. I'm having anger issues because I can never express how I feel or if something is bothering me without getting in trouble. I just bottle it up, every time I feel mad I bottle it up. I'm in the point where I want to punch my sister and my mom right in their face for everything (I'm a girl btw I'm not a misogynist guy). I'm all the day in my room doing nothing, I feel like I'm already dead, I want to die but I don't have any way to kill myself. I feel like I am the problem when I know I am not, I don't want to be like this. I want to feel able to say how I feel without being manipulated or threatened. I'm just 18 man let me live
