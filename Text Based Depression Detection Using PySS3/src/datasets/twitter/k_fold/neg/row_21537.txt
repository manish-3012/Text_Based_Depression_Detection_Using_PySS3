Please help meI don't want to die. I just don't want to live anymore and currently don't see any alternatives. If I don't do it I'll hear about how "happiness is a choice" and how I don't have anything to be sad/depressed about. I'll be stuck with "friends" who don't know how I really am inside, a brother who is worse, parents who don't seem to be understanding, and nobody to really talk to about it. But if I do it, I'll have sweet, sweet relief. Relief from everything that has plagued me for so long. I'm physically in pain. I'm so lonely. I'm scared about my future. I'm so tired. I want it all to stop but it hasn't.




Please help me. What else is there to do?
