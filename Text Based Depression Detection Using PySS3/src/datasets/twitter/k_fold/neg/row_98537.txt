Please help, someone could be in trouble. For Jolie QuinnnA week ago I saw a few posts from an account about her suicidal depression, so I started talking to her and she would usually reply really quick, but in the last three days or so she hasn't replied to a single message of mine, but just posted on suicidewatch saying she wants to be gone. I know she browses this sub and it would be really helpful if she or someone she knows could see this and get her some help.
