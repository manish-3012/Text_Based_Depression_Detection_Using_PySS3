My mental health is deteriorating badlyI am getting sicker and sicker. It's just too hard to function anymore. Day to day life is too hard to do whilst dealing with severe mental health issues. I can't live this way and don't want to see the future where I am even worse.

Today is the last appointment with my doctor. After this I will try my best to slit my wrists.
