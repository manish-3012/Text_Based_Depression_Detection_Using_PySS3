When am I going to finally have it in me to do it?All my suicide attempts have been failures. It's hard to get myself to do it, my fight or flight always kicks in. My survival impulses kept me alive when I was living on the streets and like a few weeks ago when the car I was in burst into flames, I don't think, I just act. So when I tried to hang myself I panicked and got myself free. Couldn't pull the trigger on a gun. And then when I tried to OD, turns out  my liver is extremely resilient. Its frustrating, I'm so tired and I just want out of it all. I'm about to be homeless again and I have no plans, no desires, just no interest in existing, so I don't know what I'm gonna do. Killing myself is the route I'd like to take but I can't even manage that, so I guess I just wait until something else kills me?
