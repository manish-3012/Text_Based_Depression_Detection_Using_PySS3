Im an 18 yo mother who is having a miscarriage.My first child was born perfectly health, good pregnancy and delivery, he's 2 now and has lots of people who love him. I met this amazing man about a year ago and he is the best step father and husband, he deserves a child more than any man ive met and i wanted to be the one he had a baby with. 3 weeks ago we found out we were pregnant and we were both thrilled. Last night i started bleeding and went to the ER where they told us our baby was gone. Ive been self harming with cuts and burns ever since, i dont know what to do anymore.. I just want to die.
