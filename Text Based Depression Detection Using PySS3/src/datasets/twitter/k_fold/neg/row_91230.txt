I was destined to failAnxiety and ADHD. What a toxic fucking cocktail. I try SO HARD...and I hit a wall every goddamn time. Had I confronted this shit earlier in life...maybe I'd be somewhere. Maybe I'd be *someone*. But no. It took me 9 years to get a (useless) bachelor's degree...and now I'm not even good enough to work in the dining-services department of my former university. I tell myself I'm an "artist", but all my shit sucks. I frustrate everyone around me with every single move I make. Even though I don't intend to be careless or lazy...I'll *always* come off that way, there's no getting around it.

I'm too big a wuss to commit suicide. I just wish could disappear and manifest again as someone (or something) else.
