Tried many times and have failed. I need your helpI usually take my perscriptions and sleeping pills along with Paracetomol and alcohol but I have never met my end. Is there any other options I could try? Was thinking drinking spirits that cut though throat. Would that even do anything?

Im not looking for a way back out. I have chosen my path and it makes it so much harder everytime I fail.
