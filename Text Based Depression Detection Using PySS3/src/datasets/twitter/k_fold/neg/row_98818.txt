It's all laughable and nonsensical. What a stupid life, what a difficult choice to make. It's about time I kill myself, I just don't know how, I'm too scaredMan I don't care about opinions and I won't judge anyone. What's the point of it all, isn't it going to end someday. Judge, attack, and even persecute whoever your beliefs and ideals don't align with, it won't matter in the grand scheme of things (cuz it's all pointless). People getting all jumpy and uppity about genocide while it's a very good thing in my opinion for a person too cowardly to take his/her own life. Or getting uptight about other crimes like theft, murder, rape, and pedophilia. All of it doesn't matter, all of it is pointless nothing not even fiction, (oh ah sorry I mean religion) can help you get out off this existential void. Fuck life. Fuck cause and effect.
You know, in my opinion, the worst and most painful thing is how indifferent the universe and cause and effect are. Just painful. No regard for "fairness" or "justice". You just play the game with the cards you've been given, limited by your own body and mind from becoming (your) ideal/perfect person. I've always been told that I  catastrophize a lot but I think I'm being realistic. Life is pointless but y'all (at least most of you who follow "morality" and "goodness") are just too cowardly to look reality and the ultimate meaninglessness of life right in the eye. But I don't blame you, we all have our limits and weaknesses, I for one can't bring myself to commiting suicide, I'm not brave enough. I hide behind a facade (search for painless death) and convince myself that it's better that way. But killing yourself is the best and most honest response to a crappy world like ours. If I could I would kill all of you instead, every single human aliveâ€”dead. Imagine yourself, you, as the last human alive. Wouldn't it be fucking great, what a nice peaceful life it would be. But that's just a pipe dream, killing yourself is way more practical and realistic. I'm going to post this on r/suicidewatch it's better there, I'm late to this thread anyways, nobody would read this much on reddit which makes me feel even more worthless and more pointless. Fuck everything, what is this hell. We are already in hell now that I think about it. This is it, stop fantasizing about fire or flames, this is hell, at least my experience, as a poor minor citizen in a shitty place on earth. Somewhere you don't even belong to, it's just a sad place that you can't relate to. But you might relate to my feelings. Don't be surprised if you find this on the other sub I mentioned above. If you read till here, well that's just amazing. This is one thing that I can't deny, someone actually caring feels nice, but it's all pointless. Thanks, but I'm sorry, it's what it is. Thanks for sticking till here.
