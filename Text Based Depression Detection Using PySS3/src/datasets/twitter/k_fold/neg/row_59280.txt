I hate this world.I dont hate myself. 

I hate this cruel world. 

I hate society and society hates me. Thats fine. 

I am living on the wrong planet. I need to leave. 

But I am too afraid of death, so I stay here and suffer everyday. 

Until I cant handle it anymore. 

Then I will explode and leave everything behind me.
