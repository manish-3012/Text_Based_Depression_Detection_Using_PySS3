I don't want to hurt himI just need to let this out some where...

I want to die so bad. Looking over at these pills while I sip my booze, I think how much it would take to kill me. Do I have enough? I love my SO with all my heart, if I were to live I could not imagine a world without him. But sometimes its not enough, hes so far away it pains me.

Because of my own stupidity I have dropped out of college, gained an excess amount of weight and lost close friends. I lost my job a few weeks ago. 

I feel so alone. I spend every day wishing to see people, but once they call or plans are introduced into the picture I want to shut off the world. Make excuses, be alone. This house is my safety net and yet my prison.  I cant get out of bed in the morning.

I really don't want to hurt him. He is seriously the only person I care deeply about, but I don't know if I can do this any more. I cant take it, but it would kill him if I were to die.

Do I have enough pills?
