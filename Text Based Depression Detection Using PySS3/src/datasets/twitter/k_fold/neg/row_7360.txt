School, Work, Value, blah blah blahI realized I was more than just unhappy this spring when I sat on the edge of a rooftop for hours and started writing goodbye notes. I spent at least a dozen nights sitting on a bridge looking out into the water, and I can't remember how many people would just walk by like they didn't want the crying kid to be their problem.   


I'm going back to school soon and all I can think of is that I don't want to do it all again. There's no point. I've signed a contract that should pay me an obscene amount of money after graduation, and all I can think about is that I didn't do as well as I could have, that it'll never be enough.   


What are you supposed to do when you don't really want to die, but you definitely don't want to live? I don't know how long I can go, waiting for something to change things. What the fuck are you supposed to do, just sit and wait until one day you're in your 30s or 40s or 50s and you realize that you are still working your whole life for things that don't make you happy? Why is it so hard for people to understand wanting to just sleep and not wake up?
