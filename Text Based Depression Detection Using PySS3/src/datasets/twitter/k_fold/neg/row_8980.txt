Compulsion is getting pretty persistentTrying to keep things short:

I guess I'm described as having dysthymia? Anyways, my emotional lows never get too low, and my highs are non existent... anything that gets me feeling remotely good is very transient. I think this is the way I naturally am, nothing is especially bad about my life (currently in college).

Honestly, I don't think I can get much more out of life, I have no passions or anything I want to pursue. I've some how managed As so far in my college career but things slipped a bit last semester. I don't care so much though. 

Life isn't bad but it doesn't feel worthwhile. I can't imagine anything that would make it so. Even the thought of having great wealth and travelling the world freely barely draws any sort of reaction out of me.

However, I do sort of want something: to buy a revolver and stick it in my mouth. I've researched prices and how to execute it to ensure death so I guess it's a pretty serious want. Sort of problematic because a part of me would also like to find something to live for. I guess there's still something in me that hopes but I'm fairly certain that I won't find whatever it is because it doesn't exist.

More frequently now I will get bouts of sadness that physically manifests itself as a shooting pain that originates on the left side of my chest and runs along my left shoulder. This is usually accompanied by a compulsion to kill myself.

I'm working out n' junk to try to lift myself out of funks. It helps but obviously it's not enough. I do have hobbies and stuff that I do with friends but meh. I went to go see a university therapist, she said that sessions might not be helpful to me because I don't really want to help myself. Which is true I think.

So, any ideas?
