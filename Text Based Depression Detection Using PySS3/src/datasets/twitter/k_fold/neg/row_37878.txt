I have accumulated $140 in overdraft fees.Iâ€™m 19 years old, have struggled with myself since I was 14. Not to bad tho, started working at 16. Moved out at 18 due to family issues. Family overworking me for family problems. Tomorrow is my last day of work. Last month, I got laid off. Have absolutely no savings. Not even close to being on good terms with my old folks. I donâ€™t wanna be homeless. But if it comes to that, so be it. Iâ€™m hurt tho. Iâ€™ve been working my ass off for years. All day, everyday. And the minute something goes wrong, Iâ€™m in the fucking shitter.
