I really understand why suicide is a thing.Honestly,with all that's gonna happen(i.e,Nuclear war) and with a doomed world,what the fuck is the point of life? what is the point of living?

Why not die?

Suicide..it's a actually a rather good idea.

I mean,you only go to sleep for ALL of eternity,so why not,right?
