I'd like someone to talk me out of this way of thinking:I'm not in any immediate danger of committing suicide, but I've felt the suicide bug creeping up my leg for a good 6 months now. Life is very difficult and only seems to get more and more difficult and lonely every day. But that's not what I want to talk about, I want to talk about one of the many rationalizations that pop into my head when things get bad.

This is obviously not my sole reason to do it, but it's a small idea. A couple years ago I was surrounded by people who I really cared about and who cared me. Since then in various instances I've felt terribly betrayed by every one of them, family, friends, and lovers. Not just cheap fuck ups, but serious damaging things that I didn't deserve and will have consequences for the rest of my life. Things that you don't do to people you care about.

Now these people still inhabit similar roles in my life, but it's never going to be the same again. It seems like to a lot of them that nothing's changed, but I'm not the same person. I'm a lot worse off emotionally and a lot of things that were done will affect me for the rest of my life. I don't feel I've gotten the retribution I deserve and my big final revenge idea is just to off myself. Not solely for "revenge" but also because my life is just insanely fucked and I am insanely fucked. I had everything anyone could ever want a year ago and now it's gone. 

I just feel like the suicide would make those people realize "oh damn, what I did was fucked up.". I want them to feel as badly as they made me feel because I know they still care despite their stupid poorly justified mistakes. But like I said that's just one justification of many. I'd love to hear some cold hard logic about why that's a terrible reason to commit suicide (other than suicide being generally a terrible idea).
