I wanna feel happy again, it was beautifulI always believed if i work harder I'll have a better life.  
I have a friend we where used to be so close to each other. in school he was just a lazy guy always just joking around and never study and on other other side I always worked and studied hard. I was better than him but he just had MONEY. now after about 2-3 years I'm looking at his life and I see he have things that I dreamed of... studying in grate collage, grate job, grate relationship, friends, and ofc money. I know he is my friend and i should be happy for him but it's not fair, I should be the one with a good life, I worked way harder for a better life. he just had the MONEY  
and what about me? I'm just a loser who is still lives in his parents house in hope that he will have a better life if he works harder. I don't even have anyone to talk with him. I feel trapped   


while ago I took a exam for a grate university in a grate city and finally I got accepted! and yesterday I went to sign up for the university. it was kinda far so I had to stay the night there in that city and I was so happy, I just walked around the city all night and I was soooo happy, I was just so happy I didn't want the night to end. I never were this happy in my fucking life I swear the god... I thought finally I'm going to have a better life. after the night  I went to sign up in the morning but guess what, it was too expensive. I couldn't pay for the university... and there it all was gone.  


I come back home and I just don't think I could live any more... a beautiful life, a beautiful feature I almost had it.

there is nothing for me left here. I just can't take it. now that I saw how happy the real life is I can't handle this any more

I just wanna fell like that again  
I just wanna fell like that again
