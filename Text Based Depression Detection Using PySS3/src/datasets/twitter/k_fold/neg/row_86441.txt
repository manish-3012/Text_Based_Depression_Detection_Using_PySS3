Suicide is quite appearant right now.Lately, my life has been quite simply, down the shitter. My mom yells at me a lot and my parents argue a lot. Each time they do, it feels like a repeat of the past and just brings me back to a worse time.

After my dad had a "incident" and after I fractured my wrist, my life has gone in a down ward spiral. My music was the drug that was keeping me from killing myself. For a while. After a while it just gets boring. If I get to the point to where I'm gonna kill myself, this will be attempt number 3.

I need help. My parents can't help. Please help.
