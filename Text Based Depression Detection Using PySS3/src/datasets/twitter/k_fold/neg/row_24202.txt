My family has finally given me permission to kill myself.Now I'm finally at peace knowing that my future girlfriend/wife won't ever have to meet the piece of shit that I am.

I could've made it through depression, but I'm not gonna because my future love doesn't deserve the baggage I have.

I love you, my future darling. I hope you forgive me for leaving you before we ever met. But it's for your own good. I know you'll find a guy much better than me.
