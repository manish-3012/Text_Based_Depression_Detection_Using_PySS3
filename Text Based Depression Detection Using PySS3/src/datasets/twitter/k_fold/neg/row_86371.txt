I wonder who really caresI know its really selfish to say, but sometimes I wish I could just try killing myself (not succeeding) so I could simply see how people would react. How many of my "friends" would really care? I'm sure some would be sad, but how long would it last? How long would it take for them to go back to not caring about my depression?

I know people will be sad when I die, but does it really matter if they are? No one cared enough to try supporting me better when I was still breathing, so why should it matter if my death upsets them? 

Who knows, maybe I'll get to find out the answer to that question real soon. And then maybe I'll know.
