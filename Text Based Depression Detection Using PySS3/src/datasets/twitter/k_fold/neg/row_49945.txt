Weight obsession?Iâ€™ll keep it short as iâ€™m tryna go to bed although I doubt i could when having a mental breakdown and wanting to bleed to death...

Iâ€™m obsessed with my weight to the point where I cannot be awake or in the present or reality because i like summer vacation because i donâ€™t travel the world and sleep all day and donâ€™t eat and lose weight and be pretty and wear size 4 US which isnâ€™t bad but during quarantine things escalated to size 8 US and I weigh 155 lbs when i used to weigh 127 lbs on avg and &lt;120 when i try to lose weight...

My weight is the icing on the cake on all the damned things that ive been thru or are happening to me... numbers donâ€™t matter but i feel like I cannot breathe or dit in my clothes because i used to fit in size S. Many would think iâ€™m still sexually attractive or whatever because Iâ€™m curvey but I donâ€™t fucking care i feel like a balloon and iâ€™m scared that im slowly gonna turn obese and then im legit killing myself no matter what it fucking takes i never wannna be like that. Iâ€™d rather be too skinny.

Iâ€™m wearing high heels every day at home and eating one full meal and diving it and snacking and foinf hungry and exercising and trying to sleep 12 hours a day and idk what to do more because i hate life i hate everything but i hate being a fat slut like i cannot take it and my parents or family will tear me apart for gaining weight and do the same for losing so much weight because iâ€™ve seen how they are both ways

I just wanna die how do i ensure my death!?!!?! Been reading about so many failed attempts why are u guys failing What the fuck is wrong tell me ?? I donâ€™t wanna fail

Td;lr title says it all iâ€™m just ranting.
How can i not fail my attempt?
