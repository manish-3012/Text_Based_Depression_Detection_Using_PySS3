i made a promise, but i dont think i can keep iti promised myself that i will not end my life until im 20, so i can wait and see if things change, if i get help or if i suddenly feel okay. but i dont know if i can keep that promise. im 13, so ive got 7 years to see what happens, but i really dont think i can last that long. the only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact that i dont want to upset people. ive seen the ways suicide affects people, as my uncle committed suicide, and i wouldnt want anyone feeling like that. but i feel so trapped and hopeless. i just have to keep willing myself to stay alive.
