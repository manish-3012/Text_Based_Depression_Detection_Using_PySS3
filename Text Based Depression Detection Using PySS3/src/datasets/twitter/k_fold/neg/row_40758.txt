Anyone else feel empty at timesLike sometimes I'm just rly sad and have to fake not being sad (I've never been diagnosed w depression so I can't say I have it) in front of my family and have mental breakdowns by myself but other times I just feel so empty and just run on autopilot. Quarantine has rly been affecting my mental health but had anyone been experiencing this. It's okay not to respond there's others that need more help than I need some sort of not being lonely feeling
