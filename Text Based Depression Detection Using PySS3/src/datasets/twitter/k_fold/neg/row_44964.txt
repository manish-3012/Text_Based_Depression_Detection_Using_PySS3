Giving up hopeFolks, I don't know what to do anymore.  My career has been a series of failures, no matter how hard I try.  I've just been laid off from the same company for the 3rd time.  Yes, they brought me back three times to lay me off.  On two occasions, relocating me to a new city.  I hoped this wouldn't happen, and yet I'm told that the company is going in a new direction and that my performance didn't help matters.

I've always struggled with office politics and understanding what the expectations are.  I kill myself to perform well, and yet I always fall short.  I'm 37, no relationship, dedicated my life to my work, and have received little to no recognition for anything I've done well, and don't ever find out about how I'm performing till the dreaded performance review, regardless of how many times I've asked through the course of a year what i can do to perform better.  I never get a good answer, probably because nobody wants to be THAT guy, but I just want to fucking improve.  I'm set to end my gig here at end of June, and they have an all hands meeting where they're presenting my project by someone else.  It's completely depressing.  

I hate my life.  I hate myself.  Who wants to spend their life with me?  I can't manage things at work, I can't manage my own finances.  I have a college degree (that I wasn't interested in in the first place) and have completely failed in my life.  I just want this all to end.  I am seriously thinking of ending it tonight.  I already plan to make a noose with rope I have already, and hang it from the fire escape of my building and do it right there.  what's the fucking point anymore?  I can't even talk to my parents about this because they don't give a shit.  Fuck this life, i want out.
