I wish I could be a hero.I wish I could die saving someoneâ€™s life.

Iâ€™ve had this memory of being shot and in doing so saving another person and in those last few moments thanking them. Telling them how happy they made me and to live life to their fullest extent.

I always said my dream job is to be a cia agent gone rogue. I would go rogue so I could use my skill set to save innocent people. I would know I die eventually but I could help people. 

Iâ€™ve imagined dying a hero and being honored so that way the people wouldnâ€™t have to of seen my pain. That way I could inspire others even from beyond the grave. I could be a hero and not have to feel this pain or any pain ever again. I couldâ€™ve saved a life and help many more. Because heroâ€™s never die, their spirit lives on.
