Is it possible to want to want to kill myself even tho I don't have depression?Im not diagnosed with depression and I don't think I have. I still feel happiness occasionally and I'm not always sad but I will think about killing myself a lot. Sometimes I just don't feel like living,  am I just dramatic? I know how I would do it but I'm scared it will hurt my mom and friends

I just don't know what to do
