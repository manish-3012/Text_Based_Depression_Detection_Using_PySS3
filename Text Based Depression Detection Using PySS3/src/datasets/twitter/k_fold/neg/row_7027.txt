I am a 15 year old kid who is seeing my dad getting a notice that wants him to go to immigration court
I have a full family mom and brother and my dad I love them all but I know if we go to court we would most likely get separated and Iâ€™m scared we donâ€™t have a lawyer and if my dad doesnâ€™t go to court he could go to jail and I still lose because I would still be separated from my family and would be on adoption the court date is tomorrow only me and my dad are going to court I donâ€™t know if I should just kill myself before anything happens
