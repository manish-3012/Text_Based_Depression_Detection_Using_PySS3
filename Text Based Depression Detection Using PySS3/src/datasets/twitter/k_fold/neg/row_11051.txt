All I want to hear is a good reason that I should continue to liveThe way I see it, I had no choice in my existence. All the sudden I was here, and I've spent so much time since then trying to figure out why. It's becoming more and more clear that in the grand scheme of things there is no why. I exist by chance, and there's no innate worth to my life. Which leaves me with two options: continue living this life I had no say in starting, or end it. In my mind nothing is lost if I take the second option; by definition one can't regret nonexistence. 

The only counter argument I can think of to this logic is the "might as well live" argument. If all acts are equally as meaningless, living is pretty much the same as dying. I can get behind this thinking until I actually try to live it; knowing everything is meaningless doesn't make me feel better during a panic attack or depression episode. Suicide is thousands of times easier than living a full life, and therein lies its advantage. 

I can't think of any other good reasons to continue existence. I feel I have the right to end my own life, because if I don't get a choice in my birth or death then I don't feel I have any real agency. I hope to hear some unique perspectives on this  - thanks for replying. 

(P.S. I have no interest in arguing my existentialism, except insofar as it applies to suicide. Thanks for understanding).
