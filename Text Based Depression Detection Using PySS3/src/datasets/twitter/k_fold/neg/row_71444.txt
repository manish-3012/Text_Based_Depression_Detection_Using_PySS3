Just trying to express myself I guessPeople saying the things that everyone else says just drives me crazy and pisses me off. Everyone and thier cliche sayings. Why can't people just think more deeply about the things they say? I just want people to think. That's what I wanted since I was young. I'm a thinker. And I just feel like people are only projecting thier experiences onto you. I hope I'm making sense because this is the only way I can explain it. I just get really angry when people don't understand me and it only makes what I'm going through worse.
