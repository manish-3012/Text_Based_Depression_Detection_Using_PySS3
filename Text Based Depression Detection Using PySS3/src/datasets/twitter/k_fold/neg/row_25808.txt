I don't understandI have trouble talking to others, I ruin every friendship I make and I just want to end it. I feel like I am always inferior due to having a sibling and I am always living in their shadow. I am not really scared of death but I feel as it is better that what I am in right now. I just don't understand the point of making relations if they all will crumble. I am trying to find a obtainable way to end it all, and I am on the fence with carbon monoxide poisoning and jumping from a high area. I don't see myself as getting any better with social situations and I think this is for the best.
