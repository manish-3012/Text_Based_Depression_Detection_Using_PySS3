Am I suicidal?I make a lot of suicide jokes. â€œBro if that happens Iâ€™m gonna kill my selfâ€ or something of a similar vein. And when Iâ€™m alone or doing something menial I think about a lot of stuff. Like about death. Death scares me with that existential dread that twists in my gut and makes me almost nauseous. But recently Iâ€™ve been think about what it would feel like to get out a gun from my basement gun safe. A pistol and put the end of the barrel against my temple. Not to pull the trigger, but to feel the cold steel against my skin and wonder if I have the strength to do it. Or if hung a noose from my ceiling or a tree and just hung from it. Maybe with my hands in the loop to stop me from chocking. I donâ€™t know. I used to cut myself but that was stupid and probably fake for attention. I doubt Iâ€™m depressed at all I mean look at me Iâ€™m making a post on a fucking reddit page about suicide so I can get some validation? Some fucking attention from random people that I am suicidal and that I am depressed. What kind of fucked up person am I? Iâ€™m going to post this regardless because I know if I donâ€™t it will probably be worse. But still who the fuck does this shit. I might as well just end it now to get over with it all and just be relieved of the responsibility that is suffering through life. Iâ€™ll die crying, lazy and useless just like when I was born
