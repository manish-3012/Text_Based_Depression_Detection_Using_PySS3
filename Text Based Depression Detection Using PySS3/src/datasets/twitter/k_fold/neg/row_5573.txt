Are any of us really real?What's real? Am I real? Are you real? Our problems seem giant. I feel incredibly lonely. My problems stem from me. Therefore, thinking about this logically, terminating myself also ends my problems. It might be selfish. But the guilt will also end with me. I want to be loved by someone. I'm 18 and that has never happened. I don't know how. This will end if I do. I can't feel alone if I can't feel anything. I don't believe in an afterlife. Me and all of my problems will simply cease to exist. My perception dictates my reality. Removing the ability to perceive removes the hurt. This is a logical step.
