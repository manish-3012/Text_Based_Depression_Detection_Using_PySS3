Why can't I die?I feel hopeless. That's been the story of my life. Suicidal thoughts started at the age of eight. I hoped I would die you. I am 37 now with nothing to look forward too. Emotionally and financially bankrupt. Tried of talking to people. Nothing is changing. At least drugs helped numb me when I was a addict.
