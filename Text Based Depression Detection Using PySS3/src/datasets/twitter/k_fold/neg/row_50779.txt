just here to ventIâ€™m tired. I feel alone. I donâ€™t feel good, and I would really like a quick and easy way to kill myself because I canâ€™t take this shit anymore. I just feel so uncomfortable with every social situation and feel down all the time. I hate living. I just want to feel okay but that clearly is not an option. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep on pushing when shit isnâ€™t getting any better. Fuck I am so so tired. I want to feel ready to go. I hate myself and everything about myself. I canâ€™t appreciate a single thing about myself because there is nothing to. God I feel so stupid and weak and useless. I should die. This was meant to be and I dont think Iâ€™ll ever see the light. Fuck me. Iâ€™m such a weak stupid bitch.
