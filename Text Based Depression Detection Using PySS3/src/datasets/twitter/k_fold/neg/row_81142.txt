Why do I harm myself when I donâ€™t even want to die?A while back, I decided that I wanted to go to a rehab or a mental clinic so I could just escape my life. I thought that going to a mental clinic away from my family, friends and school would just be better. I kinda like the thought of spacing out and not existing and doing nothing. In doing so I took a lot of my aunt pills, I didnâ€™t even google whether or not if it was too much then I tried cutting myself deeper so I could bleed out. I kinda liked the idea of having scar like that idk why but I just did. Eventually I went to the hospital luckily I was ok and I decided not to go to rehab anymore. But why do I like stuff like this is something wrong with me?
