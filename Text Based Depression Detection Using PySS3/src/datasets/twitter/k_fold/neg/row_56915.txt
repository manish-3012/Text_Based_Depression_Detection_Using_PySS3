I am one step from doing thisI am currently sitting in the forest, away from town I live, with the rope inside my bag, Iâ€™ve found a quiet place where birds are singing, itâ€™s so peaceful here. Iâ€™ve written suicide notes to my family, friends.

But there is one thing that bothers me, should I text my mother and tell her how I feel, about my depression, suicidal thoughts? Itâ€™s hard to do, because Iâ€™m afraid of her reaction.  Maybe she will go ultra mad and that will break me even more? On the other hand, what have I left to lose? Iâ€™ve told some people about my depression, they didnâ€™t cared enough, and if Iâ€™ll make right now a promise to my mom that we will discuss about this at home, where are guarantees that she will care? Maybe she will think that Iâ€™m just a whiny idiot because life is hard and yada yada. 

The thing is, Iâ€™m not sure that I want to die, but I donâ€™t have will to continue this meaningless existence. So itâ€™s very complicated conflict that is happening right now in my head. 
Sorry for grammar
