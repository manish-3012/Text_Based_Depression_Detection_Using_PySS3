It's been so longI've been dealing with depression for years, and have been suicidal off and on for much of it. I went through my lowest point about 4 years ago where I starved myself for almost a month and would self-harm often, but recovered. Now I'm in college and I just relapsed for the first time since then with my self harm. I'm so ashamed of myself, but I don't know what to do. I tried to talk to my friend about how I was really thinking about killing myself, but she didn't seem to realize that I was being serious about it. 

I'm taking two online classes that I'm 7 and 3 weeks behind, and I've fallen behind in one of my other classes because the files I need got corrupted, and I need to redo a bunch of earlier assignments, plus 2 weeks of assignments that are late now. 

If I fail these classes, I won't be approved for financial aid and can't afford the next semester. And even if I pass, I'm not smart enough to actually do well with a real job. I should have graduated last spring but I think it will be next fall at the earliest.

And on top of all of this, I just fucking hate myself so much. I'm so fucking stupid, annoying, ugly, I just have no redeeming qualities. I just want to kill myself because I've fucked up so much that I don't think I can recover.
