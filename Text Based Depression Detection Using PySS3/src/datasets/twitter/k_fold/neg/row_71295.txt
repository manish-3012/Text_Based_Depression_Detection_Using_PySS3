Thinking about committing suicide ? Perhaps you've already done itAn interesting idea crossed my mind every time I was contemplating the decision of switching from life to death: **IT JUST MIGHT BE THAT WE HAVE ALREADY DONE IT.** 

I am not debating your belief here, I am not even religious, but I do believe that life is a twisted game, that our spirits and  our existence is transcendental, that we live through more lives, one way or the other. 

So I've been thinking about how many suicidal people think that "I just want to end this life because it's horrible....if I'd just have another life everything would be fine, but I have THIS one and THIS one is unbearable !!" - now the true mindfucking thing is that perhaps THIS IS "the other" life - have you considered it ? Have you considered that perhaps you committed suicide in a previous life and you thought that "YES, THIS NEW LIFE IS GOING TO SET ME FREE" and now you're living exactly that life and you're suicidal again ?
