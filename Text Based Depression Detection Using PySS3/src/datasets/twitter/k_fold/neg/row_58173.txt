How do I stop being such a fucking loser?Don't tell me "be confident" because I have nothing to be confident about. I have a creepy smile and fucked up facial proportions. I'm diagnosed with Asperger's and I'm a virgin despite being in college.

I don't know anybody who takes me seriously or views me as an "equal." My friends seem to genuinely enjoy me (for now) but they make jokes about how weird and awkward I am all the time. They make jokes about how I'm a virgin even though I've never told them, which shows people can tell how much of a fuck-up I am just by the way I act and look. I didn't even have a real group of friends until a few months ago.

I've never met a girl who seems genuinely interested me. I made out with a really drunk girl at a party one time and I used to have a friend who I'd cuddle with and hold hands with and stuff but those don't count for anything. Whenever I talk to a girl I either feel like they're really uncomfortable or they seem to be okay with talking to me but if I suggest we hang out or whatever they back off. My friends tell me to just "BE CONFIDENT DURRRR" but I don't think they have much confidence in me in the first place. My parents tell me "JUST START BY BEING FRIENDS WITH GIRLS" but girls don't even want to be my friend.

What the fuck do I do? How do I stop being such a loser?
