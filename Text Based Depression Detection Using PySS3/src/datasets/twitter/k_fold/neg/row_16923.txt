Why do I even wanna die?Everything goes good  on my life, my mom do everything for me, my grades are great, we have money and everything. So why im depressed and suicidal? I used to cry everyday just to sleep, anxiety hits hard when im going to do something, and I get a panic attack, I tried to kill myself and I failed, I cant live and be happy even with all the things I have. Im such a failure, I had everything on my side and I still failing at simple things with no reason. I tried but im doesnt good enough even if I try my best. I shouldnt feel this way cuz my life is so damn easy.
