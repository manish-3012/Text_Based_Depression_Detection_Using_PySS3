Need help for my brotherHello, I was just informed by my brothers girlfriend that he said today and has said other times that there isn't a day where he doesn't think about killing himself. Now this was said when they were arguing so I don't know if he was caught up in the heat of the moment or not. I know he has been down about his career and such lately so I am just wondering what is a way to breach the topic with him? I don't want to offend him or drive a wedge between us. If he is In a bad spot I just want him to get help.  Thanks.
