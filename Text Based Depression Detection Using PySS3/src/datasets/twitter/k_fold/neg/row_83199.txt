I feel like I need to go to the hospitalIm really really close to ending it. Im having a hard time taking care of myself. I feel like the hospital would be a good place for be for a few days. I would be safe and cared for in the sense that I would be fed and have people there i could talk, though knowing me I wouldnt talk to them. Idk, maybe I dont actually need to go and Im just being a baby. Either way, I wouldnt even know how to go about getting into a hospital without making another attempt. Im not 18 so I cant check myself in, but I cant tell patents or anyone about this. Idk, I just need help.
