i feel like i've not only lost the battle with myself, but i've lost the war too.i've never put out a post like this before, but i think now is my time to go. it's been a fast decline that i was never prepared for, i haven't eaten, i haven't drank anything but booze, i haven't slept in god knows how long. and today, my long time boyfriend left me, he packed up his shit and he left. i gave every last part of my soul and my fight to him and now it's gone. the fight is over. i just want to be at peace. my dad was screaming at me because it's the only way he knows how to deal with me like this. he's begging me to come home with him, my mother is begging me to come home with her, my little brother doesn't know the state i'm in and yet i choose to stay alone in my apartment and rot. i have nine animals that kept me going for so long but i just can't anymore. i tied the noose. i'm just waiting for the right time.
