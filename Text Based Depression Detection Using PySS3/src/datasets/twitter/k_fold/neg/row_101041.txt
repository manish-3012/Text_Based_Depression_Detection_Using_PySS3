Trying not to...I have the pills to do so. I have other drugs. I have weapons. I have various poisons, such as butane gas. I have household cleaning items that I would just need to compound in order to produce the toxic, desired result(s). What's stopping me? I could even light myself on fucking fire if I wanted to. My pets are stopping me though... That's what it is. Other than that, I see no reason to stay here and continue on though. I thoroughly hate myself and my life, hate being so busy with school and work, losing sleep over having to take care of everyone else around me as well, all while they treat me as if I'm useless yet simultaneously somehow a horrible person, and I just...hate being controlled by those around me and my unhealthy ass environment... Duh. Redundant, I know. I'm fucking done with this obscene, cruel, merciless, unempathetic, discriminatory, ostracizing, and hateful ass world. It's just one thing after the fucking next for me, and IDK how I manage to be so high-functioning for a neurodivergent person and to stay attuned to reality with all of the bullshit that I am immutably surrounded by. I can't fucking stand how people treat each other. Am I the only fucking person in my general vicinity with a select few exceptions, capable of not judging others for illogical ass, superficial fucking reasons??? Like, how does that help your life out at all??? Fucking...HOW?????? And why are people so fucking insatiable and manipulative??????????? HOW DO I HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH THESE HUMAN BEINGS WHOM WILL DO ANYTHING THAT IT TAKES IN ORDER TO GET AHEAD IN LIFE, SHOVING AND PUSHING INNOCENT PEOPLE OUT IN THE PROCESS OF THEM DOING SO AND/OR USING OTHERS AS PAWNS???????????????? ... I just don't understand any of it at fucking all. I've been through the wringer and back in my life, and I am just fucking done at this point. I don't understand how some people can be so courageous and strong and almost...heroic when the odds are stacked up against them so heavily. They also make me want to live because I feel guilty that my situation is much better than theirs are, so there are actually two reasons, here, but I am still barely hanging on by a fucking thread. Since I'm always wrong in the eyes of society anyway, I'm getting close... I don't know. I'm just...everywhere emotionally and mentally right now. I hate myself for being so powerless. Humanity is a fucking joke. Even the other people who say that humanity is a joke have no real basis for saying such, and that infuriates me as well. You proved your own point though, I guess, morons.
