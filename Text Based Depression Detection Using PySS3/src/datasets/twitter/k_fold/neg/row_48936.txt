We were both in the wellWe had both fallen into the well. The water in the well had us treading water constantly. We started taking turns, carrying the other one on ones shoulders to let them rest for a while, before going back to treading water, and we kept doing that while figuring out a way to get out of the well.

I came to cherish the moments where I could take a moment to relax with a clear mind.

But when someone threw them a rope I wanted to pull them back down. I didn't want to tread water, I wanted a rope too.
