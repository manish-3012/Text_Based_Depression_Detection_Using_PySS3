My dad explicitly told me to go kill myselfWe had a pretty long and fucked up argument a while ago for an entire hour, mostly him shouting and shitting about my 'life decisions'. He's been forcing me to go to a military academy ever since I was a kid (im 15 now) and I've been pretty clear about how I'm uncomfortable and really not fit for it at all but he kept on insisting, at some point even guilt-tripping me and calling me a 'homosexual'. 

My brother currently attends the same school and he was against it at first, but eventually he enjoyed going there so I guess this made my dad push the idea to me even more. I'm so fucking mad at him and scared that he might get physical after what happened earlier. I really don't know what to do, he's the only parent I got and I kinda love him, but it's so fucking hard, and this situation just fuels my suicidal thoughts even more
