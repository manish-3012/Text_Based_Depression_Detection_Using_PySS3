Autism is making me stressed and having depressionI think about the option of wanting to be dead every day and depress myself with the fact I am autistic, 15 years old, and can only succeed in life with learning Russian, I think about this goal everyday cause I know it will bring me happiness.

I feel my disability makes it so hard to do my goal and so are my tendencies of depression everyday and suicidal thoughts, I got a therapist but she doesn't really feel like she helps me and just asks me questions all the time and says stuff like I don't have autism even though I have it and I think its a bad thing for her to say.

I feel like there is no solution, that I always will have to be anxious for the rest of my teen years, that there is no end to this until I have reached my goal and live a better life with autism, there is a good reason why the suicide rates for autism is so high and this post is proof of the tendencies, struggles, autistic teens have to deal with, I feel this is not normal life, and that I shouldn't be having these tendencies every day.
