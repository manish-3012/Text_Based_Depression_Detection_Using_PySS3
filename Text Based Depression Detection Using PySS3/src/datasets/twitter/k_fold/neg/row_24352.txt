I can end my life because no one is aloneAll my friends are either married/in relationships/have other solid friendships. My mom has other kids and she hardly sees me anyway. My family has each other. No one is alone and no one would suffer in my absence. Everyone is finally taken care of, and I can go. The only thing that would miss me is the dog.
