Tired of never happy and want to end itWhenever Im alone or dont have someone, I just feel depressed, sad, and suicidal. Im on meds, I thought they would make being with myself more bearable, but as of now these feelings are winning. I dont have something to make me happy or to look forward to. Im so sick of it.
