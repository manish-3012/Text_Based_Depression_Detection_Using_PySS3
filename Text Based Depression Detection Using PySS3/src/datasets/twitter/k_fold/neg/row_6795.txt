Please someone just notice thisIâ€™m so tired of almost constantly crying and being angry and sad at everything
Iâ€™m in constant misery and nothing helps
I feel so alone, Iâ€™ve lost everyone and everything over time and Iâ€™ve got no goals
Nothing makes me happy anymore
I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m ready to die, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m ready to stop existing entirely forever and never see the sunlight of day ever again, or ever hear the voice of my friends or remember anything or ever feel happy again even if for a brief moment
But Iâ€™m in constant agony and I wish this would just end
Life for me is this endless cycle of misery and sadness and for the past year it just doesnâ€™t end. Ever.
What the fuck do I even do at this point
