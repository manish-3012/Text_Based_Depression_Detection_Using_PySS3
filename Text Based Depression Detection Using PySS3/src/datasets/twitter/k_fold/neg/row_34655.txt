Tylenol OverdoseHi,

A while ago when I was 15 (now 22) I attempted suicide with tylenol.
I remeber getting dizzy and really tired so I decided to go to bed and sleep what little time I thought I had away.

I woke up later that night and threw up, the world felt like it was spinning. When the morning came I was thankfully still alive, I felt sick to my stomach but alive.

Ive had a ton of blood test done since then and everything is perfect, but Ive had this nagging feeling these last two days out of nowhere that I could've caused permenant damage.

Ive been googling for 3 hours straight trying to bring myself some peace.

Please anyone looking to Suicide as the answer especially with Tylenol, please don't make a permanent decision based on temporary feeling. I want to be able to say it gets better but the only thing I can say is suicide takes away all chances of a good day coming your way.
