nobody gives a shitnobody. no one is here. every relationship i have right now is in shambles. want to do more drugs to numb the pain but after a 3-4 day binge, my heart hurts and is so overworked. want to slit my throat but donâ€™t want to end up failing and leaving an ugly scar like the previous one. 4am, and i am crying alone, with nothing to look forward to anymore and no one to care for or love me. failing school, ive pushed everyone away, canâ€™t control my feelings, the last person who showed me any type of love or care just. cold, distant. gone. about to just down all of the speed i have left and let my heart give out because i just canâ€™t fucking do it anymore. fuck me, fuck bpd, fuck depression and fuck my life.
