Feeling intense emotional pain or intense indifference towards life, myself and others24/M

I've never been diagnosed with depression or anything. Nor have I visited a doctor. I am not on any medications...  

Every day the first thought in my head when I wake up is "Why am I still alive?" or "I wish I was dead".

I am just so emotionally drained and overwhelmed with sadness, yearning, regret, guilt, disappointment, frustration, heartbreak, isolation, loneliness, hopelessness, emptiness and confusion. It repeats itself too. I feel that or this from the aforementioned. And it's never better. I can't take this anymore. Seriously I can't. It's a cycle I've been in for past few months. I am just beating myself up and destroying myself at this point, and I want to stop feeling anything because that cycle is all I feel. This is no way to live...

And when it's not the aforementioned cycle - it's just an intense indifference towards myself, others and life in general. I just feel blank and emotionless. Not sad, happy, angry or anything. Just blank. But I feel most suicidal in this state of mind because I feel suicide seems to be most practical rather than "emotionally induced" and/or out of pain. I know that sounds quite odd. When in this state of mind, I simply think "I have/need to die" rather than "I want to die".

I would of killed myself long ago if it weren't for the fear of the actual physical pain or coming out brain damaged/deformed/etc. from fucking up killing myself - That's it. It's fucking pathetic. I can't live and I can't die. I actually want someone to just kill me, because clearly I can't. Or I can just hope and dream for a terminal illness/cancer or to get into a fatal car crash...

I just feel that hope and time are against me. They both increase pain.
