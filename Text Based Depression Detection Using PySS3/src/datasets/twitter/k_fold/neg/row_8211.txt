What is your experience with half-hearted suicide attempts?Tiny Prelude: Initially, I did not want to post this question here, since I do not think it is a good fit for the sub. However, for the past 2 days I tried to post it on several subs, only for it to always get closed. Honestly, I am getting a bit frustrated by that. Suicide should not be that much of a taboo topic. 

Start post: When I was 14 or so, I was a kinda sad kid. I took some somewhat dangerous medicine that had quite strong side-effects, especially when you took a double dose  accidentally. So one day, when I had an experience that made me feel a  tad more sad, I took 30 times the normal dose of aforementioned  medicine.

I did not think that this had a high chance of killing me, but ... I cannot really describe it, I think I  was being more of a drama queen. So in that sense, it was a half-hearted  attempt. To come to the point, I was always curious if people had  similar experience (I am sure there are many) and then what other  people's half-hearted suicide experience was. This does not have to be a sad topic, I am just kinda curious.

To avoid being misunderstood, I will add some more comments: I am not interested in any detailed descriptions about the actual attempt. For me this is an event that happened in the past (I am mid 20 now) that I am not entirely sure how to process. The whole thing feels a bit weird to me. I might be similar to self-harm, even though it was singular occurrence, I was not out for pain, and (I think) it had a higher chance to actual kill me... I am not even sure which conclusion I am trying to arrive at.
