Itâ€™s me againhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/9fpp4q/i_hate_it_all_and_i_plan_on_ending_it_in_less/?st=JMGKBU8G&amp;sh=60df06a8

I donâ€™t care if you read that but I suck at life so I forgot some shit so Iâ€™ll add it here.
After telling this board I told my friends about this all and now theyâ€™re ignoring me, they cut off ties and act like I donâ€™t exist.
I guess my friends said something about it to the school and now I keep hearing shit like â€œwhy is he waiting to kill himself?â€ Behind my back.
Due to asd (autism spectrum disorder) I canâ€™t get a job but I canâ€™t file for help from the government either.
Video games have since fallen out for me, i just donâ€™t have fun anymore.
I know my future is hopeless, right now is unenjoyable, my peers have a point, Iâ€™m considering ending it now instead of later.
