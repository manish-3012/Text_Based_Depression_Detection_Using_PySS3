I feel like Iâ€™ve hit rock bottom, but somehow Iâ€™ve still manage to fall deeper (transgender)I havenâ€™t ever felt this suicidal in my whole life. I just want to be seen as a normal human being. 
Hello, Iâ€™m transgender female to male. I havenâ€™t had anything medical done and Iâ€™m in high school. 

The dysphoria and discomfort of not feeling okay in my own skin is so overwhelming, I canâ€™t take it anymore. I need something to change.. but Iâ€™ve done everything possible in order to pass that I know of. Iâ€™ve spent hours looking online for something Iâ€™ve missed; some secret that guys do in order to actually be seen as a guy. 
Iâ€™ve started going to a support group and although it did give me hope, itâ€™s also made me feel even worse. Thereâ€™s this one guy there whoâ€™s already 5 years through his transition, Iâ€™m so envious. 
All Iâ€™ve been able to think about this past two months is how many different ways I can hurt myself and utilize the objects around me. I canâ€™t even tell you how many times Iâ€™ve thought about jumping out of my car while doing 60-70 down the interstate. 
The only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because of my family, otherwise I would have killed myself three/four years ago. I know this place isnâ€™t necessarily for transgender rants, but I donâ€™t know where else to put it without it getting taken down before I can get any real feedback. 

Iâ€™m 5â€™2, I have an undercut and my hair is longer on top. All my clothes are menâ€™s, I wear boxers, my chest is semi flat (even without the binder) and I have masculine mannerisms. Iâ€™ve trained my voice to be deeper, but itâ€™s still so fucking feminine. If it wasnâ€™t for my voice I probably wouldnâ€™t be misgendered. Iâ€™m so depressed, my medication just keeps going up and Iâ€™m still depressed. I have mental breakdowns regularly. I donâ€™t sleep much, or I over sleep. I either donâ€™t eat or eat on and off. Iâ€™m antisocial and awkward. I have absolutely no friends, and I just started at a new school a month ago. 
I tried getting my teachers to call me he/him even at the cost of using my birth name, but I have to get parents permission. I want to start testosterone, but I need both parents signature. My father isnâ€™t even in the picture, and my mother thinks itâ€™ll all go away over time. 

I havenâ€™t cut in almost a year, but thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s ran through my mind in the last few hours. I self harm often, but never draw blood or really leave a mark. 

Iâ€™ve went through therapists and none of them made any progress with me. Everything I do to cope only lasts for a little bit, then Iâ€™m back to being unstable. None of my coping mechanisms work anymore. Iâ€™m so unstable. 

I just want my families approval. I want to make them proud and get a college degree.. 

But at this rate, I wonâ€™t make it to my junior year.
