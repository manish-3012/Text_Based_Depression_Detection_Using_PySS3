Tired of being stabbed in the back by EVERYONEI've tried my best and I've been stabbed in the back by so many people, including my own parents that I simply do not give a shit anymore.

I was going to list all the bullshit I've gone through, but the list is so god damned long I gave up, because it was just making my mood worse.

What future I do have is likely going to be one of homelessness and or extreme poverty filled with substance abuse. Both of which where I likely die to whatever the fuck health issue I'm suffering from, since my last employer pulled some ultimate bullshit before I could figure it out.

"oh shit your medical issue seems bad! Go home and get it taken care of!" *is halfway through various test over the span of two weeks* "Oh wait! Sorry you don't qualify for FMLA, your absence is unexcused so we have to fire you!"

Suicide has been a daily thought for me for the past few months and, unless my luck changes completely, the moment my savings run out is the moment I say fuck it all and go out in some kind of blaze of glory.
