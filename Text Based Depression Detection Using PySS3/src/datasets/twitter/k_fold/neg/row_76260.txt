Hi I'm freaking out and need someone to listen to meI'm having the worst night in a while

I don't know what to say, my brain's extremely scattered and I can't organize my thoughts. I keep thinking about killing myself and the thought is so pervasive that I can't get anything done.

I'm 20 and haven't held a job for more than 4 days, I don't even know how I would get a job at this point, I live at home with my parents and I have random panic attacks because sometimes my lung starts hurting and I think it's going to collapse because it has collapsed many times in the past. This is probably confusing to read because I'm writing all of this spontaneously.

Basically I'm in constant mental torment and I just want to die so that it stops. I am sick of the panic attacks, I am sick of the intrusive thoughts, I am sick of everything. I am simply over it. I don't think I can do this. I feel like a worthless piece of shit and a burden on everyone I know.
