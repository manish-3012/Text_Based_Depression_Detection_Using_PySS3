I find myself fixating on death/suicideI fantasize about it so often, research hypothetical ways i could do it. Then I'll go back and rewatch media that involves the character committing/contemplating suicide. Listen to music about it. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

I realize that doesn't help, but I'm stuck onto it. Classic suicidal ideation.
