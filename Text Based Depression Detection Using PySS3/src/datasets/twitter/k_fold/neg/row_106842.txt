My abusive father is driving me insane. [15m]So. Where do I even begin here? I guess how long Iâ€™ve been putting up with this. My dadâ€™s been like this since I was 9 or so years old. It didnâ€™t start off this bad, not at all, but I was too young to recognize the blatant signs that were right there in front of me. It got worse and worse as the years went on, until today. Just last year he laid his hands on my mother for the first time ever. Nothing that left any marks or anything, though. He also threatened to destroy all my belongings (mainly electronics, most of which were birthday/Christmas presents from my grandparents.), and also told me to kill myself, and that heâ€™d be happier that way if I did. That was not even a year ago. Heâ€™s still just as bad. He now threatens to call child welfare on my mom, kick us out (even though we donâ€™t even legally own this house we live in.), and continues to threaten me with destruction of my belongings, as well as ceasing to pay my phone bill. Iâ€™m starting to get desperate for a way out, but I donâ€™t want to leave my mom with this scum. What do I do?
