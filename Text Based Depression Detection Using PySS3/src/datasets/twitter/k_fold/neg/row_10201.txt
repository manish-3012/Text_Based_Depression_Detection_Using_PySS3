There are bugs all over meI can't fucking stand this. No one takes this seriously. They think I'm fucking make shit up. I'm not. There are maggots inside me. I don't know what to do. They're eating me alive. And I'm depressed too. The maggots are going to eat up my stomach lining and my stomach acid will dissolve my body, and I'm going to fucking die. Just now I coughed up this black shit. It's probably blood and maggot waste. I'm fucking decomposing and I'm alive.
