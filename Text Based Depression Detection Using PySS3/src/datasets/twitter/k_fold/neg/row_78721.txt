No Reason To Continue!I hate this generation. Iâ€™ve tried to fit in since birth, but I was always pushed away.

Everyone is a trashy, no-good whore. My best friend is my dad, and now heâ€™s fooling around. Wonâ€™t talk to me, only cares about illicit actions. We used to be so close. He loves his other daughter more than me. I want to kill him. Or myself. More of myself. 

I have schizophrenia and Iâ€™ve been spacing out all night. Seeing things- apparitions.

No one wants me, no one even cares to see me. My dad is breaking me apart. He was my only friend, now he wants to leave me. I feel as if I should kill someone. I want to slit my wrists. I canâ€™t bare it.

I was bullied in high school. I had to become homeschooled. Then I recently went back to school, and was treated with so much love and kindness. But I was only there two months before graduation. Iâ€™m back to living my shallow isolated life with no one to hold or talk to. I want to go back to school.

I canâ€™t make friends. Everyone hates me, talks behind my back. Iâ€™ve never been able to hold a friendship. I have a good online friend now, who I love dearly. But I feel I burden him.

I CANT GET A JOB, OR DRIVE. My parents forbid because Iâ€™m â€œdisabledâ€

I want to be loved. The man I love is dead. Iâ€™ll never have him. Iâ€™ve only ever loved him. 

Thereâ€™s no point for me to go on living. I should just end it here before things get worse, and they always get worse. Iâ€™ve never got peace. 

I am so isolated. No one cares about me, or wants me. I could just die. Iâ€™m a ghost on earth. I want to die and live with my own kind. In heaven Iâ€™ll be free. 

Please, I am so lonely.
