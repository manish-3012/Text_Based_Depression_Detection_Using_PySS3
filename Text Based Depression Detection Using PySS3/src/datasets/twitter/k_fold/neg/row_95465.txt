In strong need of some helpful adviceHey Reddit

Back in February I had a depressive breakdown and moved back in w my mom, which was only meant to be temporary but then the whole corona thing happened. I was meant to live here until I got better and then move back home and while Iâ€™ve been going to therapy, going more outside, meeting more new people I still feel awful and donâ€™t wanna move back home. Iâ€™ve been considering suicide as I mostly feel empty, lonely and like something is hurting on the inside but I also donâ€™t wanna hurt my mom. As Iâ€™ve kinda give up on finding happiness myself I just wanna know if anyone has tips as to how I can keep going on for my momâ€™s sake when suicide feels like the only way out??
Sorry I know this was written in a very messy fashion, but Iâ€™m a bit out of it rn and just want some help for anyone who has time on their hands. Iâ€™m sick of being a burden and not fitting in anywhere. Sorry
