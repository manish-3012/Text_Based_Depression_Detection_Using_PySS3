... I don't get why good people have to die.. Like the people who actually made something of themselves and have things to live for...they end up getting stricken with something horrible like incurable brain cancer. These people have something to contribute to society and actually want to be alive. Meanwhile trash people like myself keep on living despite making zero contributions to society (or even just to our immediate family and friends).  It really makes me wish I could trade places with those people, they didn't deserve to go out like that. Life is so unfair.
