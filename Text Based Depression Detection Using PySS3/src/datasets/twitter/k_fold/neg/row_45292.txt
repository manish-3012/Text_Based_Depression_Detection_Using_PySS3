Sitting here in a parking lot, wanting to just end it allIâ€™m in a really bad emotionally abusive relationship and I just want to leave but I canâ€™t. This guilt is eating me alive so I have to leave home or I canâ€™t think of anything else. Iâ€™ve been driving around trying to entertain myself, trying to entertain my eating disorder mostly, and I all I can think about is how much pain heâ€™s caused me, how manipulative he is and howâ€™s never tried to help me. Iâ€™m so embarrassed to admit to people that our relationship is failing, even my parents who really want him as their son in law. I canâ€™t handle the pressure anymore. Some days are fine but if I act anything less than perfect heâ€™ll make fun of me. I had a panic attack two weeks and he just got up and left as like he didnâ€™t want to deal with it. I just want to run my car over the over ramp but Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™ll kill my completely. I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore is so much doubt and hating myself. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
