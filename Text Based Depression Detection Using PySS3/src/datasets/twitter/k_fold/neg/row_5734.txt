"Will cutting kill me?"Genuine question: how much research did you do on suicide methods before your first attempt, or just during a period of suicidal ideation?

This probably sounds douchey, but I see so many posts that talk about using pills or cutting as method of suicide and I just...don't get it. I always viewed those as really impulsive or suicidal gestures but it boggles my mind that there are people with internet access who legitimately think that taking pills (especially otc pills) is a good suicide method. Like what the fuck? Or cutting? Or people asking about suicide methods and all the people lying in the comments when information on lethality rates are readily available? I just...don't get it. Do people reddit before they google? ?? ?? I'm genuinely curious about this lmao.
