I am an awful personI have come to the conclusion recently that the reason I gave no friends is cause I actually canâ€™t be bothered to be a good friend. I used to think it was because of my mental illness, that I just struggled to go out and meet people due to anxiety and so on, but I think that has just been an excuse- I am too self centred to ever be a good friend. And honestly, if I donâ€™t even have the energy to be a good person like everyone else- what is the point of me being here? I am trash. And I think I am going to let a lot of people down in the future if I stay. 

I think this is a sign- I ironically have been prescribed the pills I used with my last half ass attempt recently by another doctor. There just waiting there for me.
