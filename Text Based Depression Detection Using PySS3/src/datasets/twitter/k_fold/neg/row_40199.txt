I'm so happy! :)I finally found a place online, to get my preferred suicide method.  Its actually been used all over the world, with "dying with dignity" groups - so I know its perfect.

And as soon as I read that I could get it, I felt as if a weight was lifted off my shoulders.

Yay - I don't have to stay here anymore!  I can be free.  :)

_______

I definitely feel as if my body is a prison, and all the things I want in this life, I can never have - because of how my body is arranged.

(I'm transgender, by the way.)

Knowing I don't have to stay here for 40 more years of loneliness, isolation, despair, and rejection is so amazing to me.

I've wanted to die for a really long time....and while I'm glad the first method didn't take, so I could have met my husband....

....I'm still very happy I can leave now, if I could so choose.

________

My husband taught me how to love myself for the first time in my life.  He's literally the only positive thing I've ever had in my life, in terms of someone being kind to me.

I've told him on multiple occasions, over the years however, that I'm still not sure if I can stay.

_______

For starters, I'm gay (I like girls) - but my body is totally broken, and fucked up.  So there's not really a real way for that to happen.

I just feel as if I'm stuck in this diseased  body, that I can finally escape from - and being able to do so, makes me so happy.

______

There's nothing in this world, I really want to accomplish.  I don't see the point in sticking around in a world, where you're constantly miserable, in order to "accomplish" something.

That seems like a waste of time, to me.

__________

I feel as if I did get to live out a few of my dreams - just enough to realize that none of them ever really made me happy anyway.

Everything I need, or want in this world, is something I can never have, because my body is this disgusting prison.

So now that I can finally leave - it makes me really happy.

_______

If we lived in a world, where I could have maybe transitioned earlier, to where I wouldn't be so deformed, and gotten surgery, all of those things.

(To fix my terrible face.)

I think those things might have helped.  But in addition to that, you have all the bigotry and hatred, surrounding you anyway.  You're constantly a pariah.

So, honestly, this world really isn't worth staying in for me.

______

Here's to finally getting what I want.  Even if I had a million surgeries, and looked perfect now, it still wouldn't be enough to erase my pain and alienation.

It still wouldn't be enough to erase how damaged I feel.

It still wouldn't be enough, for me to love myself - not after everything I've been through.

__________

I've been taught to hate myself so completely, that I feel as if I can't relate to anyone.

I've been taught that I'm such a hideous, and ugly disposable thing.....that it doesn't matter if I stay.

So what's the point - what' the point in accomplishing "dreams" to prove my existence to others.

Its all just a waste of time anyway.

______

I know in this world, all I will ever get to be is something ugly, something corrupt, something unloved, something uncared for.

That is not a world worth living in.  That is a world of constant suffering, pain and isolation.

So being able to leave this world, just seeing it as a real possibility, has lifted my spirits up so much.

I'm completely ready to die.  I'm not afraid.

I know my husband will be ok.  He's a good looking guy.  He'll find someone else, and he's awesome.

________

I just want to be at peace for once in my life - and now, I feel as if, its within my reach.

Be happy for me suicide watch - sometime after christmas, if all goes according to plan, I'm going home.  :)

_____

Please be happy for me, and know this is for the best.

I can't stick around, just to prove my enemies wrong.

That's seems futile and pointless.

___________

I'm happy I met my husband, but I'm ready to go home.

This is all I'm looking forward to now.
