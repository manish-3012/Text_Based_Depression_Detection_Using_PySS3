I found my unfinished suicide noteThere was a point in my senior year in high school where I was extremely depressed. I remember one day I was sitting with my friends at lunch and I was just harmlessly writing in a notebook. They didnâ€™t realize I was writing my suicide note. I didnâ€™t plan on killing myself then but I was close. 

Fast forward to recently; I had been doing much better, especially considering my first week of community college had went well. 

A few days ago I was rummaging through my backpack during class and I came across that unfinished suicide note. It took me a while to process but I regained focus and put it aside. 

Today... Iâ€™m back to my old ways. Laying on the couch, starving myself and contemplating suicide. I want to continue writing the note... should I? I want to get rid of it but I know Iâ€™m most likely gonna have to use it in the future.
