School makes me want to die(?)This may sound pretty mediocre for some people but I legitimately want to die because of school.  I'm getting so much stress and anxiety from the heavy workload I've been doing.  I only get 3-5 hours of sleep every week because I'm up all night studying or doing some project.  My grades are pretty fine but there would be at least this one subject wherein no matter how much effort I put into it, I'll always be shit (*coughs ... math). At this point, I don't find any meaning or reason behind doing all these things because I really question if I need to apply these to my life now and in the future.  But, at the same time, I really wanna get high marks since I'm in high school at the moment and I want to put a good record in my college applications.  I am fully aware that school shouldn't be my only priority and worry in life but I am seriously so tired of it to the point I want to give up already.  Sorry if this isn't really related to this sub (?) but I just need some advice because I'm dying huhu
