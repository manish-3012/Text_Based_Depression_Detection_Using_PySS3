Iâ€™m reaching an impasseI canâ€™t seem to find a purpose in living. Every day brings new feelings of impending doom, of death and suffering, of guilt that others suffer more than I do and Iâ€™m not doing anything.. I canâ€™t take my thoughts off of finding a knife. 

My partner is out of town and it makes me sick that when theyâ€™re gone I feel like this. I must be such a burden. I canâ€™t stop caring about every. Single. Headline. Every single personâ€™s opinion. 

Whatâ€™s worse is if I do go through with it, itâ€™ll hurt everyone around me. It will solidify my cowardice. 

But I am afraid. Every day. From the moment I wake up, I feel only fear or sadness. Fear of everyone around me. Sadness that human existence is pointless, oppressive, and cruel.

I once fucked up at work and wrote myself a poem to get my feelings out and somehow ended up at the conclusion: â€œI cannot call for help. That would negate the punishment. I have to resolve this myself. Calling in more people will require a bigger punishment.

Calling for help will kill me.â€
