How to I keep someone from Self-harming/committing suicide?I have a friend that constantly talks about hurting herself and wanting to die. She had a really rough childhood with her mother leaving her and attempting suicide herself, which makes my friend feel she is the reason. I have tried everything I could to try to make her feel better, and sometimes it works, but sometimes it is just not enough. I dont know what to say to her and I really want to help her enjoy life. I hope someone out there can point me in the right direction.
