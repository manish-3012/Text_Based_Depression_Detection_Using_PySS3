Wanting to die over the dumbest of things.Iâ€™m 19. My problems have always felt trivial.i donâ€™t feel like I can tell my therapist about this so here I am. I havenâ€™t enjoyed a single thing in months, Iâ€™ve been crying really hard for 5 days now, my eyes are really puffy. Yesterday I had a really big urge to cut myself just so I could feel something other than my sadness, and previously Iâ€™ve never done self harm like that. I just feel utterly hopeless and without direction. My suicide just seems inevitable now. I donâ€™t know if anyone can help me, I just didnâ€™t know where else to vent this kind of stuff. Sorry.
