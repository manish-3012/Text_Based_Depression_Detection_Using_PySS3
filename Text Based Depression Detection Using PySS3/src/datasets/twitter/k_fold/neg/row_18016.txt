i am so depressedi feel so alone im really upset because i went out of my way to sleep early (â€œearlyâ€ meaning 2 am because if i stayed up any longer i would have self harmed lol) and i was supposed to get work done today and hopefully spend time with my partner but i got really depressed last night before i went to bed and cried and then when i woke up i felt like so insanely bad and i always feel guilty for being suicidal and i didnt get to hang out and my partner hung out with his friends instead which is fine but it made me think about how i have no friends and if he cancels on me then i have no one to spend time with because everyone hates me and i isolate myself anyway as a form of self-punishment so no one ever tries to be my friend and he never tries to talk to me because i donâ€™t reply because im torturing myself and it upset me more and now im crying and thinking about killing myself again. why am i so fucked up. i had to cancel therapy this week too because i felt really sick and so i didnt get to talk to my therapist again even though i hate talking to a therapist and it never makes me feel better even though people say it will and basically? im suicidal. and i have no friends. and i cant stop thinking about how easy it would be to kill myself. and i feel guilty. and i feel worse. and the cycle repeats. we love to see it
