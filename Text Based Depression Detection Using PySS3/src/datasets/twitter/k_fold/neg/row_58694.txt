Destined to become another statistic.I'll keep it short and sweet. I'm a trans woman in her mid twenties. That's grounds enough to kill myself already. It's not worth living in a world where people have so much hate towards people like me. So yeah that's gonna be it. Lifetime of depression, anxiety and self hatred. Been having treatment for depression for a few months and things have just gotten worse.
