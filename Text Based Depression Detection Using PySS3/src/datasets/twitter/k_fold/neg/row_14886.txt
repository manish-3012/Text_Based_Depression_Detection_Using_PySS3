I don't really know the point of this post butI've never been so close to giving up. But I know my grandparents will miss me and I won't see my pug again, which makes this even harder.


I really want to kill myself. My wrists kind of pulse in craving for it if that makes sense. I hate to see my grandparents cry but it's getting harder and harder to go on.


I have borderline personality disorder, depression and anxiety. This has left me pretty outcasted in most places in society, as well as a good portion of my family. Not to mention I'm female and have a girlfriend. My family is mainly Christian.


I can't work and I've even stopped eating (not entirely but I basically have to be forced to eat). 


I want to die but I also don't want to die. But I know I can't survive on this earth much longer.


I don't know if I'll reply to much if any comments because if how bad a state I'm in. I just wanted to put this up here for some reason.
