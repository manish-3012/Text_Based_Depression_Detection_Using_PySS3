Hate myself and my familyI hate myself. I always have. For 20 years I've struggled with myself as a person, since I was a teen. Appearance, personality, taste. I have demons and I have problems. I have a mind that doesn't work correctly, so I've been told. I try so hard to be whatever constitutes as normal. 

I want a normal family. I want a stable family. I've never had one. My family loves you and hates you. They support you and they don't. They approve and they deny. 

The yelling, the screaming, the violence, the betrayals, and the loss. This is my family. And then when you toughen up and call them out they play victim. They rope you back in with friendly talks and parental support only to turn on you. 

A secret was never safe in the family. Everyone collectively ignores the problem and denies it when it's brought up. Just like my great aunt told me before she died, "you're the latest in a long line." She was "crazy" because she cut off the family after years of mistreatment from them. Then it was my grandmother. And my poor mother is a doormat for her father. It's not hard to see why grandma left.


I hate myself. I find myself alone. Pushed away friends and love and I feel at the end of my road. I wish that I had the courage to just take my gun and put a stop to myself. But I don't have the guts. So instead I pray to a god I'm not sure is real that my eyes just don't open.
