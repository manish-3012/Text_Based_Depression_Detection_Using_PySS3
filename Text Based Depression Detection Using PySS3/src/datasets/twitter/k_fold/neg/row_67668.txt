i feel pathetic posting here.i don't enjoy anything.

i have never had pleasure, joy, or rewarding experiences. the only exception is sex.

do you know why i enjoy sex? not for itself. not even because of the validation of another human being.

i enjoy it because sex is when i am closest to being dead. i am extremely submissive. the more someone can control, subjugate and use me, the more they can beat me down so i am completely helpless, so i need never make any choices, so everything is in their hands -- the more i get off.

life is making choices. i get off on being mentally dead and crippled.

life is having values, and working to achieve those values. a cowardly simulacrum of the void is not a value, not something to live for.

i have long felt that nothing seems real or meaningful. that is because i cannot evaluate anything as positive for me. i do not enjoy doing anything. i do not even experience the basic human pleasure of looking at something that i made and knowing that i made it.

and so i want to die, but not like in the past, not when i was clear and sharp and in pain and fully cognizant. i want to die in a murky, muddled, half-asleep way. i want to die in the same way that i want to read more books and start running. it's something i'll get around to, sometime. if i can ever be bothered. if i can ever get out of bed.

someone please tell me how i can fix this.
