Couldn't do itI just couldn't fucking do it. I tried many times, but I just couldn't hang myself. I felt it each time. My vision getting dark, sounds becoming surreal, head getting heavy, me, getting back on my toes grasping for air, hating myself. I don't want to die, but I can't live. I fucking hate myself for being such a coward. I should have let go and die already
