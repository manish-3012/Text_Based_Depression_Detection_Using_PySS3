considering my first attempt in 2 yearshi
Yeah, I don't know what to write, honestly.
I'm just really depressed today. Probably not in the state to write anything decent. 
Not that it matters, since I already wrote my suicide note about 2 weeks ago anyway, so my close friends'll be fine.  
And it still stands. I... don't know how I'll be able to continue on.

Some brief backstory I guess: 
I moved to the US almost 2 years ago. 
I have a history of countless suicide attempts (I lost track how many), but haven't attempted since moving here. 
After moving here, I was staying at someone's place.. let's say, a friend's place. 
Well... that ended. 
So I've been homeless for over 3 months now, and it's... SO FUCKING MISERABLE. 
So cold. So hungry. So lonely....

That loneliness in particular is just... ugh. 
I don't have any friends here near me, so I'm very starved on social interactions. 
It may sound silly, but I'm also VERY starved as far as... touch goes. 
Turning 21 soon, but I'm still a virgin. haha
And it's like.. I look good (I'm female, btw). 
But I have SUCH, SUCH bad social anxiety and I just can't deal with it. 
I'm too shy, too awkward to interact with people in *any* context at all. 
I hate it.
I don't hate myself for being autistic anymore, but I struggle with socializing a lot and it's very difficult.

The only time I'm not insanely anxious is when I use. But continous substance use is not sustainable... hell, I'm poor as fuck, lol.

Today I've been wondering if I should just take as much as possible and slowly drift away from this lonely, painful excuse of an existence...
