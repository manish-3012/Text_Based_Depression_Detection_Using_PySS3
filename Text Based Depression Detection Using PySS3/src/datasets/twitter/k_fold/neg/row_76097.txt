Just want to stop the painI just feel jaded. I've tried everything: therapy, pills, self-improvement. Always failing, no matter what. And people keep telling me that the future will be bright, that I'm talented, that everything is gonna change. They've told me that mantra for years, and no matter what, everything is the same, with added burden in the meantime. It's just not worth anymore. I just want peace
