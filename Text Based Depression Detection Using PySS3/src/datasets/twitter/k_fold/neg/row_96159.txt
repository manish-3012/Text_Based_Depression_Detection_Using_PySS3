When seeking help ends in a suicideI tried to seek help, and instead I am stuck with a lifelong badge of unemployment basically.. So I will check out. Fuck being honest and seeking for help. And fuck everyone who says this. Fuck you all of you who say that you want to help people (i.e psychiatric doctors) but instead of helping people, you fuck up their futures. I honestly hate all doctors and as long as I live I will never trust another one again. I hope that I will succeed in my attempt this time.
