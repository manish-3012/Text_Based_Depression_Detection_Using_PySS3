Getting a divorce, depressed as fuck, lost all my friends, can't keep up with school. I'm just done.Last ditch effort to find a sliver of anything.   
I'm getting a divorce. After 5 years, it's become clear that I just don't have the emotional capacity to be who my husband needs. We agreed to a divorce a couple of weeks ago. Last night, he got drunk and really aggressive sexually, even though we've agreed not to have sex anymore. He groped me in bed, wouldn't stop, I tried to pull away, he kept pulling my legs apart trying to touch me. I eventually got away and asked if he could just maybe hold me. He said no. After all this time, I'm nothing to him. Absolutely nothing but something to fuck.   
I'm failing in school. I'm massively depressed and can't keep up with anything. My best friends all sort of mass exodused to different parts of the country a few months ago. I tried calling everyone I know today, nobody answered. I am alone. I am a burden. I fuck up everything. There is nothing in this world that feels good. Everything hurts. Even lifting my laptop to post this felt so heavy. Everything is heavy. I don't care if there's nothing else after this. I don't care if there's a hell. I just want to not exist in this world where everything hurts.   
I have a gun. I've looked up over the counter overdose methods. I'm currently considering a combination of both. Maybe a beer or 3 to relax a bit before I do it. I just want to not be.
