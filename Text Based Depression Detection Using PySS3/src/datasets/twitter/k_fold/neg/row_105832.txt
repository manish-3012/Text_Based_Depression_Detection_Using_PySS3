I am homeless now and something is telling me to do harmful thingsI have posted here b4 but now it has gotten wrose I may have schizophrenia and I hear thing that tell me to do bad things and is one of the reasons why I got  became homeless.  I don't know what i am gonna do I can barely speak to people because of being anti social and my hallucinations become triggered if there is sound and gets wrose if it is louder and some times i will hear random music that are not stuck in my mind I don't have courage tp call the line and i want this to end asap even if I have to take my own life which does not seem bad because i have had depression for almost a decade.  I am running low on options right now I just kind of want to talk and maybe get talked out of this madness
