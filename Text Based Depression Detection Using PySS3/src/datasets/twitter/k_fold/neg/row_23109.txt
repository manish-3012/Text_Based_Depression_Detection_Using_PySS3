I'm at the end. I don't want to die. I don't know how I could commit suicide, even, but, I feel like from here on, the biggest event of my life will be death.I don't even want to write any of this bullshit.

I spend all of my day at home. I live with my parents. I'm 23. Male. Supposedly schizophrenic. It all started with untreated anxiety-and-depression, which is, in my situation, a single thing.

I'm on like 4 different meds, and I'm sick of taking them. Two anti-psychotics, one for the illness, one for sleep. An antidepressant, tianeptine, that doesn't work yet or won't work. And some god-awful drug called lorazepam, a benzo.

I've been alone for most of my life. I started feeling intense hate towards everything and everyone when my illness began and I was 16. I don't have friends online or offline, and I'm not particularly interested in keeping social bonds.

I'm dizzy as fuck even right now lying down. I'm tired of feeling dizzy.

You can PM me, if you want to suggest methods for getting better. But, please, no religious bullshit.

I'm trying to meditate, exercise, eat low-carb. Low-carb is probably what's fucking me up, as I'm so addicted to sugars it's crazy.

I also hear and feel my heart pounding when standing up, and it's terrifying every time.
