I have no one to talk to so here I am on redditThere's only one person who truly love me, my mother, but I can't love her because I don't have that ability, to love another person. So I don't care about what people would feel like if I died. I'll say it honestly. I don't give a fucking shit what people would feel if I was gone, they don't give a shit about me. So then I think, oh wait, maybe I shouldn't kill myself because I have something to offer the world. But really, I don't. I have nothing to offer anyone, and no one has anything else to offer me, except everything I have always seen. I want freedom. But I can't have freedom without pain. And the easiest and painless way to have freedom is to kill myself. That makes sense right?
