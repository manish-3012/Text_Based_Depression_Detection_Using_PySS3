Suicidally depressed and looking for help/advice.Hi. I've posted here before in the past but I wanted to post again to try to get some help/advice for my current situation. My name's Jacob. I'm 19. I have very severe OCD and major depressive disorder.

When I was 16, I lost my best friend. Not to death. She just started hating me. This was the closest person I've ever had in my life excluding my mom who I love and would miss if I ever were to hurt myself. When I lost her something in me snapped and I literally have not been the same since. I try to move on but I still think about her everyday and who she used to me. I never knew how much I needed her until I didn't have her. 

When I was 18, I tried weed for the first time. For a little while, weed helped massively. I was happy again. 

And then, it didn't.

Nowadays I feel so helpless. So alone. I can't even go a day without smoking. I tell myself I won't smoke and I end up getting high hours later. But I don't even really get high anymore. I just smoke to try to fill the void. 

The thoughts are getting really loud and I'm scared of myself. I can't hold a job because of my severe OCD and the little money that I do make isn't sustainable. I feel like I don't have a future. 

Any help/advice is appreciated. Thank you.
