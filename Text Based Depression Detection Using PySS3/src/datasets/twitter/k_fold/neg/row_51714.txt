I don't know if I can keep goingI have spent the last hour pushing a knife to my throat or wrist hoping it'll pierce the skin and a vein, but stopping when the pain gets too great... I've just been looking up how painful an overdose is (not getting any answers). I don't see any reason to turn to anyone since my depression never gets fixed and I never overcome my own pitfalls. I'm lazy and scared of everything. I self-sabotage and I want to push everything away. I just want to waste away and be forgotten.

I don't know what to do. I'm too cowardly to face life and too cowardly to embrace death. I just want to sleep and never wake up.
