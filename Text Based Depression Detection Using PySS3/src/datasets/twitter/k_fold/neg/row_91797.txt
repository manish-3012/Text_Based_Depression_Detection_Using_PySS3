WTF brain.I generally hate my life but recently Iâ€™ve been trying to plan how to change it but just when I start thinking about how it will take time but be better in the end something happens and the worst part is it doesnâ€™t matter how small it is it still makes my brain go back to I want to die and there is no point to living especially when I am so alone and always have been and it feels like I always will be and that Iâ€™m not good enough to be loved and I just generally feel like a monster.
