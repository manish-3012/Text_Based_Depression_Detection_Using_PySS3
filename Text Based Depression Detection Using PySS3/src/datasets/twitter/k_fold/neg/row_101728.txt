Six months since my last suicide attempt.Yesterday was the six-month mark since I tried to commit suicide and had to be rescued.  It was easily the worst decision of my life.  My life has gotten so much worse since then because of it.  I should never have done it the way I did.

I was in a very bad place.  I needed help and couldn't ask.  So instead I let friends and family know I was about to make an attempt on my life, and did so.  People came and cut me down.

Then they tortured me.  I was kicked out of my house.  My wife took the kids.  My friends all abandoned me.  My family has done nothing but scream at me.  My baby sister told me she hated me.

Things have gotten much, much worse.  I'm so afraid of trying again, but the last few scraps of what I had to live for have all been taken because I was a coward and an asshole.

I told myself if I could make it six months, I could make it forever.  But this has been the worst six months of my life.  The pain is a hundred times worse than it was six months ago.

I did it to myself.  There's no external forces to blame; no enemies did this to me.  My main motivation to stay alive is because I still give all my money to my wife and kids and they don't have any income besides me.  If I die they'll be in bad shape and I don't want to cause them more hardship than I already am.  But it's getting harder and harder to push through it.

That's all, sorry.
