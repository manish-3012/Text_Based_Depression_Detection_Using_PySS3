Birthday of a life timeToday I turned 19. I wasn't expecting to live past sixteen and since November 2018 my life has spiralled again. 

I'm living on my own in supported accommodation which is hard enough when I'm used to being around others. I'm whole heartedly an extrovert but I struggle with anxiety so I never go out and it makes me feel worse. This year, as all years my birthday was quiet and had bad moments but it did help me decide one thing.

I don't have anything to live for. 

Most people have a dream, kids, marriage, money, talent, fame, etc. But for me my future looks as bleak and dark as my childhood. Everyday is a battle of anxiety, depression and dysmorphia. I see no point in life and don't want to live much longer. I don't want to hurt my friend though who has been there for me for eight years. I'm going to try to make it to twenty-one if I can but otherwise I'm certainly going to die in the next five years.

I'm fighting the urge to attempt right now, I just wanted to tell someone, even strangers how I'm feeling.
