Tired Of People Betraying Me and Tired Of Acting Like A VictimMy ex left me high and dry, reneged on a many statements in which she pledged at least platonic loyalty. Blocked and unfollowed on every platform imaginable. Everyone ends up leaving me in the end. She kept acting smug and telling me to stop acting like a victim. She's right. I don't want to live in a world where people change and just leave you like discarded trash.
