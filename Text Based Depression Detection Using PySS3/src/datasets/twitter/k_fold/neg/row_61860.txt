That time of the year and I'm feeling tempted to die.I'm depressed and lonely normally, but with the holidays and having no family nearby it always pushes me to the edge on my darkest 'nobody cares about me thoughts.


I'm 40, not very attractive and have a borderline Aspie personality and haven't dated anyone in 10 years.

The only people I talks with are drinking buddies on a Friday, and they're not the type nor is it the situation that they want to hear me open up about my problems.
I feel a loser among most people because my depression makes me feel an underachiever next to them so I either avoid talking about it or just lie to fit in about my status.

To be honest I doubt anyone would even care if I died, and I base this on the evidence that no one notices at all if I'm not around for weeks.

So should I just do it, because my life will never get better than this?
