Lazy, stupid, selfish and coward.
Wants to be a good person but not a good person. Abused when I was a kid. Still being abused now. Have never tried so hard at anything my entire life until I found out what I want to do. Took two decades to find my passions, which given my current situation might be too late. Would rather die than not achieving my goals. Have a abusive POS brother. Have a gambling addict psychopath father. Have a mother that is stupidly in trust of people and led to being scammed and we are now in poverty. no matter how many times I screw something up shes still loves me. It's the most painful thing and a major reason why I don't want to live. She's overworking. I'm the only one who can help her but I'm not strong enough. I don't know what to do. I can't live with myself because My existence has been a pain to everyone. And How can I redeem myself when there are so many obstacles that I don't know how to break through. I'm not even sure if I died my mother's life would be better.
I'm living with a psychopath because I have no where else to go. My life has stopped in the worst place. I need help. I want to know how can some people get through this.
How can some people be strong enough to devote their life to someone else's.
What do you need to become a better person.
And what do you do if someone you know on internet have abusive parents and how can i help them.
I want to be able to help someone cause I don't wanna die a piece of shit.
