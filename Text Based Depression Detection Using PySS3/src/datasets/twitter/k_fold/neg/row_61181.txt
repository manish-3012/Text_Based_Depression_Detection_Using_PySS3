I find myself fantasizing a lot about blowing my brains out.I'm just so tired and anxious. I'm stressed out to my breaking point with college. I do all this work, and I feel like I'm getting nowhere. I have this job that makes me want to bleed myself out just thinking about it. The people. The hours. It's all just detestable. And then I only make enough to barely offset the cost of me existing while I still live at home with my parents.

I know my problems don't seem like anything special - because they aren't. But they've all just worn away at me inside and there's just this gnawing feeling of hopelessness. I feel overwhelmingly guilty. I feel I cant make friends with anyone, because I'd be doing them a favor not to. 

I just simply do not want to be alive anymore. I just want to go to sleep forever. I don't want to feel good, and I don't want to feel bad. I want to feel nothing whatsoever. I just want to cease being.
