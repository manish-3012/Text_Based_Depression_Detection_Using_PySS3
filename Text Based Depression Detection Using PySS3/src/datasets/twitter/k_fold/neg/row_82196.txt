The only reason Iâ€™m still here is for my grandma and my current boyfriendIm a 26yo woman who has struggled with an eating disorder for most of her life. Adding that to a toxic family environment, which I had to literally get away from. Until, I left home I was a shell of a human being. Despite all of that I managed to get better on my own. Felt like such a victory. Today I can eat anything without putting much thought into it. Iâ€™m at a healthy weight. Iâ€™m not obsessed with food anymore. I was always a good student, got myself a master and left home last year. 

Despite my supposed â€œhappy endingâ€ I dream of dying. Either everyday or every now and then. I can have some periods of weeks without putting much thought into it, but Its always there. Everytime something annoys me, my go to thought is: you can always die. I love my grandma and would never do anything to hurt her. And recently I met a wonderful person who has been treating me so well, Iâ€™m even ashamed of saying these words. How can I still feel like this? I believe no matter how much good comes into my life, I will always feel this away. Whats the point of keep going? None.
