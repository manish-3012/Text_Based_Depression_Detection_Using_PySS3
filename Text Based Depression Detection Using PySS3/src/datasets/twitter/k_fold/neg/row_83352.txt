Ive got the water infront of me and gun beside me I dont know what to do anymoreI'm sitting here over looking the river below me contemplating how I want to end it. Ive got my gun next to me or I could just simply jump. My life has gone down the shitter, dropped put of engineering college to pursue a career in law enforcement. But my body is falling apart im in constant pain and nobody is listening to me about anything lately. I feel like im.out of options this will most likely be a goodbye.
