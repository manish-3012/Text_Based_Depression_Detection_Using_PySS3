Hello, alt account because of obvious reasons, but I need to get something off my chest and I donâ€™t know where else to post this.About 8 months ago I was planning to kill myself. I was going to tie a rope to a hook in my bedroom wall that was once used for a swinging suspended chair. The only thing that stopped me was the hook itself, which when I pulled on it to test if it would hold me, almost came out. 

Over the months since then, I have been to therapy and I am good now, in fact my last session is in a few days. 

My problem is that I would have done it. I would have ended my life there and then if it wasnâ€™t for the structural weakness of the spot in the wall. That was all that stopped me, that kept me alive. I am ashamed that I came that close, and I want to believe that I didnâ€™t do it for a reason, but the reality is I wouldnâ€™t be here if the wall was that much stronger. I donâ€™t want to tell anyone I came that close, they already know enough and Iâ€™m pretty much all good now. It just comes back to me ever now and again, how I was too weak to carry on, how I would have done it without thinking twice. Itâ€™s just the shame, knowing I would have thrown it all away that easily.

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for, in posting this. I just had to get it out, if you made it this far then thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day.
