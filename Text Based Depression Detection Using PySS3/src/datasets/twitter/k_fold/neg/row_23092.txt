Hi, I'd like to apologize. I realize I did something terrible.I'm not a "troll", but I've been messaging some of the people that have given replies to the OP's of this sub.

I guess I should start by saying that I'm also suicidal, and I've been going to threads and reading the replies that the OP got, and sort of read them as if I was a part of their targeted audience. Most of the time I simply reported the responses that broke the rules in the sidebar, but other times I'd see someone do it over, and over again and I just got *really, really angry*, and I felt the need to personally PM those people and tell them to stop giving out "tough love" and clichÃ© advice. As you can see, I'm hypersensitive to those types of messages. "It could be worse", "Stop feeling sorry for yourself", and all guilt-tripping variants make my blood boil. Now, obviously my temper isn't an excuse for what I've said, but I'm simply giving you the rationale.

If there have been messages directed to OP's or anyone else asking for help, someone else has been doing that. All my pm's were to regular repliers to the OP's, just to make it clear.

Obviously I'll stop immediately and will simply avoid this sub altogether. I know this doesn't mean much and I couldn't possibly ask for forgiveness, but I feel beyond remorseful and guilty (of course, deservedly so). I'm sorry to everyone I've messaged, I'll be leaving now.
