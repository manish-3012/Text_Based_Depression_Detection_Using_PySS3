Suicidal because I'm a beta male.I hate that term because it represents toxic masculinity, however it's the best way to phrase it. I. am. a. pussy. Any form of confrontation I back down, think of Evan from superbad. All I want is to be able to be a normal person - I'm that guy at the party where all of my friends are upstairs fucking girls where I'm awkwardly stood there in the kitchen watching people have fun. Women are repulsed by me. There are natural born alphas and betas, and the fact it's determined by genetics and knowing in my existence I will never get a taste of what it's like to be an alpha makes life seem meaningless. Why shouldn't I kill myself? My friends go off and do things that I'm too pussy to do, I can't be a fucking nervous, sweaty, creepy pedo around girls and I can't even talk to a fucking crowd without sweating, voice trembling and a face as red as a tomato. If I can't become an alpha I will kill myself - life isn't worth living as a pussy.
