I think about killing myself everyday........I have been suffering with depression for the past 4 years( I am 18 now) and everytime I think about killing myself there is always something which prevents it from happening. I tried to come clean to my parents about it and they shrug it off like I am using it as an excuse for my low marks and my slow anti-social behaviour. I don't want to come clean because people will think I am an attention seeker which I am the complete opposite of. I need someone who can understand what I am feeling and I need advice about how to survive in this world where I kill myself on a daily basis in my mind in different ways.
