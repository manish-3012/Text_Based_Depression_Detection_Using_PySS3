Iâ€™m coping with depression by vapingFirst of all Iâ€™d like to say that I had depression for about 10 years already. Recently (like 3 months ago) I started vaping again and I felt really happy. Although I had to move to another country and school. It has really helped me keep the stress down. But recently school started a stricter policy with vaporizers and although Iâ€™m 18 they would take away my vape and tell my parents ( they donâ€™t live with me and I donâ€™t like to disappoint them so if I got busted that would suck) and that has given me a lot of anxiety, stress and paranoia. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
