anniversary  Yesterday was the four-year anniversary of my beginning to self-harm. April 3rd has always been the day of relapse for me. 
  Last November I was hospitalized after an overdose. The EMT taking me to the hospital told me that I need to think about what my death would have done to my family. As if that wasn't the one thing preventing me from a serious attempt this whole time. The doctors and nurses kept asking me why I did it, and I had no reason to give them. How is it that being done with this fucked up world isn't enough? I ended up lying through my teeth to get released.
   I have been diagnosed with MD and anxiety. I have a support network of family and friends, and three different counselors. It seems like none of this helps me in a time of crisis. I'm awful at asking people for help.
  I just want to die. How is this such a big thing to ask for? Death is inevitable, anyways. It's the final goal. How is it that the one thing I'm willing to fight for is the only thing my body is fighting against?
