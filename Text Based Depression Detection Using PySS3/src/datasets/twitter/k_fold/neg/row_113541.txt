It's like a hole you can't get out ofHi reddit,

I know it's not your job to keep me alive, and there isn't a gun to my head right now. But I figure, in the community somewhere, someone can help me.

I'm a sophomore in college. I loved biology, but it took me until the beginning of the year to reconcile with the work that's asked of biology majors to officially switch. I did okay last quarter, and freshman year I had a high g.p.a. But now...I'm already failing half my classes and I can't find it in me to care or salvage the other half. I don't like any of the bull shit that's not biology that they make you take, but I've failed my one bios course striking a fatal blow to my confidence. I have no motivation. I don't even know what I'd do with that major ultimately. I live in an honors dorm where the standards are really high and no one really has sympathy for excuses. I don't have any friends at school close enough to me that I'm willing to talk to, though I'm becoming increasingly agitated no one cares my eyes are puffy and red everyday. I told my parents I'd reached a low and for some reason they insist I exercise to cure my mood, even tough it's rainy and cold and I'm a petite female with a great dislike for both winter and exercise.

I've been sad before, reddit. I've bawled my eyes out over loved lost. But I always moved forward. This is something I've never felt before. I don't know how to shake it, I'm not sure why I'm sad. I get angry at myself for not working like I should be but I just can't see the point anymore. I get angry at others for irrational reasons. I want to sleep all the time. I have a hunting knife that I keep thinking about more and more.

I'm typing this out and realizing I should look for help. But it's a vicious circle. I sit around with the intention of working, then I can't make myself do so, then I guilt myself for not doing so, then all my time and energy is consumed. I'm afraid of this kind of failure, and I'm so confused as to why I am unable to function in the first place...

I know I don't need to cut myself for reddit to talk to me, but damn if I don't consider the option IRL.

What's gone wrong?
