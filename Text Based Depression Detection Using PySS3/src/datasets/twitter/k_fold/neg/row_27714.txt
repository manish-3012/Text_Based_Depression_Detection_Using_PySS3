Sometimes I feel it's too muchI keep thinking about it but I know that I can't.  The thought is there daily.  I do go to therapy.  I (M40) am married to (F41) for 12 years but the last 10 have been so depressing.  Every day I feel worthless.  I want to be happy but I don't think I ever can be.  Just written on the divorce subreddit but a lot of people do say that I should divorce as that she is damaging my health.
