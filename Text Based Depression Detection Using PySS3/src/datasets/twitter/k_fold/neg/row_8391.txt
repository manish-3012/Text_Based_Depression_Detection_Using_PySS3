I have nobody in my life who I can talk to--things are so dark.I am glad I found this community, I have no one I can speak to in real life and have been going through a very dark time. Even though I am older woman(29) I have always been a timid, shy person who has a hard time opening up to people. In February I met a guy that I started seeing and he seemed genuine. However, this month he ghosted me (he was the only person I ever really dated since I am so shy, so I am unsure if this is normal to do after so many months) since then I have felt very depressed. I have always struggled with an eating disorder &amp; self harm but I was doing better before I met him. Now, I am at the lowest point in my life because I analyze our last interactions daily in my mind wondering what I did wrong (our last interactions were basic and light hearted, never dramatic). I always tried to support him and not bother him a lot, we both are fairly easygoing so I don't understand what mistake I might have made. Lately I have spiraled back in my eating disorder because I feel like if I looked different, he would have stayed around. I know a lot of people will say I could find someone else but you don't understand the extent of my social anxiety, this was the one person in my whole life I felt comfortable and open around. It took a lot of effort on my part to be vulnerable to even build a relationship. At my age I wanted to be married, but instead I am living the worst version of my life. I feel very hopeless and have been contemplating dying lately, because I really am just tired of the heavy feeling that I experience daily. I am older, and have lived enough life, so I don't feel bad killing myself. I never contributed anything positive to this world anyway, so I really don't deserve to live another day.
