I don't want to live and I feel very sickI'm 16 I live with my friend. Mom left when I was born, dad's in jail. I've stopped eating a lot. I only eat the meals my friend's (tiffany) mom makes for breakfast and dinner, and the occasional snack. I don't have any energy physically, it used to be mentally. I'm always cold, but I don't care. I always cry and tiffany doesn't know what else to do.

I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't want to continue hurting myself and become a problem for everyone else.

I feel like death will be a reliever and I know it's wrong. I want to be happy and look forward to things like everyone around me. I get reminded of what could have been by living with my friend's family. They are huge and all love eachother. I feel like an outcast when they are all around.

I feel like I'm killing myself slowly. I can hardly get out of bed. I don't care though. I want this to happen, but I don't want it to be this way. I feel like all doors are locked and I'm just alone. I want help but I don't know how.
