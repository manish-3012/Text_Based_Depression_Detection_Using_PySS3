Goodbye, World!....is the last line in my suicide note. Being a programmer, I thought it was quite witty and fitting. Unfortunately, no one will get to read it since I'll probably just leave it in my pocket anyway.

My life is pointless. I get up, see my shitty self in the mirror, take a shower, go to work, come "home" (a shitty room in a house full of random people I've never met nor want to get to know), and just wait for the morning to come again. 

No real friends. Family is so fake that it hurts when I think of it. Job is quite monotonous. No social prospects; never had one and never will. I don't think I've ever been "happy". I don't really know what's wrong with me, but I know that I will never be a normal person - that's the worst part.

I feel guilty doing it now since my work has a huge project deadline. So I think I'm going to continue until my current obligations are concluded as to not fuck up an entire company, then take "vacation" time off and do it then. Part of me wonders how long it will take them to notice I'm gone.

I don't even know why I'm posting here. I guess it's because I want someone to see my last words, even if I have no idea who they are.

So,

Goodbye, World!
