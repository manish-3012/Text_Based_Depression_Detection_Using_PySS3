Feeling Like I Don't Even Want to Get Better AnymoreI had a rough time dealing with depression and anxiety since my teens, all made worse by being transgender. I did well in highschool though I made no friends and in University I did a mix of poor and well and had some of what I thought was the worst time in my life, which eventually lead to me changing my life extensively. 

After getting my useless degree I pursued transition and have done well for myself there, it vastly improved my mood and confidence in a lot of ways. I tried some paths to expanding the usefulness of my degree, entering a journalism program, which I found did not offer the sort of journalism I was interested in, and two masters programs, one of which went very well before my funding fell through. Since then I have been struggling to find a job that I can deal with with no success. I have been on income assistance with disability for my anxiety disorder. 

But despite these things I kept trying. My dream is to be a writer and so while I look for jobs or training opportunities I work on that, even doing the "International Novel Writing Month" thing successfully. I have managed to sell a few things but not for anything worth mentioning. Selling "study guides" to college students has been the only real addition to my less than thousand a month I make. But I keep trying.

I have good friends, a few at least, but they're online. And I managed to get an amazing boyfriend, though he was long distance in America. But he came and visited me and skyped often... We had a plan for me to come and visit his friends and family in the US, which was expensive and made more expensive by a massive fuck up I made with my passport requiring me to buy a new one and ending with me being a week late for the trip. Still it went well, he said it did too, and he said his family and friends thought I was great; even though there was concern of friction because of me being trans. It was the most fun I had in a long time.

A few weeks after that without much warning he broke up with me. He said he loved me, but it wasn't the sort of romantic love he thought it was. I've since had some hints of the real reason but I guess it's not really important.

Since then I have been a mess. Back in June, a little over a month after it I felt better and was suddenly full of energy and wrote a ton of stuff and was working on all kinds of plans but I started to hit walls. I started feeling it all again bit by bit before I felt like I was back down in the hole I was in back at the end of University. There have been days now where I haven't even been able to get out of bed. I'll wake up and maybe go on my computer for a few hours or go out and get a couple groceries but then feel so exhausted I need to lie down already... Some days I don't eat. Other days I eat a ton. I don't even enjoy any of the video games I used to like to play and the one thing that has always been fun for me, being the dungeon master for a dungeons and dragons game, has become unfulfilling.

I have been thinking about self harm and suicide. I have a psychiatrist and she's really good. She is less focused on medication and more on teaching cognitive behavioral therapy and has even tried teaching me some others but at this point it seems like nothing works and I feel like she's getting frustrated. I had a bad counselor in the past who told me she had no more ideas of how to help me. She went to some new conference recently about nutrients and methylation and is really excited about some new ideas that might help me but I am not hopeful. I did get my blood taken for her tests though.

I don't know what to do. And what's worse it that I don't even know if I want to bother anymore. I have a friend coming to visit me in August, I think as a sort of intervention. I don't think it will be able to make anything better though. I am almost thirty now and I feel like I have been hearing "it gets better" for a long time. But everything that has made me happy in the past few years, school, boyfriend, writing has ended up just making me feel worse.

I am sorry this is long and rambly. I just had to do something. I don't feel right talking about this to my mom or my friends anymore. I don't want to make them afraid.
