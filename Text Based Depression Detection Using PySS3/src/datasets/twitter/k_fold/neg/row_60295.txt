Absolute emotional numbnessI'm completely apathetic to everything. Nothing has purpose to me. I'm just an observer of other people feeling alive while I'm just surviving doing what is expected from me. From childhood trauma through loneliness over drug addiction to physical illness I've suffered from so much and it keeps going. I have a stable life now and most of the things many people would call good circumstances. Still nothing brings me distraction from this emotional flatline. Tried spirituality and religion which could give me comfort in theory but I've tried them over and over and they didn't really work.
I really want to cease to exist. I have to be honest I know I won't kill myself even though I'd like the idea of it. So better use your time to answer an actual suicidal person instead of me. I won't have the energy to answer to comments anyway.
The thought of living like this for the upcoming ~50 years until life ends on its own feels more like death than the actual physical death.
