I push myself to feel useful. Useful &gt; worthlessI'm a 23yo male. Ive never posted before but been around reddit for a bit now.

I have always felt worthless. While this is true I have never really felt suicidal, I have always been excited for the future. 

That is starting to change, recently I feel as if I'm losing some sort of battle internally and feel myself giving up. On everything.

On paper I know I'm not worthless, this is intentional. When I was a kid I already knew I was smart, I never studied hard yet always achieved high marks. This never really stopped all through university, this does not mean I did not push myself. I understand things quickly. Not people.

My childhood was lonely, I didn't have friends, I didn't understand how to be someone's friend. I wanted to talk about how things worked or made, or about how cool the future is going to be. My only real friends, and the people who understood me was my dad and my gran.

Since my parents split, I've slowly seen less and less of my dad to the point I haven't seen him in 2 years. I talk to him nearly every day But, he has a new family and doesn't put effort into seeing me, and slowly I've struggled to take up the slack. He didn't even come to my graduation. Partly I took on a PhD so that maybe he would come to my next one.

Now I learnt how to make friends. Some very good friends. At one point I was even quite popular. I craved friends to the point I learnt how to be friends with specific people. Now this doesn't mean I was a different person to every friend. I just learnt what they liked/interested In, what they found funny etc. This is how I understood friends and didn't understand why it never felt reciprocated.

This resulted in a lot of pain as these friends were superficial and they would drop me in the blink of an eye. I've never had a friend that actually knew me. I don't know me.

Now I said I'm not worthless on paper and it was intentional, well I realised early on people would seek my help with things. This made me feel useful. Useful is better than worthless. So I'd help anyone, with anything I could or I'd At least try.

This lead to people treating me as a tool, like a screwdriver or a spanner. They would seek me out when they needed me, tossed me back in toolbox when they were done. But hey, At least I felt useful for a bit.

I've always pushed myself harder and harder. The more I know, the more helpful I can be etc etc. So on paper I look great. Yet I've never had a best friend. The girl I loved beyond anything got bored of me, I could no longer excite her. I tried so hard to fix it. But in the end I was an ass and talked to other women. now I'd never cheat, but it was killing me so I'd talk and very minorly flirt with women. For attention. So she left me.

Last week my gran died. She was the only person I could talk to about my emotions and feelings. I talk to my dad about what I'm interested in and what excites me. My gran was the only person who made me feel loved. Now I know I'm loved. My mum adores me. But she doesn't know me 1 bit. My family are very simple people, and treat me like an alien cause I've been to uni. They interrogate me and love to ask me questions, but I'm more a zoo exhibit to them. 

Which brings me to today, I've spent Christmas alone. When I say alone I'm at home with my mum, but she left for 12 hours to go see people who don't know me so understandably didn't want me there. The only person who took my call just so I could wish them a merry Christmas was my dad. 

I could carry on for much much longer, I started writing this cause I'm out on a long walk at 2am when I started get some seriously dark thoughts and I couldn't control them. Just writing this has made me feel better. Think I'll wall home instead.

If anyone reads this. Hi.

I've just proof read this and I realise I sound like an arsehole who doesn't realise it. People honestly tell me I'm one of the loveliest people they know. Please don't think I'm an arsehole.
