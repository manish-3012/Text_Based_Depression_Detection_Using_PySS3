I'm not really suicidal.. I just completely hate myself.That's not quite true.  I love my professional life.  Lately, however, I'm so depressed with my personal life, that I just can't concentrate and enjoy my professional life anymore.  In short, the only thing that I'm happy with is my professional life, but I'm so unhappy with who I am, outside of that, that I can't concentrate and enjoy that.

Briefly.  I'm a PhD student.  I was doing great until a couple of years in, and I was happy.  I had a nasty breakup, and decided to change my dating habits.  I took to Mystery Method and all of that.  It kind of changed how I look at people.

I looked at my friends, and saw that they could go to the bar and go home with a girl.  Women actively avoid my gaze in public, as if to assure me that they don't even want to meet me.

Even among my friends, I feel like I'm regarded as a loser.  I have friends who love and care for me, who would be upset if I didn't show up to their stupid dinners, or parties, or whatever, who also think that I'm totally lame.  I want friends who respect me.  I know that there are people who respect me (see my professional life).. they're just not my friends.

I feel like I can't relate to anyone, and like if I ask for advice or help, then they'll develop a negative opinion of me.  But the sex thing, that's the thing that kills me.  I feel like every girl out there fucks a million guys, and then wants to settle down with a guy like me.  Like the cads and dads hypothesis, where I'm the loser who gets cheated on.

I'm just sick of everything.  I'm not going to kill myself, I just want to reboot and fix myself.  Is there some way that I can do that?
