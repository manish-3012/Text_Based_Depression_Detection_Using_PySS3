negativity in the comments could be supporting suicidal ideationI've been lurking on this subreddit for years because I've been suicidal for a long time. I read other people's stories and posts so I don't feel alone in these thoughts. Something I've noticed recently is that a lot of the comments here aren't trying to be helpful anymore. I see posts about life being bleak and miserable, and most of the comments just agree with them. Like a lot of the comments aren't offering any optimism or hope. Some even go as far as basically supporting suicide. It's almost like this subreddit is becoming a bit of a circle jerk. I could be wrong, maybe not I just see more negativity because I'm so sad. I don't mean to judgemental. I know depression and mental illness can be repetitive and that lots of people just want to relate to others. But I think people who really want to help should be encouraging positivity instead of bringing more negativity and hopelessness into it. I'm sorry if this offends anybody.
