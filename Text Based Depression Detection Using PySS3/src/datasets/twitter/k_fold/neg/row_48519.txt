holy crapthese feelings are real. I actually want to die. I have thought of suicide regularly for years but I have never come close to making an attemp. Untill a couple weeks ago. I just wanted some peace. I wanted to fall asleep with an empty brain. 
I crushed up adivans and mixed it in water so it didnt have a chance to change my mind after the first couple doses. It was followed by codeine. I was high and sleepy but I did not feel anything. I passed out only to be woken up by my concerned boyfriend. 
I was so upset it did not work. I should have taken those meds with a bottle of vodka. Water? wtf was I thinking! obviously It wouldn't be lethal. perhaps i knew this deep inside and really didn't want to die. But i did. Now i am still here lurking around the planet with no purpose, drive, ambitions.... i am a parent, a gf, a friend, a sister, a daughter... but non of this gives me the will to live. not even my own flesh and blood because I know at the end of the day they are better off without me. 
I hate making people feel the need to help me. I dont want that at all. I don't think I want help.  I have tried meds, therapy, exercise , etc but I just want darkness. 
I see the agony i cause others just by breathing. 
I honestly don't know why the heck I decided to post here. this is totally out of my comfort zone. I am not Internet savy but figured I would give a first time post a shot. there is not a single person in the world that can help me so trying this strange for me. But I am crazy so what is one more crazy thing? 
thanks for reading. god bless.
