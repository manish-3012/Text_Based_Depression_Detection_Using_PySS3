Last meal! Do not touch me!Ironically my last meal is a happy meal from McDonaldâ€™s! Itâ€™s not much but itâ€™s enough to fill me up. I eat fuck all so I consider this as a binge! the thing that bothers me most about suicide is people touching my dead body! Dead people look ugly! I look like shit anyway but it really bothers me! I want to set myself on fire instead of people touching my corpse. I am quite happy to go through with it I just donâ€™t want anybody to touch me... once I have done it I wonâ€™t have any control what happens.....
