worried about a friend - how can i be supportive?my current closest friend has been struggling with mental health for about a year and a half now. sheâ€™s very stressed with her massive debt (nursing school but she couldnâ€™t handle the stress of the job), unsupportive family (neither emotionally nor financially), and sense of isolation from her friend group (she feels like an outsider). for a long time, weâ€™ve discussed that feeling of wishing you were never born or wishing for a zero recourse, zero collateral way of opting out.

lately she has been more depressed than usual, and with how she was talking to me this morning, iâ€™m personally becoming worried that this may become (or has become) suicidal thinking.

my question is:

**what can i say to someone when they say they never wanted this? that they donâ€™t want to have to deal with anything, much less everything? is there anything i can do or say other than sit there and listen helplessly?**
