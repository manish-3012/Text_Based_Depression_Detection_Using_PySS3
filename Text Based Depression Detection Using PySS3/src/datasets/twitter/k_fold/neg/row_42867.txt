Telling a parent?I don't know if it's a good idea or not. 

I've been really struggling these last couple days.

It seems my dad can see it now, always asking me if I'm fine (he never does that), telling me I look pale and stuff.

Everytime I obviously say I'm fine but I've been thinking of maybe saying I'm not.

I don't know what he would think of it, I'm not very close to my dad. I feel like he hates me sometimes but now he's all over me.
