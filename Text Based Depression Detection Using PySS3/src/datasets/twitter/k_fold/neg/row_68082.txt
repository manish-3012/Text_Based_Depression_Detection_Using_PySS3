I need help, pleaseLast month has been the hardest yet. 
I was finally moving along with the pain of having my heart break since January, but then I started having a lot of family issues.
My ex broke up with me and I have to move back in with my parents. They do have a pretty toxic relationship and argue a lot, but things got worse when part of my family start acussing us of trying the still the heritage left by my grandfather (which, btw, is completely bs). My once united family is now completely shattered and I feel like my support system is broken as well.
I'm tired of still suffering for my ex, I'm trying of crying every night to sleep, I'm trying of how much of my day is just working. I'm also completely scared of the future, 'cause I have no idea what I want to be or where I want to be. I lost all my future plans this year and feel so insecure about me.
I'm not a child, I'm 26 and feel like my life is stuck.
Im going to therapy and that had help a lot, but nights like this one the only thing I can think about is fading away from this world.
What scares me the most is hurting myself physically and what my friends/family would think of me if I finally got the courage to do it. Will it hurt them? Will they feel guilty? I don't want that emotions for them.
