I've planned to kill myself when I turn 18- I'm 16
- I don't want to grow up
- Work? Ew.
- My friends will move away with their husbands and wives and leave me in the dust (I don't blame them, I'd leave me too)
- I'll get my driver's license tomorrow (me every day)
- I'll get a job tomorrow (also me every day)
- Afraid to leave the house. I don't want people to see my ugly face.
- Self-pity is fantastic. I do it every day.
- I have poor social skills. How on Earth could I take orders at McDonald's if I can't even speak to my teachers without stressing out?
- I don't want to live with my parents. I want to be independent.
- Well if I can't do work and I don't want to live with my parents...guess I'll go homeless.
- Ahaha my life is hopeless
- I laugh about my problems now and later realize that they actually haven't gone away and my suicide is a ticking time bomb.

I don't need your pity. I have myself. (Then why did I post this? We'll never know.)
