It's 5:30am. I'm still awake, thinking over if I'm gonna kill myself soon or notI can't even tell anyone because nobody thinks this can be my decision. They just think they have to stop me at all costs, without thinking why I actually want to do it in the first place. My life is too much, I can't handle it. Maybe that makes me weak. Ultimately though it's true. I can't handle this life and I need a way out. I'm the one who has to deal with it every second of every day, not anyone who would tell me not to end it. They don't feel this pain so they don't know why I want to die. Some don't even make an effort to understand, they just say don't do it and think that's helpful.


My point mainly is just that this needs to be my decision but nobody else sees it that way. This is my life, my suffering, etc. I'm an adult and I can choose to live or not
