I have no interest in anythingEveryday is a bore, my lifeâ€™s on repeat. Only difference being I care less and less and Iâ€™m poorer and poorer. All my interests and hobbies have just faded and I donâ€™t enjoy things Iâ€™d done for years.

My relationships with people who were close have either broken down or are breaking down. I am going to be so alone soon, and i genuinely donâ€™t care.

At least I only would need to think about me in the future, when I just try and move on.
