Not much leftI truly feel and there is nothing to live for anymore sometimes I wonder why the good die young when they should just take the people that donâ€™t wanna be here anymore. I had once wrote a song called the hands of time.... in the hands of times memories are lost... memories that we proceed to toss... so why must it be that we need to cross the same path that we donâ€™t need to walk....
