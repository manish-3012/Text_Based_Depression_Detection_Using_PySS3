the thoughtsI've been contemplating it for a while. I mean I can't help but think how it would affect people. I think the majority wouldn't care but maybe my boyfriend would, who knows. Yesterday I was left alone and almost swallowed a bottle of pills. The other day I wrote suicide notes. Four to be exact. I don't know anymore whether I should do it or wait to see what life has in store. What I do know though is that it's driving me insane. Getting left alone is the worst, it's what drives me to want to do it. I can never manage to stay happy long, my depression has gotten worse. Honestly, life sucks but do I want to end it? I guess we'll see eventually.
