I can't deal with what I've becomehttps://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/bo98es/i_followed_my_heart_and_good_intentions_to_hell/?

For background.

So I am currently sitting here, trying to figure it out. I'm a god damn monster who should be put down. However, that's not what she wanted and as she put it, "I owe her one." Public confession is the first step on the road to atonement, however I have to fall asleep and wake up with this. I have to look in the mirror with this.

So SW, witness me for what I am, an abuser, a manipulator, and a rapist. Who is also highly accomplished in several areas. Don't minimize what I've done please. Just...make me realize I don't have to die for this.
