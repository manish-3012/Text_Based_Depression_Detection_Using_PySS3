Goodbye, reddit, i buy the ropes tomorrowI figured i'd lost here anonymously first, i'll text my friends and family goodbyes shortly before i leave. I have my note, it is everything i want it to be. I know they all know me as the one who can play piano, so i recorded my favorite song. I drew a beautifully simple picture, containing everything i feel towards everybody, just love. I'm sorry if i drag anybody down. Tomorrow i wake up, bathe, drive to the store on my fucked up foot, buy a nice strong rope, go to my favorite childhood creek, and hang myself. I love you all, I'm sorry. N,R,Jo,Ja,Re,Ru, and D. You were my everything and i'm sorry.

For now, i should just get some sleep.
