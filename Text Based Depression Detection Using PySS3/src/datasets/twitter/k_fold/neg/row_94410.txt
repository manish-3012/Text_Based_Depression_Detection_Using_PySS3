He Got What He Wanted...Hey Reddit. It's me again. Your local depressed piece of shit. Your stupid, ignorant selfish depressed piece of shit. You know, the one that ruins everything. I struggle with suicidal thoughts everyday but it's worse now after pursuing a relationship with an older man. He told me he loved me...that he wanted to take all my pain away. He only added to it....I really thought he cared for me. Not anymore. Not anymore.... Now all I wanna do is die. It's been two weeks since I've spoken to him and I still can't get him off my mind. It seems that whatever I'm doing he'll always pop back into my head. I just wanna die so I don't have to think about him anymore. It's too painful....knowing he'll never speak to me again. He told me I was crazy. That I'm a trip. I really believe he's right. And now I just wanna die...I don't want this pain anymore. I don't want to keep thinking about him. I want to tell somebody but I don't want to put him in jail because I initially made advances on him. And he has somebody to take care of....but at the end of the day it doesn't change the fact that I've been forced to sit in this pain and idk how much longer I can deal with it. I asked him to speak to me again, that I didn't need much from him. He completely dismissed me and told me he "just got his anxiety straight". While I'm the one who doesn't even wanna walk out of my house anymore because he lives right next to me. I can't stop thinking about him. The only way I see I can end it is through my death. I don't want sympathy. I just want the pain to end....Please PLEASE just let it end. I don't want these memories anymore and I don't want to keep caring for him even when I shouldn't...I just want to get over it but I know I never will. The memories are just too painful....
