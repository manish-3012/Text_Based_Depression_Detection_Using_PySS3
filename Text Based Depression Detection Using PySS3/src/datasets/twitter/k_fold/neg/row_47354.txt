I donâ€™t want to do this anymore...Life sucks. 

My anxiety has been increasing, and as a result of that, Iâ€™m feeling more depressed. Iâ€™ve barely been able to get out of bed, and I have no motivation. On top of that, someone I really liked just flat out did a 180 on me, and started blaming me for everything. I felt lik shit. I had three panic attacks last night. Iâ€™m strongly considering just putting an end to it all.
