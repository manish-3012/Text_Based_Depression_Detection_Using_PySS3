just whatâ€™s the point anymoreI donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s the point in life anymore. Iâ€™m just going through the motions every day and it never gets any better. I have no friends, the only person I talk to regularly is my mom and I feel like Iâ€™m just a burden to her. Iâ€™ve always been a burden to her. I donâ€™t want to exist anymore. I donâ€™t want to be me anymore, because I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore. I donâ€™t recognize the face in the mirror anymore, why do I even exist. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore
