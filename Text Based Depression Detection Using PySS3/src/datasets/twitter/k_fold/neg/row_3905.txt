On my mind againSuicide has always seemed like such a logical thing to do when I am hurt. I turn to self-harming things to do instead of face the world around me (e.g. watching suicide videos, cutting my wrists). I've been thinking that I'm mentally ill (schizophrenia and gender identity disorder), but are those justifiable for the thoughts of ending my own life? For a few weeks I've had a compulsion to just sneak out one night while my parents are asleep (I am in highschool), go to the nearest building, and leap from it. The experience of falling and the sudden end of my life seems thrilling, and peaceful, all at the same time.
