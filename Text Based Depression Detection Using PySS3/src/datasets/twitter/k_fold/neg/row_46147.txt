there is absolutely no good reason for me to be aliveIv'e gotten all the "help" I could get. from mental hospitals, to residential facilities, to therapy, to meds. At this point, I am suffering, and I'm making everyone else suffer, and I am spending money that doesn't need to be spent, And making peoples lives worse. But then I am still scared?  at this point I need other people encouragement to put myself down. people are wasting good energy on me.

I feel like I haven't experienced enough life to die, ( like sex, or seeing the ocean, or college, or having friends ) but I also know that It doesn't matter how many things I experience, I wont feel any better, and I'm still going to be suffering.

the world and the people in it disgust me, why would I want to live in this selfish world? I have gotten the amount of help that would typically change peoples life, but guess what, I'm still depressed and suicidal as fuck! and you know what that means? **its not going to get better!** so I need to stop thinking it gets better, because it doesn't, at least not for me.

if my family is reading this a while from now, do you understand why I'm dead now??
