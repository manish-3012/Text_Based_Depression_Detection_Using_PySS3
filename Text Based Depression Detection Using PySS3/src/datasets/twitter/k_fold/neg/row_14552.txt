DiagnosisI got diagnosed with depression and anxiety today and I donâ€™t know how to feel about it. I feel happy that I got help but I also feel upset and angry I guess I donâ€™t know. I know itâ€™s not as severe as other peopleâ€™s diagnosis but it just feels weird to get help when all my life I havenâ€™t gotten anything. I told the doctor I was cutting and having suicidal thoughts all the time and he asked how recent Iâ€™ve cut and I said a few weeks. I lied. I didnt want to say a couple days ago because my mom was right beside me. She heard everything and I felt like she was disappointed in me. Now the urges to cut myself are really bad and I just want to yeet myself really damn hard.
