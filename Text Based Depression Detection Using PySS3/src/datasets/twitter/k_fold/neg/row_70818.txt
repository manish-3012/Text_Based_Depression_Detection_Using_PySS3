I keep trying to hang myself but its not working.I tried twice already, hanging myself with a belt from a doorknob is the only method I can do right now. I keep getting close, I dont care about the pain or the marks it leaves but my head feels like its about to explode and my body jolts for air. I dont feel regret or anything I just feel angry at myself for failing again. At some point it has to work. I wish there is an easier route. I'm so tired of living.
