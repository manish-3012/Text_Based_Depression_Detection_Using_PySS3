My Boyfriend triggers my suicidal thoughts.I really want to end it tonight ! My boyfriend, if you can even call.him that coz he always breakjgn up with me, actually drives me  to this point.

Things have been rocky about us the last few days. I told him exactly how much debt I was in and he lost it. He wanted access to my bank accounts and if I was to spend money on anything uncessary or what he deemed wasteful he was going to break up with me. He also demanded I lose weight. So pathetic me of course submitted to his dad's coz I didn't want him.to leave me. And he still was giving me attitude saying he doesn't want to speak.to me coz he finds me to be disgusting. 

Today I had a busy day with work and then went to work on a group assignment so my brain was really distracted from.the issues going on in my love life. I was driving home feeling super motivated to finish my essay and he messages me. And my mood changed  instantly. I felt this shame and anger come.over me which got worse the more we spoke. He wants everything on his terms and when I politely said I didn't want to speak tonight so I could be in the right headspace for uni he called me a coward. Said I was the most selfish  person he had ever met. Which is funny coz he himself has has been battling depression for the last 10 years and as a result hasn't had a job or finished his degree in that time. I even went out of my way to help him with uni and pulled all nighter  to do his assignments. I guess that's why it really gets me down when he calls me selfish coz I feel like I do try to put his needs before mine. 

He honestly makes me want to kill myself. I feel like  I have nothing to add to society or other people's lives when he puts me down. I wish I was dead so I didn't have to feel this pain
