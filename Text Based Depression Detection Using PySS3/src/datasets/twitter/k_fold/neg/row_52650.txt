I probably wonâ€™t but everything just sucksIâ€™m a sophmore in a private highschool. I would say that Iâ€™m pretty well liked and that I have a bunch of friends. But, according to my mom, my grades are sh*t (Bs and Cs). And while I semi-agree, she has reason because I could lose my small scholarship. But, I canâ€™t bring myself to study or just work. Hell, Iâ€™m avoiding doing work right now. Iâ€™ve always been a good student throughout elementary up until 7th grade. Then, I started to struggle because I actually had to study and work hard. But no matter how hard Iâ€™ve tried recently I canâ€™t get the grades I need to keep my scholarship. My mom has been fighting with me for so long that recently she just gave up. She decided that she doesnâ€™t care what I do anymore. She keeps reinforcing the fact that I had gotten some bad grades recently by bringing them up in casual conversation. Iâ€™ve put up so many walls of lies and complete bullcrap to hide what Iâ€™ve been dealing with outside of my house. Everything just sucks and I feel like Iâ€™m garbage. Doubly so because of my momâ€™s asian expectations. Iâ€™m going to keep trying but I just feel like nothing I do is going to affect what has happened. I just keep justifying killing myself recently. My sister wouldnâ€™t have to keep making sure Iâ€™m working and my mom would be less stressed out. I just donâ€™t know, if that makes sense. I know I should keep studying and trying hard but I keep getting distracted and I just donâ€™t know. Everything just sucks. Thanks for taking the time to read this far if you did.
