considering offing myself as of late.lately, i've just been really unhappy and i feel stuck. i always dread tomorrow, i can't sleep, and i can't tell anyone because then i'll just be inconveniencing them. if i tell my girlfriend, she'll just think she's not being a good s/o and i don't want to worry her with that. if i tell my parents or family, they'll see me differently and will possibly put me on a suicide watch (ironic). i practically have no friends to turn to, online or offline. my IRLs already dealt with a mutual friend wanting to off themself, i can't just do that to them again.
i'm not too sure if i will or not, but every passing day i'm only being more convinced to do it.
i have some ideas as to why i'm unhappy- mostly relationship issues, personal life issues, school, and other stresses are the cause. i don't know anymore. another day, another dread.
