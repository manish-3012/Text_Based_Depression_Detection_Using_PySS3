Iâ€™ve never felt such a strong urge to just do itI feel so fucking strange. My mind has been so burdened recently with so much sadness and anger that I feel almost numb now... I just have this lasting sense of frustration. I hate that my life has come to this. Literally just a few months ago I was still depressed, but I was able to tell myself to just keep trying at least until college. I have a year left, but idk if Iâ€™ll even make it anymore. The only things I have are my dog and my grades, and lately it has started to feel like Iâ€™ll lose both soon. My grades have slipped tremendously... I went from having never gotten below an A to now literally failing a class. My dogs getting old. I donâ€™t love my parents - my dad was verbally abusive and has anger issues. My mom is a narcissist and bipolar and has caused me to be deeply insecure. I probably say a maximum of five words to them everyday. My brother talks about killing himself all the time and I hear my dad laughing. I have nowhere to go. Thereâ€™s this quote in Infinite Jest, where he compares suicide to jumping from a burning building and that makes so much fucking sense to me right now. I donâ€™t WANT to jump but I see my life just fucking falling apart behind me and I know even though the fall will be scary, it wonâ€™t be as painful as trying to stay in the building as it burns down. Iâ€™m so scared and shocked that Iâ€™ve come to the point where my urge to die is strong enough that I feel like I could go through with killing myself.
