Seeing my ex and my former best friend together tears me apartWe dated for just over a year. And that's not very long, I get it. But, she was there for me when my grandmother died and we were very close. I honestly say, I loved her. But, a series of complications later we end up breaking up and not on good terms. I find out that her and my "best friend" at the time, start hanging out. And they deny it, completely. Which is bullshit considering I caught them many times (we go to the same university for example). Now, the fact that they're together, I cannot honestly stand it. If she was with anybody else, it wouldn't matter as much. But, since it's him, it hurts so much. I found this out over a year ago and it's honestly destroying me inside still to this day. I saw them today and it raised my anxiety level through the roof, and made me feel worthless/not good enough. People say I'm a good person and that I will be successful (I've always held a job, and I'm graduating with a degree and going into Nursing) and I would like to believe them, but when I see this, it crumbles that entire layer of support to nothing. It really makes me want to die. I just can't take it anymore.
