Tried to...So about 2 weeks ago I tried to hang myself. Cops ended up coming before I could finish and took me to the hospital ,  I was begging and crying for them to not take me. They actually hurt me pretty badly as Iâ€™ve got bruises all over my body STILL.

I never wanted to do it at home because I didnâ€™t want my mum to find me so I felt extra bad she had to come home to find the noose on the floor. A lot of this had to do with bullying and a relationship that severely messed with my head . 

But ever since this happened. I havenâ€™t been the same I feel really weird and disconnected . And I find it nearly impossible to cry.  Itâ€™s like the sadness became so deep I canâ€™t feel
Anything.

But I still act like everything is fine.
People ask what happened and I just laugh and brush it off . I even lied to a friend about it  when he asked what happened. 

I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore... thatâ€™s all I kept saying to the doctors to the police and my mum....

I just donâ€™t belong here.
