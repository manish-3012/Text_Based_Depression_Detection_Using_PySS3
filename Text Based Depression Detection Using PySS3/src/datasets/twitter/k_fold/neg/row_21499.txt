I Fantasize about dyingFirst off, I want to apologize if this isn't the right place for a posit like this,
Secondly, I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for (if that makes sense). Whether it be advice, help or just someone to talk to..

Now onto my post. I've gone on with telling myself Im not depressed, I guess it's denial. But still, I'm a moderately happy guy... At least I thought I was. Anyway I'm rambling again.

It comes in "waves" some days I'm fine and I don't think about anything. But each time I think of dying/ killing myself the temptations become stronger. I fantasize about jumping off of a bridge, just shooting myself, cutting myself, pills, drowning... Anything really. Sometimes I just really want to die and it scares me. I know most people would probably tell me to physically tell talk to people about my problems. But if I were to do so, I'm also scared of being judged because of it, if that makes sense.

Again, sorry if this doesn't belong here. Feel free to delete this post if necessary, I just need to rant..
