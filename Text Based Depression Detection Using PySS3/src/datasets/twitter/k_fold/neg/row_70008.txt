I feel like a shit personBack in February, I was in a hypomanic state. I cheated. I've deeply regretted it ever since. My huaband and I have been trying to work through it. I've been getting help and trying out meds, trting to get stable, even before the hypomanic state. Oh and I was just diagnosed with bipolar right before I messed up. Ever since, I've been having nightmares and flashbacks. Sometimes, I'm so messed up by the nightmares and flashbacks, that I feel physically sick and cannot bear my husband touching me. My therapist told me on Monday that I'm suffering from trauma (my hypomanic affair). She said if its affecting my life, I might want to talk to the doctor about something called prazosin. Its a drug for ptsd.

It is affecting my life. I can't have sex with my husband. He's getting real upset and hurt over it, taking it personally. He just got done flipping out on me. I told him I would take the drug if he wanted me to. His response was "Oh yeah go in there and say 'are there any pills that will make me want to touch my husband again?'" And he doesn't seem to want to go to couples therapy about it. He did say what the hell can anyone do about it? He's taking it personally and doesn't think anything will change. I wish he had more faith, though I can't blame him for feeling like this. God, I feel like just disappearing. I feel like such shit so often, and I can't stand hurting him anymore...
