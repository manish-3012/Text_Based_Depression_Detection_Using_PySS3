Looking for the right wordsI just don't really know where to go from here.  Never been in a relationship, my entire sexual history is composed of one time when a female friend sexually assaulted me (it wasn't outright rape, but I'd definitely say it was on the level of assault), took a lot longer to be out on my own than I wanted, and when it happened, I thought it would open things up for me in terms of socializing, but it's just not happening.  

I keep thinking more and more about how suicide isn't a possibility but an inevetability.  A co-worker asked me out about a month ago, and when I showed interest, she said it was to show someone else that she's not afraid to ask a guy out, and said she didn't mean it.  For the longest time I felt like an absolute loser, and I kept thinking "if you can just get out there on your own, you'll be good.  You can have people over.  You can start a relationship."  I try to hang out with co-workers that I get along with, but the plans always fall apart on their side, and they're always good to hang out with each other.  

For anyone else out there that knows The Simpsons: it feels like that episode where Bart sells his soul via a piece of paper, and he has the dream where everyone else in school buddies up with their own souls, but he's left alone.  I feel like it took too long for me to get my life going and be on my own, and now that I have, everyone else has their group of friends and their SOs, and I'm left as the odd man out.

Any time I find myself in a good mood, I always know it's because I'm distracting myself from the bigger picture, and when I'm depressed or suicidal, it's because I'm taking everything into consideration.

The only thing that keeps me going is knowing that it would destroy my parents, and my best friend.  My friend listens when I talk about my problems, but I keep it toned down, because I don't feel like I have the right to put this much of a burden on him.  I still see him about once every two weeks, and I used to hang out with him and his wife almost weekly, but I've only seen her socially once since the beginning of the year.  It feels like I still have my brother, but my sister turned her back on me, and I don't know why.

I don't really have a plan in putting this all out there.  I've tried slowly opening up to people that don't seem to care or pick up on any signs, so I figured this was a way to at least rant.  It's been pretty emotional just writing this all down and debating whether or not to hit the post button.
