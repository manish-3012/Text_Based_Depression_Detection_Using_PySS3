Questions...Iâ€™m feeling quite convinced to â€œcatch the busâ€ or CTB as we used to call it in the sanctioned group. Would you care to discuss, do you have the urge to say goodbye to people? See them one last time? Iâ€™m on the fence, but when I call people I havenâ€™t talked to in a long while, we have great conversations, then Iâ€™m all alone and suicidal again. I wake up and go to sleep with SI. I found *Channeling Erik* on youtube, fascinating stuff, but I hate his mom, sheâ€™s a biatch. 

His story makes crossing over so much less frightening. I have nothing but more dread and suffering ahead of me, not one speck of evidence it will get better. Trust me when I say, in the past 3 years since my last/only attempt, not a damn good thing has happened. Sure, I got to be a wageslave for a while, hated what I did but liked having a few $$$ in my pocket, now unemployed again, savings gone, and this pattern I keep repeating, i just want to end this nonsense. 

When I read the risk factors vs. resources, I always come up 10-0. I thought therapy would help, but as soon as it ended, I was doomed again. Everything ahead of me is pure shit, just canâ€™t see the point of drudging on.
