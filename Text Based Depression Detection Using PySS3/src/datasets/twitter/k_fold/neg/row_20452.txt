I don't think my life is worth itSo, i have a fear of going outdoors. It started 2 years ago when me and my family moved away from my home town. I get really paranoid and i haven't really gone out much since then (like in the car and stuff). I am scared to meet new people and getting help has been hard. I'm getting tutoring so i don't miss out on school. It's just so much and i don't think i can handle it anymore. I used to self harm and i attempted suicide 3 years ago, and i thought i was doing fine the way i lived, i didn't mind it, but now i just want help but i'm so scared. I just don't know what to do.
