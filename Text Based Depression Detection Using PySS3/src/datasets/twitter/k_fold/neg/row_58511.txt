Literally nothingI have absolutely nobody to talk to. Nobody in my life gives a shit about me. i have been told by family to kill myself before an my sister has even said she probably wouldnt feel anything if i died. I have such severe social anxiety that I can't hold even the most basic conversations with people. I never graduated 9th grade (I'm 20) i work at fucking mcdonalds, there's nothing I enjoy doing and I've never heard of anyone *ever* being helped by therapy and medication. there is nothing for me.
