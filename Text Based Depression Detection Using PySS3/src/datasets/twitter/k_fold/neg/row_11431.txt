Iâ€™m ready to dieI have been feeling shit for a long time and these days itâ€™s just been hitting me longer and harder.
I guess I used to think that someone would care but I just cut off everyone I thought did and even then they didnâ€™t care so I guess I was wrong.
I used to be scared but now I just feel more relief and excited at the thought of ending it. I left my friends group chat I guess as a last cry for help but I guess it was the final thing I needed to confirm it,
I think Iâ€™m ready to die. 
Thanks for reading. I just wanted to vent.
