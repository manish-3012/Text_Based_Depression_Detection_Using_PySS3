23 years old, diagnosed last week with stage IV braincancer, 2 months to live..topsLast week I experienced a black out, and woke up at gasstation with an employee hanging over me asking me if I was alright. I remember sitting behind the PC at 10 am, then it was black, then I was at the gasstation at 8pm. I have no recollection of what happened in between. The employee called an ambulance and they picked me up and I was on my way to the hospital. When I got into the hospital I also noticed that I had double vision ever since I woke up, and a huge headache. A CT revealed a tumor in my head the size of a wallnut, and an MRI confirmed it. Pretty fuckin shocked, and I asked what was next. They'd have to run some tests. I just got the results, and the latest MRI shows that the tumor has grown even more at such a rate that I'll be dead by August. It's also spreading through my lymph system, as metastases have been popping up in my liver, colon, and pancreas. There's nothing they can do. I've had headaches before but never thought much of it, and now it's too late. I've been going to college like nothing's wrong, but I don't want to end up like a fucking vegetable, drooling all the fucking place while a nurse has to wipe my ass every time I shit in my bed again. I want to finish it my way. I have no relatives who I'd be leaving behind or anything, and my friends will get over it. I'd rather have them remember me as I'm now then as a drooling meatbag in a hospital bed. I can't think of a single reason not to end it all before I can't even lift my fucking hand anymore. My double vision has been getting worse, the headaches keep me up at night, and I can just feel this fuckin disease spreading through me. I'm pretty shocked at how easy I've accepted it, but then again, I don't have much of a choice. I've only got 1 choice left. Anyone else know anyone who was in a similar situation, and how did they handle it...
