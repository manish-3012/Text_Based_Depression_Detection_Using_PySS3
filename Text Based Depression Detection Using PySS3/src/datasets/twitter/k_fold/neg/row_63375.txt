I donâ€™t know what else to doIâ€™m a 26 year old man whoâ€™s running out of hope fast. Iâ€™ve done nothing productive with my life and I have no but myself to blame for it. Here it goes
1. Iâ€™ve been addicted to porn for years now and no matter how hard I try, I canâ€™t escape it. 
2. I never took care of myself growing up and Iâ€™m paying the price, Iâ€™m overweight, I have a couple broken teeth so I canâ€™t smile. Iâ€™m hideous 
3. I have Aspergerâ€™s, Iâ€™ve always had trouble talking to people and making friends and because of that I really donâ€™t have anyone. 
4. Iâ€™m still trying to finish college, but even thatâ€™s becoming more and more challenging and on top of that I still have no idea what the hell I want to do after I graduate. 
5. This is the worst and most painful. Ever since I was a child, Iâ€™ve wanted to be a girl...I have never felt right in this body. I canâ€™t talk to anyone about this. I come from a conservative Christian household. The one time I tried to talk to my Dad about it his one sentence response was â€œ Son, you have a penis. Deal with it.â€ Iâ€™ve kept it hidden since then. Iâ€™m a Christian too. I know I shouldnâ€™t feel this way and Iâ€™ve spent many nights praying for it to be taken away. But itâ€™s at the point now where every day is painful. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m capable of taking my life. Iâ€™m too much of a coward and I donâ€™t want to put my family through that. But I donâ€™t know what else to do. Every day is a long struggle and Iâ€™m tired of fighting and losing on so many fronts.
