Another night aloneI honestly just want to kill myself. I'm sick of waking up everyday. People say that gets better, well it doesn't because it goes back to being hurtful. It hurts really bad with memories not being groomed when I was a child and I honestly want to kill myself. Everyone will notice, okay soooo what's your point? I'm doing myself a favor. I can't even get hugs or cuddles because I'm so far away and ladies I meet can be real jerkbags. I am currently in the room right now where I got sexually exploited and I just want t9 end it all, I don't care anymore. Why do I always have to b hurt over and over no matter how hard I try? I just don't get it! It'll just be best if I got out of people's hair.
