Shoulda done itTwo weeks ago today I had it all planned out. I wrote my note, I told my best friend all the nice things I had to say about her, and I even tried to contact my ex boyfriend to tell him that he's not entirely responsible for my death. Around 1am  I had everything set up. I was gonna hang myself with a necktie in the closet (partial suspension hanging). So I put my neck through the loop and pushed down. I felt the spooking tighten around my neck and began to feel light headed and I began to pass out.


And then I just didn't do it. I couldn't tellyou why, but I reached up and undid the knot around my neck. all the psychiatrists I've seen (my parents found me and sent me to a hospital where I've been ever since) have told me that I didn't really want to die. But that's total bullshit. I've never wanted anything more than to die. Maybe it was the way my cat was meowing at me, or that I was scared of someone "saving" me, or maybe it was just my instincts.


Anyways, getting on tothe point of this, I've spent every day since regretting my choice of not going through with it. I've been miserable and have only thought of death since, and the longer I stay alive, the more I want not to be. I only made it harder to be alone so as to do the whole suicide thing, and now I have to write a new note (since the therapist yelled at me until I gave him mine to read). Truth is, nothing has changed between two weeks ago and now, except maybe reaffirming my choice to end everything. Anyway I guess I'm venting but whatever. Shit still sucks.
