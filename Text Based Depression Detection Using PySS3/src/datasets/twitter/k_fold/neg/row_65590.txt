Thoughts of suicide almost daily....So I'm a 32 year old who pretty much lost everything in my life over the past couple years.  I attempt suicide by slitting my wrists about a month and a half ago and more and more I think about how to finally end it all.  My mom found me in my bedroom and seeing her so hurt broke my heart but at the same time made me feel like the pos I think I am.  I have 3 kids who I don't see because my ex won't allow it and eVERYTIME they enter mind my next thought was how much I miss them which then makes me want to end it   I literally cry at night constantly and I really want to get help but I'm uninsured and unemployed.  I really feel like a burden to everyone and as much as I try I can't get out of my head. I know I'm a good person. I respect people and help out whenever I can but I still feel everyone would be better off without me. I'm not angry I'm just severely down.  I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense I just don't know how much more I can take of this and it's hard to keep putting up this front that nothing's wrong and there's no one I can talk to about this
