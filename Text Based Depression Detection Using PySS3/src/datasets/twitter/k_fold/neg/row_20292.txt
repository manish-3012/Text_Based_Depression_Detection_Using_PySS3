Iâ€™m done.Iâ€™m 25. I tried to kill myself 3 years ago and failed. Since then my life has been exactly the fucking same and I canâ€™t ever change it. No matter how hard I try. Now Iâ€™m 3 months behind on rent. I canâ€™t afford to pay for anything. I owe so much to my college and to my loans. My son will see me as a failure. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t trust me because I canâ€™t get sex off my mind. And my parents donâ€™t talk to me because Iâ€™m the black sheep. My ex left me for another woman when my son was 6 months old. My best friend stopped talking to me because she believes a rumor. My boss hates me because I have a mad memory. My house is always a fucking mess. 
If I actually went through with it all this stress would be gone. Iâ€™d be free.
