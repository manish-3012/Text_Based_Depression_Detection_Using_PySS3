I don't know if I can keep going onHey, I guess there are a lot is posts on here like this, but I just don't know if I can keep going on. I'm transgender, I hate myself so much. I can't keep going on like this. I can't look in the mirror without wanting to die, and every time I dress in clothes that make me feel even slightly more comfortable I get stared at like a fucking freak. I just want to be normal, but I can't and it will never get better. I might as well die.
