I want to attempt, but I want to survive.I want to go through it all. 

Being brought to the emergency room, getting fixed up, having a psych evaluation, being put on suicide watch, and maybe spend a few days in a psych facility where they watch my every move. 

I don't want my parents to know. I don't want really anyone to know. But I feel like it just needs to happen. I want it to happen and it doesn't make any sense to me. But somehow it does. 

I just hope I'm not alone in these feelings.
