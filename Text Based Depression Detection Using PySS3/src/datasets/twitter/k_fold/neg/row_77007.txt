I need my brain to shut offI'm going to kill myself. There has always been this part of me that wants to survive and push on. But I can't anymore. I know that nothing comes after death but that is what I want. Suicide is so illogical because I know I won't get to enjoy the relief it will bring. But I need it. I need it so badly. I just can't take it anymore. 

I hate Everyrhing about myself.
I hate the way I treat people 
I hate the way I think 
I hate that I still see your body, lying there on the sidewalk, sand from the beach digging into my knees as I pumped your chest and tried to best for you.
I hate that I still hear your death rattles aand hear the screaming of your poor friends.  Pounding the ground as they watched me fail. 
I hate that I still taste your blood. And that I hesitated when I tasted it. Did I kill you in that hesitation? 
I hate that she was taken by violence. That she was lying there alone and no one was there and no one could tell her how much she was appreciated and what she did for the world. And I never texted her back so my goodbye was at her wake. 
I hate to think of you, what's left of your body slumped over the steering wheel. Giving the hardened cops nightmares. In pieces. So young. Were you drunk? I don't care. You were so good. 
I hate that you were taken from your sisters and they hurt so much and they still don't realize you are gone. I can't be near them. It's painful 
I hate that you left your daughter. So soon after her mom was gone. And now she is alone. She has no light. You could've prevented this. You could still be here. 
Why did you leave her. Right before her junior year? You hanging from a tree. Her studying vocab. Tears coating the paper.
