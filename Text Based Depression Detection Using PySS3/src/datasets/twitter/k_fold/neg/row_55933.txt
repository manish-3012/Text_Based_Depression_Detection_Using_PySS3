LostThrough my own eyes darkness surrounds my heart and mind. For a long period of time I have experienced a lot of peoples pain and misfortune pushing aside my own thoughts and emotions. As time goes along I'm hit hard by what I leave in the closet and lock away. For me the pain is shown through the scars. 

More frequently I've been experiencing darker moments when I'm not able to see straight on my exact path throughout the next day, week, year. Iv been having issues with my girlfriend and its killing me inside because I'm so unsure what iv done to bring pain on myself. For a while now iv been under the assumption she is cheating and knowing this has made my mind fragile pushing me to self-harm like I use to. Iv talked with many and it's all the same thing "keep busy" or "try find something to keep your mind off it". Unknown to many in society the impact of depression is not ever really gone, it more sits at the back of your mind waiting. 

This is a weird post, my first really. I just am unsure what to do to try and remove my mind from cutting again. It showed throughout my schooling now it is starting to again through university. I've got a connection with my girlfriend in which is not the same and even after talking I still have the feeling she is cheating on me. I'm lost in my own head.
