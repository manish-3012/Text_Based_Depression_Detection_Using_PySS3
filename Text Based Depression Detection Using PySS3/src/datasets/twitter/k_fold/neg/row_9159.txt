im doneim going to feel bad about doing this to my family. but i dont want to wait until im old to do this. i do want people to feel sorry for me when i die, so i guess in that sense i really am just an attention whore. i am a failure, and i cant stand being a failure any longer. i mean nothing to anyone, except my family, so i am a selfish piece of shit for doing this. but at least now you dont have to waste money on me going to college just so i could continue to live a wasted life. im so lost. im so done. thank you to the few people who tried to talk to me. there was no point, because i am an empty person, but thank you for doing it anyways. i wasted my life. i wasted my life so much. i am absolutely isolated, and i cannot get out. i cant. im stuck. i cant be unstuck because im too weak to do anything for myself. i am selfish, and i am weak, and i am a failure. im so sorry. i cant live like this forever, and i want to die at an age when people will still think that there was hope for me, so that at least they wont know that i already died as a failure.
