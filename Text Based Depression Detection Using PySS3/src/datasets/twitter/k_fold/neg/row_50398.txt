26 excedrin pills isnt enough is it?I counted all the pills I have left. 26. I'm pretty sure that won't be enough. Maybe if I have the 2 mikes hards I have left in the fridge. And even then, I live 2 minutes away from railroad tracks..


Pretty sure I'm doing terribly in all my classes. Whats the point of living if I'm gonna be a college drop out? There's no point.


Idk if i can even withdraw from any classes at this point. A "serious or compelling" reason is required. Is being stressed to death and suicidal "serious and compelling" enough? I don't think so....


And all of my teachers are probably ashamed of me. Who the hell can't get through college? I'm pathetic. Even if I decide to live, everyone will hate me for trying to end it anyways.


I love my boyfriend though. He's the one thing getting me through all this. And I never want to do anything to hurt him. But I'm tired....I've been depressed and suicidal for literally a majority of my life. How can it ever get better? How's anything gonna ever et better? 


i dunno. im just sad and alone and i cant tell or talk to anyone about this. what should i do, i just need someone to tell me what i should do cause i dont know anymore please
