God I want to do itIt fucking hurts, I can barely breathe. I feel like someone is choking me. I donâ€™t belong here. I want to die already. The world would be a better place and Iâ€™m just a reminder of all of the pain Iâ€™ve inflicted on people. I loved my ex with all of my heart, I still do, but I hurt him so fucking badly. I canâ€™t stand myself anymore. I can barely get out of bed and I hate myself. I just want to leave. I canâ€™t get the strength to actually kill MySelf but I donâ€™t even know how I would do it. I want it to 100% fatal. No one cares and no one loves me. Iâ€™m just a painful memory to people
