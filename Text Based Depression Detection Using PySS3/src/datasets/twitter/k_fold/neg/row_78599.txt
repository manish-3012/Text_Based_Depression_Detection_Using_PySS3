I have no right to feel like this.My low periods have a routine just like my hyper happy periods, several steps that start with not sleeping, not going out then leads to not eating or bathing then ends in selfharm and suicidal thoughts. The transition can last anywhere between a week to a month, and I've not yet found a single way to stop the downward spiral once it's begun. 
I have no right to feel like this, as of a month ago my life has been perfect, infinitely better than the average persons life. I don't want to die, I just don't want to be me. I don't want to wake up in the morning, I don't want to do the day to day things that makes someone alive. Does that make sense?
I don't have depression. I bathed, fed and looked after my mother when I was seven due to her manic depression and I refuse to even entertain the idea that I am in anyway unfortunate enough to have anything remotely like that.
I just know that tomorrow...Whether it's tomorrow or the tomorrow after that or the tomorrow after that...It'll be my third serious attempt, I'm 18 now, a practical big girl yet I'm so weak, every time this happens I feel like a big fat failure. I don't want to spend the rest of my life having these periods. I'm not strong enough. I'm just a freak.
