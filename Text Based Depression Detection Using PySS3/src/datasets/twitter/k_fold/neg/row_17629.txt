I can't get out.I was diagnosed almost 10 years ago with a major depressive disorder. No matter what I try, I can't get rid of it. I probably have something else wrong with me like Bipolar disorder or some sort of Dissociative disorder. I don't know. Sometimes, I'll have sociopathic tendencies where I'll genuinely contemplate mutilating myself or others (mostly myself) in response to an event in life. I have periods where I'll be eating dinner happily but I'll look in the mirror and see I've gained even the smallest amount of weight and I'll contemplate grabbing a knife and cutting it out or disfiguring a part of myself like I used to as a reminder of my weight. I don't think I've gone 3 hours without thinking about ending it all in some way. Where I'm at, there's no facilities I can go to for any dedicated help. I'm afraid of breaking and hurting myself or someone else. A part of me wants to give up and take a shot in the dark, move somewhere else and wing it. Another part of me wants to flex and express the frustration and hatred I have with myself on the rest of the world. I hate who I am but I'm scared of who I could be. My mind constantly keeps going back to just doing myself in somewhere remote and quiet. It'd be the end but it's something that gives me reprieve to think about. I don't know what to do anymore or why I am the way I am. I'm not happy with my life. After about 12 years old, I don't think I ever was.
