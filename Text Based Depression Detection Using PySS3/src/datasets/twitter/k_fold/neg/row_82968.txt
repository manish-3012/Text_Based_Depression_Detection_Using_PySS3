How can I start loving myself again?Itâ€™s been 7 months since I attempted suicide.  Iâ€™ve been telling everyone how much better i feel now, but in reality Iâ€™ve been getting worse by the day.  I canâ€™t even tell you why Iâ€™m so depressed and hate myself.  I grew up in a loving household thatâ€™s financially stable, I have close friends.  For some reason Iâ€™m just fucked up in the head I guess, I canâ€™t even tell you the last time I genuinely smiled or laughed or even had a good time.  Iâ€™m getting really tired of putting up this front of fake happiness.  Just need some advice I guess
