My sister is in the hospital after attempting suicideMy sister called me after a suicide attempt by overdose and I called 911 because she was 20 minutes away and there was just no way for me to know she was safe until I got there, or even when I got there thereâ€™s no way I could have been sure she was going to be OK after the amount of pills she took. I know I did the right thing but I still feel like I betrayed her.  She didnâ€™t want to go to the hospital, she thought that she was fine and her attempt failed - she had taken them the night before and was still coherent and walking around just very sick and all she wanted to do was talk. But now sheâ€™s in the hospital I havenâ€™t been able to see her at all since the ambulance took her and because of covid they wouldnâ€™t let me into the Hospital - but I didnâ€™t know that the EMTs made it seem like I could see her once she got there.  I was panicking Iâ€™m not sure I even hugged her before she got in the ambulance I thought I was about to see her again.  I know the hospital is the last place she wants to be and even though I know she needs to be there right now and maybe I saved her life I just canâ€™t stop feeling like I betrayed her. Iâ€™m terrified that sheâ€™ll make another attempt in the future and she wonâ€™t call me or anyone because of this.

 Iâ€™ve been able to talk to her a few times on the phone but I donâ€™t even know what to say.
She hasnâ€™t said it but I think sheâ€™s mad at me, I donâ€™t even know if I should keep calling her at the hospital.  And she keeps apologizing to me when we talk for calling me and I donâ€™t know how to make her understand how thankful I am that she called me.  She doesnâ€™t seem to want to talk when I call but I donâ€™t know if I should keep calling anyways just so she knows Iâ€™m here for her.  I just donâ€™t know what to do, I feel so helpless.  When Iâ€™m not scared or just angry at the world for being such a shitty place that my sister doesnâ€™t want to be in it Iâ€™m just numb. But itâ€™s not about me, I just want to be there for my sister and I donâ€™t know how, and she never asks for help or what she needs.  Sheâ€™s the best person I know and I canâ€™t lose her and I donâ€™t want her to feel this way anymore.
