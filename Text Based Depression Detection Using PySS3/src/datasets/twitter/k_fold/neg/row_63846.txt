nightmares every time i fall asleepi was doing so much better until i started having these shitty fucking nightmares. they're always disgusting and gory and centered around things that shake me to my core. i don't know what to do. last night i just took a handful of benadryl so i was knocked out for a long while. i never have dreams when i take that but i have a higher tolerance again and i'm running out. i'm afraid to sleep. i want to just off myself to end it already. i'm miserable and anxious when i'm awake already. my life's a sick joke at this point. it wasn't enough for me to be wracked by paranoid intrusive thoughts about things from my past and my obsessive fears while i'm awake. nope. now i'm fucking miserable when i'm asleep too, and i'm exhausted all the time to boot. sorry if this isn't very coherent i've drank some tonight just to see if that helps me go to sleep before 10am today at very least. nothing's helping and i just want to end it so i don't have to see fucked up things in my dreams but hey at least i can temporarily scramble my brain enough to get maybe an hour nap in.
