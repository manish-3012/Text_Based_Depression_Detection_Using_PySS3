Life is a cruel jokeHaving to work everyday until Iâ€™m old sucks. Getting student loans fucking suck. Seeing everyone happy on social media makes me feel awful. Seeing people that look better than me or looking in a mirror sucks. Not having friends sucks. Not having a normal family sucks. Then this virus shit happened. Life just seems like a joke.
