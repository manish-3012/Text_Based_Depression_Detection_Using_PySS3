Why bother any more.Obvious throwaway here. Long post inc..

Been struggling with depression as of late, and last December I tried to kill myself whilst at work. Honestly just want to rant.. since I can't really tell anyone else in my life about it.. 
(I told a girl I like, who went through severe depression too, but had to stop being so negative and depressing halfway through, as I do like her, and I don't want of her to think of me as a gloomy person all the time..)

I'm unhappy with almost everything in my life.
I hate my job.
I hate my weight.
I hate my ugliness.
I hate what is expected of me all the time.
And worst of all, I hate that I can't do a damn thing about it.

Don't get me wrong, my job is "good" in terms of pay.. but it's too exhausting. 12 hours a day, 6-7 days a week, with constant switching between days and night shifts. The money is great, but I don't need this much. I'd rather have the free time, but because of what my job is, and how my family is, especially my step-father, I can't ask for it. (I cover those who -are- off/sick)
280+ hours a month of work is too much.

I've lost the ability to go out with my -two- friends I have, because they're either at work at 7-10am/pm or wanting to unwind/sleeping.

4 days before x-mas, I tried to kill myself at work, and was taken off of work for 3 weeks, on a sick note for "low mood" 3 days a week max work. 

But, despite paying rent and having enough money to blow on useless shit I didn't need/still save some, I was 'asked' to take every shift I could by my step-father, who doesn't care that that I want a rest. He just wants me to do as much work as possible, regardless of anything. If it were legal to work 30 days a month, 12 hours+ he'd sign me up for it in a heartbeat. Despite him working 3 days a week. Alone. And spending it asleep/laptop/TV. He gets paid to do NOTHING at work.

Thing is, that was almost perfect for me back then for 2-3 months. I had enough hours (12 days a month, per sicknote), less stress, more free time and STILL had more than enough money.

I can't get out of this fucking job though. I was unemployed for 4 years before, living on Benefits, and no, I don't want to go back to that, I just can't "get" another job. My parent won't let me leave. If I were to leave the job, it'd be more than just me not earning money, it'd mean I'd get kicked out. I have no where else to go.

I also can't just "find a place to live if you have so much money :)". You know why? I already struggle to get an hour free time most nights, and that's without me having to clean up an apartment, clean/dry my clothes every night (Uniform, only get 2 shirts, 1 trousers, 1 thick jumper), go out shopping for food ect.

It's the same with all these driving lessons I'm being "forced" into taking. It's costing me a fortune. I don't **need** a car, I don't **want** a car. I have a Motorbike which is cheap to get me to work and back easily. It's 125cc, meaning my 25 minute ride to work is easy enough on fuel. Costs me Â£30-40 a month. Why the fuck would I want a car, that only I would use, is going to cost me alot in fuel and insurance/initial costs, when I have a perfectly decent vehicle to get me to work? In the end, I just end up working more, so I can afford my car, so I can work some more. What's the fucking point?

But what I hate most of all is, that most people would kill for my job. It makes me sound entitled and spoiled beyond belief whenever I tell anyone (the 2 people I have..) about it.
"Oh you're making Â£2k a month, what have you got to complain about" ect.. I don't want Â£2k a month. I want my free time back. So I -can- change my life..

I have **zero** desire for kids, at all, ever. I mean, if I were ever getting any (20~y/o virgin here, unlikely to change hah) on a regular basis, I'd damn well make sure I was protected/vasectomy.

I am also really, really not interested in relationships like most men.

I've met one girl, a good friend (Known her a while, but reconnected recently to talk)that I actually liked in that way.
She's incredibly pretty, smart, caring and I know she has been through what I am now, hell I talked her out of suicide last year and best of all, she doesn't want kids or even marriage.. but she's not interested in me. I don't blame her for that. 
What stings is that I **can't** be with her. Ever. I'd of been happier knowing I had even a sliver of a chance. I'd be willing to learn, to change and to do almost anything reasonable if she were to ask, but she's already told me she's never going back into a "one on one" relationship any more. She's Polyamorus now (Multiple lovers, loves them all ect). I'm not looking to be "just one of many", even if that option came up. 

And no, there aren't "plenty more fish in the sea". She had alot of near-unique aspects I won't find in anyone else.

TL;DR Unhappy with overworked job, unable to get out. Don't want kids, ever = No chance for partner.

Thinking of killing myself. 

Sure, my mother + sister would be devastated, but no one else would care. I'm not close with either of them and it'd help them both a bunch if I weren't here, clogging up the house ect.

No one else's life would be impacted, at all. I'd just be a "oh that's a bit sad" news to anyone else who knows me.
