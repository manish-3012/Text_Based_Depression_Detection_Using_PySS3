Really need some helpHey, so I've been suicidal for a while and suffer from manic depression and things have been looking up recently, I got into college, I've been doing the work good... ect but then my debit card got stolen and I cannot access any money in my bank, I have Â£30 in there, its all I have and no cash, my car is out of petrol and I need it for college, I got home and thought I'd email my teacher to explain the situation and boom I left my hard drive in college, I called them up and asked them about it and they checked the class, its gone, the cctv show a kid stealing it, there goes all my work, I don't have any backups, lesson learned I guess. I haven't eaten in 2 days because of no money to afford it, I've got around 20 miles of range left on my car, nothing left to sell, everything I have is keeping me sane, my doctor told me to get a loan but I can't I've tried. this is fucking terrifying and I can't stand it anymore I just need fucking $20 for gas and watching anything to take my mind off it infuriates me, my favorite youtubers have become the most annoying thing in the world, casey neistat bought a new macbook pro because he couldn't log into itunes and I mean I can't blame him, he has the money to do so but I;m here and just need a little helping hand like I can't stand it, I'm on the edge right now I can't survive like this anymore, can anyone please talk to me and help me the tiniest bit?
