The thought of suicide gets so much more appealing the more I think of my impossible futureI am 17 and an autistic female, I have nothing going for me other then being â€œlazyâ€ (called that by my asshole step dad who coincidentally also is on the spectrum). 

Online school has done nothing for me but fuelling my diagnoses ADHD. Itâ€™s fucking impossible for me to do anything to unfuck myself and my future. 

Iâ€™m tired of fighting the inevitable. I donâ€™t want to be a disappointment anymore, all I do that makes me happy Iâ€™m shit at and canâ€™t make a career about. I can barely interact with my own fucking family without feeling like an alien. I fucking hate myself and wish I was never born. Iâ€™m just a disappointment and a bastard child.
