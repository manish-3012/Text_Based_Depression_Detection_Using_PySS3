I dont think I'll ever stop wanting to kill myself.Even if I dont have the nerve to go through with it, it's always on my mind. Like a primal urge.

I heard a quote I dont think I'll ever forget.  I don't know where it came from.

Sometimes, what you know doesn't matter. What you feel takes over.

I know killing myself would be selfish.  It would ruin my family's lives.  I know life is supposed to get better.

I feel like I'm an inch away from doing something I'll regret.
