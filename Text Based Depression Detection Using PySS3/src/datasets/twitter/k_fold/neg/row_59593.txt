Iâ€™ve given up and I think everyone around me has to.Thereâ€™s nothing anyone can do to help me. Weâ€™ve tried everything. Doctors my parents me everyone. I donâ€™t think I can do this anymore. Itâ€™s physically impossible. Iâ€™ve ruined my life. I want to start a new one. Hopefully thatâ€™s what happens.
