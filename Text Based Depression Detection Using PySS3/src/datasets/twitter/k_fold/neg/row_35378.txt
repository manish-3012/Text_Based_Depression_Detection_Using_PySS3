I don't want to watch my kid grow upMy kid is beautiful. Lively and curious, innocent and imperfect in the most perfect way. I'm gonna fuck that up one way or another. Through drinking, drugs, transitioning, mental health, job loss, whatever. I've wanted to kill myself everyday since I was 10 years old and the "1 more day" mentality is draining. I don't want to think about being here anymore in my 30s, even with a beautiful kid. I had no right to create someone so beautiful. I'm a fucking trash coward.
