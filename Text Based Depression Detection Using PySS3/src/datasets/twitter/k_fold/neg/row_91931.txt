I need your help, fellow suicide watch users. Hi, I am wanting to start a podcast/YouTube channel where I will be speaking what's on my mind, kind of like a blog, I want to be able to help other people though, because I will be speaking about my depression, what's going on in my life I'd like other people to be able to speak with me, maybe to have a talk, show other people that they are not the only ones out there, maybe they can be on the podcast one day and speak too about any problems, just express your mind, now I obviously cannot do this on my own, like I say I will be talking by myself but I would like others to talk to as well may it be over Skype. 

This is something new to me, I got the idea thinking of different ways to express what's on my mind, maybe if someone could listen to me instead of having to read what I say it will be better, plus being able to speak to people will be better to in my opinion. 

I'm no therapist or counsellor, I'm just a "normal" person who wants to speak his mind and help others, so what do you think? Is this a good idea that some of you would be willing to partake in?
