I feel like I'm staring death in the faceI don't feel like I have a choice but to either die or live a painful life. There can be no success for me. I'm just not good enough to make friends with people and I never will  be. In life if you can't make friends than there is no hope. There is no hope. I'm not too stupid because I say I am. I just am. I cannot just let go and enjoy life like normal people. I never will be able to. I'm too weak. Everything effects me emotionally in a negative way. I can't do this. I was never meant to succeed. I just want it all to be over.
