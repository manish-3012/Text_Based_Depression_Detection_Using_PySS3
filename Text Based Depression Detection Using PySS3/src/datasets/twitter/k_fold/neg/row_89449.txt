I want to make it to ChristmasMy emotional health has gone with shit in the past two weeks. I don't understand why I feel the way I do and can't find any way out of it. Last night. I wrote the same word over and over again on a piece of paper and ended up sleeping on my buddy's couch again. My body wants one thing, my brain wants another, I feel anxious all the time; my heart pounds, my thoughts race, I just want it all to stop. I lost my relationship to all of this. I don't understand what's happening to me. I'm going in to the doc today to see if I can get some pills or something to make my head quiet. I don't want to be an addict but xanax seems to be the only thing that's working for me to quiet my mind and my body. But when I wake up, I know the feelings will come back. I'm not sure I want to die, persay, but I know that there's a general drum beat in my head that says that suicide is the answer to everything. I'm feeling bitter and angry and everyone and yet it's also interspersed with sadness. My ex and I had been planning on making a christmas card together. All of the happy shit that we were going to do, won't happen now. It's all my fault. I just feel so crazy, suicide watch. I don't know what to do.
