I'm a coward and a pussyThats what my parents said to me tonight. They aren't wrong, in fact I've felt that way about myself since I was very young. My therapist said that those thoughts are internal, that no one thinks I'm a loser or a coward. He's wrong though. I'm 23 years old, I graduated college last year, I can't find a full time job, I live with my parents, all I do is make other people's lives worse. I cried in public all my life, even into my twenties, embarrassing my parents and friends. I've given up so many things because they were too hard or I didn't want to do them; I could have been a self sufficient person if I followed through. I dishonor the memory of my grandparents because they fought through WWII and the depression and I've had everything handed to me. I'm fat, no one in my family has been fat, at least at my age. I have no determination, no self-control, no confidence. I'm not a really person, just a parasite. My parents are now yelling at each other in the other room; I've ruined their relationship too. I'm not even sure I want to die, but I do nothing but disrupt and destroy. I'm a net negative to those around me. I'll never measure up to my family or their expectations, and I know I'll never deserve what's been given to me.
