Re: I'm losing my mindThis was supposed to be in response to a post that was *just* deleted. I think it was freshly posted and hadn't received any responses (the post and the user seem to have been deleted while I was in the middle of typing a response). Anyhow, if the original poster is still on reddit reading (I hope so), here was my quick response:

You're not alone. These just aren't "peak" hours right now and most people are probably asleep by now (It's 5 a.m. here in California right now).

I'm not the best person to offer advice since I'm quite lost in my own depressed state. My situation isn't exactly the same as yours (I guess nobody really has the same exact situation...) but I, too, struggle with who I am. I feel like I've become my own enemy, and people say you can't let your depression define you, but I'm struggling to see where the line should be drawn...

Anyhow...sorry I can't offer any better words of encouragement. I just wanted to say that you're not alone.
