Life's a BitchSince more than 5 years ago, my life has been quite interesting as many people say. Traveling a lot, working at many places, meeting a lot of people, but I still feel that hole in my chest, that feeling that I'm not good enough in anything, and I just want to quit living.   


I, personally don't even like the path I'm walking, and now I don't even know what I'm doing.

Recently moved to Canary Islands, because I met a girl from here, and now I only have two options left, as my visa will expire next week.  


1. Go back to my country, a country almost everyone wants to leave. 
2. Stay in Canary Islands, for two and a half year (illegally) until I get my green card. Working in a Chinese Restaurant in which I can't have a day off, and I'm receiving minimum wage. 
3. &amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty sure I won't be happy in any of those places, but just gotta keep going because of "the loved ones" and all that bullshit.
