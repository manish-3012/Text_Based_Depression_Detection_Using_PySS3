Threatening suicide for attentionI donâ€™t want to kill myself. I have no plan or intention, but every minute of goddamn day, my brain will not shut up about it. Useless, stupid, fat, ugly, pathetic, unlovable, unwanted, life has always been bad and it always will be bad so you might as well kill yourself now, I try not to listen but it wonâ€™t stop. Itâ€™s a grade school bully that follows me home and wakes me up constantly throughout the night just to remind me.
Iâ€™ve told a few friends and my mother and posted on tumblr about being suicidal but I think they think Iâ€™m just saying it for attention. Thing is.. I think theyâ€™re right. I do need attention. Immediately. I need help.
Because even if I donâ€™t want to kill myself, even if I have no plan to, Iâ€™m really really scared Iâ€™ll reach that point soon if I donâ€™t have someone see the pain Iâ€™m in and at least try to help. Even if thereâ€™s nothing they can do, just making an effort would be enough, if just for a little while.
Instead, I got a series of excuses. Everything from, â€œIâ€™m too tiredâ€ to â€œanimal crossing just came outâ€. A video game is worth more than my life. My best friend couldnâ€™t come over and sit with me yesterday because she only had three entire weeks to pack up ONE ROOM to move, and me being a dumbass that feeds off of crumbs of intimacy off the floor, I STILL went over to help her pack today.
Every self-help pamphlet and website says to reach out when youâ€™re suffering and I did and it only made things worse. All it does it prove my brain right.
