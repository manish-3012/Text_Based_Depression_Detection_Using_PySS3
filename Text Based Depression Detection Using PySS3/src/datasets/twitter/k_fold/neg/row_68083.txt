My life sucksSince I was a child I was humiliated, emotionaly and psychologicaly abused and tormented.
My life since early days felt like prison combined with boot camp.
In schools I had 'buddies' in school but not real friends, was bullied also, never had a girlfriend, I didn't even speak to girls.
When I was 20 I tried to commit suicide but it was not successfull as the dosage was too low.
I was mugged and robbed about 10 times in my life, which only raised my anxiety and me being untrustfull in people.
Now I have crippling depression and anxiety, I cannot speak normaly with other people and make friends, the last time I went out to someone and speak with someone as a 'buddy' was 7 years ago.
Currently I'm 30 and still never had a girlfriend, and my longing for romantic relationship is killing me.
I'm living with my strict parents that control every aspect of my life, they have to know everything and about everything, when I was younger they did not allow me to go anywhere and usualy I had to be at home by 7 or 8pm.
That is why i'm not even trying to speak to women, because I know I would have to find a way around my parents or lie to them.
I have a job, so potentialy I could move out, renting something as I don't have money for a house, but in some way I still want to be with them even though i'm 30 now and basicaly i'm forfeiting my life.
