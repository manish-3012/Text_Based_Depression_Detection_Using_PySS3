I really need a reason not toIâ€™m a 19M studying Electrical Engineering at a community college and I have had suicidal thoughts for awhile now. I even tried it once after I got a really low score on my SAT in high school. I feel like nothing has changed since then. No matter what I have done I donâ€™t feel better. I was able to get my associates degree at 18 but that didnâ€™t matter because I had to stay at the community college because I didnâ€™t have all my prerequisites done. Lost about 49 pounds and I still feel fat (I was 6â€™0 240lbs) before. Iâ€™m not super quite or loud either and since Iâ€™m at a community college where pretty much no one in my class talks to each other I donâ€™t really have that many friends. The ones I do have are off at university making friends and having fun on their own. I would be okay with this if school was going better for me but itâ€™s not. Iâ€™m on the verge of failing my circuits  class and yet again everyone else like my friends seem to just be having a ball in school. I have made posts like this before desperately trying to find a solution to this but just canâ€™t. Why am I not deserving to be happy? What have I done to deserve feeing this way everyday. I hate myself through and though and Iâ€™m tired of it now. I woke up this morning thinking about just figuring out some way to end this suffering. And the worst part is Iâ€™m not poor or suffering from any physical ailments so maybe Iâ€™m just really ungrateful and weak. I tried to tell my family my thoughts before and my dad just got mad and said Iâ€™m going to hell if I do so I donâ€™t even want to talk about it anymore. The amount of money I would give too be someone else.
