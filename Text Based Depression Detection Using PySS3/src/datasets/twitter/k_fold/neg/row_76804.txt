Don't know why I'm really even posting but I just hurt so muchI know venting helps but I tend to go unnoticed.  Things have been so hard and I've tried for so long.  I feel worthless.  My family dynamics are awful.  I have 2 half-friends, they never reach out to me or try to include me in anything.  Acquaintances I've known for years is more accurate.  I let myself get scammed and lost my savings...  I have a master's degree and still can't find a job.  I have tinnitus thanks to antidepressants and now my depression is even worse and I have permanent incurable disfunction I wouldn't wish on anyone.  The way my dad modeled relationships with my mom, I just get taken advantage of and abused.  I'm so lonely and I can't blame anyone not wanting anything to do with me since I'm such a mess.  Since middle school I had imagined killing myself after my parents pass.  But I never anticipated things getting so bad and they don't seem to care.  No job, no insurance, can't afford to see my therapist.  Seeing the news just emphasizes how cruel, evil, and stupid people can be.  I just want it to be over.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
