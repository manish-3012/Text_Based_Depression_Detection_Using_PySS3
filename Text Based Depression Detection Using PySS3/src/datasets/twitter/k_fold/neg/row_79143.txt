I hate my lifeI want to die. I'm so depressed. I feel like a failure, even though on paper I'm not. I have a good job in my field. I have a fiance. I'm getting married next summer. But I feel like im drowning. I have no hobbies. No real, close friends. And no easy way to make them. O feel like noone actually cares about me. I feel like im only in peoples lifes because of what I give to them, but never for me or who I am. Even my mom only calls me when she needs something from me. I think my fiance loves me but it's all about him. He never thinks of my needs or puts mefirst, litterally ever. Last night I was having a break down crying my eyes out and telling him how overwhelmed and sad I was and that I hated my life. He told me this is ridiculous and I was being dramatic, and ignored me while I sobbed for a half hour. He didnt care until I later pointed out that when hes upset I talk to him, help him, and try to understand/make him feel better. But it feels like hes only trying now bc me pointing that out makes him feel bad about himself and being nice to me makes him feel better. I feel catatonic about my job. It's good, it's in my field, and my dream job and I litterally just dont do it. I scroll through Facebook all day and accomplish nothing. I hate it. I dont care about it anymore. I just want to die so everything will stop hurting but I feel pathetic because I'm too scared to even do that. Everytime I drive somewhere I hope someone will hit me and kill me. I feel so alone and I dont know what to do. I also feel like a fucking loser cuz I'm sitting in my work bathroom crying as I write this hoping noone notices. I just don't know what to do. Strangers always say "im here" "I care about you life dont kill yourself" but all I can think is you dont though. Not really. I'm just a passing thought, that noone really cares about in the end.
