can someone just convince me not to commit suicidei tried to yesterday. chickened out, almost made it all the way before i stopped. 
but, next time i know it'll be different. 
i'm horribly depressed. i have been for many years. since july it's gotten out of control. to the point where i plan out my suicide daily. write my suicide notes daily as well.
everyone has left me. all my friends, including my best friend of five years. without any warning. just stopped talking to me. my boyfriend left me. said it was all my fault and that he didn't care about me and that i was nothing to him. 
i started college now and it's just gotten worse. i'm in debt, i can make no friends there, and these days i don't even go to class. then i hear the disappointment from everyone around me.
i sit in bed all day. i do nothing. i've lost 30lbs give or take, i don't sleep (currently haven't slept in over 24 hours), and i don't even take joy in the things i once loved.
on monday, i was at therapy when my therapist laughed at me while i was telling my feelings. the same day someone was threatening me with blackmail and said he'll ruin my life if i don't let him rape me. and when i tried to reach out to multiple people they all gave some response on the lines of "i don't care."
i guess this is my last attempt. my last cry for help.
