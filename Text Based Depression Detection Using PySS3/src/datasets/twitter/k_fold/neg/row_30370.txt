I've delayed it for two years. I think it's time.I've been depressed for the past few years and have seen multiple therapists to no avail. My new therapist is a psychology student and is graduating with her PhD in a few weeks and will be gone forever. I feel like I've never connected more with a person and she's leaving. She's been the reason I've stopped myself so often. The past few days I've been oddly optimistic and happy and I thought I was getting better but I guess not.


Tonight was so terrible. I'm going to fail my class and fail out of college and lose everything. I'm a failure and a disgrace. There's no point in living. I just texted my dad and told him I love him. I don't know how I'm going to do it but I know that I can't go on like this.
