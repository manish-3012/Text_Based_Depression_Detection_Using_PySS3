Why do people only pretend to give a shit about you after you're gone?I genuinely have it a try once, and only then did people wanna tell me how much they care about me, and how talented I am, and how bright my future is gonna be...

All bullshit.

People only pretend to care so they don't have to feel guilty. They'd rather you suffer through the pain of not being able to live than to let you go and feel the burden.

I wish I was worth more than a glance, but I'm not.

I wish someone genuinely cares about me, but they don't.

People. Only. Pretend. To. Care.
