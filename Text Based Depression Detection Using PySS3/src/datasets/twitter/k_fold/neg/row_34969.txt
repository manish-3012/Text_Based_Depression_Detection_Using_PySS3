I can't do anything, I want it to stop. Please help me.I sat on the window ledge of my 22nd floor apartment today, I really want to jump. I couldn't bring myself to cry. I feel unsafe living here. I can't feel anything, I've begun to sit around all day. I smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes, I just mindlessly stare at my computer. Not even browsing, just sitting there smoking. I've stopped eating, I've stopped sleeping, and the only thing I think about is jumping out the window. I've begun to isolate my friends and I have no family where I am living. I just need someone to talk to. Please.
