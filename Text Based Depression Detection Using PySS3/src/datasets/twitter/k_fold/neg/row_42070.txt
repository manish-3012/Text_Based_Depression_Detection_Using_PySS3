Fmltoday you are back with these thoughts.  today they hit me hard.  I see myself standing in front of the mirror and cut my face with a knife ... I hate myself ... I will never know what it is like to be loved ... I am not something to be loved ... I am  a monster and way too fucked up to be loved ... fml .... the medication will calm me down soon, sleeping pills and sedatives will help
