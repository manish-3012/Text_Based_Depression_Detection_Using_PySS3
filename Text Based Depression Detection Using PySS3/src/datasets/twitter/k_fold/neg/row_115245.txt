basically anyone who I think would get what I'm going through *drunk post*there are times when I want to share my suicidal thoughts with my bestfriend. (this bestfriend of mine is suicidal, too)

there are also times when I want to go share it with an acquaintance or a stranger online

or post it on websites like this as anon


.....then it hits me that everyone's just too far away from me.
I can't talk to anyone who's actually near me. who's up for a random night just to talk about these fkkd up thoughts bcos that only happens in movies ha ha ha 

I want to talk to someone while I comfort that person... while we share the shitty things we're going through.

Idk but sometimes I forget about killing myself when I get to help someone.
