Got fired. It just feels so hopeless. And I'm tired.I got fired from my job yesterday. It was the longest job I've ever held at a whopping....8 months. I'm in my late 20s and graduated college. It was my fault though. Boss was upset about me spending too much time on the internet for non-work reasons. While I felt like there was some poor communication from my boss, and there were some unfair expectations of me outside of that (my situation was pretty complicated outside of the internet thing), it is ultimately my fault. I've told a few people I got let go but no one knows the real reason because it's so embarrassing. I told them something vague that's technically not a lie. It just feels like I can't do anything right. I just keep messing up again and again and again. I've never moved out of my parents place and I'm just a waste of resources. I feel like I'm not allowed to breathe air, and I'm not deserving of existing. It really feels like the world would've been a slightly better place if I was never born. I've accomplished nothing of value, and if I do continue on, I think my parents are just going to die and then I'll become homeless and die on the streets. I've been nothing but a burden to other people. I've tried not to be. I've been trying again and again and again and again. And each and every time has been a failure. I'm just so tired. I've been fantasizing about getting hit by a drunk truck driver. I really just wish to be gone.
