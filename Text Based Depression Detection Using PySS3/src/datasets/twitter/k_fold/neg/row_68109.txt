I feel like I'll never be able to move on from my abuseI know I know, I probably sound like some dramatic baby who is indulged in self victimizing.

But I just cant seem to control how I feel, because it feels like everything in life has conditioned me to see this pattern. That to ignore it will always just bring more pain

It feels like in my past has told me: this is a red flag. Avoid it and avoid hurt.

But sometimes those red flags are actually not really bad signs, and it's just me overcompensating my fear by shutting it down early.

It just feels like all the times my parents break my heart, and every time I've forgiven, has just led me to believe that people will always take advantage. That I will always feel like an inconvenience, an annoyance, someone who doesn't deserve to exist or be treated with respect.

I find that whenever someone shows me a small action of respect, I feel indebted to them because I feel like it's something I don't deserve.

And maybe I am being dramatic. I don't know. Every day i look at my arms, I will forever see the scars for all the times my parents hurt me.
