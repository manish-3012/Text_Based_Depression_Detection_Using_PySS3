Considering suicideI just feel like I have no reason to live. I keep it bottled up from friends and family. Hell, this is a throwaway account so it wont impact my regular one. I just feel like if I blow my brains out, it won't make a difference. I'll die anyways, what would change? The pressure of all this goddamn work is seriously making me think. I'm extremely depressed and writing this quickly so no one sees. I'm going to bed after writing this. Somtimes I hope I dont wake up.
