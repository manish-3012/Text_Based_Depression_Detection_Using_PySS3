Iâ€™m going to do itIâ€™m gonna end it. I seriously just canâ€™t do this anymore. I hate feeling so disgustingly ugly all day, people rate me 3s and 4s which is low so I know that I do look ugly. Yeah looks arenâ€™t everything but I donâ€™t see the point in living only to feel sad about my appearance. This is my last post on Reddit because Iâ€™m not gonna be around for much longer. Donâ€™t bother commenting cos Iâ€™ll probably already be gone but i hope everyone else is ok
