Why should I be alive? Itâ€™s all so hardMy fiancÃ© and I recently had to break off our engagement. Weâ€™re still trying to be friends but it hurts me when I canâ€™t talk to her. I feel like I ruined everything in our relationship, I didnâ€™t give her enough love or support.. 
I feel as though my friends donâ€™t love me. 
I wish everything would fade into black. 
The only thing keeping me in this world is the fact that I know my mom would be distraught if I left. 
I really donâ€™t think anyone else would care. 
I just want it all to end.
