I want to embrace nothingnessJust let me go already.

Why can't you let me go.

Why can't I let myself go.

Why do I stay here and be tortured every second of my existence.

Why can't you let me go, me.

Just let me embrace it.

The nothingness.

I lust for it.

I feel like im going insane at your expense.

I'm fucking splitting myself in twain.

I cant even think without second thoughts or thinking about myself.

I just want to stop.

Just dissappear.

Let me die in peace.

Help me.
