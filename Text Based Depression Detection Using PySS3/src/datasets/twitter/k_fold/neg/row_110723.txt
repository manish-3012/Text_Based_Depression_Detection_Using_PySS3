Me [32/ f] with my ex[32 M] decade later still ruining my lifeI got drunk and let rip on all of the emotionally abusive BS he pulled.


in a few hours he will either have blocked me or ignored me. I do not even care which. I just want people past and present to respect me, my choices and my body. I may be in a pit of anxiety and depression right now, and wine,,,, support is needed.... I had his abortion.

I tried to say we needed to talk about it all but he wasnt interested. Now his GF is accidentally pregnant ad he sees it as a project and wants a clone of him! (m/32)
Things have come to a head and I have messaged him all of this. I doubt I willl get a reply and I am on my own. 

tl;dr: had exs abortion he did not want to know a decade later still a wreck
