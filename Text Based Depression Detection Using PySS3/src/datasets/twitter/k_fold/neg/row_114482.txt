I just want to dieIm 19 years old and i want to die, every day i think about death and how i want to end it all. I grew up in a abusive home surrounded by drunks, never had money, everyday of my life has been a struggle. Life did get better for a while when i met a girl with who i fell in love with, but nothing ever lasts and life always tends to go to shit for me. I was a salesman for a while and i quit my job to join the army, it has been my dream for a long time, but as soon as i quit my job, i broke my shoulder, then after that my girl left me, and then i broke my other hand and now i have no job, im going to lose my apartment, all my friends just started to exclude me from everything suddenly and now i have nothing and no one, now im in the hospital , about to go in to surgery in an hour and not a single person has asked me if im ok. And all this shit just happened this month. Before all this happened, I was still struggling with depression and i tried to get help, but everytime i tried to talk about it, with my friends or my ex, no one ever listened and no one ever cared, but I was always there when ever they needed help with anything, people are just fake and it seems like no one ever cares about other people, they just care about them self
