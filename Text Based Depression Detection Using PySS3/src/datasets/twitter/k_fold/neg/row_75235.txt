Fuck.Ya boys got tests coming up. But the LC (Irelands equivalent of the final exams that determine if u get to college or not, think S.A.T's, GCSE's that shit) the thought just terrifies me. 

Like I've done many tests through the semester. Done well enough in all of em. But fuck I'm scared of my Christmas tests. I really dont want this. I just want to study. Like I actually give a damn but every instance the thought crosses my mind. Fuck me. I'm scared. I have a week. I wanna use this to catch up on all the notes I'm missing and get a start on the subjects. I don't wanna waste this time. I've done that before and I don't want to repeat that.

I'm scared. I just wanna run away to a corner and hide. Just hide in between seconds so no one can find. Just there one second and gone the next. Just vanish and comeback when I feel like it. I wanna die so this feeling will end. I can't even fucking cry anymore. The tears are there. They just never come out. Fuck.
