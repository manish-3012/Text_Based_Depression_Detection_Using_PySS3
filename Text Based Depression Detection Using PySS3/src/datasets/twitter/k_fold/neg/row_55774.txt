I want to get away from all of this.I just recently got surgery to remove my lymph nodes and my left testicle. I'm cancer free, but now I can't stop feeling physical pain or touch from seeing or sensing people who got or are being touched or Injured. When it first started happening all I had to do to stop the pain was to isolate myself to recharge, but lately it's been lingering longer and longer. Sometimes the pain is so intense that I can't sleep. Is there anyone who can give me something to feel better?
