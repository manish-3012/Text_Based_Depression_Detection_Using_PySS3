Couple of weeksI'm planning my suicide. Two years ago my dentist insisted on an operation finishing my bracelets. As a result I got a deformity. I look like a freak. I still got to continue to live as I got an heritage coming up within a couple of weeks. I'm depressed as hell, lost my confidence and realize I will never date any hot chicks anymore. Fuck this corrupt world, and all these motherfucking bastards. My life just seems pointless as I cant identify with my new me. As a result I started smoking lots of marijuana which only made my problems worse. I dont care about anything anymore, this seems so unreal.

Anyone any advice??
Thanks
