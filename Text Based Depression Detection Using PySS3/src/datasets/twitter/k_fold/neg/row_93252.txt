I don't deserve savingI'm a terrible person. I've lied my entire life and purposely hurt those close to me. I'm an abusive piece of shit. Hell, I don't even deserve any sympathy. I can't be honest now because then what's left of my life would be over.

I'm too far gone mentally. People like to pretend like you can turn this sort of thing around, but not me. I don't change. I just want to rest.

I probably won't kill myself yet, just cut to make these feelings numb.
