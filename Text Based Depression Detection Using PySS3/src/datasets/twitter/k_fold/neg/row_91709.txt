Lonely All The TimeThis is a throw away :c I just wanted to say how lonely I am all the time, even when talking to all my friends. I feel as if I'm the weak link in the chain. I've started to ditch some of my other friends to hang out with this one group of kids (We'll call them A Group) but I feel as if they don't care much about me. 

I feel like if I killed myself A Group wouldn't care at all and it makes me sad because I've spent so much time with them. I tried asking them to hang out with me, and all I got was um... no. :/

Along with that, I met this guy online and I was sort of desperate for someone to say nice things to me and I encouraged him to flirt with me just because I was lonely... 

I'm just so damn lonely all the time and I feel if I killed myself, people wouldn't care that much. I don't know how to make A Group my closer friends.
