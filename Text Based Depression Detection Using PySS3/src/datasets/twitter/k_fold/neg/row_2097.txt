i dont know what to do anymorei have been feeling the same way for about 5 years but i think right now im at my lowest point; i lost my only friend that supported me and was always there for me and i dont know what to do anymore, she was the only reason i was still alive but now im all alone. 
i tried to talk to my family about my mental health but they all just laughed at my, just like everyone else

i really want to die but im a fucking coward i cant even try to commit suicide, everyday feels the same i feel fucking empty and alone always faking a smile and no one knows how i feel because i pushed everyone away im a worthless piece of shit. i also tried to talk to my new "friends" but due to some old experiences i feel like theyâ€™re just going to laugh at me 

i really need help i dont know what im gonna do
