If I ever need to end my life, the last music I'll ever listen to is Pink Floyd's album the Dark Side Of The MoonIt's an album that brings up... problems that people have to deal with.

Money, time, a sense of belonging... and I know that I'll feel euphoric knowing that I will never have to be bothered by those again
