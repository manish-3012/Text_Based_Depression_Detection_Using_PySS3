Girlfriend moved away to college. Have been suicidal for over a year now, I think it's coming.Ever since my brother died, my girlfriend has been my rock. She is a year younger than me, so when I started my first year of college (I stayed at home) she was in her senior year of high school.

I know that I truly love her, not only has she helped me so much, just seeing her makes my mood lighten. I always joke that she's the light of my life, but now I see that it's honestly true.

Well, due to circumstances, I wasn't able to join her at college this semester, so she is now over 2 hours away. Money is extremely tight, so I can only afford to see her on some weekends.

I'm also very insecure and easily jealous, so I'd be lying if I said that those factors haven't harmed our relationship terribly since she moved away. 

I'm so God damn alone. It's extremely hard for me to make friends at my school, and I feel left in the dark with my girlfriend gone. 

I'm supposed to transfer to her school in January, but I seriously don't know if I can live like this until then. Plus, what the hell do I do if I get rejected? This isn't the only thing bothering me, but it's the one thing currently that is killing me.
