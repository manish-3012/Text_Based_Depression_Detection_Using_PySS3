Feel like my life is too good to justify killing myself, which makes me feel worse about wanting to dieI have a shit ton of problems too of course, like anyone else, but I also have a lot of good things going for me that I appreciate on a head level but not enough on a heart level. It's not like I don't feel happy or grateful sometimes, but at the end of the day, it always comes back to me wanting to die. And it's like, shit. Some people would kill to be in my shoes. I don't think anyone who loves me knows how dark it gets, but despite not having anyone in my life quite get me, I'm not even that lonely. I'm just sad as fuck. And the pain is mind numbing, like it feels like my brain is literally throbbing in my head. What the fuck is wrong with me? I feel like some other soul deserved to have the life I got so much more. They'd appreciate it more. I'm tired. I'm fucking pathetic. And because I know I'm blessed in a lot of ways, it makes me feel even worse and guiltier about wanting to off myself. Who else is in the same boat? What the fuck is wrong with us?
