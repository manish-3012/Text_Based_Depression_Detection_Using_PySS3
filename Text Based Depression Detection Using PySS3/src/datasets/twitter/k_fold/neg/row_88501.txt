Trying again toniteFailed my attempt about two weeks ago, trying again this evening.

As usual someone decided to play hero and say "I'm here if you need to talk" but ghosted when I actually did.

I'm female, I'll be 34 in a couple weeks, and out of 34 years only one was happy and life just keeps getting worse and worse. 

I'm poor. I'm lonely. I'm tired of trying and, if we're honest, the better years have already passed me by. I don't have the memories and connections to make another 34 years of hell worth it.

I'm going to try again tonight. Hoping I don't lose courage this time. The only reason I'm still here is fear of the dying process. I have no problems being dead.

I wish I were in Belgium. Then someone would help me, it would be less painful, and my quality of life and individual choice would be respected. Here I'll have to go slowly, painfully, and hide everything from potential "rescuers.

I hate last minute Heroes. They do it to make themselves feel good. 

If you really want to prevent suicide you have to start long before someone is ready to "jump of a pill box".
