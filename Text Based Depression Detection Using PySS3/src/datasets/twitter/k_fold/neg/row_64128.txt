Please, someone tell me why life is worth living?I pray every night to die in my sleep. Iâ€™ve lost all my passion and hope. I canâ€™t feel anything but despair. My meds keep me stable...enough. But Iâ€™ve lost any spark I should to have, any desire. Hell, Iâ€™ve even lost my sex drive. I want nothing anymore, besides to sleep so I can pretend to die.
