Donâ€™t know where to turn.Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 11. Itâ€™s scary to think back on me just beginning 7th grade wondering if I could pry the bars off my 5th story window or if I could get skinny enough to shimmy through them. I look at seventh graders and I canâ€™t believe I felt like that so young. So precious faced. So innocent to what I am now.  Now Iâ€™m 20 and killing myself is hard. I yearn to not exist so bad. Today was very hard. I am five weeks pregnant and my fiancÃ© left me. Today was hard. What shouldâ€™ve been my father in law pushed me to the ground and kicked my stomach. Today sucked ass man. I didnâ€™t want to get out of bed, I barely drank any water, I definitely havenâ€™t brushed my teeth in god knows how long. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve showered in three days. It hurts even more because no one around me notices. Not even my fiancÃ© ( well I guess ex) and I canâ€™t kill myself because I have a baby in me but the baby could die because of the trauma. I canâ€™t run to my parents. They donâ€™t care. I have no where to go. Tomorrow night I will not have a mattress or a couch. I wish I could call my mom and Dad. I wish I had a friend who I could call at 2 in the morning and say, â€œhey I really might kill myself but I probably wonâ€™t if you come overâ€ I donâ€™t even think I can raise a baby on my own. Iâ€™m sorry I ramble and go in eight different directions with my thoughts. Itâ€™s hard to keep everything together. I couldnâ€™t find any razors around my house so it made me cry harder. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep it together. I miss my mom and Dad. I wish I wasnâ€™t a fuck up child and they loved me. Or they cared enough to answer when I called at 2am. I wish I had something to hold on to but all I can hold on to is the hope that I die. Itâ€™s so disgraceful to see myself like this. Do you ever wish you didnâ€™t have to do it? Iâ€™m so tired of this life. Constant struggle. In and out of homelessness. No college. I wish someone just saw how tired I was.... I donâ€™t know if I can keep doing it...
