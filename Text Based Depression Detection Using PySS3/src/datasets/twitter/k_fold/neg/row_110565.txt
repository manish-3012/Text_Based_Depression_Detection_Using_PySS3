Depressed/anxious over nothingI have been feeling extremely anxious and as a result, depressed for the past month. I was able to graduate college but did not even care that I did. Everything in my life is perfect yet I cannot get these dark, hopeless, helpless, suicidal thoughts out of my mind. They are so poisnous and just twist my world around into a blur of madness. I am constantly confused on what I am feeling coupled with a feeling that I am going to die soon, or am destined for suicide. IT MAKES NO SENSE. I should add that a close relative of mine committed suicide 2 years ago and that triggered a lot of my symptoms. It was like "oh god he did it, then I must be capable of doing it" I dont know why he did it, but I did find out yesterday how he did it. I think that has fucked me up because I have been non stop crying for two days, unable to talk to my parents out of guilt and the feeling that ill be a burden. I also am starting a new job and I cant just drop it and leave, plus with my apparment. Yet I feel the world has come crashing down upon me, I feel fucked, I feel doomed. My thought float towards death and its extremely scary and distressing. I have heavy mental fatigue just from fighting away these thoughts. It's a constant battle. Help!
