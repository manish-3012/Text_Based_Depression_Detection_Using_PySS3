I wrote a noteMy anxiety and depression have debilitated me so much that I've given up on every career path, nearly destroyed my family, and lost all my friends. I just hurt everyone I talk to. I'm waiting for my sister's birthday and graduation because I don't want to ruin them, but after that, it's curtains. I'm out of options.

I wrote a note tonight explaining why, apologizing, saying I loved my family.
