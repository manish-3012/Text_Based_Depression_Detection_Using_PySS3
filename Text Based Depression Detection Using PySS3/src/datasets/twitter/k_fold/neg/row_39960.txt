Why do I even bother trying to keep myself alive?So I've been around SW for awhile, so some of you may know me. About 2 months ago, my girlfriend broke up with me. I know I should get over it, but it was my first actual love. I had cared so much about her. I stopped her from starting up drinking again, I tried to help her with her almost chronic panic attacks. We talked for about 20 mins a few days later and she said that she never loved or cared about me and was only using me. She said that her new boyfriend, the person she left for me in the first place, helped her. We had made promises to each other. She promised that I would be her first. I promised that I would wait for her and put my heart and soul into the relationship. It was a shitty time in my life, and I shouldn't have tried to grasp on to every single opportunity that I could have for happiness. Ever since then I haven't been able to be really happy. I am in the top PSAT 85th percentile, and I am on the verge of being an Eagle Scout. I have my whole life set for me, but I don't want to live it. I don't see any other life to take, though. I can't change the road I'm on. Why don't I just end this road? I just don't want to live life if I'm not going to be happy. Everyone has always said that it gets better, it has never gotten better. I've only ever lost friends. I have a hard time with people because I automatically assume that everyone has a negative opinion of me. I don't know why. I don't have negative opinions of most people. Yet, I can't help but think that no one wants to be around me. I don't even understand how I got Alyssa in the first place. I try my best to avoid social contact with people that I don't know. The only people that I can generally trust are the people I've known for years, or that I know have some form of morals. At this point, I might as well just stop walking down the path that I've laid for myself. I don't know why I haven't yet.
