My mother againJust had a conversation with my mother who is already drunk (at 3pm on a Monday). I told her recently that I am suicidal which I have been for a few months (already posted about this today but I need to rant). She is shouting at me about how lazy I am, how I do nothing around the house, saying Iâ€™m only depressed when I talk to her, sheâ€™s telling me to move out right now. She literally said â€˜if youâ€™re so depressed why donâ€™t you just fuck offâ€™. I hate her.
