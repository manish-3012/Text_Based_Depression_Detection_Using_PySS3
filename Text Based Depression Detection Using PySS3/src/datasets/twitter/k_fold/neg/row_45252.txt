I can't do this anymore. I'm done.So, I finally got section 8. The new landlord showed up unannounced at my house that I'm currently at for a "prospective tenant" inspection. As far as I can tell, it wasn't legal but what was I gonna do? I let him in. My house is a wreck from moving/packing. So, he says he's probably not going to rent to me. I don't have anywhere else to go. Sigh. I can't keep fighting. I don't have it in me. Someone tell me you understand. I'm hanging on by a thread.
