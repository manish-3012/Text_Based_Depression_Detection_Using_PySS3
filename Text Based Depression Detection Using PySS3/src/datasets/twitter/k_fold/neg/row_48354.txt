What is really the point?I'm beginning to seriously consider giving everyone the middle finger and taking my life, it's mine after all. 
I didn't ask anyone to bring me here, nobody asked me if I wanted to be born, I was forced into a meaningless life because my mother just wanted to have me.

Thing is, recently I've been thinking about the future and what do I want for myself, and I just don't see what's the point of continuing. I have many hobbies, in college studying what I liked since childhood, relatively good financial situation, I know a lot of people, only thing missing is a girlfriend and I would pretty much have everything I hoped for in life.

So what's the point? See, I don't need anything else, I'm bored of life, what is there to live for? 
Knowledge? Experience? Money? When I die, it goes with me. I already gave up on trying to find a girlfriend, so having kids in the future to "keep my legacy" isn't a thing.
Having fun? What for? Same thing, it goes with me when I die.
Helping the human race? We showed ourselves that we just simply do not give a shit about eachother or the planet, no matter what.

I will probably find a job and give money to my family for a while, just to help with debts, and then just finish it. 
Now I'm not sad or anything, I actually feel pretty calm now that I reached this conclusion. I just don't see the point of living a life I know has no meaning for me.

So what's your take on life? What is your own meaning? What keeps you from giving up, knowing that no matter what you accomplish, you will end up just like everyone else?
