How do you go on?I have had TMJ (Messed up jaw that causes pain and many problems) for years. It's only getting worse now and the treatments for this are terrible. Surgery is risky and has bad success rate. I was so excited for my life 6 months ago but now I dread the future. My life will never be the same as in looking at jaw pain and complications for the rest of my life. My only emotions are hatred and regret for the mistakes that led me here and being scared as hell for the future. I just can't live like this. I just want to die but I can't do that to my family. I want my life I had 6 months ago. I don't want to live anymore but I don't want to hurt my family. This isn't their fault and they did their best with me. It's my fault. I should be the only one to suffer.
