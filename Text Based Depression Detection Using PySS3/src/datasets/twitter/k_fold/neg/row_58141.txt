i am a monster,,i am a monster, i cannot love nothing, all my life i have never been happy, i only can feel satisfaction with meaningless and selfish touch, or by eating something to trick my brain to be happy.

i never had any friend, never ever i had friend, and i already know that i will die alone.  everyone that i see, i believe they will eventually betray me, or use me.

and it never gets easier,  i thoght it would by now but it gets harder and harder, i always say to my collegue that i do not feel loneliness so do not bother contacting me in any holiday or birthday.

and me even writing this pathetic article here pains me that how much of a trash of a person i have grown up to be.

it has been all of my life that nobody cared about me, 

i do not know when it is going to be, but it is so painful, so painful and i enjoys it 

because it is proof that one up in where chosed me to be the waste of life.  

it eats me like me cancer, piece by piece, i have called numerous suicide call line, none of them helped. 

i cannot go to therapist because i will get fired from my job. 

no one will ever know, no one wlll ever care. 

but i grossely hold on to my life, and beg for that hope 

that one day i can live like humans out there smiling enjoying day by day.

nothing is going to happen. i already know, 

i know that i need someone to talk to, and i won't, and i am not going to.
