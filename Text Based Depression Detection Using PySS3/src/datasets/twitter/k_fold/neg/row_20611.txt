Give me a GOOD reason to liveIm done trying, its too hard. Everything is just a grind from where I am. My childhood is over, and only very minor pleasures exist beyond the point im at. Not to mention depression bogging everything down. Its only getting more and more difficult, and my ability to cope with it is declining. I just want to die. I have no energy, motivation, or anything left. It takes A LOT of effort and energy to squeeze out even the smallest bit of happieness. Why should I live? To make money for someone else in a job? No.
