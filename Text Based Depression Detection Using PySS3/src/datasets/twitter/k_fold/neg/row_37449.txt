I punched myself everyday for the last 5 yearsIt might sound little weird but the only way to make the pain inside of me goes aways is that I have to self inflicted the pain outside. 

Iâ€™m afraid of knife so cutting myself is out of choice. Plus because itâ€™s gonna look obvious on my wrist.

I punched myself in the stomach instead. I use to do Thai kickboxing so I know exactly where to punch that will give the most pain. 

I canâ€™t stop.
