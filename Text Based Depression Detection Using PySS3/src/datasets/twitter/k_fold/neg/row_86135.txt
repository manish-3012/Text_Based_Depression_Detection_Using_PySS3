Whatâ€™s the point?For the past 6 months, Iâ€™ve come up with a reason to live for the day. But for 3 weeks, I couldnâ€™t think of any new reasons. Whatâ€™s the point? Everyday feels like a never ending cycle of pretending that Iâ€™m happy. But when others that Iâ€™m not, I just get told to seek help. All I really needed was someone to listen. Someone that I knew. A friend, a sibling, a significant other, a parent, a roommateâ€”just someone to listen. Iâ€™ve written so many suicide letters that itâ€™s become a weekly journal entry. I feel empty and I just want to feel something even if itâ€™s sadness. I donâ€™t even feel sad. I donâ€™t feel anything but to put an end to the cycle.
