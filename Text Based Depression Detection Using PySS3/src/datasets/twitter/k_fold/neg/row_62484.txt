I don't know what I'm going to do and I don't anyone can help me.I am a timed-out uni student and trying to finish. But over the last few days I have been feeling very negative. I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't even know what I'd say even if I had someone to talk to. I feel like life has me cornered and I don't have a way out. I want to just drop out (mostly because of financial conditions) and maybe work on my music but I don't know if it's a viable career option. But I know that lifestyle doesn't really pay, so I started working freelance but even then I don't get too many jobs. 
Currently I'm broke to the point that I haven't had food since yesterday, just surviving. I just wish someone would kill me but no one will because I can't even pay for that. Surprisingly however, I've grown to hide it so much so that people near me do not have any clue what I'm going through inside. These last few days I have been getting the feeling that they might in fact be my last few days.
I don't know what I set to achieve with this post but I figured maybe I'd just do it, since I have nothing to lose at this point.
