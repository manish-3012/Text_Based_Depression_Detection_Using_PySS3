People are reaching out to me and I don't know what to do.Throwaway. I didn't know where else to post.

I run a blog for an (unrecognized) issue some people have which answers questions and points them to resources. Recently someone asked me if there were any stats on suicide in our little community because they were struggling. I answered with a stat.  Since then people have been sending me messages like this:

&gt;I need help. [issue] makes me more suicidal and I hurt myself... I am obsessed and scared. Please.

&gt;[Issue] causes me a lot of distress and makes me even more suicidal. I also deal with severe OCD and panic disorder and it is not a good combination... And my [issue is] always dark and painful and results in panic attacks daily. Help.

This is my community, that I love and want to help... but I have no idea what to do.  They're reaching out and I don't know how to handle it.  

I did read the "concerned but don't know what to say" post listed in r/SWResources but I didn't really see a way to apply it to this situation where I am receiving anonymous messages with little information.  

I don't even know where to begin, how do I reply to messages like this?
