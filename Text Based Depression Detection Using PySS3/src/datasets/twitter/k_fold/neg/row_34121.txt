Unbearable endometriosis pain. Giving up.I've had endometriosis for 10 years as far as I know, and still too young for doctors to perform surgery on. I'm in the hospital at least once a month. Eating pain meds constantly. I just got back from the doctor. Both of my ovaries are fused to the bottom of my uterus. Thats only what they could see on an ultrasound. The pain Never goes away. They won't treat it until I'm either in my mid 30s or have children. I can't wait that long. I'm sorry for bothering all of you but i needed to vent before i go. Thank you for reading.
