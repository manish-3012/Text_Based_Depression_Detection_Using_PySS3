Probably not enough xanax to kill myself but weâ€™ll see. Goodnight?Xanax and wine. Low key hope i donâ€™t see tomorrow.

I love you more than anything dad.

I love you mom, brother, and my 2 best friends. 

You all dad so much and more. donâ€™t blame yourselves. The problem is me, never you all. You mad it the happiest it could have been. My mind is toxic. I love you all more than anything but please understand I canâ€™t take the fucking agony. Hope you find this. 

It will probably fail though. Hopefully goodbye to this evil, but simultaneously evil world. i wasnâ€™t meant for here. I apologize, really been trying my hardest. Much love. More than you know.
