Australian overseas on holiday looking for some kind of service I can access.So I've obviously got problems and I'm not good at saying them here, but the website that I used last time only works in Australia, where I am not. They gave me useful information about resources I could use and they seem like they know their stuff, but didn't do much counselling actually. I don't have any phone to use that I can call with, and I'm in Germany.

I really need help with this right now and I would really appreciate it, and this is my first time I've been on this subreddit so I have no idea.
