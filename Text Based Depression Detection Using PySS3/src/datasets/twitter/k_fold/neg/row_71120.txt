Why does my brain just automatically say â€œkill your selfâ€ the moment I feel any dread or sadness what so ever?I have borderline and ocd and depression and probably a few other things as well. Been doing a day program to get better. Went off my meds for 3 days, finally got a dosage today and took it but Iâ€™m still moody as hell. I keep thinking about certain things and my brains automatic reaction is â€œok thereâ€™s no point or reason. Just kill your self.â€ Iâ€™m trying so hard with this program. Iâ€™ve been in it for weeks. Probably a month by now? Iâ€™ve lost count. But so many of the classes just trigger me. Like one was about responsibility and adulthood basically and I couldnâ€™t handle it and I shut down and like I normally walk out but I just sat there and hid myself under my sweater and balled my eyes out. And I feel bad because Iâ€™ll just vent and vent and vent to people but I donâ€™t know why anymore. Iâ€™m crying for help. But not the kind people give me. I should be appreciative, but all I want is my childhood and my innocence back. I want the people im grieving back. Radical acceptance is full of bs to me. It hurts too damn much. I just want family. I had it and I didnâ€™t appreciate it and depression and bpd blinded me. Now itâ€™s gone. Because I made mistakes and Iâ€™m a faulty person. Iâ€™m not perfect and I hurt people. Every group chat Iâ€™m apart of I feel like the odd one out. I feel like I donâ€™t belong. Like I just burden people or bring people down because Iâ€™m always negative. Iâ€™m just wondering why Iâ€™m even bothering. Why shouldnâ€™t I just go back walking out and disappear somewhere. I dunno. I have this fear of death so thatâ€™s probably why I havenâ€™t done anything. I just needed to get this out. I just wish I had a reason to keep going when everything I want Iâ€™ll never get and I canâ€™t be happy with anything else.
