I need guidance... please help me.Nothing religious, oh God no. (haha, funny joke.) but i feel like I'm dying on the inside. I'm so alone.. Forever Alone even rejected to be with me. I'm in high school now, and I've had these thoughts since forever, around 7th grade. I'm the epitome of a failure, i have nothing going for me. 

I spend my entire afternoon studying, and yes, my ENTIRE afternoon. Sometimes it goes to 5 hours of just one subject because I'm too stupid to understand the simplicity, or logicality of it. I'm in two AP classes, my GPA is a 3.468. I do have friends, yes. Maybe I'm not entirely forever alone, but i have never had a girlfriend. I'm too shy, i don't know how being a kid works. My parents don't talk to me, i'm given full independence of thinking, but i'm not allowed outside of my home. My parents want me to be independent, but they still won't let me outside. I spend my whole night studying, and thinking of what could have been, or what could be. I don't see myself in the future, mostly because i feel like ending it now. I don't know why, i feel so fortunate, but i feel so insignificant, i feel like a nuisance. I feel like i'm the one my friends hate together, or make fun of me behind my back, even though i KNOW they don't. I just feel useless, empty, and pathetic. Everyday. I study and study, and still can't get good grades, while other kids in my class don't study at all, and pass the class with a straight 100 in every test. I do all my homework, even if it's optional. This might just be a vent, but i really don't believe it is a vent without a purpose of death. I need help, i'm chronically depressed, and don't want anyone to think of me as the failure i already am. Please help me. I'm 16, and i don't want to cry, but i find myself doing that very often now.
