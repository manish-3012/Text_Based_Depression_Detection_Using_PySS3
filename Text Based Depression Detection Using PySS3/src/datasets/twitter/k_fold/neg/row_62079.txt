I just want the pain to stopHello everyone,I'm a 19 yer old college freshman from Croatia and I'd like to start off by saying that I haven't been feeling well for the past 5 years.Sometime around when I started going to highschool my parents hit a rough patch when my father lost his office job and my mother started suffering from  depression after her hands got shaky,so she had to quit her job as a hairdresser.Ever since then they've barely been making ends meet.I started hating the school I was going to partly because I simply disliked it it and partly because seeing all the well-off kids with succesful parents made me even more depressed and angry with life.The constant fights  my prents had about money and the shitty conditions we lived in(still do) didn't help either.Ever since then I haven't felt the same.I hate every moment of my waking life,I'm in a constant state of unjustified anxiety and most of the time I'm either immensely depressed or so angry that it borders with absolute rage.Every day I smoke a pack of cigarettes and I drink myself into myself into a stupor on weekends just to make it all hurt less.My ambition and will to live are as good as gone by now and I feel cheated by life because I've been denied all the good things people get to experience in their teen years.If it weren't for my supportive girlfriend and my younger brother I'd have taken my life 10 times by now if that were possible.Sometimes I regret being born just to suffer on a daily basis.I'm just not sure if I can continue like ths.
