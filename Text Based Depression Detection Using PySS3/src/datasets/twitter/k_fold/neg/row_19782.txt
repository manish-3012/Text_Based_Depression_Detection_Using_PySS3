I've been awake 3 hours and it already feels too longI feel seriously depressed. I don't have depression, but I've lived with anxiety problems all my life. I've never contemplated taking my own life until recently. I don't even hate myself for the most part. I just can't fucking stand the absolute horrible pain that I'm feeling in my chest. I know for a fact that if I drink I'll drink until I'm unconscious. I can't see a therapist until Friday and all I want is for this pain to stop. I just have no idea what to do.
