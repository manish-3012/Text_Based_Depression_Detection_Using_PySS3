I don't feel happy. I don't feel.This is my first time posting something here, I don't even know where to start. Recently my life is just going in one way, one direction : bad. I'm not feeling happy at all, I mean in 24H I'm just happy like for 3/4 minutes and then it's gone idk. I only fell alive when I'm listening to music. I'm hating my routine more and more, I can't understand why I'm going to School and I'm feeling that I'm in the wrong area, I got no plans for the future and even for the present. I wake up early go to school, wait till go home do fuckin homework study then eat and wash my dishes, And I just sleep about 11 Pm. I can't go on like this, I can't support this anymore. I'm starting to cry everyday in bed and it's not normal. And I got friends that would never understand this I don't know what to do, and while I'm writing this I feel like it's no worth it, so I'm just ending up here.
