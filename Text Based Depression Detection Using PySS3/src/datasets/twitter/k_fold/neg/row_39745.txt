I donâ€™t know what it is, but I am scared of it. I feel like I need helpNo matter what I do, I always fuck it all up. Iâ€™m only 19, and I already feel like I shouldâ€™ve never been born. Like it wouldâ€™ve been better for everyone around me if I was never here. Thereâ€™s always a thought in my head that Iâ€™m never gonna succeed in anything. I feel pathetic. I have my family and my true friends but still I feel Iâ€™m not worth it all. And I know for sure if I wanna die, they will never be able to stop me
