I'm just so tired. I don't see the point of any of thisI guess my anxiety has been riled up lately because I have a presentation to deliver soon. 

Suicidal thoughts are not new to me. I always get them whenever I'm under pressure. 

But in general, the pressure has been mounting. I need to work next year but I don't want to. I need to complete my thesis and I don't even know if I'm competent enough to pull it off, but there's pressure to do it really well. 

I'm sick of the dominant capitalist system and I wish the world would change. I guess I'm just tired and I want to end it. Just escape. Logically it makes sense. I'm free from all of life's constraints. I'm glad to have experienced life, but I've had enough. This is it. 

If the world is not to going to change enough to eliminate all of these pressures that cause us to feel this way in the first place, why the fuck must I fucking adapt? I'm not obliged to, yet if u don't, there's consequences attached to it. Well I say fuck it. Fuck life. I'm done.
