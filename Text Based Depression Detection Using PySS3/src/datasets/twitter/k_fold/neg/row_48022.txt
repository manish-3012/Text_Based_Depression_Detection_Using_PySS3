Enough of this cruel world....i have had enough, from seeing my mom die to seeing my dad cheat i have seen everything i have to and of course more than that. I really don't understand why i am even breathing right now. Nobody gives a damn about how i feel. I really wonder if it's me who is this complicated or if it's the people who don't  understand me.

I am a fab  example that money can't buy everything. Having enough money to feed a 100 people i still feel like dying a bad death. I am in a position where i feel afraid of living and feeling happy.

I am tired of being yelled at.

I am tired of being accused for things that are not even related to me.

I am tired of being proved dumb.

I am tired of struggling.

I am tired of being misunderstood.

I am tired of being fucked up.

I am tired of being depressed.

I am tired of missing my mom.

I am tired of hiding my pain.

I am tired of crying in the bathroom.

I am tired of crying on my pillows.

I am tired of crying in the shower.

I am tired of crying within me.

I am tired of  pretending to be happy.

In a nutshell,

I am tired of living.

if death was a option, I would probably opt for it twice.

Any nice suicide ideas ?

I'm listening.....
