I've been fighting it but I can't anymoreMy baby grows up while I'm stuck away working, my girlfriend reminds me of the fact that I'm not there and doing nothing for her everyday. My best friend drowned in front of me and I saved the person that killed him, my mom doesnt even remember most of her life let alone mine and has fits that cause her heart to stop and hopefully restart until it doesn't. My father is a pedophile,  my family on both sides wants nothing to do with me.  And to top things off.. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end
