I have no will or motivation to live anymore, it all just feels like too much effort and I don't want to be a burden to anyone.I'm not really sure how to go about it, I don't want to make my family or friends suffer. However, I think me disappearing for good would be less painful in the long run. If I stay here I am only going to cause them long-term pain with my unhappiness, lack of motivation, unwillingness to fight for anything. 

I can't think of any life-goals, any future plans, I don't really picture myself happy in the future in any way. I've always been like this too, since I was a kid I just wasn't a very happy kid, always riddled with anxiety and worry. As I grew my relationships were just one mess to another in which I hurt other people and myself by my lack of gratitude.

I don't want to feel pain or make a big dramatic exit and scar anyone's life. But I just don't really see the point to me being here anymore.  I know if I want anything in life it will take effort and hard-work and a long time. But I just don't have that in me, I say I want all these things but I really just don't care about anything, not life, not myself, nothing.

I'm not even sure I feel much sadness anymore, I do feel anxious sometimes and so much regret for how I've acted and mistakes I've made that have cost me opportunities and relationships. But even then, I see putting the effort to make them work as too much. There's no spark in me, there's no care.

I see no point to being here anymore.
