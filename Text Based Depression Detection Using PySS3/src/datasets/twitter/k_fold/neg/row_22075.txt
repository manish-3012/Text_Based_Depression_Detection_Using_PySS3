My planMy plan is get drunk and high and shoot myself
 I plan on doing it this summer.  I haven't drank in eight years....but relapse is around the corner.  I told my therapist this in an email last week and she still hasn't responded.  Guess there isn't anything she can do.  Since I don't own a gun yet nobody is taking me seriously.  Got to love the mental health field.
