Trying to be happy while depressed and wanting to end it all is exhaustingItâ€™s funny how we pretend weâ€™re happy just to keep up with others when I just wanna die. The anxiety, the fears, the fucks ups, the feeling tired all the time, the trivial shit we put with. The useless fighting everyday for each year to get worse and worse and f worse. Life is nothing but a grind, and I canâ€™t Fucking have one thing I desire because this shit of a mental illness will always limit me. Everyoneâ€™s problem is hard and complex we canâ€™t help everyone, sometimes death is the only answer to a miserable life.
