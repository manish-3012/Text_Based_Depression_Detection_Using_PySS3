I just want everyone else's pain to end but mineI just wish there was a way for everyone's lives to be happy but mine. I want all of everybody's pain and suffering to end and it put all on me. Life doesn't seem worth living anymore. I've been through these horrible thoughts and feelings so many times to the point where they actually make sense now. I will never be the person I was set to be, not even half. I will never be happy, I will never be in control of my life. I am starting to agree more and more with these voices in my head as time passes on. Killing myself seems like the only option left.
