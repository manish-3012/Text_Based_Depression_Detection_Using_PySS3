Unemployable and therefore ready to be deadI havenâ€™t been hired in nearly two years since I left my last position due to a nervous breakdown. Unemployment gaps are a huge stigma that only get worse with time. Thereâ€™s nothing I can do about it and I feel that I am just ready to end my life once and for all. No one will hire me, and there is no help for this type of setback. Iâ€™m ready to die.
