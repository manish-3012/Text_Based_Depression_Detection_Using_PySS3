I donâ€™t care about living my life the best it can be. If I have one shot at life and it will never be what I want it to be, whoâ€™s to say I should stay alive?Why should I stay alive for other people? I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s selfish. Once Iâ€™m dead I wonâ€™t be around to even consider that shit. I only have one life and if itâ€™s not the one I want why do I need to stick around?
