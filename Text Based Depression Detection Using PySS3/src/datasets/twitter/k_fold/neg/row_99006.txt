Iâ€™m so tired of everything.My parents treat me like shit. Treat me like a damn 15 year old. Iâ€™m 21 living with my parents. I have no phone service because I canâ€™t afford it, they disconnect the internet at 10 so I sleep â€œearlyâ€ I got 0 dollars on my checking account. I have to pretty much beg my parents for money, for my gas to start my new job.  My boyfriend treats me like shit. I finally confronted him, and told him that Iâ€™m tired of life, tired of everything &amp; how my parents treat me. He started playing his game, and completely ignored what I had to say and blamed it on my parents and it was my fault for always kissing up to them... called me and I quote â€œa dumbassâ€ I hate my life so much, the only thing thatâ€™s motivating me is my sister and my sibling on the way. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of everything. I donâ€™t know if I handle it anymore im so done.
