Lost antidepressant prescriptionI needed to go for a refill on Monday anyway as I'm down to my last week, but I'm on cymbalta and I misplaced my last week's worth. I'm really scared right now because I've been suicidal this week (talked to my therapist in person and on the phone multiple times this week about it) and I've only dealt with a day's worth of withdrawal before. I don't know how I'm going to make it to Monday. I have so much work to do. I'm going to feel so awful. :(

My school's pharmacy, where I have to get all prescriptions from, is sadly closed on Sundays. I have no idea wtf to do. I'm so scared.
