Why did I hopeIâ€™m so stupid. Why did I ever think I had value? Why did I start to believe anything anyone has said? I donâ€™t have value. Iâ€™m worthless. I donâ€™t deserve to be happy. I donâ€™t know why I let myself think I could be. Iâ€™m only here to hurt. Iâ€™m only here to hope and be let down. Iâ€™m a mess. Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m not worthy of the life I dream about. All I want to do is cry. All I want to do is be done hurting. Why do I let myself hope? Why do I try? How long until I learn my lesson. Stop believing in yourself. Stop believing in others. They donâ€™t care about you and never will. Youâ€™re here for them. Youâ€™re never going to be human.
