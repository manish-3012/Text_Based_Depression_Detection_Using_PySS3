I've been struggling for a long time but I find comfort in thisI really do love you people.  No I don't know you but I love the fact that this is the place I can confide in and I can confide in you.  I've done nothing more than upvote in this sub but I've really been struggling lately.  Every wish I can make is to just be happy and no matter what I can't.  I'm really trying, I can't leave, people would miss me, but I just don't want to stay.  I'm just tired.
