It didn't workI don't know if passing on can happen peacefully all the pills never seem to work. I was hoping for one peaceful moment in life but I woke up instead. I just don't have the appeal of Bleeding Out or kicking and struggling while hanging from the ceiling as being peaceful at all. So it's always pills but it never works. Maybe death is like life and there is no peace in that either. Just want a moment of calmness before my much-sought-after exit. The desire to go is stronger then the expectation of peacefulness. It's so unfair that everything has to be so ugly. Why can't it be calm and easy to just go
