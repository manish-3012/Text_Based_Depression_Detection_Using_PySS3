i need helpi am only 15 and yet so much has happened .my dad abused me when i was little and consumed drugs since i can remember.  when i was 7 i was seually assalted by one of my dads freinds. only a week later my step father took videos of me crying, not naked just crying for my mom. they have recently gotten a divorce and it's just gone down hill. it's that bad that i'm at the stage of crying before school begging on my knees for help by my mom. she then proceeds to tell me that im attention seeking. she raised a hand to me this morning now i'm flinching at everything. she was screaming at me. so i then just told her everything and she didn't realise that i was this bad. i can't cope anymore.
