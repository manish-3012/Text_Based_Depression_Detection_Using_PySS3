I'm out of options. Don't even know why i'm posting here. Maybe i'm hoping for someone who has advice.I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. I'm only 16, and i've not left my house due to anxiety and nausea in 7 months straight. I lay in bed all day feeling ill. I have no contact with anyone outside my immediate family. I'm very alone. My parents have tried hard to get me help, but people tell them theres nothing that can be done.

I called my cities mental health clinic today out of pure desperation, to see what my options were now. The woman told me that my parents and I had already exhausted every available options(Going to GP, hospital admissions, crisis lines, medications and seeing a therapist) and that she had nothing else to suggest. She suggested if I really feel in danger, just go back to the hospital. She also told me if I wanted a specialist appointment for my gastrointestinal issues, it would likely be a 6-8 month wait. Thanks a fucklot, Canada.

I've already stayed in the hospital 5 fucking times(More than a year ago), not the mention the fuckload of times i've went to the ER, only to be sent away. Nobody cares to help. Nobody wants to help.

So, thats that. I now know i've exhausted everything. Life, you have failed me.
