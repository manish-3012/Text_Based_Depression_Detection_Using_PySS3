What else is one supposed to do in this situation?When you don't enjoy doing anything and literally everything you do becomes tedious and miserable given a small amount of time, what are you supposed to do?

I feel I have no capacity for happiness the way I have capacity for agony.  I can feel basic or complex pleasures, I can feel enraptured, I can feel complete -- for as long as the simple, direct stimulation causing these feelings lasts.  I can feel some alleviation of boredom doing certain things, but after a short time everything makes me feel miserable.

The world hurts me.  What else am I supposed to do to escape but die?
