I should post this on a throwaway but oh well.The past two years of my life have been hell. Every time I feel like Iâ€™m making progress in my life it feels like it all falls apart. I havenâ€™t been suicidal in like 8 months but for some reason today has been bad. 

I just feel very alone, and sad. I looked through my phone and realize I have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t want to go to the hospital cause I always end up in the hospital and I wanted this January to be different. 


Iâ€™m struggling to find reasons to live.
