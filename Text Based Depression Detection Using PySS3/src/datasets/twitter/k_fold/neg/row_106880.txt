I have such mixed feelingsI want to kill myself and take the easy way out. I don't want to deal with myself any longer.

I have a brother though who I love very much. I don't want to leave him. I also have an internet friend I want to meet. 

I feel like these are the only reasons I'm still here. Sometimes it's hard to remember that though.
