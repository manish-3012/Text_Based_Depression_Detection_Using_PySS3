So lost with everything in my life. i hung myself but couldn't do it, i dont know why.I have PTSD, Depression, Anxiety. 

I really wanna end it all, my girlfriends treats me differently which is what is hurting me the most

all of my friends left me and im so mean to my family i feel like a monster who needs to end it all.

i hung myself but my little brother saw me and asked for a hug. and i feel like without him id be gone. i want to die.
