26/f feeling generally aloneI just don't feel connected to people. I feel like I'm grossly hideous and awful looking to guys so I usually spend most days feeling pretty bad about myself. Most of my time (when I'm not at work) is just spent on photography (which is kind of fun but I suck at) or watching movies with interesting cinematography or listening to music. I would really love to make a friend or just connect with anybody because I know there are a lot of people in the world with extraordinary beauty within their hearts and minds, but I'm just way too shy/hideous to be around people so I don't even try to talk to people (also I should note I'm the worst at talking to guys because I feel like they are always secretly judging me on how disgusting i must be). Lately I feel really alone and idk if this post belongs here.
