How are people so hopeful?I have had depression since I was 14.  I have had periods of suicidal ideation with a plan since then. I've been in therapy, on meds, I exercise, I'm employed yet I still feel like none of this is worth it. I will likely end my life in the next couple of weeks. How are people so hopeful about life? What is the secret?
