My friend is manipulativeOne of my best friends from childhood is incredibly manipulative, he will purposely make others be mean to him just so he can make everyone feel bad for him except he always only comes to me when he pretends to be picked on by the group, why fucking me? I generally have nothing to do with it but he always texts me with stuff like â€œhow come you guys hate meâ€ I know heâ€™s only doing it to try and keep my closer to him as a friend but when we do hangout he pushes me away and Iâ€™m the last one in the friend group heâ€™d talk to specifically, he gets mad when I hangout with others but literally left me alone at my bday party to go and try and hangout with this girl he likes that I invited. It really sucks and I still feel guilty for his shit, Iâ€™ve told him multiples times that Iâ€™ve tried killing myself and have severe depression but he still throws every one of his problems on me.
