I'm trying for one more year.So I have made the decision to try as hard as I can to change the situation I'm in right, it doesn't have to be perfect but if my life isn't at least better next year. I'm done

Don't know if anyone is interested but I thought maybe someone out there will get some motivation from this somehow.
