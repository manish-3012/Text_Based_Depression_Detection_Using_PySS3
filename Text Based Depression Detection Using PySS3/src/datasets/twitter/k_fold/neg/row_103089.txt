how do I keep the elephant in my head at bay?I go through pretty intense bouts of depression and have frequent thoughts of killing myself, almost to the point that i'm fantasizing about it. Right now I'm not concerned that I'll actually do it but the more this goes on the more intense and frequent the fantasies are. Is this normal and how can I stop it?
