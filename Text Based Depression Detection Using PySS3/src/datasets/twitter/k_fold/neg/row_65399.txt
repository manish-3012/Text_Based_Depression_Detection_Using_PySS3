My girlfriend may be suicidal and refuses to see a professional. I'm not sure what I should do, please help.I'll try to keep this brief:

* My girlfriend dropped out of her classes (without penalty to her GPA) a few weeks before the end of the semester when it was clear that she would fail them. She's been home ever since.  
* She was doing well until depression sank in. She skipped class and stopped doing work.  
* She saw a professional once per week for a few weeks but didn't participate much and dreaded going.  

She says that she "has to" end her life because her life is going nowhere. She has **no plans** ("yet") and **no time frame** but has told me several times that she has to and has asked me why I won't let her do it.  

She refuses to go to a doctor or a therapist. From looking on the Internet, it seems like these are commonly listed as the first steps of action, so I'm at a bit of a loss as to what I should do. Should I just tell her parents and work with them on it?

Thank you for your help. It's so hard to deal with this during finals week. We are both freshmen in college.

**TL;DR: my girlfriend has told me she wants to end her life but has no plans or time frame. She refuses to see a doctor/therapist and I would like advice on what to do. Thank you.**
