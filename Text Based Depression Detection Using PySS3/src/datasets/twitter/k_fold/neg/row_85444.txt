I canâ€™t take it Iâ€™m exhausted I want everything to stopIâ€™m thinking my life over and over again I tried to be good boy and always tried to listen my parents even they were wrong I was just a kid but I had no option to what I want or what can I want because these things was meaningless what was the mean my parents words. Yeah maybe this is ridiculous for you maybe not I donâ€™t care anymore this is my story Every time I try to something for me they were always be mean to me if I insist about they were get angry and even they hit me with fists so in a time I started to cut my things my inner voice I wasnâ€™t be able to myself I started to be a kid/teenager/young whatever you wanna call I became that it wasnâ€™t me it was something that they were wanted. And I became I get school they send to me they chosed my university section I did no choice they did and in the mean time in a community I always be silenced why because I lost myself I had to create another character that I had to live. Now I just make a flashback to my life and still I can just cry when Iâ€™m alone I just say Fuck what was am I
do I even remember my character thatâ€™s belong to me I just so fucked up that I canâ€™t take it Iâ€™m exhausted Iâ€™m done Iâ€™m not me I lost my soul, myself I lost So my question is if you lost your identify would you wanna still alive 
you can just fuck away the question I was realized how empty Iâ€™m and Iâ€™m not to worth to live. if you questioning if you were so empty why would you post something like that well before to end my life i just wanna fill something before I go I donâ€™t want to be completely empty or so Idn
