I told myself I'd wait until the end of the year and see if things get betterI tell everyone else that I'll 'just leave the state'.

I don't even have time to cry this week.

I really dont know if this is all worth it, and  I really doubt waiting until the end of the year is a worthwhile endevour.  I won't meet any of my goals, and I have everyone/everything.
