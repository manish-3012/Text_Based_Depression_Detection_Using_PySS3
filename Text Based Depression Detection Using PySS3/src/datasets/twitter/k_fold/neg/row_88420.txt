I need to talk. I need help.I've been depressed for 9 years now. I'm 22. I have been sitting at home since 2 years. I screwed up my exams badly. Even after clearing them last year I didn't go to college thinking that i'll get an even better score this time. Anyway, I couldn't study and I have screwed up badly. Each day I wanna die. I have made so many mistakes in life. I have no close friends. Don't tell me to get a job etc. I don't know why am I telling all this. I want my suicide to look like an accident.
