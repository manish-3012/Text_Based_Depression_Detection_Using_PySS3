Iâ€™ve lived enough lifeIn my 30s, Iâ€™ve seen and experienced it all. Iâ€™ve been depressed my whole life and normally Iâ€™m having an emotional breakdown when I think about how bleak the future looks. But these past few days itâ€™s felt different. I know there is no future for me and I have a twinge of sadness but I actually feel complete and fulfilled. Life wasnâ€™t ideal but it wasnâ€™t terrible. But itâ€™s over now and Iâ€™m okay with that.
