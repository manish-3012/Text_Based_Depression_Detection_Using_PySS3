I snooped and accidentally saw that my two best friends (roommates) hate meBackground: I have been extremely depressed the past few months. I'm in university and lately have had extreme social anxiety and paranoia to the point that I thought I was schizophrenic. This has caused me to be distant, skip classes and sleep all of the time. I have two roommates, Melanie and Alexis. Melanie is my cousin, and Alexis is her friend who moved in with us. Anyways last night they left for a class together and my cousin Melanie left her phone on the kitchen table. I never snoop or go through people's things but she got a text from Alexis calling me a cunt. I ended up looking through their conversation and found out that basically they think I'm an awful, lazy bitch. The thing is they've never confronted me or acted angry so I was really shocked to see that they'd been talking about every mistake I'd made in the last six months. I don't know what to do
