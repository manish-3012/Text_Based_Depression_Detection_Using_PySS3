Today I set a date.15th of march. If nothing gets better until then I will 100% end my suffering. I have never ever been so low that I am right now. I don't really feel worthless as many others do. I am actually quite smart, outgoing and my family loves me. I just feel like I don't fit in. I should not be on this planet, I am not made for this. I have trouble finding love, I can't get my self heard and people treat me differently. Like I am less than what they are.

I have been depressed for many years but now I am starting to become numb. I act on autopilot, work 8 hours, lay in bed for 13. On the weekends I usually go out for drinks with the few friends I have. I always get the most drunk til I can't stand or speak and when I get home, I cry myself to sleep. Everyone in my town knows me for "how I am always wasted til oblivion". No one gets me.

Why does it seem like everyone, easily can just accept who they are and love themselves? Why does everyone have so easy building relationships? Why can't I be like them? Why am I so jelous? I truly hate myself. I want to be normal, I want to fit in, I want to be respected and accepeted for who I am. Though, I am not.

It has always been like this. Though when I was little, I had goals and ambitons. I wanted to become a soccer star, an actor you name it. It all quickly changed, when I was 13 I said "when I grow up I want to be homeless". People laughed but deep down as a fucking 13 year old boy, I knew that nothing would come out of me. Im 21 years old now, still depressed. I have always made small improvements but knowing how little joy it gives me Im slowly giving up. 

This world is not for me. Thankfully there are people who are meant for this. Not for me, and if nothing magical happens within 2 months. This will probably be my last 2 months alive.

Thanks for reading.
