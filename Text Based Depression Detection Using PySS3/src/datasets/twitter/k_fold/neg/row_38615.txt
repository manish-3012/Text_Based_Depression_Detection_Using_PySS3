A note to whoever's out thereThis is it for me. I don't know how many days I have left. Not many. I'm feeling the worst I've ever felt and somehow the feeling keeps topping itself. I'm gone as a person the people I reach out to have they're own issues. The rest went be able to handle my depression. I hate that I couldn't even hold on to the one I love. She just left. Said she couldn't handle me. No matter what I do or who I talk to. It feels pointless. I'm realizing it is. I'm really sorry Mom and Dad. There's nothing left for me here. The pain is too much.
