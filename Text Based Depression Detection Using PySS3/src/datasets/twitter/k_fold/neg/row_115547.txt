I think i fucked upI'm supposed to graduate next year and I still don't know what to do with my life. Everytime my family asks me what career i'm gonna have, the answer changes, from artist, to surgeon, to musician, to military, to video game design, etc. I lost the inner artist in me, they straight up deny me of being a surgeon, can't join the military because of a past surgery that fucked me up real good, they laugh at the thought of me doing game design, and thats just to name a few. I took up guitar and that sparked some hope in me that i could be a musician, until they told me its a hobby and not a job. They think what i mean when i say musician is playing music for people in bars, clubs, and shit like that. What I mean is making music for things like video game sountracks and stuff like that. My godbrother seemed to understand what i meant when i told him i wanted a music career, he even recommended a great college. But then again, "its a hobby, not a career." I don't know why my parents can't understand. I just can't win. I'm scared of the future.
