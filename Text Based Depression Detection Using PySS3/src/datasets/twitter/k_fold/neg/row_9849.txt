i hate my personalityI feel like im very weak. I hardly talk about normal things. I only come on Reddit to moan about my problems. I haven't got the ability to even make a comment about other stuff. Or at least it feels forced. Being whiney just comes naturally to me. IRL i whine to family. I cant force myself on dates so i will never get a girlfriend. I have very few friends. I once had an outgoing personality with many friends and i had a normal if not great life. Now i feel like a total loser. I feel like there's no one i can relate to. Even other depressed people have more going for them than i do. I've never had a decent job im 27 now. I will never accomplish anything good. Im too shy to do so many things. I dont have the confidence to do projects such as starting a business. I cant even force myself to go to places by myself sometimes. I won't even have a funeral because the only person that would come is my sister. If were talking hypothetically and i die at 75. Because my friends aren't close anymore. We only made friends when i was really outgoing buy im a shadow of my former self and as a result were drifting apart. I haven't made new friends for 10 years. A girlfriend is just unfeasible. I need to change my whole self. Im overweight with very little career prospects. There's nothing about myself i can genuinely take pride in. I have no good personal qualities that i can think of. I used to be funny etc but now im quite the opposite. I get on with most people but i have no social status and im not likable enough for people to take a shine to me. Im seen as unattractive to women now. Im just not normal. I was the cool type but I've changed on the inside. It's like someone took my personality and smashed it with a sledgehammer. I will not return to normal as its been 10 years and I've hardly shown glimpses of my former self. Not many people can say they definitely won't get a girlfriend but im one of them. I  could go on and on tbh
