Preparation.Does anyone have any tips for preparation of your own death? I've already considered hard resetting my phone and my laptop to get rid of intimate data.
I also have an over draft which I'm Â£1,200 pounds into and I'm not sure whether my family will have to pay that off when I pass, which I'd rather they didn't have to do. I've already thought about method which will be by slight suspension hanging, tying a bandana in my mouth so the sight of my body won't be so gruesome with a half bitten off tongue. A note to the people I have left, and sent photos to those people I thought they might like, and I have also deleted all social media. Can anyone think of anything I've missed?
