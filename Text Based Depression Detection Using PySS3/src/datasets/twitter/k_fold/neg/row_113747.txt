How abnormal is this?Now, I'm ordinarily moderately to a bit more than moderately depressed. Probably bad enough that I should be on medication for it, but I'd rather not be.

Every now and then the depression will get really bad and I will start thinking about suicide, never really enough to get any concrete plans laid out, but I start getting urges to just go ahead and keep walking across traffic when I cross a busy highway on my way to campus. Or I'll just randomly start wondering if certain wall fixtures would be able to support my weight if I were to suspend myself from them.

I know these feelings are probably indicative that I should be on medication, but surely I can't be the only one who gets self-destructive impulses from time to time, right?
