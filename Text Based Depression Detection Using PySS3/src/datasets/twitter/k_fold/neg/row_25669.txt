I'm so tired of feeling lonely. I want to fall asleep and never wake up.I moved to a new country with my mother at an awkward age where I'm too old for school but everyone my age still hangs out with their school friends. My job sucks, everything thinks I'm happy but it's because I dont want to burden anyone with how I really feel. I have no friends here, and my old friends are moving on with their lives. My brothers and I are close, but we hardly speak and I only see them once a year. My dad left when I was 12 and I havent heard much from him since then. My mother is emotionally and verbally abusive. I just cant take it anymore. Everything feels... empty. 

I have 2 dogs that i love, but one of them is still young and is destroying my house. It causes so many arguments with my mother and has me financially strained. No matter what I do, he isnt a good dog. It's my birthday on Monday and my mother said she doesnt want to spend it with me. Another birthday on my own. I think it would all be better if I just went to sleep and didnt wake up. I cant feel like this anymore. I just want it to stop.
