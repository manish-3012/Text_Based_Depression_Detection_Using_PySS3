I blame myself for wanting to kill myself

I have a decent life, I have a roof over my head, food, clothes, Iâ€™m not being abused, but I donâ€™t want to live. I should be grateful for the life I got, many people have it worse. 
And I keep hearing all the time that I canâ€™t feel like this, because Iâ€™m a teenager and I donâ€™t know what real problems are. Itâ€™s just a phase and I will get better. But I donâ€™t want to wait, I donâ€™t care, Iâ€™ve lost all the willpower to get better and even if i would, I feel like itâ€™s not worth it. 
I feel so entitled for complaining about my life, but I just want everything to stop.
