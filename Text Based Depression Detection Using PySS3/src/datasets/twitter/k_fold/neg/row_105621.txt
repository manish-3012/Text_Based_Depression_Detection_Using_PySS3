For the first time I am contemplating just ending thingsI've been battling depression since my teens but I had never really taken to the idea of taking my life, I had never reached that point, I had been close. Until now. A recent break up has made me spiral into a state of despair I could never imagine possible. Those feelings of worthlessness I've spent nearly a decade fighting off all came back in one moment. This constant feeling of hopelessness, pain, I can't take it anymore. The one person I thought I would spend the rest of my life with, has deleted me from hers as though I meant nothing. It's ruined me. I try to put on a brave face, remind myself that eventually I will get over this and move on but that doesn't work. Nothing I do helps. A few days ago, it just came to my mind, that I would be better off dead and ever since, it's all I can think about. I even dreamt about successfully killing myself. It brings me comfort knowing I have this option available.
