18 and want to kill myself to end the torture.I am 18, Senior and Highschool and I think I'm gonna kill myself sooner. I have clinical depression, social anxiety and OCD and my life is just torture everyday, for the past 7 years of my life. People never loved me, maybe my mom and dad, but other than that since I was a child people bullied me, people use to call me a "Negro" because of my skin tone, and my half sisters and brothers didn't treat me well, I think they are still a little bit angry because I am a son from another man of their mom. I did my best for the past 6 years, I tried to improved myself, I exercise, meditate, and learn new things everyday, and do well at school and persevere a lot but even whatever I achieved I still feel empty, I usually isolate myself from my friends, because I am just too anxious, when I try to face my fear, I am left feeling sad and lonely. I love music, I am an aspiring singer songwriter, I write a lot of songs and music is just the only thing I am living for but my interest of it is fading away, I guess my depression is getting worse. And plus I live in a third world country where people, especially older adult people, stigmatise mental health disorders and even though my mom and dad wants to help me, they can't because of financial issues, and my family is just fucked up. I did well on my class this semester, but I don't feel anything about it, I think I'm just gonna end up becoming a corporate slave, working a 9/5 job that I don't give a fuck about, and live miserable, which is my worse nightmare. I just wanna kill myself honestly, I am lonely, depressed, and insecure. I feel nothing, I just want to end the suffering.
