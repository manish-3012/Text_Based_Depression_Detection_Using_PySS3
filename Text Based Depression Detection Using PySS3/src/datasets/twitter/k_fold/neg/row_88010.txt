Ruined my life; donâ€™t see the point of carrying on.A few months before I went to college in 2011, I went to a party, got really drunk and high, and woke up the next morning in bed with a girl I barely knew. I swore off drugs and alcohol afterward.

Fast forward a few months and Iâ€™m in college. Iâ€™m having a really hard time making friends because Iâ€™m a little older than most of my classmates and I donâ€™t drink or use drugs. I get really lonely and depressed and drop out after one semester.

I moved back home, got my old job at a local restaurant back, and decided to start drinking and using again. This marked the beginning of a downward spiral for me.

At first I only drank and used with friends, but as my friends grew up, started careers and families, and stopped drinking and using, I began to drink and use alone. After about a year, I was drinking alone pretty much every night. I tried to kill myself twice in the span of 5 months between 2012 and 2013, which cost me my job. I was unemployed for months and forced to sell my car because I couldnâ€™t make payments anymore. My drinking slowed down during this period, but didnâ€™t stop; as soon as I found another job, I was drinking daily again.

My mom talked me into quitting drinking for a stretch in 2014. I was sober for a few months and then after having â€œa fewâ€ drinks at my sisterâ€™s graduation party (which I undoubtedly ruined), I started drinking daily again.

The worst of it came after I became a traffic cop in 2015. The first time I presented evidence in court was against a little old lady. We were last on the docket and I spent most of the day being told that I was a piece of shit because she couldnâ€™t afford to buy food. I practically begged the prosecutor to throw out the ticket (I didnâ€™t want to be responsible for this woman starving), but she wasnâ€™t having it. My drinking went on overdrive after that. At my worst, I was drinking a bottle a day.

I lost my job back in December. Not because of my drinking (although I probably should have, I embarrassed myself in court a couple times by going in still buzzed), but because of budget cuts. I got a severance package and received unemployment benefits.

Now, here I am. 27 years old, unemployed, unable to find a job, maxed out credit cards, and behind on my bills. I think the worst part of this whole ordeal is that, now that I have been sober for a little over a week, Iâ€™m exhibiting signs of heart disease and advanced liver disease brought on by drinking.

Iâ€™m already dying. Iâ€™m might as well just finish myself off.
