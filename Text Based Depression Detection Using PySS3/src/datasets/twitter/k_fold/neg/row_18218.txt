I've disappointed everyone around me. I don't see myself living past Friday evening.My parents were so excited to see me graduate in a couple weeks, but I'm six credits short and I'm failing probably the most important class towards getting my degree.  The exam is in about 12 hours.  I've studied enough, but every time I take a CS or similar exam, I just blank out and I can't solve any of the problems.  Last time I got close to attempting suicide was last November.  For a while I was doing really well, but it's become harder for me to concentrate because of depression and gender dysphoria.  I don't want to drop out of college, but I think I have no choice.  My younger brother is prom king, and I didn't even go to prom when I was in high school.  Everybody talks about how great he is, and everything I do is disappointment after disappointment.  If I transition, it's just going to make my family associate with me even less.  My parents bought planet tickets for my grandparents to come out, cap and gown and all that, and I'm going to be the big piece of shit that let them down.  They're paying for my college, btw.  So whoop de fucking doo, they blew thousands of dollars on a fucking tranny loser.  The least I could do is kill myself tomorrow.  I figured my grandparents would be flying out for my graduation or my funeral, now I know which one it's going to be.
