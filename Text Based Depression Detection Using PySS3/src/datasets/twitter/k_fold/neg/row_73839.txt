I do just want to die but I don't know howI'm not looking to talk about suicide methods. I want to talk about not being on the same level as everyone else. 

Best way I can put it is that everyone else I know is on dry land and I'm under the water and drowning. 

I'm not where everyone else is mentally and I really don't think I'll be going back. 

I want to die but then it would hurt everyone else that's all dry. They'd have to go into the water and try to pull me out. The water I was in would touch them and stain them. 

I want to die but I don't want to hurt anyone
