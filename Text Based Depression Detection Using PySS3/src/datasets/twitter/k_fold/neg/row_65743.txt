Whatâ€™s the feeling of having the person you love, hate you?3.28am in the morning, Iâ€™m breaking down once again. Iâ€™m just going to type and rant everything out ... 

So I dated this girl which I love so much I could die for, I give her everything I have. My time, my money, my emotions and everything. And yeah everything ended after 4 months of a toxic dating but Iâ€™m still Glad it happen. I confide to my close friends about it as I really canâ€™t take it. So people in the school started to hate on her as people say she played with my feelings &amp; like she hated me for it. But some people already have bad judgement on her &amp; now the blame is on me. Why the fuck would I want people to hate her?!? I fucking love her &amp; I wish that she can always smile like she used too.
