I cant find the strengthI want to end it all, nothing to happen can change that now, but i still feel this fear in my body, everytime i touch anything to do it, i become freezing cold all of a sudden 
iits like my mind is trying to be rational and end the pain im causing to myself and others around me, but my body is not letting that happen, im not materialistic, i have no one to love and no one to love me, so i dont understand what is holding me back
