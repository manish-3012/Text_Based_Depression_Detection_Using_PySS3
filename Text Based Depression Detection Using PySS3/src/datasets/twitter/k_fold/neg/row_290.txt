I swear to god if one more person tells me to volunteer after opening up about my suicidal thoughts Iâ€™m going to shoot myself and hope they get splatteredI get it, I put on a good f*cking facade, people probably think Iâ€™m just being full of myself. I donâ€™t open up to people but the few times I have (suicide hotline, ER) I get this advice. I get it, for someone who is just down in the dumps volunteering is awesome but for someone who constantly gives their all to other people itâ€™s bullsh*t. Its like their last attempt at helping once theyâ€™ve gone through the list of things Iâ€™ve already fucking tried. Guess what, I have volunteered and I hated it it felt forced and I already have a hard time doing anything for myself so spending what little I have on more people makes me incredibly depressed.
