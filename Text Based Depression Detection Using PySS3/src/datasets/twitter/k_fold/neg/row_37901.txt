Is it normal to want to kill someone?Hey yâ€™all, Iâ€™ve been searching for an answer but keep coming across deadend shitty quora questions with to results. I have been having reoccurring obsessive thoughts of murdering this one girl in particular just because she has 5k+ followers on Instagram and is the most popular girl in my school and I constantly have to suffer In my life but she gets praise for doing literally nothing. I would never ever hurt anyone else and I just want to spread positivity but this extreme obsession makes me have an undying hatred towards all popular people. How can I help myself from having these extreme unrealistic thoughts because I truly know I would never do it but I feel awful as a human for even having these thoughts, please help me
