I go from doing okay to hating my life in split secondI am a 28 yr old female, an addict, and I have been depressed since I can remember. I had a fucked up childhood, my mom had postpartum depression, used drugs and didnâ€™t love me or my sister. My dad ridiculed us and fucked up my ego. Iâ€™m completely dysfunctional in relationships and fuck them all up. Iâ€™m a toxic, unhealthy person. I jump from relationship to relationship, I cheat on boyfriends, I sleep with guys Iâ€™ve just barely met cause I have no self-control. I base my worth on all of these external things because Iâ€™m miserable inside. If Iâ€™m doing okay for a while, and I think I can live a healthy life, my whole world just comes crashing down on me with one decision.

I hate myself and I hate my life. Iâ€™m so miserable.
