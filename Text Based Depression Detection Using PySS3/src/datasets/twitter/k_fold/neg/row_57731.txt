yeahMy girlfriend was in South Africa for 3 months and broke up with me after 2 months. She's back now and we work together and she sits 10 feet from me. My alcoholism and depression and anxiety have been getting worse for a long time now. My psych just doubled my SSRI a week ago. Feeling really weird and stressed and like reality is falling apart. Starting to consider an exit from this. I don't really care about my ex I'm so numb at this point. I just don't see something to live for.
