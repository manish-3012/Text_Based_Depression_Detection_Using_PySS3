I want it to end, but I don't. It has been the week of hell. I've been through long period of mild suicidal ideation before, but this has been different. This is what I can only describe as crashing waves of suicidality. 

It's like i'm in a canoe in the open ocean. The smallest wave tips my boat over, and hungry ghosts from the depths of the sea drag me downward with frightening speed. My body aches, I want to die so badly but I don't want to kill myself. I just want to lay down and cease to exist. I'm pressing forward but I'm getting tired.
