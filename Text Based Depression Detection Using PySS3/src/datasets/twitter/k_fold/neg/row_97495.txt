I just want a hug.I wish I didn't feel like killing myself, I really do. And I don't think I would ever really end it. Maybe if I had a gun, I dunno. I just want a hug so bad. No one loves me. I feel so misunderstood. I think about life and it depresses me. I can never fall asleep either because I think too much, so I don't go to school. That pisses my parents off and they call me a failure, and they said they're signing me out of high school next week (I'm a junior). I think I really will end it next week if they do that. It's not like I don't wanna go to school, I love learning and I wanna graduate so bad. Even my brothers hate me, especially my older brother. And my grandma favorites them over me. I don't know what I ever did. I'm so sad and I'm hiding in my room right now so no one sees me crying pathetically.

I don't know what I'm asking, I just need help, advice, something.
