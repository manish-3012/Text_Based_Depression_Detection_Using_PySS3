i dont know anymorei feel so bad about being unhappy because iâ€™m fortunate compared to a lot of people. i have friends and family. i go to school, i do sports, and overall i have a relatively â€œnormalâ€ life i guess you could say.
some days, i feel fine. all the work i have to do distracts me.
but other days, especially when iâ€™m alone, i feel so empty and unhappy. thereâ€™s just a lot of things going on (some little, some big) that all combined into the reason why i feel this way.
recently, iâ€™ve had more alone time. i keep thinking about everything thatâ€™s wrong with me and i canâ€™t stop. i contemplated self harm and i almost did it today. i keep thinking about killing myself. 
i dont know what is wrong with me.
