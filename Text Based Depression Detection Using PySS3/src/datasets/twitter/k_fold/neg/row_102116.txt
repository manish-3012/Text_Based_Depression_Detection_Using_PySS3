I've gone beyond wanting to liveIt just feels like a certainty at this point. There was already little for me in the world and there's nothing if we're going to have to keep living like this. I had my job and my friends, and that was it. My job has changed to the point I can barely function, and I can't be with my friends. Talking on Zoom takes a mental toll to the point that I leave feeling worse. I've felt like I'm preparing for death for about a month and it's getting closer. I don't know what's keeping me at this point honestly.
