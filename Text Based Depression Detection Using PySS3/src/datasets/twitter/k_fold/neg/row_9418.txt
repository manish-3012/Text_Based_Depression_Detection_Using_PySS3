Self induced coma.When i was younger i fell into a coma. The cause wasnâ€™t known but i remember playing nitendo ds all night and then having a red eye, vomiting and after that my mom found me doing an epileptic crisis.

I stayed in a coma 2 weeks. I want to try this method to commit suicide. But iâ€™m scared that now that iâ€™m older i wonâ€™t be able to trigger it. I donâ€™t think staying a whole night on my phone for example will make me do anything else than falling asleep on it.

Any suggestion ?
