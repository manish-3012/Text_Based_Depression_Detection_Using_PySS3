Don't even knowI'm considering committing suicide. I just don't have the will to continue living, simply put. I've managed to overlook the fact that it can be considered a selfish act after about a year of internal debate. All I want to receive from this post is advice. I don't have access to any guns, I can't 'hang' myself from anywhere, and I've been told numerous times from multiple people that pills don't work a lot of the time. The other other options I have are jumping from somewhere around my house directly onto my neck/head, electrocution in the bath (somehow, sounds like the 'success' rate is lowish), or just simply choking myself out with a belt on the floor. Are there any other ways I could consider before trying anything? I don't need to be convinced to not do anything to myself, I've made the decision already.
