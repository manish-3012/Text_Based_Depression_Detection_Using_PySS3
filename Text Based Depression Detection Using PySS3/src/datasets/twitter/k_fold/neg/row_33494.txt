Bleak future , no motivationIn before, I am sorry for any grammatical errors because english is not my native language ; anyway , I suppose I dont have it as hard as most of the people posting here do , but nonetheless suicide always seemed an appealing solution even for temporary problems . To be honest i am in a really beautiful relationship and have some people that i can call friends but in reality all i feel is a deep nothingness inside me , covered by shallow layers of drug and social induced oblivion . My family always provided me with the material means that I need and want and I respect them deeply for it , but they never understood me . I guess i never got to really know them and that's not the point . I just need some guidance from you folks , I dont really want to end any of this , I want to live and fight but i cant get myself to start anytime soon ... pls halp
