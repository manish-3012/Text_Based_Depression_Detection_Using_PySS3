The end of my worldI just canâ€™t take it anymore. I canâ€™t handle these restless nights with my mind racing from drugs to her to drugs again. I canâ€™t handle going to a normal job and being nice to people day in and day out. I just donâ€™t have what it takes to be cut out for this world. Some of us donâ€™t have it.
