i can't do this anymore.i'm a 14 year old girl. i have no friends at school and nobody i feel like i can talk to. i find myself daydreaming about suicide in class. everything is overwhelming and school is so stressful and knowing i'll have to go through so many fucking exams and getting a job and learning to drive overwhelms me so much. i feel like i'm stuck in limbo becuase i would do anything to escape my life right now but i don't want to hurt my family. i'm the oldest child and grandchild in both sides of the family and i don't want to traumatise them, i know how bad it hurts. i don't know what to do i'm stuck i'm stuck i'm stuck i hate being in this body i hate being in this world i hate my parents for bringing me into this world without my fucking permission and now i have to just accept living here. the world is awful. i want to take a bus to the beach one cold day and find some foggy corner nobody goes to, take heaps of sleeping pills and just let myself fall asleep and hopefully die from hypothermia or something. idk i just can't stand living here anymore
