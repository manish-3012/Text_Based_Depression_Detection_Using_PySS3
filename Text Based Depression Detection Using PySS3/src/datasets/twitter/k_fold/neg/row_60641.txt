Canâ€™t find a reason to keep goingLife has thrown not just a wrench but a toolbox full of wrenches at me. Due to my event, I now suffer from ptsd, depression, anxiety, paranoia, night terrors and get an average of about 0-3 hours of sleep a night for about 4 years now. I hear his voice. I see him sometimes. The paranoia and distrust caused me to end my marriage. That divorce left me with $18 to my name and I moved out with some friends in another state. I opened up to one woman, who was one of two roommates, who had been through something similar and we loved one another then I ended up pushing her away too and sheâ€™s since left me and is sleeping with our other roommate. Each night is horrific hearing them. My job while easy in itself is stressing me because of how poorly the other employees do. I canâ€™t handle it all. Iâ€™ve since far surpassed my threshold and now I just want to end it all. I have no will or motivation if life whatsoever. Iâ€™m a robot on autopilot. Wake up (or simply get up if I donâ€™t sleep), go to work, go home and lay down. Waiting for it all to end sometime. I donâ€™t want to kill myself because I know that will hurt my family and friends also but I want to die. I want to be hit by a car. Choke on something and die. Lose control of my car in poor conditions. Have someone rob me and end up shooting me. Iâ€™ve no will to keep going at all.
