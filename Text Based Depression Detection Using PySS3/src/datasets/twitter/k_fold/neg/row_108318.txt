A friend of mine is planning their suicide.I saw a bunch of posts on her tumblr planning out her suicide and I know she's been mentally ill for years and years but now she's getting very serious about it. Like scary serious. I told her I'm driving an hour and a half to see her tomorrow and she was surprised and thankful. I just don't know what to do or say to her when I'm there. I'm socially awkward and I am afraid that I'm not going to help her feel better. I just feel awkward and scared for her. Can anyone help guide me on what to do when I'm with her?
