Does anyone ever feel like a waste of space ?Iâ€™m bipolar 2, have severe OCD, panic disorder and major depression. Iâ€™ll go maybe three months with feeling alright and the rest of the year is spent in agony and sadness. I barely have any friends or people besides my husband who I feel actually care about me. Today I had to go get stitches for self harm at the hospital and I canâ€™t help but feeling worthless and like an honest waste of space
