Only 14I'm tired. I'm so, so tired. I don't want to get up anymore, everything feels heavy and impossible. I've been going on with this stupid facade for so long, smiling, saying everything is okay. And yet still, I've ruined my body with scars and lack of food and no sleep or too much sleep. I don't understand what the point is anymore. Getting help and therapy was supposed to help me, but I just feel so much worse. I feel stupid because I don't understand the concepts I'm being taught, I'm so sick of trying at this point. I've been sick for weeks. I have an ear infection. Everything hurts, and my arm will be bleeding soon. I'm too young for this, but this is life. Stupid, cold, indifferent, godless life, that gives a fourteen year old the means, will, and determination to end her own life. I want to rest. I want to stop fighting. I don't know why I should want to carry on.
