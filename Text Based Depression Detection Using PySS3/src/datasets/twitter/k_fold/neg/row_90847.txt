Want to die !I'm alone, and have been alone for years now.  The only girl I ever loved that "loved me back" used me and abused me a while ago.  She still haunts me.  One of my best friends died in a car accident in the midst of all of that.  I was molested by someone I still have to deal with everyday when I was young.  Almost all my other "friends" don't speak to me, and could care less about my suicidal tendencies.  I feel like I've driven them all away.  Nothing like telling her happy birthday and you miss her only to be completely ignored.  Nobody cares, and nobody will care unless I kill myself.  Then everybody will act like they miss me... when it's too late.  I just want somebody to love, but I would never love myself.  My nervousness and anxiety around people makes it almost impossible for me to make any friends, let alone find a girl to love.  The anxiety carries over to driving.  I never go anywhere because I have nobody to see and my heart races and just about every turn.  I'm 19 and have never had a job, or love - two main things everyone else seemingly has already.  I only am looking for a job at this point because it seems like something I have to do.  I am looked down upon by seemingly everybody when I tell them I'm an unemployed student.  I'm not going to kill myself, but I should.  I am tired of the pain in my chest eating away at me everyday.  I woke up before noon for the first time in a long time on the weekend and was looking forward to hearing back from the birthday girl.  I should never get my hopes up.  Guess everyone is dead to me, and I'm dead to everyone.  The suicide hotline put me on hold too which was actually kind of hilarious.  The only hope I have is that someday I get to play music as a career, but that is a long shot, and even then I'm starting to lose my love for things I used to love.  Whenever I pick up a guitar and sing, it feels like it's out of spite.  If it doesn't get better this summer (and it won't), I don't know how much longer I'll be able to take the isolation and coldness.  Thanks for reading my novel.  It's time to get out of bed and study for all the shit I have coming up next week.  Fuck me.
