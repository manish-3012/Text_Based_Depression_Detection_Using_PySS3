I'm just so tiredI've been suicidal for a little over a decade. Everyday I think about killing myself. Without fail. Obviously on good days/weeks, I hear that thought in my head and just shrug it off. But the bad days...just keep piling on and keep getting worse and worse.


I'm just tired. Tired of everything. Tired of continuing life because its "selfish" of me to end it. 


How is it selfish of me to want this pain I've been feeling for the majority of my life to stop, but not selfish of *you* to condemn me for feeling this way because *you* don't want me to die?


I can't handle this right now. ANY of this. And I just feel like everything is closing in on me. This strange feeling that my life is coming to a close soon. I try to try and let it all out, but no matter what I can only muster up a few tears. After years of suppressing emotions and tears and sadness, I think I broke myself. And I think the end is in sight.


All I ever wanted was to feel happy.
