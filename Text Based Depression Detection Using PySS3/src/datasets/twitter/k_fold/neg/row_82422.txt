So disconnected from lifeI haven't been to school in 3 days because of how bad it's been lately. Yesterday I was up at 2 30 in the morning crying on and off scared I would do something stupid but also hating myself for not being able to. My boyfriend came over after school today and as I was hugging him I kept trying to memorize the feel of his hugs and arms around me, but I felt to empty I couldn't feel anything. My arms felt hollow and I felt so disconnected from it all. I found myself wishing I had taken a sleeping pill or something so I could just pass away after he left. Just so I could preserve that moment and have my last one be a good one.
