My plan: 14-02-2018I've thought long and hard about how I will do this! 

I can't access a gun in my country, so that's out. I tried to jump off a bridge before but I chickened out at the last minute. I wouldn't know how to get my hands on drugs. I thought for a while that I would stab myself in the jugular - pain for only a few minutes, but let's be real, I wouldn't be able to go through with it. I like cutting myself, but the thought of someone finding my body with my wrists cut creeps me out. 

For weeks my plan was to buy a rope and hang myself in a tree in the park I love, but I don't know if I could do that - I'd be scared I'd jump wrong and slowly suffocate rather than breaking my neck! 

Then I realised that if I took sleeping pills, tied myself to the tree and then just waited to fall asleep and fall out, I'd hang more easily. Then I realised an even better plan: 

I will buy whatever over the counter sleeping pills I can. I will catch the last bus to the beach that I can and wait out until 2am/everyone is gone. I will then take all of the sleeping pills and start swimming. I am not a strong swimmer to start with, and I will most certainly drown when  I nod off. The darkness will make it even harder to find my way out, so I can't back out even if I change my mind! I never grew up at the beach, so it's not as meaningful as the park/my bed, but I would rather no one can find my body. 

No one will even know I died. They will notice after 3/4 weeks maybe (at least my mum will when I stop answering texts), but she doesn't know my friends or have any contact with them. 

They might think something is up when I don't come back to uni, but all in all - they'll never even know. 

"Hey do you remember jcnggd32?"
"Oh yeah, she was weird, what happened to her?" 
"I don't know. I thought she had another year of uni?" 
"She must've finally killed herself"
"Oh... hey how was your trip to South America?"
