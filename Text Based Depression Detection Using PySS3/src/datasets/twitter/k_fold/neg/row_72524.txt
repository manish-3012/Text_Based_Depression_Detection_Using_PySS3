Is life worth living?So let me preface this by saying that I rarely ever post but I'm having one of those nights where I scribble down some shit. I will post it in the way I wrote it originally in my notebook:

Life feels so pointless at times.
I think everyone has felt that way at least once.
Most people deal with it and continue on, day to day.
But the truly hurt and damaged, decide to end it all.
However they choose to do it, their mind is made up.
They want to end it all, stop the hell they are in.
Many people would say this is weak, selfish even.
But some may argue that this act is brave,
For no one really knows what happens nextâ€¦
If one is in constant misery daily for years, or decades,
Are they obligated to go on?
Suicide is so heavily looked down upon, it's even considered a crime.
But why? Nobody ever asked to be be born.
Life itself seems to be a miraculous cosmic anomaly.
So is consciousness a blessing or a curse?
