Why am I even alive?If there's a god out there, I hate you. I hate my parents too, why did you guys put me on this earth and force a miserable life on someone. I cant remember the last time I was happy, I've never had any friends in school and my family has always been terrible and has shown time and time again that they don't care, I've been a lurker on this sub for a while and I didn't think I would be posting here anytime soon but here I am. I've seen enough of the "Life gets the toughest right before the best parts." types of comments and I seriously doubt that it ever will. I'm a failure in everything I do and I feel like there is no other way. I don't think anyone will care if I die, in fact I think they'll be happy and I want to fix the mistake that my parents made.
