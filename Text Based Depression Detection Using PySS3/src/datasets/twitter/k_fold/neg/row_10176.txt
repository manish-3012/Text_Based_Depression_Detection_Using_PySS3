Need help without asking for helpHow do you ask for help without saying what Iâ€™m thinking about doing? I know Iâ€™ll get the usual response of â€œwhy would you think of thatâ€ or â€œdude youâ€™re life isnâ€™t badâ€ and I understand that itâ€™s not, compared to others I have a completely normal almost great life, but I still have these feelings quite often where I need to just do it. How do I express that to the people that know me that Iâ€™m not doing good and Iâ€™m the ledge, needing to be talked down?
