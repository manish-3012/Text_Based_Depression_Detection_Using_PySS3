My girlfriend is really the only reason Iâ€™m staying alive.So my home life is already shit and with this quarantine thing happening I have been locked in my house with my parents for 3 weeks, Iâ€™ve been depressed before this but now itâ€™s worse than ever. My girlfriend is the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet. She is always so supportive and nice to me and I miss that because I havenâ€™t been able to see her in 2 weeks, and to make it worse her family is moving to the uk when the school year ends( early June) so I donâ€™t know what I am going to do when that happens. I want to spend as much time with her as I can but my parents are strict and wonâ€™t let us see eachother anymore, I donâ€™t know how to cope with this, I just feel Iâ€™m losing a piece of who I am.+ With me being at home all day every day for the past 3 weeks I have ruined some of my best friendships and just I have no idea where my life is headed. Iâ€™m on the verge of suicide but I can bring myself to it because of my girlfriend.



Sorry if this is super hard to read I canâ€™t type very well when Iâ€™m stressed.
