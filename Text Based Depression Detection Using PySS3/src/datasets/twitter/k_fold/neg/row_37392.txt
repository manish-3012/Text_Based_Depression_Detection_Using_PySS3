My brother just nearly walked in on me going through the gun safeI've had a long shitty life that I really don't wanna go into right now. TL;DR version is that I'm 21, live with my parents, grew up poor, living even poorer now. Never really felt wanted or loved by my alcoholic father or mentally absent mother, grew up getting beaten up (and, once puberty hit, sexually abused) my by older brother, who now is just a manipulative sociopath who starts conflict just for the sake of entertainment, constantly stealing money, alcohol, and drugs from me, sometimes just to start something then put it back after I try to talk to my dad about it. (God, I wish he did that with my last paycheck... I had to make it through the month on just $100 already and he stole half of that...)

Given that it's Christmas and we're going through bankruptcy, it's a shitty fucking Christmas this year. Morale is already at an all-time low and my brother is pulling his usual shit of trying to start fights, pitting myself and my already-upset-and-crying mother in his usual Them against Us bullshit, teaming up with my dad to let us know on no uncertain terms that we don't deserve to be treated like human beings

I think he heard me in the gunsafe from the shower

I knew it was stupid to go there with him directly above me upstairs, but all I've been able to think for weeks is how happy they'd be if, for Christmas, I gave them that gift. After all, without me, everything would be better, right? You blame all the bad in your lives on me, anyway

Here's hoping I can tell the real guns from the BB guns ðŸ»
