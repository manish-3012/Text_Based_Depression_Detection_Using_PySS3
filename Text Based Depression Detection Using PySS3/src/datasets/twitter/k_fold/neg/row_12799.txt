So all of my friends think Iâ€™m faking. Iâ€™m starting to believe it.I burnt all my bridges the night I planned to commit suicide. I failed, obviously, before I could even get to my designated location I was spotted by a cop. It was so unlucky/lucky. I donâ€™t really know how to feel about it. Anyways I spent the night in the hospital then another in the mental clinic. After I got out I called my friends and apologize. Only two answered and they said that Iâ€™m just trying to play the victim and doing all of this for attention. They donâ€™t know what happened that night and wasnâ€™t planning to tell them cause I feel like they will only accuse me more. I want to repair my friendships and just being without their support is sending me spiraling every day. I ended up going back to the mental clinic and got prescribed mood stabilizers. But being back there again I felt like I was only doing this for the attention. That I am just blowing everything out of preposition as way to get attention. I want to explain to them what happened but without bringing up the attempt or the hospital or pills. But I donâ€™t know how. Anyways Iâ€™m starting pills tonight so wish me luck.
