I think my wife is killing herself tonightThis is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. My wife (33) has been suicidal for most of her life (her first attempt was at 8 years old). She told me when I first met her almost 8 years ago that she didn't plan to live very long, and knowing that full well I chose to be with her anyway. At that time she said she was waiting until her beloved dog passed away (she was already like 15 at that time) because she (my wife) didn't want to leave her elderly dog alone without her. Well that day came and went, it was a hard time but she was able to pull though, mostly for me. Well her mental disorders have been getting way worse. She had OCD and Anxiety so bad that she has not been able to sit in a chair for over three years (she has to always be standing or laying down). Well about two weeks ago her disorders took her ability to sleep, so she has not gotten more than 2 hours of sleep a night. She has hated living for so long now. She tells me that she is only staying alive for me, and if it wasn't for me, she would have killed herself a long time ago.  And yes, she has been getting treatment, she's been seeing a therapist and doctors for years and taking all the meds they give her and doing all the things they tell her, but nothing has helped at all.

Ever since I've known her she has had a "kit" containing supplies to do the job. She says it makes her feel better to know that it's there if she needs it.

Today is the anniversary of her mothers death (8 years ago). She told me that she can't do this anymore, this world is too hard for her. I already knew that, I have been expecting this for a long time. I held her, and we cried together for hours, she told me how sorry she was, and I told her how much I love her and will always love her.

&amp;#x200B;

 She drove away and I didn't stop her.

I wanted to stop her, I wanted to hide her car keys, or throw away her kit. But I love her, and I see every day how miserable she is. She is in 24/7 pain, both physically and mentally. If I stopped her, it would be only because I am selfish and want her to stay here for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am praying so hard that she changes her mind and I get even one more day with her, but I don't know if that will happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel so dead inside right now, I love her, so I don't want to ever be away from her, but I also love her, so I don't want her to suffer anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't expect anyone to read this, and it may get deleted but I needed to tell someone, I can't tell anyone else.

TLDR: My wife has been suffering so long that every moment of her life is misery. I could have stopped her but I didn't, so she drove away, with the tools she needs to end her life. I hope she comes back, but I also hope she finds peace.
