lostitâ€™s 4am on a Friday and i just sat on the roof freezing and sobbing for 20 minutes, trying to gain the courage to jump. a week ago, something happened with a â€œclose friendâ€ of mine(really, my ex girlfriend who i still have feelings for and i thought vice versa) that just...shattered everything inside me(not a breakup, we broke up in may). my heart completely broke and along with it, my world did too. im just a shell now. ive cried every night since, had suicidal thoughts constantly, done some really questionable things, my urges to self harm are back after so long of being able to resist them, and i just. whenever im not feeling that suffocating pain in my chest, im empty. nothing brings me joy anymore, i donâ€™t like doing any of the things i used to. i wanna overdose on hard drugs, i wanna jump off my roof, i wanna starve myself, want to hang myself as well. i feel like ive lost everything inside me. like ill be broken forever. if not forever, then for a really long time. and i donâ€™t even...see a reason to go on anymore. im so fucking depressed. the only thing i wish for is the courage to end it.
