Feeling like ending my life, afraid of failingA bit about me: 23 y F, I've suffered from social anxiety my whole life which made it extremely difficult to make any real friends. When I entered university I saw everyone around me finding their place while I was spending every day skipping class to cry for hours until I finally lost my mind an tried to kill myself with a bottle of sertraline and a bottle of jager. I wish it had worked.

My boyfriend was the first person in the world who has truly cared about me. We were together for 4 years and I know I never would have made it past that first suicide attempt without him. He was the only link keeping my from being completely isolated from the outside world. The only thing keeping me alive. 

This April he moved away for the summer and within days I spiraled into an uncontrollable depressive state. And then he dumped me.

Now I'm alone with no friends or family to talk to or seek support from. 

I was working in customer service with the TTC and I was forced to watched all these subways go by every 5 minutes for 10 hours a day and I started feeling like if I didn't quit I would throw myself in front of a train. It would be so easy.

Even though I quit,the idea is still in my head and I can't shake it. When the pain is so bad that i can't eat or leave my house without crying, how can i go on?
