Not sure if the dreams are worse than how I feel when Iâ€™m awake. Done with it all.Iâ€™ve never written a post before on Reddit, but I am so sick of living. Im 29, I have no job, no money, nobody left who I can really talk to, and I keep having dreams about my ex. I miss her more than anything, but she is happily with someone else now. We dated for 5+ years and I was a shit partner in the relationship. Only after we broke did it hit me that she was everything that mattered to me and I could have easily made the relationship work if I cared more then. Sheâ€™s gone, and I canâ€™t get over her. Even when I try to move on, I end up having dreams about her that leave me waking up knowing that I lost everything that mattered. She is always so great in the dreams, even when she isnâ€™t. Sometimes she is even with her new partner, but I still find myself being friendly in hopes that she will come back to me. But these are more like nightmares when I wake up. Iâ€™m left laying in bed with a sick feeling inside me all day, all week, all the time, I hate it. I hate living. Sure my family would be sad, and Iâ€™d be seen as selfish for killing myself. So am I supposed to be the sad one and live like this just to keep them happy? I donâ€™t care anymore, i feel like a corpse already. My anxiety and depression keep me from applying for jobs and busying myself. I could go on and on, but then Iâ€™d just be complaining too much. I just want to die and will likely make it that way soon.
