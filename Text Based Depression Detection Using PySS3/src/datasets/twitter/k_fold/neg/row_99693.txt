I don't know anymoreI feel nothing anymore. I'll never be nothing and I feel dead inside. Why not just do it without making a damn thread in the hopes of someone who might actually care when reality is? No one is there to catch you when you fall. I'm done. Final goodbye's? Fuck it. I'm not worth the time.
