Been thinking about "it" all week.Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

One year ago, I suffered what I consider to be the worst emotional injury of my life.  A girl was involved.

I thought that one year was enough to get past this, but now I think I was wrong.

What I don't understand about this issue is that sometimes, I'm okay.  I think "man that was pretty bad, but it doesn't seem so bad now" and everything is fine.  Then, a few days later (like today) I'm putting together plans to hurt myself.

What is most interesting is that I can be in the middle of raging silently and laying out all kinds of plans for revenge or hurting myself (or whatever else you might expect), but as soon as I decided "I'll send an email / make a phone call / meet with someone" the rage disappears.  The catch here is I'm only okay up until I send that email / make that phone call / meet that person.  Once the actual event is done, I immediately go back to feeling like roadkill.

I don't know what this means.  It doesn't really correlate to anything other than making the decision to communicate somehow.

That's not the main issue, however; I am (still) in a situation that makes me feel as though I have to choose between friends.  I feel as though I was very unfairly treated, wrongfully blamed, a victim of a double-standard, and now expected to "just deal".  That's not how my mind wants to handle things at all, and man, it's getting dark in here.

I would like someone to PM me if possible... I don't like the idea of barfing the entire story out to thousands of people just yet.  It's hard to talk about.
