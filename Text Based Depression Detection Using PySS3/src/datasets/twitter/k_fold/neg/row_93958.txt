I just can't do it anymoreTo my family I am sorry. I love you all so very much. 

I just don't want to live anymore. I know I said I was better, I know I  said I went to get help but it is all a lie. I am not better, I never will be. I don't even remember what its like to feel happy anymore or what its like to want to live. I have spent so much time trying to put on a happy face but I just can't do it anymore. Life keeps throwing such devastating curve balls at me one after another and I think its time I just let go. 

Goodbye.
