Well, it's not like this was ever going to not happenI'm going to kill myself, and I was always going to. I can't not. I can only do this because that is what was always going to happen. I'm tired of fighting a pointless war, and I've come to terms with my efforts having been in vain. I've accepted leaving my loved ones and am ready to move on. I've got about 50 extra strength Tylenol and am just waiting for the perfect time to take them. Gonna gag myself afterwards incase I throw it up. I'll choke on my own vomit if I have to. So long as I go to sleep and then never wake up. So long, folks.
