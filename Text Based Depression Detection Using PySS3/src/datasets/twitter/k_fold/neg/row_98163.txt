I'm fucking terrified of growing up.In about a month I will be 17. I have been dealing with my depression my whole life. Probably the number one thought I have on a daily basis is to kill myself. I'm such an outcast from society, I just can't stop thinking about all the fun things I missed growing up. I have no friends, was never accepted anywhere. But every year, even though I felt this way, I always hoped things would be different next year and I would be happy. A couple weeks ago, reality hit me like a brick. I'll never be able to relive the things that make childhood fun and I won't change next year. I'll never change. I'm just not ready to grow up. The thought that when I'm 18, I'll be an adult, I'll have to move out and fully support myself. Its just terrifying to know that I will be completely alone. I don't know what to do. I just don't see a point in living anymore if I'm just going to constantly suffer for the rest of it.
