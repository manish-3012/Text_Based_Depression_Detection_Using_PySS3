this is my titleso honestly i debated even posting here for a while. i rlly dont need someone calling a fucking ambulance to my house but here goes. yeah im suicidal have been for years i grew up in a shitty home and now that im outta that situation im still facing the everyday battle of moving on from that. never rlly had too many friends but  the ones i did have were kinda shitty i got 2 good ones now but there scarce in general, im a transgender that might be some of the reason for my depression. never truly being able to love yourself. family is scarce as well my grandmother is trying her best but i can feel her getting more jaded the more shes around me, im not religious at all i cant force myself to believe something that is so obviously false. ive tried therapy for 5-6 years (obligatory my opinion) therapy in the city is fucking cancer. i tried online therapy but apparently i got too close to my therapist not in like a creepy way just as friends, but that was too much. i have ptsd from past traumatic experiences with my parents, relationship wise i havent been as lucky ive been cheated on beaten almost raped multiple times. i would open up and talk about this to my friends, but theyre guys they just dont understand. girls dont like to talk to me. i think its because i may be trans but i still like girls so that may be quite creepy at times to other people, this is just the tip of the iceberg but im tired of typing. evrything is just numb these days. i lash out at the only people trying to help me and feel shitty about it later. im so down on myself. even when i try not to. i honestly just want someone to hold me. i want to cry but that just doesnt happen anymore
