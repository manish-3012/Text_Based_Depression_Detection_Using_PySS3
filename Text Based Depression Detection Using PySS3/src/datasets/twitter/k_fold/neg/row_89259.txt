Giving up on everything, i want to end my lifeEverything started with my family. When I went to middle school my only sister left the country for her boyfriend (she left 10 years ago, when i was only 11). By the way i have 4 more siblings that left our home earlier. I've never had a support by me, everything by my own. 

I have lost contact with a friend that got fired (the same job) because of alcohol. I called him many times but he didn't call back. We actually have met few times before he stopped responding to me. The last thing he said was:
"i will call you if i dont forget it" - it was 3 months ago,  he just stabbed my knife, i did so much for him.
 I don't know what to do. I miss him so much, we had so many moments. I dont believe that he doesn't give a damn about me.

I've been drinking alot and actually trying marijuana to get rid off all the problems: family, work, stress, no time to do anything.
Now im feeling f****ng empty inside. dont really know what to do.

Friends? No thanks. (i deciline every person who wants to be on my "friends" list. I dont know how to talk to strangers.

Online games and alcohol make forget all the troubles.

I've benn feeling suicidal, want to hang myself to end my pain. No one will understand that. I have to hope, no friends, no future.

Just giving up on everying

(hanging myself is my solution ;/
