ConflictedSo...

I have been depressed for over 5 years now, having my better times aswell as worse and feel like everything is falling apart. Under this long period i've start to poses a darker humor, less sympathy, and alot of self hate. While some people's first thought in the morning may be how tired they are, i can't get suicide thoughts out of my head and always keeps thinking about the easiest and less painful way to kill myself.

These suicide thoughts have existed in me atleast about 4 years and it hurts me. Later year on my depression (around late 2019) things started to clear up and i actually started to feel quite better. But now i've lost it all. Lost my hapiness, friends, comfortable envoirnment and my will to live. It's hard to points fingers to what makes me more sad. My social anxiety? my appearence? my personality traits? 

For people telling me i should search for help. I don't think that would do much. Although i think people working on preventing suicidial persons do a great job, it wouldn't feel genuine to me. People who's work is to care about others and say encouraging things just doesn't feel right to me.

I'm not expecting much here. Just wanted to write it..
