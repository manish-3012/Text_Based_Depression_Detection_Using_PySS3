did my friend try to kill herselfi don't know whats happened and I'm very confused. i've liked this girl for ages but thats irrelevant cause i care about her so much, so this isn't about that. however i know she overdosed on tranquillisers and ended up in hospital. does this happen accidentally.. or did she definitely try to kill herself. i try to help her and she brushes it off as if she's fine etc. I'm worried. that's my main question. if you overdose, its an attempt to commit isn't it. this doesn't just happen accidentally?
