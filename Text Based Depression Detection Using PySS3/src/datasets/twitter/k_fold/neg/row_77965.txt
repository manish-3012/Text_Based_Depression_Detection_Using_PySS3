I just don't get it...I'm a 30 year old dude. Work in technology, make good money, live in a nice apartment with a girlfriend who says she loves me. Yet, with every new day, all I can think about are my regrets in life and the myriad of ways I disappoint people. This consumes me.

The probability of throwing myself in front of the train I take to work grows every day and, like the train, I can't stop it. Therapy and exercise help a little bit but it feels like such an inevitable end. Sooner or later, I'm just going to throw myself in front of that fucking train so I don't have to feel like such a disappointment anymore.

Rationally, I shouldn't feel this way but it just consumes my every thought recently. Has anyone else felt this way? How'd you get through?
