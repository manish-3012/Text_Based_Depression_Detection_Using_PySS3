21 Year Old Moocher, Can't See Any Way OutI'm 21 and I still live at home.

I wasted four years of my life by not going to college and by not learning to drive. I've burdened my grandparents for twenty one whole years. They insist that they want to just take care of me until they can't anymore. But to me that's disgusting on my part, if not me being abusive to them. I've mooched off them since I was able to start driving. I should have done it right away. Now I see teenage co-workers with cars and keys, giving me condescending smiles. They act like they're all better than me because I don't have one. But in away, they are.
