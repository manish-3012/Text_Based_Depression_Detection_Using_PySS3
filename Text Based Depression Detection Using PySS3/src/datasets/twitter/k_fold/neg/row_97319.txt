It's hard coming up with reasons, at this pointI've posted to the subreddit in the past and, each time I've done so, it's been through tears. Today, I'm posting because I can't think of anything else to do.

In case you couldn't guess from the name of my account or didn't check through my post history, I am a trans girl who's, well...pre-everything. I unfortunately haven't started T-blockers or estrogen therapy.

Now, this is gonna be a bit rambly because I don'y really know where to start, but really I'm just looking for the best sort of reason to not kill myself. This isn't a "what's my purpose in life" type of question, it's a "what's the point' type of question?

I feel relatively worthless. I was in the top 10% in high school and got multiple full rides to good universities due to my grades and SAT/ACT scores, but I've flunked out of college twice in the last two years because I have difficulty forcing myself out of my room. I'm completely financially dependent on my parents because the thought of working makes me sick to my stomach, and my parents don't want me taking hormone therapy, hence why I haven't begun.

Thus far, I haven't killed myself because I don't want to bring that sort of pain on my friends and family, because I know they still care for me. At this point, though, I suppose I'm becoming more selfish, because I'm really tired of keeping myself alive for other people's benefit, and I can't think of any reason to do so for me.

If I start working to pay my way through HRT and school, I'll be miserable and my schedule will be full and I'll just be even more worn out than I am now. If I take loans to return to school then I'll just be a walking shell of a person because I wouldn't be able to pay for HRT and the debt afterwards would weigh on me more than my current guilt is. Even if everything works out and I return to school, get a job I enjoy, and transition properly, I'll still be considered a freak by 90% of society.

So what reason do I have to keep going, at this point? Seriously, give me something - anything. What's the reason to continue living if that life is just going to be shit from here on out? Why not just save myself the trouble?
