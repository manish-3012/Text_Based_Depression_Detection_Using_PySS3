Iâ€™ve never felt so close to the edgeIâ€™m 32 and have battled suicidal depression for years, but Iâ€™ve never felt this close to the edge so to speak. I always had something still helping me hold on or to live for. A reason to fight the battle. But now it feels different. Like all the fights gone. Iâ€™m 100 percent disassociated from everyone. I donâ€™t feel present. Iâ€™ll always continue in this same struggle so thereâ€™s just no point in continuing to keep the battle up if the end result is always the same. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™ve come into some kind of acceptance that I just wasnâ€™t made for this life. Iâ€™m going between feeling a haunting peace between that acceptance and a pain that even Iâ€™ve never known because I lost the battle.
