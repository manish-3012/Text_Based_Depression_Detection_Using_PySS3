Why do I continue?Everyday is a slog. I'm always wearing a facade and a mask. I can never speak or express myself. I never do anything. I work a job I hate. I was too stupid for uni. I have no friends. I hate myself more than anything or anyone. No one cares about me and only speaks to me when they want something. Why do I bother to wake up each morning? Guess it's because, I'm too much of a coward, to take that final step.
