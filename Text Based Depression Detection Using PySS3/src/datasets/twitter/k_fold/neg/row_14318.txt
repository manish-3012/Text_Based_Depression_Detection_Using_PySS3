I used to be a kind, happy, brilliant kid with his whole life ahead of him.My mental illness kicked in around puberty and it ruined my life. Even if I could change my life around I don't enjoy living it. My teenage years and early 20's were a compilation of  panic attacks and disappointing looks from my parents. The worst part of my illness is that it turned me into such a terrible person full of hate and jealousy. I hate regular people for living a regular, happy life and I hate myself for corroding into someone so pitiful. I'd rather die than continue to degrade into something even more abominable.
