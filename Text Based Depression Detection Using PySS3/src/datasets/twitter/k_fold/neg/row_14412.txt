That feeling when you're currently in the ER due to suicidal attempt and YOUR COUSIN'S FAMILY WALKS BY AND SEES YOU ðŸ¤¦â€â™€ï¸Why the fuck did they have to be here today? THEY LITERALLY CAME HERE TODAY TOO.

I didn't know what to say so I just went "dunno, feel bad" when having IV pouring into me and cables n stuff in me monitoring me.

Fuck me.
