Letâ€™s try this again.     My name is not important. My struggle is not important. Iâ€™m finally done. Iâ€™m at the end of my thread. I have been in and out of jail since I was 14 and been placed into two different long term stay facilities due to suicide attempts. Iâ€™m done trying and failing. Recently I have gotten a new car for myself. Itâ€™s a 2001 Cadillac DTS. All I need to know is if it is capable of emitting the right amount of CO that I need. Another issue Iâ€™m having is that I donâ€™t have a garage. I thought about using a friends garage but I canâ€™t do that. I wouldnâ€™t want to risk their health or traumatize them. Please donâ€™t â€œgive me adviceâ€ or try to â€œtalk me out of itâ€. Iâ€™m not here for that. I just want answers. I would post it to some sort of mechanic thread if I knew it wouldnâ€™t get removed immediately. Again please. The least you could do is help me pass peacefully instead of giving me your 2 cents.
