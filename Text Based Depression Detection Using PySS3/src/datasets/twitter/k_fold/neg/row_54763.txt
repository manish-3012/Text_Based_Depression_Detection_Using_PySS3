I don't knowI don't want to die, but how can I keep on living? I can't seek help without being disqualified from future employment, which would make it impossible to ever pay back my student loans. I hate my life currently and I only see one way out. I don't know what to do even my dog knows somethings wrong which makes me feel worse.
