Trying to find the courage to kill myself.I hate when these are long-winded and full of shit, so I'll TRY to be brief. I feel like I owe it to the world to end my own life. It's not just when I am in a depressed state (though this is often), as no matter how things are going and how I feel, I know that killing myself is the right thing to do. My family and what remains of my friends don't care much for me, I waste all I am given and don't see a bright future. I'm miserable most of the time and I pretty much hate every aspect of my life, and when you add that to the fact that I am a burden on the world, suicide seems like my duty. I hurt myself sometimes but it's just for my own pain. I'm still here and still a piece of shit, making the world a worse place every day. Like the title says, I'm just working on reaching somewhere in my little pussy-ass self for the courage to take my own life and leave this poor planet alone. I dunno if this post is really in the spirit of this subreddit. Fuck it.
