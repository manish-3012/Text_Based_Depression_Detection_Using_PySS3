Is it abnormal to feel like lack of sex is going to be the last straw?I have other problems; real ones, but feeling trapped in an unfulfilling marriage is the one that's worse. I should be happy, but I just am not. I'd rather just pull the trigger and leave it all than try to... what? Start over? Cheat? Would that be better than leaving a grieving family?

I don't have the option of leaving, divorce, being alone, I'll not survive. I consider it though, maybe I'll be easier to forget about if I'm the villain in all this. I don't care what people think or will.

Feeling like sex is a stupid thing to put importance on only makes me loathe myself more, and just want to be forgotten.
