I want to make more friends.. But do i even deserve them?Do i even deserve any kind of love and care? I feel like i don't, the only thing i deserve is a gun to the head. If i were to make friends, i would just anger them and sadden them when i finally did kill myself.

I want to die, i want to die so fucking badly, but why can't i do it? I don't know, if i wanted to i would just do it right now, but why can't i? No one would notice or even care.. What's the point? I'm just making everyone around me more angry and frustrated.
I don't deserve to live, i deserve a noose around my neck, that's what i deserve.
