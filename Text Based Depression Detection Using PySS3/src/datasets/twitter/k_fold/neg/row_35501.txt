Mind Clear, Final realizationI realized this morning that I have made huge mistakes in my life and they are going to mean the lose of everything that I have worked for the past 20 years. I can't face the fact that I'm going to have start from square 1 at almost 50 years old. I can't bear thinking about losing the respect and love of my wife, she is the only thing I have in my life that is good, but its not enough.

I am sorry but I don't have the strength or will to face another 20 years trying to dig myself out of the hole I created with poor decisions. I just want the fear, shame and pain to end.
