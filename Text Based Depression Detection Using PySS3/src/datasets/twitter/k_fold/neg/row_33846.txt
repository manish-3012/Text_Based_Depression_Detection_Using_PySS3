I know I need immediate help but I have to workI have a car payment to make by sunday and I have $28 and im working doubles at my job all weekend to pay for it and I know I need to go home and get serious mental help because i think about killing myself all day everyday even on medication and i have the notes written out and everything and im scared to even drive my car anymore which has never happened but i cant go home and get help because i just did last month and now its getting worse again like WAY worse but i cant call into work because theyll fire me and im sick of this constant fucking cycle.
