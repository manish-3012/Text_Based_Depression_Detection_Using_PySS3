Hearing about a suicide makes me suicidal.... I don't know how to stop it.I'm only 20 and I've been depressed for half my life. The odd part is that I didn't realize that I was depressed, I just thought I was weird and crazy. Growing up, I have always been the "brave" one and the strong daredevil type. Everyone thinks I'm cool for it and calls me brave, but what they don't realize is that I really just didn't care what happened to me. I would risk my life because I did not desire to live, and hey, why not go out doing something everyone wanted me to? At least that was my thinking.  
But  I've tried to kill myself before... multiple times. I know, I should have talked to someone... that's what everyone says. But sometimes it hurts more to talk.. I tried to get help before, and for a short while I was doing ok. But something changed..

Now... when I hear of a suicide, or someone even mentions the word, the desire comes over me. The pull is so strong that I will zone out thinking about it with overwhelming intensity. It stays on my mind even when I try to force myself to think on other things. It feels as though the thought is a untamed beast in my mind who is called forth by the mention of its name... I don't know how to fight it.. I've tried to be strong, but  a strong warrior today can fall tomorrow.
