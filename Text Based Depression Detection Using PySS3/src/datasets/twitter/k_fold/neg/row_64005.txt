Whenever I think of ending it...I think the worst part is when i think about why i shouldnt. I would waste people's time and energy just to come to a funeral for some kid they dont care about. Cost of disposing my body, reputation of my family is soiled (they care more about reputation rather than the person harmed.)

I want to do it, but i will only be trouble for them even after death.
