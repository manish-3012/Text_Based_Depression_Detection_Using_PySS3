I'm depressed and can't tell anyone, especially my girlfriendShe is honestly the best thing that has happened to me. I've had so many failed relationships and this one finally worked out for me. We've been dating a year and a half now and it's great. Except that I am depressed and I've told her how I feel and now she dosent want to hear anymore, I did it for a long time (6ish months) and I understand why she can't do it anymore. I pretend to be happy but really it's just dull. I have no friends, no social life. I make her mad all the time, we fight every 3-5 days and it's almost always my fault. I've tried everything and I just want to be normal. Otherwise I can't be a burden on everyone anymore
