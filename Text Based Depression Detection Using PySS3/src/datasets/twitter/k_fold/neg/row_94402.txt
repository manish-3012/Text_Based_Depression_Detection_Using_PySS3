This is actually the first time in a while that I'm letting anyone know my true feelings about my life. I do not want to be here anymore. Every day feels like a fucking shithole, remembering old friends and bad memories. It just makes me want to cry on how I hurt my acquaintances at my school (harassing a girl I know that she used to like me, her friends hating me because of that - I apologized to her but IDFK anymore if she really accepted my apology or fucking told me to fuck off based on her bodil/facial expressions and online). I hurt my parents to the point where my sister doesn't want to forgive me anymore. I told lies to a lot of my close friends in my fucking delusions that they were fucking abusive and hurt me when I was the one being abusive. I hurt so many people and made so many enemies this past year where some of my friends are annoyed that I want pity (sadly true) and idk now if my closest best friends are annoyed of me ranting about my parents. One of my online friends believe my lies, but I don't know at this point anymore how to tell the truth anymore about my parents to him without him getting mad and telling me to fuck off (he said before that if anyone messes with him really badly he's pretty much gonna tell them to fuck off. Another one of my friends have left me because of my rants and how it fucking drained him. IMAGINE how he's gonna react when he finds out. I've done so many things now that hurt my friends a lot to where some don't want to be friends anymore. It's FUCKING PAINFUL TO LIVE WITH THIS FUCKING GUILT AND TO LIVE WITH THE FACT THAT I HURT MY PARENTS EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE TREATED ME SO WELL AND MY FRIENDS TO THE POINT THEY PROBABLY HATE ME.

In my fucking rage I also managed to become a bum, taking easier classes and becoming a lot lazier in life to the point where I don't know if I can get into any good college at this point (grades are ok at least so thats ok).. I just want to fucking run away from my shithole that (I have to admit) I've fucking created myself.

Most of you will say that it isn't true, but I've admitted to the fact that I have Narcissitic Personality Disorder, even though I'm not technically old enough to be diagnosed (under 18) and haven't been diagnosed to my psychologist because 1. that age thing, and 2. I probably lied to him about myself. IT WASN'T ME BEING ANXIOUS AND AN INTROVERT BUT IM JUST A FUCKING NARCISSIST (I WANT TO SAY COVERT BUT IN REALITY ITS PROBABLY OVERT ANYWAY). You all know how narcissists like Ellen and abusive boyfriends are, well, fucking abusive because of their narcissistic delusions. I would probably turn out to be the same. I think it's best to end it all for me at this point to save all the pain that others would feeel and be inflicted upon based on my narcissistic traits. I just want to end my life. ITS A PAIN TO FUCKING LIVE WITH THIS GUILT. I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO MY FRIENDS BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY WILL FEEL AND IF IT GOES WRONG, FML.

I know that you guys are probably gonna say that im just avoiding all responsibility to clean up my shit, and you are right. I can't live with this anymore. I just feel so bad at times. I CANT DEAL WITH THIS ANYMORE. FUCK MY FUCKING LIFE. I, AS A NARCISSIST, DON'T DESERVE TO LIVE. IF SOMEBODY COULD END IT ALL I WOULD FINALLY BE PEACEFUL.
