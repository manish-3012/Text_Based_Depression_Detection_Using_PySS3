Why should I love myself if my mother can't?I moved out 2 months ago and my mother never reached out to me. I wasn't disrespectful or rude to her but fed up with her behaviour when I realized, she just doesn't care about us. Me, my sister and her daughter.
Now she is moving out, to one tiny city and doesn't care if we would visit her or not.
It is killing me slowly, my self esteem worst than ever. I've started my therapy sessions but I have these days when I don't have anything to do, without money or lover and I'm just thinking.

I won't try it again, I always started the conversations and I only got back some half ass answers.

When I talked about my suicidal thoughts and depression, tried to tell her how hurt I am because she doesn't try to talk to me, she told me not to hurt her.

My father died when I was 14 but after the divorce, age of 8, he disappeared. Now the only thing what I feel is loneliness and I miss the parental love. 

It could be worse but it could be better either. I'm almost all alone and I don't know if I wanna survive.
