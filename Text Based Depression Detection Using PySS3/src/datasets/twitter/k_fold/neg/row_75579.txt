It feels so serene knowing I wonâ€™t be alive by the end of next yearIâ€™ve always been planning to kill myself. Usually I pussy out or get lazy and canâ€™t be bothered. No longer. Iâ€™ve finally found the resolve to hang myself and it feels incredible. Iâ€™ve been thinking of a good date. My birthday? You know, to make my age exact. Maybe April 1st, seeing as everyone thinks of me as some walking joke anyway. 

Maybe even this christmas. Itâ€™s unlikely, but possible. Maybe Iâ€™ll hang with the mistletoe. Maybe Iâ€™ll jump in front of a train and leave some shit stains. 

Too long my â€œlovedâ€ ones have suffered my verbal abuse. I wonâ€™t let it happen anymore. My boyfriend, my friends, my parent (fuck you â€œdadâ€). Nobody will be forced to hang around me anymore.

Nobody will be tired after talking to me, nobody will feel like trash about themselves after talking to me. Not anymore. 

Finally, I can liberate these pour souls of the cancer that is me. 

Bye bye.
