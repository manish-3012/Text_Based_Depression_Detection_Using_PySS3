I feel like such a failure I just want to end it? I've suffered from  severe anxiety for 1/4 of my life . I have been so half assessed about everything  allowing   
 my procrastination to ruin grades I could of  easily obtained with enough effort. My education is crap could be worse but its bad. There's nothing to my CV but shitty grades turning 22 this year i'm such a pathetic loser.  I've never dated let alone allow kissed a girl. Currently studying for a  Computer Science  degree couldn't even  get through the year without messing up on a few modules .
