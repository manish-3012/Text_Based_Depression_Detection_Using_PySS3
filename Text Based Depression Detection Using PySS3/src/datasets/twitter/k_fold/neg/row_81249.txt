I want to stop feeling suicidal, I'm never sure if I'm in a bad spot and ignoring reality, or being dramatic and should be patientHere goes, I'd hate a wall of text if I were you reading this so I'll do bullet points

- had sleep dysfunction my entire life, as a child even pretty badly, just would not sleep at night 

- got told i was ADHD in university

- got out in the working world and office life / cubicle syndrome hit me hard, thoughts began to get really wonky, anxiety and depression ramped up, manic &amp; depressive episodes

- pressure of being the youngest in a traditional family. friends all doing better than me, stable successful careers, feel so behind. 

- see things getting worse, not getting better. one psych said OCD, another said schizotypal. medications didnt work. have good peaks and bad peaks.

- ok this is a big one, but I've lost my mental agility or something, all the time, with almost everyone from close friends to family, i feel like everything is in double speak, attacking me, threating me, calling me gay, or weird, or judgement, from very low self esteem or confidence im assuming

- feel like i cant hold down a job, need to make money somehow. 

- feel like a loser and failure, i smoke a lot of pot and ciggarettes, i feel ciggarettes are slowly killing and suffocating me, its like a slow suicide. I chain smoke often when i get out because its so cold. 

- I generally rarely feel healthy, i throw up after i eat often, im very skinny and frail, i'm always using the bathroom, coughing and sputtering, feel lethargic / borderline sick. 

- everything has felt boring for the past long time, not that i'm too prooud to ask for help but i know theres only so much others can do, but im still failing, and i wouldent want me around, i feel like a burden. 

- i feel like a shitty role model to my nieces and nephews, genuinely feel like a leper in my own family, being the youngest of 8 who are all accomplished and much older and my parents im constantly critisiced i feel or/and ive just internalized it so much over these years 

- dont feel hopeful, feel like i'm sliding down, and all my ideas are half baked plots to get rich, or practical matters that i'm just too lazy to follow through on. 

but I dont want to be suicidal, but is it really worth living a life thats this embarrasing, when your this weak?
