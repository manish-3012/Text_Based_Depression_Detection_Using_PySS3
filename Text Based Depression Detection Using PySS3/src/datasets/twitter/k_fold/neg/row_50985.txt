Disposable alwaysIt's amazing to me, how everything that has happened before will happen again.

My friend bailed out on a concert because he was feeling tired.

I spent 30 minutes trying to give my ticket away to someone for free and finally found someone who thought I was trying to screw them over.

I drank two beers, went to the bathroom, cut myself 11 times, and sat down at a table alone and priced out my suicide machine.

The sister of the person I gave the ticket to talked to me and she was gorgeous, fun, etc.

Got her number and a hug and insinuations that we should hang out.

But it's not going to happen - she's popular and a social media muse.  Fuck being 'the most thirsty' person for attention.

It was nice she went out of her way to talk to me, but this isn't an isolated incident.  I was more attractive and popular once, and people would chase after me sometimes, but they always go away.  Always, always.  Now it's just faster

Continuing to see if they'll actually like to hang out sometime is a sick joke.  I know the outcome, I know the flakiness is coming.

I don't know why it matters.  I think I'm just trying to find a reason to live, but there is none.  My blood is drained some days and i want nothing more than to die.  That's really the only rewarding things i look forward to now ever.

I posted a year ago in november that i was going to kill myself.  i don't think ill be finished by then, but I'm getting tired of trying to design this thing so maybe ill just do it the old fashioned way.
