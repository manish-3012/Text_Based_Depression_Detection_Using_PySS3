I REALLY need help! How can I put this into words?!My day consists of me, trying to get thru the day. I'm sad and very lonely. I feel like I would simply say that I'm VERY SAD during that period of time.  
But then I get 3-5 short periods of half an hour where I feel like my fucked up mind decides to trigger something, and I go from feeling like a 3/10 on a "happy scale" to a -5/10. I basically start feeling like my life is ruined in every way possible. I get an urge to burst out in tears... tho I feel forced to hide my face and keep it in when this randomly happens in class. I also get a sudden urge to find a way to kill myself. Imagining how good it'd feel to end this. This sometimes ends up with me making an irrational decision.  
What annoys me the most is that... I don't know what's happening. I feel like I'm just rambling, spitting out nonsense and right now, I'm really having trouble being able to explain this.  
It's like I go from being just casually very sad and lonely to extremely depressed and suicidal in a matter of seconds.  
This goes back and forth about 3-5 times a day and it's really making it hard for me to avoid making a dumb decision because of those sudden bursts, such as leaving mid class. And I'm aware that me making a decision while I'm in that bad period would ruin everything.  
I'm really sorry if what I wrote doesn't make sense, but I can't be the only one feeling this way? I'm really not good with words.  
Hopefully there's someone who'd take the time reading this and who's able to tell me what's happening to me?
