Barely holding on and I walked outside to find my car stolenHi reddit. I'm having a hard time, I'm out of work trying to find a job, severely depressed, been trying my hardest to get back on my feet. I've been having some medical pain as well and was afraid to go to the doctor in case treatment would be expensive. I finally worked up the nerve to go, stepped outside to get in my car and it was stolen. I've already reported it to the police and my insurance, but that was my lifeline. How am i supposed to do anything without a car, and living alone? It almost feels like its a sign that I wasn't supposed to go to the doctor and should just do myself in.
