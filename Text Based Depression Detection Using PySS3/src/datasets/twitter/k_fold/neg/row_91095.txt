who fuckin caresMy whole life is a fucking mess. I just turned 18, and I'm midly  autistic (Asperger's and PDD-NOS). My father is severely handicapped and he's lied to me for 5+ years. He wrongfully went to my doctors and psychiatrists to diagnose me with paranoid schizophrenia, and profound autism. I'm almost done with high school. I can't fucking WAIT to get out of this fucking place. All there ever was for me at high school was nothing but misery. People would throw parties, and even though I was well respected, they would shut me down and not invite me, because "they didn't have room" or they were "trying to keep me safe". Fucking please. All of my friends at high school are all assholes. They lie to me constantly and tell me that they're there for me while saying that I'm an amazing guy, and beyond brilliant. Yet I've never been invited to any plans. I've never been invited to go to the beach, get smashed, or do ANYTHING FUN. It's so goddamn unfair in every way possible. And yes, I am a virgin. I'm not afraid to admit that. Because I'm autistic, I'm guaranteed to be a virgin for the rest of my life. I just wanted to have some fun. Most of my high school experience is just me sitting at my house, doing nothing, but being screamed at by my psychotic father all damn day. What is the point of life? I've been so damn angry these past couple of years, I've developed severe social anxiety, and paranoia. It's like, the people who I am friends with, when I'm just roasting them for a good time, I feel like because I did that, I'm destined to be a failure for the rest of my life. And I have been bullied so much its unbelievable. To those people that tell me high school is the best years of life, I just roll my eyes. This isn't high school musical. Then again, this high school that I'm graduating from is notorious for spying on other kids in 2010, so I shouldn't be surprised that its so bad. And yet it gets so much praise for test scores among other grades students get. They all get to go off to the best colleges/universities. Not me. My family is to clique for that shit. They won't even let me move out, experience life on my own. How the hell am I supposed to get a job in this day and age? It's fucking impossible. I'm supposed to HAVE job experience, which I can't get because I NEED TO HAVE A JOB. Every single goddamn job I try to apply for, requires job experience, and the ones that don't, never notify me. This is my destiny. Being nice to girls never got me anywhere either. I've never dated a girl before. But of course, being autistic, I have to be this nerdy weaboo virgin nerd for the rest of my life because I have this label. I thought I was going to be a IT College student. But NO. NO NO NO NO. Fuck no. My life is fucking over. High school has determined I'm a virgin loser and failure for the rest of my life.
