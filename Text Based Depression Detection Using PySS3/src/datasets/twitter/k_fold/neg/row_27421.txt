Tried Reaching OutMy girlfriend and I have been trying to immigrate to the UK to reunite with her family, but there aren't many options, especially with covid closing most universities to international students. She constantly tells me she wants to kill herself, asks me how she can help me have a good life without her. I don't have family, and I have one friend in the UK that talks to me over Kik. We also now have two birds. I tried to talk to my friend yesterday about how bad it's gotten, but he left me on read and when I changed the topic he came back. Today I tied a noose over my door and sat there for a long time with it around my neck, testing it, feeling myself about to pass out. I tried talking to him again, which I know is selfish, but when I told him nice things to make sure he'd understand my thoughts if I did succeed (telling him he'll always be my best friend) he left me on read again. I don't want to out pressure on anyone. I don't know.
