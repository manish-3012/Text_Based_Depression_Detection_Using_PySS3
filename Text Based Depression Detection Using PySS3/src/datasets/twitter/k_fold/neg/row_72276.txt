I'm useless and I'm aware of itThrowaway because I don't need the people I know on reddit bothering me IRL for this.

I don't want to whine too much. But, long story short, I've fucked up life. I've gotten to the point where I'm pretty sure I'd be better off just donating all of my organs to people who would make better use of them than me.

The biggest problem in my life is that I seem to have lost the ability to give a damn. I thought about going to a doctor or therapist about it but what would I say? "Hey Doc, I can't be arsed about anything. Got any pills for that?"

The only reason I haven't jumped off a bridge is because I don't want to hurt my immediate family, who are pretty much the only people who still care about me. But I'm sick of wasting their money just to fail their every expectation. Eventually it's going to come to a head.

Any advice?
