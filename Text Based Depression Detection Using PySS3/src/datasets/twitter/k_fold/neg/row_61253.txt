Help with diagnosisI've had this problem for a while and i need some help to see what it is.
    I feel...alone I guess. I only have two real friends and they're both girls. I always feel like I'm a burden to them. They say I'm not, but I still feel like I am. I don't really hang out or anything. A sort of mutual friend asked everybody I know to go to a party. I'm the only one in the "group" to not be invited. I have mixed emotions about that. The last time I was invited to his parties (which was two years ago) all I did was stand there in a corner whilst everyone drank and had fun. I felt so out of place. But, it's just the idea of not being invited that bothers me. That just makes me feel even more secluded, as if no one really cares. I don't know 
     I'm a closeted gay and I've never been in a single relationship. I've never been a sexual or romantic person, but I still feel like I would like at least something. I'm extremely insecure about my self. I'm fat. I'm ugly. I'm everything I hate. 
     People say I'm gifted academically, and I push myself constantly in school, or at least my parents do, but it never pays off. I never get into those prestigious programs. I never get a thank you. I wonder what's the point. Sometimes I can't tell whether I'm doing stuff for myself or my parents.
     I would be lying if I said I didn't think about suicide, I do. But, i can't see myself doing it. I guess you can say I've grown indifferent to death. I mean, I'm not man enough to blow my brains out, but I wouldn't be upset if a car hit me. 
      It kinda goes in waves. I'll feel really sad, but, usually when I get occupied by a task or something, I get better and am actually happy. But, usually when I'm alone, I get depressed again. It has been this way for years. My mom and brother both have been diagnosed with depression, so...I'm not sure  though. 
      If anyone has a good explanation please tell me. Don't try to make dumb jokes because I'm totally serious.
