I'm probably going to soonI told my cut-off point was 25 if I wasn't where I wanted to be, but I always feel like it needs to be sooner. I don't think I can wait. I don't have any support group or anything. I don't want to talk to my friends because of pride except for one who's really busy. I don't talk to my family because we don't talk. I don't know who or where to turn to. I always have a one-track mind on girls and there's this one that I relates to me no one else has before. I write for a living and a passion and I'll admit that feeling like this produces fantastic writing, I've gone through this before(or at least tricked myself to think this way) and I don't know how many times I can. I don't know what to do. I've also been drinking every night for the past 2 months. That might be making me feel this way too. Not sure. What changes can I make to stop being so close to just making that ONE special mistake one night? I'm afraid I will someday without something that will change my life.
