things always go wrong and i can't do thisi always FUCK UP all the time and i can't save things with my boyfriend because i'm selfish and do shit that upsets him, and i feel guilty, and my mom is an abusive piece of shit and my dad won't even come near us because of covid. i asked if i could stay with him and he said legally i can't because there's nobody to watch my baby sister but i swear to god i can't keep living here. nothing is ever gonna change. i always tell myself it will and it always gets worse. ALWAYS. i genuinely see no purpose in continuing my life because there's never gonna be a time where i'm gonna feel happy for more than a little while. i'm always gonna be stuck with the parts of me that ruin my life and that i hate. im sorry sfdhjhj
