Chronic Depression. I have a foolproof plan but scared.Be brave, i tell myself. Be brave.

I don't know what that means any more. Brave to live? Brave to die? In about two weeks, I'll have my answer to life's problems. My method shouldn't fail, and if it does, hopefully I'll be impaired enough that living/dying won't matter. 

Family has a history of Parkinson's/Alzheimer's. I have social anxiety and bipolar disorder. I'm not quite 40, but close enough to see the rest of life as a slow decline to the grave. I never made it in this life. No job. No money. Just a way out.

I don't know what to do. If I continue to live in this world, I'll be nothing but a burden to those who love me. So do I keep on? I can't even qualify for social security.... Death is easier than the struggle to find help... I haven't found real help in just under 40 years....
