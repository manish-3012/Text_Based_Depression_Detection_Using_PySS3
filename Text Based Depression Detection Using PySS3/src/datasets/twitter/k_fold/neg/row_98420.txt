I can keep going anymore.I just can't do it. I'm so tired. I don't have any friends anymore. Everyone got sick of me. I don't blame them, I would leave me too. I'm tired of sleeping behind a dumpster. I'm exhausted physically and mentally. I'm so fucking lonely. I'm afraid to tell anyone that this might be it for me so I'm posting this here. I'm afraid they won't care. My family has already given up on me, why would anyone else care? I don't even know why I'm posting this. I guess I just want someone to know.
