8 Days Left..I've never used Reddit before but I've lurked a little today and didn't know where else to talk about this.

A week or two ago, I set Nov. 1st as my 'end it all' date. From a young age, I've felt that I'd take my own life. I never imagined that I'd live beyond 18. Now, at 24--I feel like I might have passed my expiration date. Like I was never supposed to pass 18. 

I set Nov. 1st as my date out of practicality. I can't afford my rent next month because I lost my job due to extreme anxiety. I'm about $200 short and have no friends or family to help me. I've gotten into sex work to pay some bills but that is also not helping my mental wellbeing. 

Now that I'm 8 days away from Nov. 1st I'm unsure about what to do. I've been so depressed and so anxious for so long now. I have no friends in the city that I live in. I have a wonderful partner but they are often very busy with University and I try not to put the full weight of my situation on them because they need to do well academically. 

I feel so...jipped. I made it past 18. I survived. I then had to drop out of school because of my mother's cancer. I returned, only to have to drop out again because I broke an ankle. I now am unable to get financial aid or loans of any type and I can't go back (despite only having one year left). I fought so hard to make my life something good but I'm still the same fucked up person that I was when I was only 10. I *want* to live. I truly do...but I don't want to live with the cards that I've got in my hand now and I see no way of switching them out. If I can't come up with my rent, I'm screwed anyway. My landlord isn't very lenient and I've been late the last two months. I feel stupid for ending things over money but it's obviously much more than that. I just...had to get this all out. I hope I don't sound too foolish or stupid.
