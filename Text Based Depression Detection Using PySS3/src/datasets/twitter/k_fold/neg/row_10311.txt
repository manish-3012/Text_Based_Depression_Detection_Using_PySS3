One more year and my suffering will finally endJust one more year and it will be all over. Tbh i WISH i could do it now with every fiber of my being, but unfortunately i have to wait one more year because i have things i must do before i die. I know it will get exceptionally worse during that year, but my motivation to live would be that suicide awaits for me at the end of the road. I honestly can't wait until i reach it and welcome it with a smile like child who misses their parents after waiting so long for them. 


Who said there's no hope in life? No matter what happens there'll always be a hope lurking around, which is suicide existing to give hopeless people like me a sweat release of death.
