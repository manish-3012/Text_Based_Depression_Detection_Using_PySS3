Suicide is all I can think about.I keep dreaming about it. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm desperate to die. I feel so alone. I don't know what is paranoia and what is justified but I'm certain that nobody wants me here. Not anyone who is physically nearby. 


I never get invited to things, I never get spoken to or interacted with and I've been trying so hard. I've been pushing my anxiety down and making the first steps by being the one to initiate conversations and asking about hanging out with the people who've insisted, verbally, that I'm their friend. But it never goes anywhere. I don't feel like I've ever had a real friendship and that's all I've ever really wanted. 

I've been feeling so physically sick with anxiety for the past week that I've barely been able to leave my bed. I can't eat. I feel like I can't breathe. 

Every time I think life is looking up it's tanked straight back down with more vigor than before. 

I've never wanted to be here.
