Give me a good reason not to do thisI'm sick of my life. I've never had many friends. The friends I do have tend to ignore the fact that I exist most of the time. I've never had a girlfriend. I've never been good at anything. My grades are slipping sharply. I've been taking antidepressants for months and I've been in counseling. I try to act more confident, but no one seems to notice. 

Please give me one good reason to not kill myself right now. I've heard all of the bullshit about it getting better. Don't tell me that unless you can give me a reason to believe it.
