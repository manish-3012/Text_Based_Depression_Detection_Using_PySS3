An inevitable overdoseTo clarify, I haven't taken anything at the time of writing this, but I plan on doing so extremely soon. I wish I had more quite frankly. You know, so I can assure that I don't survive. I'd rather end up dead than have permanent brain damage. Seizures are a big worry of mine with this drug. I don't know what else to expect. I've had large-ish doses before, but this is nearly triple that.

Hmm. Seems a lot of people are posting about overdoses today. Best of luck to them on their journey, I guess. I hope that no matter their outcome that it isn't painful.

Anyway, I'm off to sleep. It's quite late for me. Goodnight Reddit.
