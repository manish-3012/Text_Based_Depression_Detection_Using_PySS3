No."He died on me. I failed.

Why? I should've intervened sooner.

He lit up all the flags, I should've helped him...

I... I can't.

Why?

If I'm that useless, they won't miss me...

...wtf? You're not that useless, you know too much...

But the pain is also too much...

Fuck.

Wait... No. Stop.

Damnit hand, Stop!

Put that screwdriver down.

... Damnit! No!"

That was pretty much the transcript of what I could remember when I nearly killed myself... I could still feel that screwdriver on my chest near my heart.

A battle buddy died on me the week I met him by his own hand. I wasn't there to see him go... so I'm pretty sure my mind went into overdrive imagining how he died with what little info I got afterwards. That, combined with my financial hot mess, the bleak fort, and my apparent uselessness within my post caused me to spiral.

If I didn't trust my leadership as much as I did then, you all would probably be hearing about my death on the news instead. Just another statistic and barely a blip on the world and this terrible year.

I still have those thoughts, and I'm honestly surprised that my ego is holding myself at bay... for however long that's going to last.

But it's looking to be either end it or go brain dead and morally bankrupt... And I don't know if there is even a sliver of a chance of me making it.

I know too much, I care too much, and I'm intelligent enough to recognize all the problems but not enough to ignore and/or solve them.

I don't know what to do.... But I'm maintaining a holding pattern......

I don't know...

... The sun will rise tomorrow...
