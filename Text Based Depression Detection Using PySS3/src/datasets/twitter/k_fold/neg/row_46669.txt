I am not sure.I am functionally mentally retarded. I have intense struggles with talking to other people, to the point of causing seizures in everyday life. I live at home, with my parents. I am the disappointment in an otherwise successful group of children. They have a different look in their eyes when they talk to me than they do when they speak to another of their children. I am given many chances, and I simply fail to follow through on opportunities. Even with assistance in another city, I could not manage to cope with a University and two classes. This caused a big problem as financial problems happened between the caregiver and my parents. I am profoundly discouraged about life, and wonder about killing myself often. I know people would feel great sorrow, but I can't stand the reality of my life. It may seem hard to believe some random text on the internet on some site where people pretend a lot for sensation, but I just want someone to know my opinion now.
