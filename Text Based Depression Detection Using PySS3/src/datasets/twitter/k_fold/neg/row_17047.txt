Let me know.This is my first post and I don't really know how to do this, but here goes. I'm a 21 year old kid. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts and tendencies and attempts since I was 4. It's been really difficult lately because I cannot seem to get in touch with any of my friends or family. I can't find a therapist. I just feel super alone. Long story short today for the First time in my life, I wrote my note. To my nephew, dad, sister, brother, and best friends. Telling then I was sorry but I always knew it would happen this way. Going over why and that it wasn't their faults. I wrote it and even now I feel completely calm. Like I didn't just admit to myself that I'm going to do it. I'm afraid that one more episode and it's over for me, but I don't want to die. However, I'm so afraid of life and what it has in store because of what it has done to me in the past. I would rather take my life into my own hands then be at the mercy of fate. I just don't know what to do. Suppose that's probably pretty common on this, but none the less, maybe you guys have an idea. Let me know.
