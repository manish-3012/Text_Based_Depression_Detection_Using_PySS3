morbid, but it doesnâ€™t matterIâ€™m gonna cut open my forearms and bleed out all over the fucking floor. Iâ€™d usually just cut whenever I feel like this, but itâ€™s not enough anymore. And as a noticeâ€” if someone in your life is diagnosed with depression or tells you theyâ€™re having suicidal thoughts, maybe donâ€™t sit on your ass and wait for them to get better. You could save a fucking life.
