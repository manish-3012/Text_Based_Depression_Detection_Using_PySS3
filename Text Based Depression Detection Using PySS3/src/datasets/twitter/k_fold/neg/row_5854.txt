Anyone else feel like a shell of a person?I've been feeling like this for quite a while now, I don't feel anything anymore, just emptiness. Nothing excites me anymore, it's a struggle to just put on a fake smile for family and co workers. I'm just ready to leave this world behind. Anyone else feel like this and changed for the better?
