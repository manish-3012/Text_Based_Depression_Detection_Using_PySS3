Please Read This if you need help.Hey there, I just discovered this subreddit, and decided that I wanted to at least try to help you guys. I realized that I couldn't reply to everyone, so I decided to make my own post. Just remember, if you're ever feeling down, you are awesome, and were born that way. You're the product of millions of years of evolution, and don't let that go to waste. I wish I had a million things to say to cheer you up, but I'm not good with words, quite the opposite actually. So just remember that you are a strong person, and everyone has their own unique skills. If this helps just one person, than I will have done what I set to do, and never forget that no matter who you are, I believe in you.
