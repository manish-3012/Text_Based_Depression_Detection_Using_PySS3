My parents knowJust posting this I don't know why, maybe it helps someone somewhere or something.

I'm a 22 year old guy who has been introverted, loneley and depressed most of my life. But I never ever told anyone. 

This evening my parents wanted to have a serious talk because I was appearing 'ice cold' in my responses an behaviour and some other shits.

At this talk they narrowed down that there was a serious problem with my happiness and mental state, and I know that, but it is the first time ever thar they or I talked about it with them. Because I surpress every emotion I can, because I littarly feel physical pain and uncomfotableness when I talk or come in contact with that kinda stuff.

But wathever, long story short, i'm actually kind of glad and releived that they know now. My mom made an appointed with a doctor on monday.

I've got a long way to go, but this very first step already made me feel 1% happier.
