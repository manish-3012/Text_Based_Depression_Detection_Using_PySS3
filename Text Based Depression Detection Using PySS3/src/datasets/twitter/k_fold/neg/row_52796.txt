I donâ€™t deserve to be hereIâ€™ve been taking into a respite home, it was either this or going to the ward. Iâ€™ve already met a few people and just hearing what theyâ€™ve been through and why theyâ€™re here makes me feel so shit, because I really donâ€™t have any reason to be here at all I feel like if anything I need to prove myself I need to prove that I should be here, maybe actually go through with my plan for once. Itâ€™s fucked up I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m like this. I think as soon as I get out of here Iâ€™m going to go out and buy a blade, and maybe Iâ€™ll go through with my plan.
