Improvements!Iâ€™ve made significant progress since my last post on this subreddit. My friends pointed out that Iâ€™ve changed a lot and are proud of what Iâ€™ve accomplished. Despite all of that, I still feel like I have a feeling of dread getting up every morning. I was wondering how everyone else copes with these kinds of emotions?

Iâ€™d appreciate all the help I could get.
