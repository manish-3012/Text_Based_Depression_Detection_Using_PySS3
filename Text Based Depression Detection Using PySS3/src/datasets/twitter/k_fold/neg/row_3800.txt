My mom is angry at me for trying to kill myself and itâ€™s making me feel even worseSo yeah. This morning I skipped school and had a sort of mental crisis, and I had made up my mind to kill myself, and then someone drove by me on the road and picked me up, probably knowing I was in a bad mental state. I wound up at my momâ€™s work, and as soon as we left she got mad at me. I told her I had been trying to kill myself, and she was mad at me for skipping school. I donâ€™t think she has the tiniest understanding of my mental state right now. Iâ€™m alone with her and sheâ€™s trying to make me sit down and do homework, but I fucking need help. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. My mom might be fucking gaslighting me. No one knows that I genuinely need help right now. I donâ€™t want to deal with this bullshit anymore. I wish a car would fucking swerve into me and just fucking wipe me out of existence. This is the worst ducking feeling ever. The one person that understands that I have a chronic mental condition and is willing to help me isnâ€™t available. I donâ€™t know what to fucking do.
