MY MOM IS NOT A ROLE MODEL IN MY EYESMy dad told my mom she didn't want kids, but she decided to ignore all the red flags. Instead, she raised a child with a deadbeat father who had no idea about taking responsibility. The saddest part is, she won't leave him and keeps complaining about him to me. And to make matters even worse, my mom pressured me to go into a career that I didn't want to pursue. She expects me to become a nurse for the money. Why can't parents understand that just because you gave birth to your child doesn't mean that you should control their life? Each child is born with unique talents. Plus, a healthcare career is stressful enough for the people who see it as a calling. So, those who do it because their parents forced them are going to be miserable.
