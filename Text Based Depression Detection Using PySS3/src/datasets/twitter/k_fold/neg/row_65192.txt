Why do people say Reach out to someone or talk to someone? Because I'm there for everybody else as a shoulder to cry on, but the one time I need support, nobody can be there for me.I have nobody to speak to at all, I am all alone. I am that person who cheers people up, makes them smile or laugh, makes the burden they carry seem less. But now I'm suffering and in need of help, nobody is there for me. What's worse though is when people say empty promises like speak to me, I'm here, give me a ring! When I do, they ignore all my calls and texts. All I wanted and needed was a chat or a hug. 

I don't want to live anymore and I really don't want to see 2020. I prefer my dreams. When I am asleep, in my dreams I have plenty of friends and family that love me and a partner that loves me deeply.
