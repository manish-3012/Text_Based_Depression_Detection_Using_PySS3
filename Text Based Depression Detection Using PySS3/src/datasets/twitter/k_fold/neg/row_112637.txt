What to do when youâ€™re lonely?Not the kind of lonely thatâ€™s lonely in a crowd. Not the kind of lonely when youâ€™re in a new place and donâ€™t know anybody yet. But when literally no one loves you. When your family is a shitshow that want you to be what they want you to be instead of who you are, that treats you like a 7 year old, when theyâ€™re manipulative and controlling.

When you have no friends whatsoever. Iâ€™m just waiting for next school year. Maybe Iâ€™ll be able to be with the girl I love. Because I know she can understand my issues. Because I think of her everyday and to be honest, is the only hope I have. God, I just want someone to love me.
