I dont know why Im waitingPeople have been telling me for 30 years that it gets better, that this is temporary, that something will change. It hasn't, its not and it obviously wont. Ive tried the therapy, the meditation, the medication, the diets, the exercise and you know whats changed? Nothing. Actually its gotten worse because at least when I was 20 I still had feelings and hope and dreams. Now Im just a walking dead. I cant believe I listened and let it keep going even though Ive known for at least 10 years how bad it really is. Now I just need to brace myself and get over my own fear towards ending this miserable disgusting existence before another 10 hellish years go by and I find myself somehow even more soulless and tormented, if thats even possible. I dont know why I hesitate, it would take me less than a minute to make it happen. Last night I was going to swallow my fear along with my pills but I wanted to throw away all the stuff in my room first, so instead I spent the day cleaning. I dont have anyone to say goodbye to, if I go somewhere remote away from the city no one will even have to clean up after me.
