Don't make the same mistake I did.I'm planning to kill myself on 13th this month.
Before I go, I wanted to share my thoughts here...
Don't make the same mistake I did,
If someone doesn't treat you right, please leave them. If you don't, you'll just end up like me.
You deserve to be treated much better.
If you see red flags, whether it's a friendship or a relationship, try to talk it out, and if they keep covering the other person, don't hesitate to leave them.
Everybody does mistakes, and if they can't accept it, or atleast acknowledge it, they don't deserve you.
If you're having suicidal thoughts, please get rid of whatever is making you feel that. This shit eats you up.
I know life can't be easy all the time, but it's just too hard.
Stay well y'all. We only got each other.
