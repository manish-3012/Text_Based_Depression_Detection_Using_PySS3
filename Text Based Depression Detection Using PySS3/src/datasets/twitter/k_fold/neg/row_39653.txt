Why me?As a young kid, my father used alot of drugs. Abused my mother and always left us behind. My sister was 8 &amp; I was 6, when she started cutting into herselt. As a young boy, I didnâ€™t understand the motive behind that. Why would such a beautiful girl do that to herself? She burned herself, cut herself &amp; multiple times in the hospital for an almost fatal suicide/overdose. I was young, so I thought this was normal. I started cutting myself at a really young age. Cutting the pain away, multiple suicide attempts, but never succeeded. Walked around with these questions I could not ask to no-one, because no one understands me. Still to this day, I feel worthless; craving for a little bit of happiness. Everyone leaveâ€™s me because I am nothing worth &amp; should have never born, but then I ask why; how can I not kill myself? Am I a coward or is there still hope left for me somewhere. I just want to leave this horrible place &amp; be happy one day.
