HelpI canâ€™t do it anymore. I want to, but I really canâ€™t go on like this. Every part of my life is falling apart. I tried going to therapy, opening up to friends, all the stuff people recommend doing. As soon as I feel like things are getting better, something hits me from behind and Iâ€™m back at my worst. The only thing I care about is how I feel, how nobody cares for me, how many problems I have... but the truth is: I donâ€™t care for anybody. I forgot my momâ€™s birthday. Sheâ€™s at home with my daughter and Iâ€™m crying my eyes out, because I feel like shit. The only thing I worried about the last couple of days is my dark thoughts and how much of a bad person I am, I was so distracted with my thoughts and with whining about how shitty I feel that I completely missed to be a caring daughter or mom. I love my daughter so much but it hurts me too much to be with her but not actually be with her because my thoughts are circling around how fucked up my life is. I canâ€™t keep hurting them with my presence, they donâ€™t deserve that.
