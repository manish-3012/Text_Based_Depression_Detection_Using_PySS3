16yr old suicidalHi, Iâ€™m as you see in the title suicidal. Iâ€™m thinking about ending it all tonight. I feel guilt for the past and wish I could take it all back. I feel as if Iâ€™m a burden to the people I love and who love me. I struggle with BPD and depression. Iâ€™m taking my medication but I feel ultimately itâ€™s too late to change ever I fucked up.
