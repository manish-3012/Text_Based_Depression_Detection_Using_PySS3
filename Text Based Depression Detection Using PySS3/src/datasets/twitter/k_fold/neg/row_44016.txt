I feel like I don't belongI feel like I've been alive for too damn long- I've vented about my childhood on r/abusiveparents but venting just isn't enough for me anymore. I don't understand anymore I just feel like all my friends are holding me back and I feel so selfish. I'm never really happy at all unless I'm with my friends or in a relationship, and even then  it doesn't last long. Being tormented by your own mental illnesses only for the to be called battle scars, and not only that I can't feel or regulate emotions like everyone else?  I have to mimick other people's emotions Happy, excited, any other positive emotions?  I have to mimick through social interactions. It's a miserable existence and even though I have so many friends I still feel so empty, emotionless, out of place. My outlook on life is basically.... Life is worth it as long as you make it that way- well guess what?  To me it's not worth it at all I can't even see my therapist anymore due to insurance. I want to fucking die I hate all the noises in my head, all the loud voices in my head and the yelling. I want them to leave me alone I just want silence that's all I could ever ask for in life just that one thing... The closest I can get to total silence is sleeping and that's the closest thing to death that I can get to. I'm crying while typing this because I realize how much my friends or others won't understand how terrified and tormented I am- They say I won't be happy if I die but I will, everything would be quiet and i wont be hurting anymore.
