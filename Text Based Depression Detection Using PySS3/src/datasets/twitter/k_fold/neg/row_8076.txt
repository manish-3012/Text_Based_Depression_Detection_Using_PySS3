Nothingness after the pain seems fair catch the train today?I feel Mike I habe to forgive my father for raping me nearly killing me. But that feels like attempting suicide. But I feel it is the only way I can be normal again. I so desperately want to be ok, want to be only as twisted as anybody else. Want not to have think twice before using a knife to prepare a meel, or scissors to cut my nails. I want to attempt suicide again. I loved the feeling of pulsing blood out of my body. I loved the sharp pain when I cut trough the layers of skin over the carotis. I even loved the attempt as it fails. I just want to be close to death. Play this game of chance. Whether I lose and life I trie again if I succeed its alroght. At least in dead it will be normal. Just nothing ness. The easy feeling of that makes me laugh. I am not scared I will be pissed if there is any form of existence when I am finally gone.
