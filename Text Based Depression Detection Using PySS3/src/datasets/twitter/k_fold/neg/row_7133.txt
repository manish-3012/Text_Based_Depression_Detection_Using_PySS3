itâ€™s getting worsethere is no god. there is no afterlife. there is only me. my reality, my brain, my world. iâ€™m consumed by the world, and it controls me, yet i am one individual. i didnâ€™t ask to be born in this body, yet here i am. i donâ€™t know what else i have to live for, the only thing that has kept me alive this whole time is my mother. my poor mom... if she found my dead body... but i donâ€™t know how many more times i can picture that moment before it becomes emotionless. i canâ€™t handle this anymore... itâ€™s all so much.
