Son's friend attempted suicide...!My son is 16, almost 17. He has a good friend, who was sort of a girlfriend last year for a couple of months. He's distanced himself from her, once they found they were better off as friends. 

She tried to commit suicide on Wednesday, and asked to see him today. Her mother said: 

- there were extenuating circumstances
- please don't tell anyone
- she did get to a doctor

What bothered me the most is that the mom didn't even want *me* to know. If my son is going to be emotional support at this level, I *need* to know. Plus, he's not going to hide something of this magnitude from me. What is she thinking?!

The whole thing gives me pause. The mom is a high-conflict drama queen. I don't want my son to be hurt, and I want his friend to get real help. 

Any suggestions?
