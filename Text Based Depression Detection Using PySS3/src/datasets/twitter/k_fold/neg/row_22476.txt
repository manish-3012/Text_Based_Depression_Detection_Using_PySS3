I've given it my all for 30 years, I can't continue at this intensity anymore.All my life I've lived with the faiith that working hard and hustling would get you though life. I always knew I wouldn't reach the top, but I never thought I'd be this close to the bottom.

Work gradual became a chore, and I was finally laid off. I have no motivation or drive to interview anymore, and less drive to establish myself at another company. I am too old, too tired, and have not had enough positive reinforcement to propell me further.  After fighting to get work, there is nothing waiting on the other side except loneliness.  I have tried every permutation of things to try to make friends and meet women, with no success. I do not have enough professional success to make up for my lack of social appeal.

One small silver lining of failing so miserably on my social life is that I have savings that will keep me housed and fed, at least for a while. But living like this is unappealing.

I have thought everything through very thoroughly. All that awaits me is a mediocre existence. I can't bear that.

I have a gun stored with a friend in another state. I will work up the courage to use it soon.
