i want to die but i donâ€™t want to failiâ€™ve had countless suicide attempts over the past decade (21F). only 2 were really serious that required hospitalization. iâ€™ve been super suicidal over the past month but the only thing stopping me is knowing i could fail - again. the feeling of shame is worse than how i feel now but i feel crazy that that is the only thing keeping me from dying 
also not to mention the crazy hospital bill and institutionalization that follows all that, really does not help
