She's gone. I'm broken. I don't want to live a life without her.Nothing matters enough, not hobbies, not people I care about, not things I want to do or experience... If I can't do that with her. She was and is my everything. My moon dance. 

I put the gun in my mouth tonight. I am just so arrogant that I can't pull the trigger. How sad is it that the only thing keeping me alive is my pride and arrogance. 

It's been three months. I still vomit regularly from the sadness, and bouts of guttural crying. I can't imagine a world without her, and I am living it every day. Every day is the worst day of my life, and it isn't getting better.

I wish I could let her feel the love I feel. Her apathy crushed me. In alone in this house with a million memories and it pulls my insides apart every morning when I wake up to an empty side of the bed.

God every night I am afraid to fall asleep because of the dreams.. Always dreams of her. They hurt so much. Nothing, not combat, not death of loved ones, nothing in life has hurt this much. 5 years and I was a different man because she showed me a future that I didn't know was possible. I am alone.

I want to die alone.

I don't want a life without her in it.
