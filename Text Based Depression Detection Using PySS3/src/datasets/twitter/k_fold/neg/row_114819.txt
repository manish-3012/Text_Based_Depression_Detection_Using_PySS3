Guilty about not wanting to die tonightHi :). How are you? 

I don't know how it works, but I wanted to talk to you \^\^

Most of the time I just go to bed wanting not to wake up in the next day, and I kind of tried to do this some times. 

Some days ago I told someone that I wanted to die and that I tried to, and this person talked to me a lot, but I feel deeply and extremely guilty that I did it, because I feel that I shouldn't be making they deal with me and those things. I shouldn't have said anything, I shouldn't have make they feel bad and worried. I feel really bad about it.

But I feel worse, more guilty, when I'm just having those nights where I'm not so sure that I want to die. Because I feel like I just used this person to vent out - I hope I didn't - and that was it. Like, why did I tell them that if I'm not feeling like that anymore? Why did I tell them that I want to die if I'm not trying it?

I feel really sad about it. I feel like I should die or at least, I should want to die every time.

Have you ever felt like that, too?
