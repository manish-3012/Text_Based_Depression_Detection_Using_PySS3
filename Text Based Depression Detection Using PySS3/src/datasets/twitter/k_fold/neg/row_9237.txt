im just waitingWhy can't I just get cancer. That's all I'm asking for. Just give me cancer so I can get a prognosis of less than a year, and then go peacefully with some barbiturate (die with dignity state). Why do people who don't want to die die, and those who don't have to live live. I was dealt one of the worst hands life has to give. I had no choice. I just choose to want to die. End rant. Or better yet give me the courage to actually end my life myself...
