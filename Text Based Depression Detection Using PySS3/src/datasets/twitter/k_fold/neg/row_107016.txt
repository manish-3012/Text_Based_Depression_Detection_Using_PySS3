Sitting in my carI wish I had a garage, long tube, and duct tape. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. My life isnâ€™t worth living and Iâ€™m not sure what I can do to change that. I donâ€™t have any hobbies or interests. I know I have friends but itâ€™s hard to talk to them about this. Sitting in this car feels like the best thing I should be doing right now listening to music closing my eyes and falling asleep. The only two reasons that hold me back is not having a private area to do this in and thinking about how my friends and family will react. I wish I could get into a fatal car accident at least then no one would be mad at me.
