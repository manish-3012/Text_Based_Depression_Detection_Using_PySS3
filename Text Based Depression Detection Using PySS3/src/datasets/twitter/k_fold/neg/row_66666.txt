Is it weird that I want to go to a psych ward?I want to wear the hospital gowns and lay in bed, being handfed by nurses. I want to be in a ward where everything is unbelievably white and clean, so much so that I miss the colors of home. I want to be alone in thought but have other patients who reek of death like me. I think being in a place where everyone knows I'm there because I'm unstable would be a nice break from faking all day. It'll give my face a fucking break. I could wear short sleeves and have my cigarette burns breathe for a chance. I want to tell strangers that I want to slice my throat and have them feel the same way and not give me any bullshit.
