I'm done.I have lost every friend I have. Everyone has given up on me. Everyone fucks me over. I'm not even good enough to have a friend. I don't want to live anymore. There's no point. I don't trust mental healthcare, I have no good options to escape this, and nobody wants me in their life. There is no point in living.
