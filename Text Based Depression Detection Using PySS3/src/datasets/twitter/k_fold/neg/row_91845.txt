They say you can die from a broken heartI believe it. I've been suicidal most of my life. From issues with my parents, being raped by a family member's friend to abusive exes... The void calls to me. Sometimes it's almost inaudible... Lately it's been screaming my name, begging me to come and stay for a bit...
It was quite for a bit, but in 2017 I lost my 14 year old shih tzu. And it came roaring back. That dog helped me through so much. My abusive, cheating asshole of an ex husband to numerous nights where I would cut. Now that she's gone, I'm not sure how to cope. In 2018 I almost lost my current husband to a peptic ulcer that ruptured. He got better but with some lasting PTSD from the experience. In March of 2018 we brought home a new puppy... But I didn't bond with her the way I did with my last dog. Meanwhile I'm still puttering around functioning on basic motor skills. I decide to check reddit to see if there was a sub about my favorite TV show, and so I joined. I've met some amazing people... And that is where this comes in. I started talking to a fellow redditor. I got very close to them. I started to fall in love with them. Caused some internal conflicts with myself but it helped me to communicate with my husband and we went poly. For a few months we were working to get our boyfriend out if his situation. We found them a place and a job. I was counting the days down until he would come. But issues happened between him and his ex. His abusive cunt of an ex. He forgot something important and had to go back after my husband and I extracted him. And he got cornered. His abuser called his mom who then threatend to disown him if he left. 
All within a span of 24 hours I went from over-joyed to completely destroyed. My husband and my friends all tell me that I'll be ok. But I'm not. This is the first time in a long time since I lost my dog, I felt complete. Planning my life with both of my men. Cuddling them. Loving them. Needing them... 
And now that will never happen. 
I'm completely devistated. I knew I never should've let my guard down. But I did. I'm not sure how I'm going to do it, but this time I am. I can't do this anymore. I never should've let my guard down. I never should've let him in. I wish I could change his mind. His mom's mind...but that will never happen. I will never get to be cuddled by both of them. My heart is completely broken. I wish I could convince him that his life here will be better.... But I can't break up a family. I just hope he knows I would've moved the mountains themselves to bring him home with us... But that will never happen. My husband will move on and find someone better for him than me. 
I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time. I just can't do this anymore...
