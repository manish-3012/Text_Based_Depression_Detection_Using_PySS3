It will get better?If I can make it through another night, things will seem better in the morning. Will tomorrow night be a bad night, too? I wonâ€™t know until it comes. Everyone eventually disappears. Iâ€™m not sure what it is about me but I donâ€™t blame them, I donâ€™t even want to stick around for myself some days. Things were going so well, I was working so hard to be healthy. But bad nights make it feel like itâ€™s not worth it.
