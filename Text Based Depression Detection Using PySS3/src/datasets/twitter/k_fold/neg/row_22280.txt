Different kinds of suicidal thoughts?I've had an objectively cushy, privileged life. But I got stuck with shitty mental health genetics and I have had severe depression for about 6 years (currently 21). For years, I've struggled with suicidal thoughts, but meds have kept my depression under control for the most part. But when it flares up, it flares up bad and I'm actively suicidal a lot.

My suicidal thoughts manifest usually like intrusive thoughts. It's like this voice in my head constantly telling me "kill yourself kill yourself swallow that bottle of pills slit your wrists" even though objectively I know I have good grades and tons of friends and family who love and support me. Because I've dealt with this form of suicidal thoughts so long, I've figured out pretty effective coping mechanisms and for the most part, am pretty good at keeping myself from doing anything. (I have attempted once but that's it)

This time, it's different. This is the first time I've wanted to kill myself with a logical reasoning behind it. I don't want to get into specifics, but I fucked something big up and I feel like a complete failure and like I deserve to die for being such a fuck up. I've been so close to doing it so many times over the past few days. 

Usually I can just distract myself from my intrusive suicidal thoughts, but since this is more concrete, small distractions don't help. I have no coping skills to deal with this and I'm terrified I'm actually gonna follow through on it. As I'm writing this, I don't have any urges but they're gonna come back soon and I'm honestly terrified I'm going to act on them. 

I don't know if this makes any sense, but I'm hoping someone can relate and give me some advice. What are your coping mechanisms? Is there a way out or is this it?
