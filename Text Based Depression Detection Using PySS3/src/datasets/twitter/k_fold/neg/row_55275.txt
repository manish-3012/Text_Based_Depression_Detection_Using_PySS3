Thank you allI posted here earlier tonight, talking about being swamped in homework and whatnot. Earlier than that, I posted about just having a good yet unfulfilling life. You all were very helpful. And I want to thank you for that. My parents' needs and a future to look forward to is what keeps me going, but sometimes that isn't enough. And in those cases, you guys provide the help I need. So I just wanted to say, to the mods for keeping this sub non-toxic, to the countless people who offer advice, and whoever else browses this sub: thank you. You truly made a difference.
