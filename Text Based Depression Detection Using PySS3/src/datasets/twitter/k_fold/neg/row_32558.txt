Tears of endearmentMy cat ran away today. I want to snuggle with him and feel his soft fur. My (ex) spouse told me she wanted to seperate just after Valentine's day, but we have to live together for the kidz(way too complicated but work cycles). Every time I hear her laugh, or a story from work, or her fucking ringtone I want to punch things. She can't clean up after herself, and doesn't support my chronic pain medication(cannabis). Our 3 kids(oldest turns 8 soon) are all autistic. Some days are good. Most mornings are nightmares. My best and least complicated answer is to kill myself. I have been having these thoughts for years on and off, probably as a result of the stress. I cannot live with the decision of my kids being raised without a father tho. I just can't do it. It makes me cry. I can't do anything after that, it just makes me feel like a worse blubbering pile of crap on the floor. This cycle is perpetual and I need to break it. Help before I break something else.
