I'm drowning in debt and have no options leftI'm drowning in debt and feel as though I don't have any options left. I've tried to get help with my financial issues but no one can help me. I was left with a lot of debt after my ex abused me and attacked me one night then left me with all of my debts. For this, I feel worthless as a person and I know that I don't want to subject myself from the torment I feel daily.
