My lifeâ€™s moving upwards, really well, but itâ€™s not taking my mind with it.I have been through hell. And only come partially back. 

When things are good, they donâ€™t feel real now. I depersonalise and zone out, and when things are bad itâ€™s like itâ€™s slow motion, and Iâ€™m hyper focused on it. 

I dislike myself a lot. I can achieve a lot, and I am, but I donâ€™t know.. 

I just wish I could give up. Not have to at all. Why be some success in life if I cannot experience it properly and enjoy it?

I wish I could go back in time and save myself from not only the world, but myself as well...
