I long to be at peace...I'm so tired of living.
I enjoy sleeping all the time.
Waking up is such a chore.
Sometimes i don't even bother taking a bath anymore.
Sleeping is so peaceful.
You feel nothing at all, eveything is empty
I'm tired of thinking what to do about my current problems. I just want to retire.
I just want to let go of it all.
Nothing good ever comes my way.
Being awake feels sad and lonely
Sleeping is so comfortable.
I don't have the courage to end my life
