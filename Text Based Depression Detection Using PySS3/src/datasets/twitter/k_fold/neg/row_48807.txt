Okay reddit, I know how awesome you are. So, I need your help. Desperately.I don't know how to make a self post so that you don't accuse me of karma-whoring but this is urgent.

So, I'll lay the cards on the table. A friend of a friend of a friend is studying in a private school in N********. My friend came to know that she is going to kill herself after 6 PM UK time today. I'm not good with time zones either, so I hope I'm not too late.

The thing is my friend reckons she's off her rocker and she's not listening but I think you guys can do something. She threw away her phone so, I'm not able to contact her.

That's all I know, now it's your turn. Can you help her out ? or is it impossible ?

**EDIT:** Come on guys ! This is kind of an emergency!

**EDIT2:** I just learned she has no family. I guess it really is asking too much. :(

**EDIT3:** I just learned that she's **/** years old and that she's supposedly going to jump off a bridge.

**EDIT4:** My friend thinks she has a kid and she needs money. But my friend isn't sure.

**EDIT5:** Tried calling the UK suicide hotline a couple of times, but it's unavailable. Any thoughts ?

**EDIT6:** Can someone from the UK please try to do something ? All details are provided above. Everything *I* know, atleast.. Sheesh, I wish I could do more.

**EDIT7:** She..went to the bridge.

**EDIT8:** No more information received. I don't know what happened. I'll keep you guys posted.

**EDIT9:** Hey guys, I told you I'd keep you updated, so here it is: Apparently, K******* jumped; but I guess the bridge wasn't high enough so, she survived it and now she's recovering slowly in the hospital! 
Also, EDIT 4 was wrong, so sorry about mixing up the facts.

**Here's to wishing her a speedy recovery !!** (I know you can't see it, but I'm raising my cup of milk to shoulder height)

**EDIT10:** Edited out all the private information.
