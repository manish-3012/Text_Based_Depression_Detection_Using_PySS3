How can I think about wanting my life to end at the same time be so terrified of death?I don't understand it. It must mean I don't actually want to die. I really don't think I do. I just think it's the only way to get rid of all my problems. 

But again, I don't want to die. I'm so terrified of it. I'm terrified of how my family will be if I do.  Heck, even typing this out is terrifying. Even using a throwaway, with the intention of no one I know ever seeing it... just admitting the fact that's it's been lingering in my brain for the past months, lying that it's the answer, is terrifying. I don't want it to happen, but i'm so afraid it will. What do I do with this?
