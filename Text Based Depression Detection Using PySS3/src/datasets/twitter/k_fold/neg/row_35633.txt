Everything continuously keeps fucking up over and over again.Last year before summer, everything became 100x better. Life became worth living. I found the person who I wanted to live forever with. She was the best thing to ever happen to my life. 

I'm 18 years old and since I was I was 10, I've been going through depression and anxiety and bipolar and insomnia and adhd and panic disorder and everything. Obviously some days have been better than other, but the last couple of years have been horrible. 

She helped me so much, she made me get help, I've been seeing a psychiatrist (I'm in the waiting room right now) and therapist for around 10 months now and I'm taking medication for everything too. 

She has mental illness problems too and my purpose for living was to help her and to be with her. 

Around two months ago, someone spread that I cheated on her and since then, everything has gone to shit. She doesn't trust me at all and we've broken up and gotten back together multiple times and but now for like 2 weeks, we've been fully done. She said that she can't be with me. 

I feel like I'm rambling here with no outline but I just want to say that I don't know what to do anymore and my parents were abusive before and now they're so much more abusive and its all just so fucked up. I failed my grade 12 second semester and I had a 86% average for first semester but despite that I have to come back.

Been an inpatient at the psychiatric ward twice the last couple of months.

She said she can't handle my problems and I've been like a baby to her and she just has to pamper me but I used to help her too



I don't know how to continue living because all I do just reminds me of her and all the music I listen to reminds me of her and half my closet is full of clothes that she's bought or likes and how I walk fucking reminds me of her and how I fucking talk and everything does and I don't know what to dosjakakdjakak
