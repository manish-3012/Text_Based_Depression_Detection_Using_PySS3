Depression rantI feel incredibly nihilistic and pessimistic like continuously. I feel like my entire life is a waste and nothing that i do will prevent me from my inevitable disappointment of the ones i love and killing myself. Nothing feels worth doing because it always feels like itâ€™ll end poorly. I dont have a job and me and my dad are moving in 2 days and i was using this all as an excuse to not have a job yet but a big part of me just doesnt want to throw my life away to a job that wont make me feel happy. I feel like im absolutely worthless and have no skills and look disgusting and feel disgusting. I try to get attention from men because i feel as if im not as worthless if someone could be attracted to me. I just dont really know what to do because nothing feels worth striving for because no matter what itll just end the same and im too much of a disappointment to change my own fate. I have this constant sense of dread and doom and obsess over how little i accomplish at any given moment i just cant fully enjoy anything in life because theres the voice in the back of my head saying â€œnon of this matters if you arent making money off itâ€ and that mindset has pushed me away from trying to get better at videogames i like, learning instruments i enjoy, pursuing an education in music, it just all feels so meaningless for anything beyond my own happiness, but in a world where your financial value is held higher than your emotional value its hard to justify doing anything that could potentially move me away from this constant emptiness that just tells me to kill myself because i cannot be happy no matter what choice i make.
