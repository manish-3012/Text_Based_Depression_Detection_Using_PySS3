SuicideWatch, I'm just incredibly hurt and confused.I fell deeply in love with this guy and about a month or so ago we broke up. I think about him constantly and still love him but I know he doesn't give a shit about me and will barely talk to me. On top of that my dad is lying on his death bed and my mom is redecorating his bedroom as I type. I'm failing out of uni and I just don't know what to do. Everything seems to broken to fix...
