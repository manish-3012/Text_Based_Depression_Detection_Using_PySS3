Fantasising about suicideI'm suicidal and have been for several years now, I'm 16 with diagnosed chronic depression and anxiety, I've been through meds, 5 months in hospital, extreme self loathing. Basically absolute hell, if it weren't for my family I would have been dead ages ago.

Its so frustrating that I will never be able to kill myself, it would kill my family, and when I imagine my grandparents getting the call I feel sick to my stomach, this stops me ever going through with my plans. 

I can't see anyway of carrying on, I think the world is horrific and have so much wrong with me life is just exhausting; depression, anxiety, aspergers, IBS, possible Impulse Control Disorder. I can't stop fantasising about suicide, I've been researching local bridges, and the nearest cliffs, researching different methods, despite the fact I tell myself suicide is not an option the thoughts seem to be getting stronger.

I'm probably fucked, my parents turned the wifi off so I wouldn't stay up all night, so I spent money I don't even have on 4G, I desperately needed to not be alone, I tried texting a helpline but it is closed, I hope my parents will understand, but I feel like i've let them down and regret not just doing what they tell me

I don't know, I just needed to vent, somehow I feel worse
