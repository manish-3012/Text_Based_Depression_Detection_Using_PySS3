Gotta let this out somewhere.I just want to dump all this here because I have no other way to get it out. Tonight I was feeling severely upset and decided to walk to the gas station to buy cigarettes. The whole walk there and back all I could think about was killing myself. I've had suicidal thoughts for years and I've made a few half-hearted attempts in the past, but I always get too scared to actually do it. 

I was in therapy for about a year and on anti-depressants for most of that time. None of it seemed to help at all. I know people care about me and my life has not been the least bit difficult, but I still can't stop thinking about it. I think about killing myself almost every day. I've tried getting out more, getting more exercise, I even joined the army thinking it would fix my life. Nothing has worked. Recently I've thought about volunteering locally to fill my free time and give me something to feel good about, but my internet searches didn't turn up anything in my area and now I've run out of ideas. I really just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation and escaped it. How the fuck did you deal with it?
