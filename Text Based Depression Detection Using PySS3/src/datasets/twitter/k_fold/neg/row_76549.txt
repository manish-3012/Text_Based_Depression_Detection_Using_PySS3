really want to take all my clonopinIm not sure exactly whats going on in my brain right now but i feel awful
went for a walk and couldnt stop thinking about just walking onto the freeway

i think i just need to get some shit off my chest

the girl i love is dating someone else and every time i hear his name its like a new dagger in my gut
I keep looking at myself in the mirror trying to figure out why she doesnt want me anymore, is it the acne break out, is it the new haircut
why am i not enough, and why cant i just be okay being me.  
i keep trying to be what everyone wants me to be or expects of me and it just doesnt work for me

i hate being a contributing member of society, I want to be an anarchist poet in Morocco shooting up heroin and fucking prostitutes 
my life is pretty shit. i have no goals. But because people expect me to reach some sort of percepted potential that theyve set for me i feel a need to do what they want

I know that i'm not broken but Im bent and i need straightening, whether thats a close brush with death or maybe i need to go skydiving or something to get these thoughts out of my head.
