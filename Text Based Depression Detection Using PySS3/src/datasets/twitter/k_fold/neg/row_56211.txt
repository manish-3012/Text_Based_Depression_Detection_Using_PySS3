I don't even knowI feel so empty.. nothing seems to matter anymore. The thoughts are so intrusive and debilitating. I don't have an appointment with my therapist until the 17th and I don't even think she wants to see me at this point. I don't have any friends to talk to Because I honestly just don't want to bug them, they already seem annoyed with me. I'm tired and I just want to sleep.
