God Bless Everyone helping hereI came to this sub looking for help, but I feel my own problems dwarfed by what I've read here, and that's not what this is about anyways. To everyone dedicating their time to support those going through depression and suicidal thoughts, God Bless you. Seeing so many people offering help and support is amazing.

And to those going through suicidal thoughts and desires, I pray you'll get the help you deserve.
