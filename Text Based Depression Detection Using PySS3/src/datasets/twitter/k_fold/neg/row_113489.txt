I wanna die, but I also want to be rememberedI take comfort in the thought that I will die someday. But I honestly hoped it would come sooner. When I was in middle school, I had wanted to die, I still do. I believed that I would die before I graduate high school. Well, I turned 20 just a week ago. I graduated at 18. These two years has been some kind of a numb feeling,  because they weren't supposed to happen. My greatest achievement is graduating high school, all that it ever will be. I hated school, I'm never gonna do anything meaningful in college. I took one class last year to test the waters and failed it. One basic-ass English class. Parents think I enrolled next semester anyway. I am not gonna do it. I think I'm gonna end this shit soon enough. Should have done it years ago. 

I also feel like I can't though. Every time I get ready to kill myself, I remember that a video game series I like is releasing a new game soon, or that I haven't watched a series I've been looking for. Sometimes I get some kind of religious feeling that says I shouldn't. Funny that procrastination fucked me in school and now it's postponing my own death. 

I'm around 5'10, I'm not that good looking, it's not that I'm ugly. It's not that I'm short or tall, it's not that I'm fucking stupid, it's not that I'm "too smart for my own good". It's that I'm average. I'm average as fuck. I have nothing horrible about me, or remarkable. I blend into the crowd. And my headstone will too.

So I guess the question I ask myself is "Am I finally gonna do this". And the answer is no almost every day. I hope one day I will finally drop the excuses, and turn off this fucked up game for good.
