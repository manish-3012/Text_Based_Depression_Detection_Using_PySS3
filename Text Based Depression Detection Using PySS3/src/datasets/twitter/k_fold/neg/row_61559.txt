I just wanted to tell someoneIf I tell friends, I know I'll make them worried. Suicide hotline just puts me on hold like it's customer service. I'm killing myself in a year. My life insurance should be fully funded by then. My family will be well taken care of and won't have to worry about money anymore. They can live a good life after I'm gone. I don't know how I'll do it, but hey, I'm sure I can find a way.
