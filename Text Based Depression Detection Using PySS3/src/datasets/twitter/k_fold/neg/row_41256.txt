I don't have the guts to do it, but I've thought about killing myself specifically to hurt my family.I know it'd destroy them, but they deserve it. Years of mental manipulation and being their emotional whipping boy and bullying at school and my identity crisis and hating myself and hating my body. What's the point? My life has never improved. It may never improve. There is no deleting history. There is no going back and undoing all the hurt the world has inflicted on me. I just want it to be over. I'm sick of God punishing me.

Every single second I'm alive it feels wrong. Feels like I'm defying the order of the world. I can't take existing anymore. I've brought nothing but pain and destruction to everyone around me. I'm 19, and in the 19 years I've lived I've gained nothing and have lost so much. College isn't worth it. People aren't worth it. Humanity isn't worth it.

I probably won't kill myself today or tomorrow, but if life continues like this I may eventually. I may just stop taking care of myself. I may start taking bigger risks. I may go out at night with my car when I'm home and fall asleep at the wheel. I may drink until my liver gives out. I don't know yet. But I'm done living for anyone. I'm done living for myself. I'm tired.
