I donâ€™t know what else to sayIâ€™ve been feeling really lonely these days. Despite hanging with friends and shit. Got a lot of problems going on at home. A lot of inner struggles. And just been expecting too much of my friends. 

Itâ€™s like I want the perfect answer. But itâ€™ll never come. Every night I ask myself what the fuck am I doing here. Play this same fucking piece on repeat. Over and over. It never ends. 

Nothing is enough to feed my pain. 

In all honesty. I know my life will end in suicide. Nothing will stop it. Tough love, softness. Nothing. Iâ€™ll die one day by my own hand. All I can blame though is myself, for not having the strength to hold on. 

My purpose in life was to live, feel pain and then die. And bring pain upon those I love so theyâ€™ll understand mental illness and how serious it is. How misunderstood it is and how itâ€™s often swept under the rug. To many people think mental illness is a choice... itâ€™s not. I didnâ€™t ask to be fucking depressed or suicidal. 

Hopefully I can survive tonight.
