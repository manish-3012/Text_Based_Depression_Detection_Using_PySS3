My sister is suffering and I donâ€™t know what to fucking do.She keeps crying and she never even smiles anymore. She dedicates her time to building those Japanese robot toys and picking at bugs and is always on reddit. I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t ask mom anything because sheâ€™ll never explain anything to me. I love my mom to death but sheâ€™s so difficult. 

She has cuts on her arm, theyâ€™re deep and are really white even though weâ€™re lightskin. She spazzes out like someone with the chills even when itâ€™s just room temperature or hot. She bites her lip when playing games (mostly metal gear solid) till the point where it bleeds. She talks to me but she has been doing it less and less.

I tried to squeeze out her favorite sub to see if I can get answers and she texts â€œsuicidewatch is interesting I like talking to people I guess.â€ So here I am. I just need help. What do I do? Iâ€™m so desperate, I want my sister back.
