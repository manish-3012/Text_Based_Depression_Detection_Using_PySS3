I know I need helpI've been dealing with depression since as long as I can remember. I was never a happy kid. Stuff happened when i was 15 that really messed me up, emotionally at least. My family life is all kinds of fucked up; and I feel myself "losing" more often then I care to admit to.

It's not even been 4 years since I was admitted to a Psychiatric hospital, and I can see what's happening now. It needs to end. 

To be super plain, I want to kill myself. I find my mind drifting to the "how" far more often in the last month. I'm not sure I've gone a day without thinking of at least one possibility. 

Can someone please help me. I am scared. I hate myself. I hate my depression, but more than all that. 

I want to die.
