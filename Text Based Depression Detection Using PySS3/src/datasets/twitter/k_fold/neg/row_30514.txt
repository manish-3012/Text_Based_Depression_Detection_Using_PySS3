My brother killed himself last year and I want to do the same thing nowHe had lifelong depression and so I. I'm in my early 40s, female, and have been through an insane amount of loss and pain, particularly in the last few years. 

The most recent loss was a "friend" who I thought would be the one person who would always be there for me. He wasn't. He has gone, without even a goodbye; I've tried a couple of times to reach out, to apologise, but I have been utterly cut off. He knew everything about me. I can't see meeting anyone else. I am too depressed, too withdrawn. And how would I be able to trust anyone else after him anyway? 

I have a debilitating chronic disease which is incurable and which isn't going to get any better. I've already had enough of hopsital appointments, tests, pain, etc. to last five lifetimes. I don't want it any more. 

I am also desperately, desperately, desperately lonely, despite having an absolutely lovely female friend. But I am scared of ultimately driving her away one day too: I have everyone else. 

Put simply, I have nothing left to live for. I'm in 10/10 mental pain nearly all the time. I've tried about 8 or 9 different antidepressants over the years; none of them have worked for longer than a few weeks - or a few months at absolute most. Some left me in a worse state than before I began them. I have no interest in trying any more antidepressants. 

Therapy is unaffordable.  

My dilemma is this: I desperately want to end the pain, as I cannot go on like this for much longer - I just can't. But I don't want to put my parents through a second suicide; I would swap places with my dead brother in nanoseconds. (He may not thank me for that, but I don't give a shit.) 

I am stuck in a special kind of hell. I want to wait until my parents pass. They are elderly but it could still be another 10-20 years. No way I can hold out that long.
