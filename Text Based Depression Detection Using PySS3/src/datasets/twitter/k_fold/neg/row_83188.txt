[Help Me] I don't know what to doI'll try to keep it short and sweet. If there is a better sub-reddit for this please point me there and I will re-post this thread.



I have a small interest in watching bestiality. It gives me an adrenaline rush, and sometimes a bit of a turn on. I absolutely hate that I'm interested in it. I feel like total shit when I have these thoughts and any advice is appreciated.


I only watch and look it up very occasionally, but my continued interest is what sickens me. What's wrong with me? If these thoughts continue I feel like killing myself because they are so sick and make me feel like such a fucking weirdo.



Most people say well you only watch it that's different than doing it but if I was alone with an adult dog in heat, there's no saying what could happen.


I feel like a total failure and am in need of some advice. What should I do about these nasty thought, I hate myself for getting even the slightest bit turned on by this, and even though I find it disgusting it's so alluring as well. And the thought that I would actually fuck a dog gives me a HUGE adrenaline rush but then I'm like what the fuck is wrong with you, sicko. Go kill yourself. Any and all advice is appreciated.
