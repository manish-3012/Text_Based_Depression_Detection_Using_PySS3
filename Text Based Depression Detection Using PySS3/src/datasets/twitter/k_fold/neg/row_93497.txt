Venting sorry if Iâ€™m posting too much
Let me start by saying Iâ€™m safe, I donâ€™t have any active plans to harm myself or do anything crazy.  But Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve been like this since about 2 weeks after my last attempt 3/14/2019. Iâ€™ve been cutting on my thigh for the last 3 weeks. Itâ€™s maybe once a week I cut but it helps to release the stress. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this I guess just to be able to vent. Part of me wants to die as Iâ€™m tired of my life feeling like itâ€™s on repeat and part of me doesnâ€™t as I want to see my kids grow up.
