So, yeah.Nothing life threatening, feel free to skip to another more pressing thread.


So yeah, been without my ex for a number of months now (awkwardly saw her earlier tonight), don't want her back but miss the company. Sitting a couch in a nightclub atm, met a few friends, offered to buy a few girls drinks to no avail (not bad looking, might post a photo if need be) and no dice. Sick of being lonely. I'm a solitary guy, but need sex and more importantly, someone to love me. That's egotistic in itself, but to top it off - I'm awefully shallow.

So yeah, sitting here complentating death options. I don't believe alchol factors into this, but I've had a few for the record. Not going to do anything rash, but damn this sucks. First world problems, eh?

I know things will only pick up in then future, but my fascination of the beyond coupled with my current feelings is not a good combo.



What do, reddit?


EDIT:
Sorry guys, I should have posted in r/depression
Suicidal thoughts to NOT warrant me posting in a Suicide Watch board, especially when I know full well I wouldn't make even a half-assed attempt.
