What do in my life?My entire life has been a roller coaster of wanting to kill myself since the age of 10 . From abuse from my parents to being cheated on by my first love. To losing my 2 best friends; one to pneumonia and the other in a car accident. Battling cancer at a young age. And now 2017 my first new car drowns in floods after 2 months of use and having to climb out of my car in the flood with no one helping me or even offering any help. Then meeting the love of my life which I keep feeling I dont deserve at all . Shes probably the only reason I have any form of attachment to this world. I really need help. Problems with family everyday and my other new car I just got had an accident as well. I feel my life was just not made for me to be happy for too long. Because whenever anything close to good happens. 20 more bad things happen after and my mental health is in no shape to handle this. Ive done therapy before and counciling and was even given medication. Nothing works. The thought of wanting to end it all goes through my head every second of everyday recently. And the only thing stopping me from doing that is the love of my life. she knows what ive been through but she doesnt know im close to the edge with ending all of it at once. She over worries about me and the thoughts of ending my life I cant share with her because I know what it would do to her. Everything is torturing me mentally and I just can't bare with it. Everything feels too much nowadays. I dont know how ill stop myself because im hitting the edge and I feel that at any moment I might just snap and go through with it. I came here for help in any form as this is my last resort. I am against suicide but my brain cant handle what ive been through and I feel that I have just hit my ending limit. I really don't know what to do anymore. Help me
