I hate how all I can do is hopeWhen I see the horrible shit that goes on in this world all I can do is hope that things will be okay but somewhere in my mind I know Iâ€™m just a powerless animal. Even on a personal level itâ€™s scary to see how powerless I am. I can only hope for no suffering, no pain. etc.  but in reality I canâ€™t actually prevent it from happening and that scares the shit out of me, I keep telling myself that everything will be okay but will it? The uncertainty and the fact that I canâ€™t do anything at all to control these outcomes is what gets me. This world truly is a chaotic hell where all we have is a prayer.
