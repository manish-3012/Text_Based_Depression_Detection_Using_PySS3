There is nothing I want to do, life is pain.My life is actually pretty nice but its also pretty shitty. I think suicidal thoughts are all about perspective. One person might kill to have someone else's life but that someone else might wanna die on the daily. I'm sure you've heard every possible boring, lame life story about being lonely and not feeling anything. Just pick one and apply it to me. I just wanna kms, but I'm too much of a pussy and that makes me feel even sadder. It's like losing at losing in life. It would be nice if there was a service that just did it for me. Off to fantasize about killing myself without ever doing it. RIP me, am I right? Probably just end up doing more drugs to make myself feel happy. This is a cry for help that I hope no one answers. Don't comment on this shit. I don't want the dopamine rush from seeing comments on this pathetic post.
