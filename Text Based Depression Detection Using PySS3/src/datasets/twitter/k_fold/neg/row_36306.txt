I've lost it.For background story, go here. Something I posted back a while ago.

I just sat their looking at the instrument I was going to do it with. Stopping myself from doing it after staring at it for a good hour I just sobbed. Now I'm resorting to reddit. I'm at such a low it's killing me figuratively and literally. 
The guy moving up on my ex is just too much. He moves fast and in a promiscuous way. Very arrogant and does it as if they've known each other for years. It hasn't even been a damn month. She let's him touch her a bit and kiss her on the face, except the lips. She denies the continuing "thing" they got, but I know this guy is just trying to get in on her. She's just gives people the benefit of the doubt too much. 
The thing that made me almost do the worst thing possible to myself is that they went to the movies to "hang" and the guy does all the normal stuff he usually does. Touching and moving on her. The only reason this time she let's him do slightly more is because he paid for the movie. WHAT THE FUCk.....urgh........I just don't...want to anymore. 
She said she was going to take me back but...I mean she went mute on me on purpose for the better but now it's not. Absolutely not. She basically paid back with her body and that's not the girl I know. Usually very resistant but why him? Why not resistant this time? Why fucking me? Why does it seem like only dickholes get it all? Hurhg... I know some would say that I shouldn't go for her if she is like this, but it really isn't a matter of that right now, rather what I can do....but it seems like there is only 1 thing I can do.....and I don't want to, yet I do. 

I'm at my lowest. On reddit. God....
Being an atheist doesn't help either. I can't hope or pray. Just try....but I'm giving up.......
