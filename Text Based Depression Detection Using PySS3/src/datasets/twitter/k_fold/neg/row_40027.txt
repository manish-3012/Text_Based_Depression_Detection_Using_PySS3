How and when do I leave my girlfriend that has postpartum depression and threaten suicide when I leaveHi Everyone,

  
Itâ€™s been one month since her abortion. Â She is physically doing well, but mentally, not so well. Â I get yelled at on a bi-weekly basis because I am not providing enough support for her.  
I am trying to support her, I cook and clean everyday, open to listen and talk every night, and sleep next to her at night. To her, this support is not enough. I am the only support she has because she does not want to tell her friends and family about what happened. Â Her friends and family are 300 miles away. Â She did tell one of her best friends, but her best friend is not going to support her because the best friend said she doesnâ€™t support her late-term abortion. Because of this, my GF is afraid to tell anyone else.  
My current support is not enough for my GF. Â She says she needs hope, commitment, and intimacy in our relationship. I still do not have feelings for her and do not believe or want to be in a relationship with her. Iâ€™ve talked about trying to find a therapist but she refuses to go to one until I have sex with her. She tells me I am not supporting her because I refuse to have sex with her and that makes her feel unwanted. I tell her that our relationship isnâ€™t working and she threatens to commit suicide because I am not trying to fix the relationship, she does not need to try with her life. Â She tells me she gave up our child for me and the least I can do is give her a committed relationship.  She says that is the only way she can heal. I am willing to continue to support her, just not in the way she needs support.

Whenever I bring up that i don't see a long term relationship, she goes and grabs a kitchen knife to play around, swinging it and practicing self stabbing motions. Here, I say anything (that i will try my best to make the relationship work, etc)  to just calm her down and drop the knife.  Once, she drove off in her car with a knife.  I couldn't find her so I called the police to keep an eye out.  She eventually comes back to the apartment where the police are and she gets sent to a psychiatric hospital where she stayed overnight.   
I understand she is going through a lot with the abortion and her job. Â Do I try be in a committed relationship with her even if my heart isn't in it just so she doesn't do anything dangerous? How and when do I leave her?  
TLDR:  
GF had a late term abortion (20 weeks). Â I want to support her and help her get through this but she needs a committed relationship from me and I am having a hard time providing. She blames the abortion on me and threatens to kill herself if I donâ€™t provide a committed relationship. A committed relationship means moving in with her, attending her every need, and being intimate with her. Â I do not see a long term future with her and do not want to be in a committed relationship. How and when do I leave her with her being okay?
