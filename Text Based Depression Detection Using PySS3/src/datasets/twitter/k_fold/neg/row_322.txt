Honestly, for the past week, I've been thinking of nothing but suicideI take my medication and I see my therapist tomorrow, but these thoughts just keep coming. While at work, all I can think of is wanting to go home and just hang myself. When I'm at home, I thinking of tying my bedsheets into a noose and ending it. I was doing fine for a while, but it's like all my progressive just hit reverse. I'm so tired and I just wish I had the courage to go through with it.
