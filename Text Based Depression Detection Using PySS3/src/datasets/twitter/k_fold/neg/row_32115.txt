(UPDATE) It's time for me to goMy next well intentioned disaster happened just like I predicted.  I fucked up like always.  

I was having an awesome night,  I did stand up at my first ever booked show and my gf came.  We had decided to take some time apart the same night as my previous post and I wasn't sure she would come.  But she surprised me and did. I did an awesome set and she came back to my place and that's where everything went wrong.  


She like to be in control and sometimes hold my neck during sex.  Tonight I tried to do the same thing back but my dark side came out.  We were making out and while I was on top of her I grabbed her neck for a few seconds, not hard but the gesture was enough.  I basically sexualy assaulted the woman I love beacuse of a misguided attempt to assert myself.  In that moment I was. Trying to get back control of my life symbolically and it ended up hurting someone.  


I can't be that person.  I have never, ever hit anyone or tried to harm them and the fact that I emotionally hurt someone kills me.  I can't get ahold of my life without hurting people.  

This sealed the deal for me.  I can't live with myself as I am and I can't change without destroying the people around me. I need to leave.  I should have done it on Monday before I had a chance to hurt her.  I am so fucking sorry.  I am so fucking sorry.
