I just want to know if I have the right to report my friend who is suicidal 

I want to start off this post by saying if you are under 18 don't read this cause this is sensitive issue

I have a best friend who I'll just call bud who I was on a phone call with cause he's now at grad school while I'm here at the college he used to go to. We had a deep conversation and in it I found out that he wants to take his own life and recently got a gun an ammunition to do so. Hes in a presage place and if it got out that he was suicidal his rep would be completely gone. I don't think anyone knows other then me that he is this way and I don't think he was gonna tell me but in the end he did.

some back story about me is I have tried to take my own life a couple times already and he knew of one and didn't report me. I don't feel like I have the right because I had tried to take my own that being said he's one of my best friends and if he ever was gone then I don't know what I or our other friends would do. he trusted me and I would be breaking that trust. I don't know if I have the right or not. 

no one around me would guess that I'm suicidal myself and I know no one around him thinks any different. I don't really care what happens to me I don't really matter but I know he does to so many people and if he was gone people would be devastated. would doing this push him over? would he really get the help he needs? do I have a right to do it or not?
