You wouldn't want to help me. I don't know how I can go on.I'll try and give a small background, though I don't want to justify or excuse any of the thoughts I have.

I'm fairly recently widowed, with a young son. I've been suffering from intrusive thoughts for a few months now, to the point where I totally believe them and I'm crippled with self doubt about how to be around my child.

I have scary thoughts and doubts that pop into my head in certain situations, but then even when I think I'm off the clock and thinking of something completely different or not really thinking at all I'll notice I've thought something truly terrible without even trying, and I realise the only conclusion, despite what I try to tell myself, is that I'm a bad person.

Tonight I decided I would watch some regular straight guy legal porn (I haven't watched any other kind, to clarify) to reaffirm what I believe are my attractions (girls), but while reading a book I was reminded of my wife's illness and to put it as bluntly as possible I was upset that I had thought of it because it had killed my desire to watch some porn.

Yes I could argue I wanted to watch the porn because I needed the reassurance that despite my fears I was still into women, and the need for that was taken away from me but not in a helpful way

Instead I just feel I've hit a new  low on where my mind will go, in a day, a month, a year of painful thoughts. And I don't think I can take another day of it.

**EDIT** The first reaction to my post appears to be a downvote. Clearly I'm not the only one who thinks I'm a horrible person.
