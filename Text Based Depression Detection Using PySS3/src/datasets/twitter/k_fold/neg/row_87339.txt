I want to give upIm just exhausted living with multiple issues, both mental and physical. I dropped out of 7th grade three years ago due to heart issues and I feel like i have nothing going for me in life. I barely have any friends, and the only person ive loved is breaking up with me since I struggled to talk at first. My anxiety and other mental issues make talking a pain, so getting a job will be hell. My parents fully expect me to never move out. I constantly get so lonely that its painful. I just want to die already.
