Tell me to do it alreadyThereâ€™s no reason not to and all I do is fantasize, suffer, and spread more toxicity.  

What am I supposed to do to reduce the burden on others?   I can fill out my will tomorrow.  Should I sell all my things?

I want to blow my brains out but I dont want to leave a mess so maybe Iâ€™ll just get drunk and fall asleep in the snow
