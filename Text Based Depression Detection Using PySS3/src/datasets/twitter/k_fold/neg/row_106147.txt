regretI wish I hadn't failed at hanging myself. I finally built up the courage and just like everything else in life I fell short. Why can't we just have and off switch? Why am I too much of a coward to try again and too much of a coward to live my life how I want? I'm just so tired of this, so tired of me. I wish I could just go to sleep.
