I want to kill myself but I have too many responsibilities to finish in the next month.I have the school play that Iâ€™m a main character in. My grades are at Dâ€™s and Fâ€™s and I need to bring them up or I fail and have to take the classes over again. Finals are coming up and I havenâ€™t studied at all because I assumed Iâ€™d be dead by now. I donâ€™t want to do any of this anymore but I know my theatre teacher is counting on me and Iâ€™d feel bad about letting down my other teachers when I couldâ€™ve actually tried to be a good student before I died. Part of me wants to kill myself right now and avoid all of those responsibilities as a bonus to not suffering anymore, but a part of me also feels guilty because Iâ€™m afraid I might fail at killing myself and Iâ€™ll have to come back with even more work to do. Then the largest part of me is afraid of dying so I donâ€™t want to die, but I really want to kill myself.
