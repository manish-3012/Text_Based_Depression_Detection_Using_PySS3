How to overcome urges?I could be having a normal day and all of a sudden the thoughts kick in. doing it isnâ€™t easy and painless thatâ€™s why i donâ€™t want to do it, i might survive and live with irreversible physical and mental damages that will make my situation even worse but i am stuck in an abusive home with no access to therapy or any psychiatric help , i donâ€™t want to die because i have been happy before and i know how liberating happiness feels like. 

My only option is to wait until the world opens up again so i can fly back to college and leave this toxic environment &amp; get professional help but it seems like every day the hopes of the world reopening it get lower.

Please tell me if there are things i can do to help with the urges because they have been more frequent lately i am going to try meditation and yoga if thereâ€™s any oils that help calm down please let me know
