my life is going nowhere.itâ€™s not going to get better. iâ€™ve accepted that no one cares about me or what i do. everyone would move on quickly if i ended my life. they would forget about me, and i would be replaced by someone much better. i am not special in any way at all, and i have no personality. i take bits and pieces from everyone else. all i want is to be liked by people, but i feel like everyone hates me. i overshare every time i talk to someone and end up pushing them away. iâ€™m seriously better off dead. i am a burden to everyone i know. their lives would be so much better if i didnâ€™t exist. iâ€™m so close to my breaking point. i really want to sleep forever. the worst part of it all is that i feel like my feelings arenâ€™t valid because i feel like iâ€™m doing this for attention. i just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. i wish i couldnâ€™t feel anything honestly.
