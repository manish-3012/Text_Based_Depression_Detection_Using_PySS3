My parents and doctors are partly to blameIf they got me on growth hormones as a kid I wouldâ€™ve grown normally. Now Iâ€™m like 5 â€˜6.5 and have childlike proportions. Very narrow shoulders. Iâ€™m now 20 and look 15. I mustâ€™ve had a hormone issue that never got addressed. Itâ€™s now far too late. Women love tall men with broad shoulders. I have none of those traits. Iâ€™m essentially a non playing character and everyday is hell. Iâ€™m also having nightmares of my school bullies everyday. Everyday and night is helli itâ€™s almost time.
