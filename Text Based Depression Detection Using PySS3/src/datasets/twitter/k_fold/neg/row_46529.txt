This world does not cater to people like meThere's not a good place for me to start, so I think it's best for me to just list off things in life that I've noticed give motivation to others.

Money, having an SO, career paths, hobbies, pets, drugs, friends, family, the future.

There's more but I can't think of any right now. What I'm trying to say is what normally keeps people in our society motivated to keep trying in whatever they're doing, has never interested me. I've talked with therapists and taken medication like I'm supposed to because I'm not normal, and neither have changed me. People have told me that it's alright if nothing interests me, but I at least can't kill myself because it would ruin my family. Well if the only reason to be alive is so others won't be sad, what kind of life is that? 

At this point I need to stop existing. I'm close to just walking into the woods and disappearing, and just this thought alone has been giving me the most excitement I've felt in my life.
