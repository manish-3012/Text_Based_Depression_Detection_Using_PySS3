Articulating what I thinkI'm neither intending to give help nor to get help with this post. I want to write what I don't dare to articulate to anyone in any way or form (also not via journaling). I'd like someone to read it and maybe reply. Here it goes.

I'm a young man living in some country in Europe. As a child I was interested very interested in life and fascinated by plants and animals, insects and cacti and the like. I spent a lot of time outside finding stuff out about what I would later find out falls under biology in general. Apart from this interest I was quite timid and a bit of a pushover, which showed in me crying a few times when nothing really bad happened, sometimes out of nothing at all.

A bit later, in what might be called highschool-ish age in school I was bullied a bit, which to me felt really horrible, which was partly because of me thinking that it was and being very sensitive. But nothing like other bullying-stories you hear and write about on the internet. One day when some of those guys walked behind me, throwing snowballs at me and my brother which they thought was fun, I stopped at a traffic light, someone grabbed my school bag (to wipe away some snow) which I understood as being pushed, I turned around and hit the guy as hard as I could on the side of his head, which resulted in it being swollen and my right wrist being sprained or at least very very swollen and unusable.

This ordeal resulted in me and my brother talking in the principals office with the principal and what we felt were our tomentors. Afterwards we never really had any problems with them, also thanks to switching classes (everyone did) to go to a class specializing in one field (like "artsy", "law" and "scientific" classes). The people of my new class were much friendlier.

I still felt that it was hard to DO things, any hobby, sports, meeting friends and so on. I rather spent time in the internet, first a lot of gaming and then more like watching movies and listening to classical music. Up to now (only a few years later) I've watched a couple of hundred movies, the best of them many times.

Around the time of me switching classes, my uncle died of cancer. He was a biologist; As a child I always wanted to become a biologist ("nature-investigator") and told people I'd become one, but after him dying not really anymore. My change of heart wasn't as drastic as this might sound to you; my interest changed over time from being fascinated by nature to not knowing what I wanted.

Because I at times felt really lonely and thought of myself as not really like other people, which I think is a feeling many if not every person has, I somehow thought myself unfit for being social. Not that I was antisocial or even asocial, I just concluded this while still being friendly, helpful and trying to keep my word. Others I figured saw me as normal as everyone else, even if I'd like to believe to be special (which I sometimes attempt to do via figuring out how intelligent I am to feel better I guess). I think I am special, because I'm the one knowing more about me than anyone else, even if that turns out to be too little.

After highschool (or college? I don't know your school system well) before I could go study I was drafted for mandatory military service. On recruiting day, I scored a medal/badge in sports (which I never thought I could do, because I'm quite thin and not fit) which felt really nice. Then the Major asked me what I wanted to serve as in the military, and as I read that security-soldiers were needed I told him I liked to become one. So he said yes.

Coming into the military very very nervous, I soon found out how it was. In the first few days we became our uniforms, and all our stuff, dozens of kilograms (or pounds) of it in total. Actually, the first thing I got was our service-weapon; the rifle. Because I was a security-soldier, I also got a nice pistol too. The first days were hell, not objectively, but for me; to be cut off from any place or people I knew and liked, in a unknown situation with tons of people from all over the country.

We learned all the ranks from the makrs on other peoples uniforms and hats, how to greet, stand, walk, what NOT to do with our weapons and other basic stuff. We also did lots of sports, because our barrack was a infantry recruits-school, one branch of the military doing lots of sports and being very fit. This was quite straining, as it was also November 1.5 years ago and at the location cold. Very, very cold to me, as I have Morbus Raynaud, a syndrome which makes the blood vessels in your hands constrict too much when exposed to cold. Everyones blood vessels constrict to avoid loosing to much heat over your hands, but mine almost close. So I always have cold hands, sometimes my fingers turn yellow from having to little blood, which you might think is like when your arm or leg or foot "falls asleep" and doesn't really hurt, but my hands did a lot. And every morning we did sports at 6.45 waking up doing push-ups on the sports-field, while the ground still having rime (frost). I witnessed while jogging someone landing with his foot on a step of some sorts and tearing his achilles-tendons apart in one foot.

In general, I was always exhausted, overloaded because I couldn't retreat to my own space being alone for some time, being on the edge all the time of fear of anything negative (like certain situations of being made fun of and other things). 

It wasn't as bad as it might sound, it was hard, yes, but not really... bad(?) I don't know. One of the things I really liked was shooting. The day I first shot my rifle was when I started panicking having while walking up some mountain (the one which we climed every second day) and starting to cry. I was pale and not well at all, so I asked one of the group leaders of our Platoon and lied of having a stomach ache or something, after which he gave me strong painkillers. Afterwards, we did something during which I tear open some flesh around my thumb and started to bleed through my leathergloves, which I wore all the time because of the cold. Then bleeding through the gloves, not feeling the blood and the sight of what obviously had to hurt, part of the platoon took turns at shooting our rifle for the first time. Which I did.

I can remember how it felt having just shot the first time, and it was an ambiguous feeling which I somehow liked. The guy next to me struggled pulling the trigger; he couldn't. Our platoon-leader came up to him and spoke softly, calmed him down and suggested he gave it another try. He couldn't and then gave his weapon to the leader, because security-soldiers have to be able to shoot, otherwise you get put in another branc of the military.

This was special in two regards; first I began liking shooting and secondly I had the first of what I much later would call panic attacks, but neither I nor psychiatrists know what it actually was. The weeks after that we shot every single day, either pistol, rifle or both. I liked shooting the two different weapons a lot; the couple of times we shoot on 300meter (around 1000 feet) targets I was (one of) the best of the platoon. I would have received the shooting badge if I stayed longer in the military, but more about leaving it later.

A couple of weeks later I had another panic attack, then another one and they grew more and more frequent. I had them more frequently in situations where you are under stress physically and/or psychologically, but no one thing would reliably produce a panic attack. I had terrible anxiety and really bad thoughts, switching between wanting to leave everything behind and pushing through to become a competent, reliable, fit person, which I still think I could become. I thought positively about GOING to the military, but I am ambiguous about THE military in general. I just thought it could be some sort of "school of life" for me, learning skills like being able to withstand pressure, being physically strained and being resistent in general. But that was not meant to be.

I can't really describe how having one of these panic attacks feels like, but it's not quite how panic attacks are when you read about them. It was almost as if I thought myself into them, even though it is more accurate to describe them as happening to me than as doing something. While I had them I stopped wanting to exist, which overspilled into my thoughts, my perspective on life. I'd say I became depressed, if I wasn't already before I joined the military.

The cameradery I experienced was really something by the way. We were harsh and friendly, respectful and joking all the time. We regularly went a couple of nights out ("military exit"?), ate dinner and/or drank alcohol. It was fun, a welcomed relief from normal training and stuff.

I don't know how articulated my thoughts were, but in hindsight I'd say that I wanted to shoot myself with our pistol. Because the ammunition was stored safely and we only got to see it when we shot with something and were controlled heavily afterwards, so that we didn't smuggle something from the shooting range we weren't allowed to, I would have had to do it while I was with others shooting. I never had an accurate plan or anythign. I just felt that I wanted out of there, especially while having attacks, or to cease existing. I thought about ending my life extensively (which I still do from time to time but never seriously now).

As I got a couple of hours at the doctors for checking my hands because of Morbus Raynaud, the doctor noticed something or asked me something which got me (dunno how) to share what I'm experiencing, my thoughts (but not so precisely as to how to end my life), my attacks and how I felt. He recognized the attacks; others have experienced something similar/ the same; he made an appointment at a psychiatrist outside the village the recruits-school was located. A week later, during which I had my attacks every single day and was really ill, even though during the exits I was happy, friendly and stopped caring about it, I got to the psychiatrist, after having spent a day at the military-hospital. He wrote that I couldn't continue my service and wrote a notice. The day after I spent in the hospital again (I think) and later gave my whole equipement and my weapons back and left the military.

During my service, I often talked with different group-leaders about this and even the platoon-leader a couple of times. They listened, spoke kindly and told me I could do the military. If it got too much, I'd have to say to get some time out (while having the attacks and crying silently in streams). Generally I cried a lot, in the end every single day, it didn't matter who was around me, often in front of my whole platoon and once even in the big canteen in front of a big part of the recruiting schools- recruits. My platoon was really supportive but I still failed the military, the one thing I thought could make me a better human and resilient. I thought this was my one chance at transforming into what I personally regard is "better", NOT that of anyone else/society.

One group leader I spent some time with at the recruiting a year before even gave me his personal phone number and offered to listen or meet me if anything was or I wanted to hurt myself, which was very kind of him and brings me to tears right now.

anyways, back at home I told my parents (still living with them) and they were a bit shocked but quite supporting. I got an appointment with a local psychiatrist and he is to this day the one I can talk to (every 1-2 weeks). It's wrong to say I don't have anyone else to talk to - I have. But doing so is too hard for me in my current situation and I choose not to. My psychiatrist is very old and very wise and we often talk about life, consciousness, free will and other intellectually stimulating things very openly. I think hes on par with my interests and very intelligent, so our talks are always very thoughtful and thought-heavy. 

I am still depressive and am taking medication against it. I started studying social/cultural anthropology in my major and switched my minor from history to biology. One thing I aspire/dream about doing but not believing that I could is to bring the natural and social sciences closer together, namely sociocultural anthropology and biology/biological anthropology. All the new ideas stimulate me a lot and bring me to work on my worldview a lot. I aspire to bring things together generally and have an informed and holistic view of the world, a bit like Gregory Bateson did in his "Steps to an Ecology of Mind", which is very interdisciplinary.

While being very sad from time to time, I don't think I'd commit suicide in the near future. And a year ago I didn't think I'd make it to the end of 2017, wanting to jump in front of the train I daily use to commute. I still have those thoughts, but never the intention. I'm just curious of how I could commit suicide and what woudl happen afterwards.

I started listening to Jordan Petersons Lectures on Youtube and would like to say that they changed my life for the better, who so many of his fans wrote him in the thousands of letters and many more emails he is receiving from them. But he only changed my personal philosophy (like some "mental masturbation") without really changing how I act, feel and think. But here's what he still changed: I started reading on Pragmatism as a philosophy (James S. Peirce's writings), I want to read Jung, Nietzsche, Dostoyefsky and Solshenizyn and some other of Petersons recommendation (als his Maps of Meaning). Generally he sparked my interest for reading and things like political belief, Postmodernism (which I want to get a good overview about with an open mind and less with pre-formed negative opinions about it that I picked up from Petersons lectures), Gender and other things. I have often discussions with other students of different study-years and sometimes feel like I'm ultra-conservative. I'm in the middle, as someone far-left-leaning guy in his masters-degree told me, even though I am presenting myself as if I was ultra conservative. I feel this way because in the social sciences almost everyone is a lefty, and quite a lot of them far-leftists with some marxist/anarchist/socialist thinking dispersed through the minds of many students. After many heated debates I began having a more open mind, being lest righteous and opinionated and wanting to have actual, real conservations rather than discussions during which either side tells the other why they themselves are right and the other is wrong. 

Maybe I can manage to get my life together, get some hobbies, clean out my room as Peterson suggests in his 12 Rules for Life (which I'm reading) and stop my bad habits (porn, internet, staying up until 1o clock or later and getting too little sleep) and instead become more articulated, well educated in art, literature,  history and philosophy, more courageous, physically fit, mentally stable and start transgressing my comfort-zone to widen it'r range. Social Anthropology will help as our method of gathering data is field research, in other cultures, other languages, learning the language and local behaviours which is SO MUCH over my comfort zone that I will be very proud of myself if I can manage to carry out such field research (usually alone). 

Above paragraph is what I think about my future, with occasional thoughts of suicide, what I want to do with my life and feeling lonely or miserable.

Long story short: The military made me depressed (or at least increased it) so that I once wanted to shoot myself with my service weapon (pistol). I'm going regularly to a therapist, take medication and have some hopes for the future now, not least thanks to the great therapist and to Jordan Peterson.

Thank you all!
