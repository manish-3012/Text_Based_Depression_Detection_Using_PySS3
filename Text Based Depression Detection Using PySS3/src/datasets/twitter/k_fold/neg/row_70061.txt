Life is not Worth Dying ForI know you're out there. I know it hurts. I know you feel alone. I know you rage against the callous disposition of the world. I know you think there's no hope. I know you're tired.

I know.

I won't sing a song of glory or praise for life and its infinite riches. There's no golden rainbow around the corner to make it all worth while. I won't tell you the world is your oyster, or that a handy set of bootstraps can turn your life around. Those are all lies, and I'd be insulting you and embarrassing myself to think a stupid philosophic parable legitimately encompasses your turmoil.

But I can say you can use your sadness, focus your rage. Hate the thing that put you here. Fume against life if you must. You had no choice of how you got here, your circumstances, or how your best intentions somehow make it worse. Life is your enemy. No matter how old you are, you've not seen one iota of the barrage of destruction it could levy upon you; being alive is dangerous business. And if you die, it wins.

Don't let life troll you to death. Ever since I was five, I've wanted to punch life square in the gonads. I've cheated death numerous times, fought depression for decades, been an outcast among outcasts, and let my obliviousness drive possible friendships into dust. All those things and more hurt every day, but even when I don't want to live, neither do I want to die. Every second I'm alive, I'm telling life to go fuck itself.

I won't let life and its endless barrage of trials and tribulations defeat me. Maybe it won't work for you, but it's worth a try.
