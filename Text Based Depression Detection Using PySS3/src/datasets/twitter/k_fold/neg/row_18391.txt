Every day is just like electroshock therapy session for my soulNothing happens but studying. I have to study all the time. Every conversation my mother begins is about studying. Everyday I have to do what I hate. 

Can't they see that this goddamn studying already made me a walking ghost? That it sucked all the emotions and feelings of me. That my failure at the final exam absolutely destroyed me emotionally?

I can't talk to others. Every talk is a torture for me. I fail at remembering simple things. I fail even at being myself. 

I wish I was dead. I wish I could kill myself.
