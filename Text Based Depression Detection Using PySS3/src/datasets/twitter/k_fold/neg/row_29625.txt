I feel like the world is a bowl of creamy potato soup and I'm a stupid fucking ant that crawled in and is now slowly drowning.Spent four hours today trying to remind myself not to die. I'm so alone. I'm broke. I am getting tired of being tired. I just want to go to the beach. I just want to smoke weed and play guitar. I was happy when I did that before. I could be myself. Why is that too much to ask for? Can I just go somewhere and grow my own food and go fishing? I should probably sleep soon... I wasted two fucking thousand dollars on this stupid bullshit course I'm taking. Two thousand dollars would have gotten me like six or nine months of hanging out on a beach in Central America. Then I could have figured something else out. Like working online or something. I don't fucking know. But now I wasted it all and I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I don't want to die, but I want this shit to stop. I hate myself for wasting everything. I feel like I don't deserve to keep living. I feel disconnected, like I'm watching myself die. I've felt that way for a long time now.

Why are there always bruises on my legs? I don't remember getting them. There's this big one on my shin that's been there for months.
