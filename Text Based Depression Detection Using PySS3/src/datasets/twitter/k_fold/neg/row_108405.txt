A failure at everything, including dying.I have posted on here a few times in the past, and every time writing these posts alleviates some amount of the pressure being forced down on me. but I'm starting to feel like even now, the pressure is just going to continue to pile on. 

Last week, I took a combination of Mirtazapine, sertraline, and another pill I can't remember the name to, a total of 25+ pills, all at once. 

Within an hour I was feeling tired (Effects of Mirtazapine) Half an hour after that, I threw them all back up, I sat in the bathroom and for nearly 2 hours straight I just wept, sobbed and felt like a complete failure. 

My family have all but ignored that I have an issue, My friends have all but abandoned me, thrown me to the wolves and are just letting these moments continue. I don't have anyone to turn to now, I don't have anybody to help alleviate all this hell I'm dragging myself through. Therapists are putting me on an almost 3-month waiting list, I've been referred to a psychiatrist but their list is almost as long, I just don't know what more I can physically or mentally do. 

The main reason I am writing all of this is that Im back to how things were last week, I just want to go. Find any way out and just be done with it, I'm a failure in the eyes of my family, my friends, and even myself.
