I don't think I'm suicidal but I just dont see why I need to keep on going (let me explain)Life is a clusterfuck loop, and I'm tired. I was born in the wrong place in the wrong time, and If I had to decide my birth I would of rather not be born. Since I was little I've realized the privilege people have over me. Everyday for the past 17 years, I've woken up to the feat of someone coming up to my door and taking me and my family away from the life I've created and theirs. The burden of not being able to do things others can kills me inside. This weight keeps gnawing at me saying I can never be normal, and I wont. I go to school but I see no future, because I have none. I can't study and frankly I have no motivation. my only option so I can stay is marrying and having kids. I don't want to give anyone my problems. This brings me to ending my life, I can say I've been depressed over my situation and that a big reason why. I just dont see the point in living when I dont have a chance. Right now, I'm not going to do it maybe in a few years? I know my parents, friends will be but I can't hide for the rest of my life. What I really want to know is if there is a way to euthanize myself or do legally kill myself? Sounds stupid but I'm looking into it, I want to go not hurting myself. I watched the good life last episode and I kinda wish that door when your done living existed. It made me think of the peace I would be at no longer carrying my burden.
