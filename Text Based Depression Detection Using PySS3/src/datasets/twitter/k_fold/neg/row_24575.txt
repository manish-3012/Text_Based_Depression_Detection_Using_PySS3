AnniversarySo tomorrow marks one year since I attempted suicide and came the closest I have come to dying. This year I'm in a psychiatric hospital for attempting to hang myself on Monday. Honestly can I expect anything better in my life? it's just a roller coaster and it seems that I have more lows than highs. After everything I've been through mainly from all the abuse suffered as a young child. I wonder if I can cope with the misery of life. I just want to be at peace and I think that will only happen when I'm not alive anymore.
