I'm done.I'm just done. I'm tired and as much as I'd hate to admit it,  I was carrying on only because of a select few family members whose images kept forming in my head just as I was about to do it/envisioned myself ending it all, and the fact that I chickened out three out of four times I attempted suicide. I've been dragging on since March 2016 (my first suicide attempt due to anxiety problems and lack of communication with my family) and I'd set a deadline till 2019 to end myself. 
I've thought of self-harm quite a few times but never done it since I've always thought why the slow the process of ending myself. I'm increasingly becoming a burden on everyone around me so it's now or else I'll live to see myself become the biggest liability and I'd be able to do nothing about it. Plus,  I let myself down a long time ago so I was trying to live for others since the past couple of years. I've thought of getting ECT as a last hope but I pretty much know my calls for help will be unanswered. 
I seriously regret confessing to my family that I "was" suicidal and lying to them that I won't do anything like that ever. They'll feel worse now and I'm too fucking tired to leave a note.
