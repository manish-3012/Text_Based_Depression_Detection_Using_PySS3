33, scared of committingHello,

I'm at a point of decision and not feeling like I can follow through on what I set out to do. 

 I have bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety.  I attempted college multiple times in my twenties, but always left due to my illness and lack of direction.  I struggled to keep jobs as well.  I finally set out to the oilfield in 2012 and got a job on a drilling rig.  It was very hard work but also fulfilling, and I managed to do it for 1.5 years before quitting.  I quit because I worked 60 out of 75 days (12 hour shifts of hard dangerous labor), working my scheduled two weeks and then filling in for people on the other two weeks.  I was too worn out to control my symptoms and had to quit.  

After a few months I got another oilfield job and by all accounts was doing well, although I had to battle through very nasty mental illness symptoms on the job.  I did that for almost a year, turned 30 and thought I'd found my spot in life finally.  Then the bottom fell out of oil prices, and I was laid off along with many others.  I had no job and was still sick.  

After collecting unemployment for six months and being isolated in my apartment I got a job at the water/sewer department in a city about 30 miles away.  I tried hard to keep it but my anxiety grew and grew and I ended up half-psychotic anxiety/insomnia and had to quit.  At that point I was eligible for medicaid and started seeing a psychiatrist.  He prescribed medications that ended up working.  Because of being on medicaid I was also eligible for tuition assistance from the state, and I found an online program for process/power plant technology.  I started it up thinking that it would be similar to oilfield work, and would pay well.  I worked part time as a janitor while going to school.  

Almost 2 years later and I've finished the program.  But I'm scared of moving on and taking the next step. Scared to work in a power plant, and I'm questioning why I chose something so daunting.  I think my ego from the oilfield led me to that choice.  I feel hopeless and disgusted with myself, even though I'm not as sick as I used to be.  Suicide is popping up frequently, and I need a place to talk about my life.  Thanks for reading.
