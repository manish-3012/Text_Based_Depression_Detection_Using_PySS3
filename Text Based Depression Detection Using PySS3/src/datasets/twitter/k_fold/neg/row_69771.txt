press to give emotional support to a fucked up personhuge probability i am overthinking but try convincing my mind that friday i got dumb high on marijuana with a friend it was only us two we chilled in mcdonald's for a few hours i remember making wack jokes, trembling, speaking to myself, just the regular shit high people do, but i don't remember a huge portion of my night i think i weirded him out, he wont speak to me anymore my greatest fear is that my unconscious mind is homosexual and that i acted in such a manner with him, if he is just pissed off cause i was being retarded and maybe said a few retarded things to him, idgaf, he has iust not responded so far after my few attempts to phone/ message him, only telling me ya on text like im some sort of bitch i probably was acting like one, but if that is all i did idgaf, if in my weed fuelled retardation i hit on him in a gay manner then my reputation and life is tarnished and I will have to move somewhere else, i make part of a society of recent immigrants and we are all including me not tolerant of any of that, and if i a'm that i have no trouble ending my own life honoroubly i know consciously i am straight, but it is said weed reveals who you really are, and if i am really gay then i dont know what to think, i am repulsed by homosexual behaviour sober and i dont remember anything different high i might have done something which seemed gay but that is far enough can a sane person help me out, and embracing gayness is not an option
