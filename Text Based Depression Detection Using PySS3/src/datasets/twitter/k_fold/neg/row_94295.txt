Does it really get betterI lost both my mom and papa to cancer and really donâ€™t have any family left. I value my relationships so much that I often feel misunderstood by those closest to me. Iâ€™ve had thoughts for years, but recently itâ€™s been flooding and I really doubt things are gonna get better. Iâ€™ve been through child abuse, poverty, death and I feel Iâ€™ve let my mental illnesses get the best of me. Does it really get better?
