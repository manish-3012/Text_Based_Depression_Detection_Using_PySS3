I tried to get help but I couldn't and now I'm doneI spent weeks thinking about going back to my treatment and trying to recover and have a good life. I tried to schedule an appointment and the doctor doesn't want me to go unless I bring someone with me.

I can't do it. Mostly because I'm completely alone (I have no friends and I don't have any contact with my family, except for my parents and my brother). I don't want to bring anyone from that close family because my brother doesn't care, I would rather be dead than to be next to my dad for more than 1 second, and my mom already disappointed me a million times during all my life.

I love my mom and she surely would be my first - and only - optionÂ  but I prefer if she's not involved in my treatment for a lot of reasons. Needless to say, the doctor wasn't exactly interested in hearing all those reasons.

I know I'm supposed to just get over it, find another doctor and keep the treatment. But I already went in like 5 or 6 professionals in 2 years and they ALL said the same thing. I always stopped going because they wanted my mom to go there and they wouldn't stop talking about THEIR wishes so they couldn't hear MY reasons. I don't want to try again just to see the same result

no one understands me, probably because no one tries to hear me. I don't understand why it is so hard to listen to me? Is it that unbearable to stay with me?



I didn't tell my mom I canceled the appointment so I have an excuse to go out next week. That's it, I'm tired of everything
