I can't see my psychiatrist or therapist until late August, and I'm feeling so unstable.I thought I'd be fine about waiting that long. And after my last "attempt" I thought I'd never go back to feeling this way again, because I saw how much it hurt my mom. But I'm here. I wanna take the easy way out and just escape. I know it's a pussy move because I'm still in high school and my life hasn't even been that harsh, but I'm so tired. My sister was literally in a ward and was released today, so I can't tell anyone what's going on either. I'm too dramatic anyways. Probably don't even have depression or anxiety. I always feel like I fake my anxiety attacks or bouts of depression, and it's tiring. I'm too much of a pussy to attempt again, but the thought is tempting. I wanna rest.
