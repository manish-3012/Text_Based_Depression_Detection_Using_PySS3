I'm so so so fuckedHey guys,

I fucked up really bad and I don't see a way of recovering from this.

I just finished the Spring semester at college, and I'm pretty sure I failed a class. This, on top of having dropped a class earlier in the semester, has both killed my GPA and reduce the total credit hours I actually passed so far, and now I'm at risk of losing my scholarship unless I take summer classes.

The plan was to talk to my parents about taking some easy classes over the summer to help bring my GPA and credit hour count back up.

My parents currently don't know that I've failed or dropped anything, but when I talked to them about taking classes over the summer, they stated that unless I dropped or failed anything, there should literally be no reason I'm taking anything over the summer.

My parents are extremely strict Asian parents and have threatened to pull me out of college if I under-perform and I am extremely scared of saying anything to them because I don't want my life to be even worse than it already is. They already limit my social life and I'm afraid they'll lock me up in the house if they get a hint of this. I really don't want to drop out of college. They said that I shouldn't be losing any scholarships, and I shouldn't be taking any extra semesters to finish my degree, so I'm pretty sure I'm definitely fucked.

I really don't know what to do, there doesn't seem to be any sort of recourse from this and I really feel like the only way out of this is to just die. Like I would much rather just wait for my next paycheck and buy a gun to end it then talk to them.
