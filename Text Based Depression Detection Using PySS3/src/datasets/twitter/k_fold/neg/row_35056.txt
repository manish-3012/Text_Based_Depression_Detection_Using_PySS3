Attempting suicide as a cry for help.I am so overwhelmed with sadness and I have become seriously suicidal. But I am 15 years old so I need my parents permission to get professional help, but I know that they don\`t believe me. They just think I\`m ungrateful. I am going to kill myself soon if I can\`t get professional help. Because if I don\`t get professional help then I won\`t get better, and if I don\`t get better than there is no reason to live. I know this because I\`ve tried for so long to help myself without professional help.  Do I have to attempt suicide for them to believe me? I want to hurt myself in a drastic way because I feel that\`s the only to prove that I\`m really hurting and not faking it. Should I attempt suicide as a cry for help? What should I do? Please don\`t tell me to just talk to my parents calmly. I\`ve tried to do that for years and it\`s led me no where. I have a feeling that today is my last day on this earth. I feel sick just writing this post it\`s my last resort for help.
