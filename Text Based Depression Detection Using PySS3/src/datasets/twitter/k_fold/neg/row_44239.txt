My short note for whenever the time is right	My words never made much impact on anyone in life. I don't expect that to suddenly change just because I'm about to kill myself, so I will be brief. Truth is, I never felt like I belonged here, or anywhere I've been, with anyone I've connected with in my life. That is if I have ever connected with anyone. I am doubtful these days. Either way, nobody had anything to do with causing this decision. This was a choice I made all on my own.

Anyways, that's it. I'm done. I love you all. Goodbye.

My note above is so short because I donâ€™t really have an explanation for why I feel the way I do. Iâ€™m going to be 23 and I am in the best shape of my life. Iâ€™m working hard, paying off a new car, Iâ€™m lifting weights, making friends â€” communicating. Point is Iâ€™ve made so much progress yet still Iâ€™m laying here unable to sleep, uneasy even after years of soul searching.
