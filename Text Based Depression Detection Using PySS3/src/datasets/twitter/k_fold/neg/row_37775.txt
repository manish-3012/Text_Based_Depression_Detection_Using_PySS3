Expectations not met.Am i suicidal? Maybe? Maybe not.. I donâ€™t know, yet.. Iâ€™m a failure. Thatâ€™s what i think.. and know.. Theyâ€™re expecting too much, Iâ€™m trying my best but still not enough.. I love them but they always say iâ€™m giving them headaches.. heartaches. What would you do when those people you love thinks youâ€™re a burden. I donâ€™t know what to do. I really donâ€™t know. Now iâ€™m here standing at the back of a gasoline station, cigarette lit up, eyes sweating..
