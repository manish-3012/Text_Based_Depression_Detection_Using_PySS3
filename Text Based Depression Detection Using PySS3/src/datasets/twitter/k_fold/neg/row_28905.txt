Panic attacks/Depression. If it doesn't work out, I'll most likely commit suicide, or force myself into a hospital.Okay folks, been in a panic and dperession for awhile. I''ve lost some of the paperwork I was sent in, for renewing my housing assistance, which lowers the rent I pay because I am disabled and was chosen in a raffle. I have very little time to turn it in. It was in my left pocket when I got it, and put on top of my stereo system, but now it's gone. I go to the office tomorrow, and can only hope that they will have the paperwork that I need and can print it out for me while there. The reason I lost some of the paperwork was likely due to too much alcohol, I barely remember anything I did yesterday, and I may have misplace it, tossed it, I don't know... I live next to a high bridge, that I crossed while blackout drunk, just to get another drink... Very unsafe. I've been drinking too much lately, which only leads to more depression, anxiety, and stupid mistakes. If this doesn't go through, I can't be sure I'll be capable of facing my some of my family (who thinks I'm an idiot) to begin with, for screwing up something that was so good for me personally. I know that negative things will be said to me, and I will have to just accept it, and be honest to say "I know, I should probably killl myself.) I can still live on very low income, without assistance, by myself... So it's not the end of the world if it doesn't work out, but screwing this up would just prove how stupid I really am to everyone.
