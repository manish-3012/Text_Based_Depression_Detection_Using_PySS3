I'm fucking sick of dealing with lifeI don't want to get better. I don't want to reevaluate the choices I make or the thoughts that I have. I want to die. I don't want to learn and grow. I don't want to understand others. This is all pointless bullshit. I am a fucking failure of a human being because I do not want to learn and grow. I'm fucking sick and tired of being alive. There is nothing good about existence. Absolutely fucking NOTHING. It's either me or everyone else because I can't contain this rage and because being seen as a crazy person who needs fixing is just fuel for the fucking fire it might as well be me.
