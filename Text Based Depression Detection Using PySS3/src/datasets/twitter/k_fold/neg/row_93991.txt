Why is it so hard to pull the trigger.Iâ€™m so sick and tired of living. Iâ€™m back to cutting myself all the time. I am a terrible human being and Iâ€™ve thrown away every relationship Iâ€™ve ever had. My family doesnâ€™t talk to me, I donâ€™t have any friends, my ex has blocked me and refuses to talk to me. 

Iâ€™m miserable. I spend most of the day in bed not eating. I talk to no one. This isnâ€™t living Iâ€™m already dead. So why canâ€™t I finish it? Why canâ€™t I just cut so deep that I bleed out. All I want is to die Iâ€™m so tired. Everyone is better off without me theyâ€™ve already moved on. I just want to die so badly. Maybe if I hang myself Iâ€™ll have more success? 

This isnâ€™t a life worth living. Iâ€™m basically already dead Iâ€™m just so tired of existing. Please I just want to die. I donâ€™t even cry anymore Iâ€™m just so numb. Cutting helps me keep it together but Iâ€™m tired of hanging on. 

God Iâ€™m so fucking worthless.
