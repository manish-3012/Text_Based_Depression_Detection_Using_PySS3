Over thisI have a boyfriend. I have some family. And Honestly I should be happy. But I'm not. I'm just so over it. There are no other words to describe how exhausted I feel having to pretend I feel anything positive. Yeah. Maybe it'll get better. Maybe it will just get worse. Regardless having to pretend to be happy and having to plaster a smile on my face and act like all my shit is together is tiring. And I'm done pretending.
