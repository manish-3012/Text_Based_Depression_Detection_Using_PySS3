I just want to be happyI stopped taking my Abilify about a month ago. Haven't told my doc yet. Even with them, I still felt suicidal. Didn't see the point in it anymore.

My mom and I used to get along great, but now we argue constantly about petty shit. I just feel like she would be happier with me out of her hair.

I love my boyfriend more than anyone, but he deserves someone better than me. I feel like he settled for me. He deserves someone better than me. He's an amazing person who deserves someone equally amazing. That someone isn't me.

College is just going to make me have anxiety attacks all over again. Then that will stress my mom out, and she'll just yell at me to stop being a nervous wreak. It's just going to be high school all over again. I can't handle that for another two years.

I'm not good at anything, I don't even think I'm good at the career I'm going into. It's going to be a dead end career and I'm going to be stuck at a dead end job for the rest of my life with no hope of advancement or to acheive my dream of traveling the world.

I don't see the point in it anymore. Nothing is ever going to get better and I'm going to end up poor and sad for the rest of my life. Everyone will benefit from me not being here anymore.

I can't go to my mother for help. She'll just say that if I do I'm going to hell and yell at me for being a selfish little bitch.

I was having a horrible week last week, I would've ended it last week, but my boyfriend's grandfather died. I had to be there for him.

I can only imagine my boyfriend being sad when I'm gone, but I'm sure he'll find someone better. He will, because he's an amazing person. 

I just don't know when I'll do it yet, SW. When I do, I'll let you know.
