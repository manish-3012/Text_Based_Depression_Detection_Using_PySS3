One of those nights againI'm sitting up late at home thinking about how my life fucking sucks, how no one likes me, how nothing really is keeping me from suicide except me being a big pussy scared of death somehow, and being afraid of being judged (Yes even in death).

Most people are probably doing something fun or something they benefit from tonight, whilst I am not doing anything!

My life is one big mistake, wasted time and money on me for what?
I will never be anything to anyone, and I wish I could give back every time someone wasted anything on me and say ''sorry!''.

I have to be an unintelligent, ugly, prick, for 60-70 more years (I'm 17) unless I take my life soon or am lucky and get some kind of deadly disease then maybe people will notice me for one second.

It will probably be during this years summer vacation from school when I will be lonely for several weeks, not like I am not lonely during school weeks too, but at least I am surrounded by people.
People a lot happier than me it seems like, they have real friends and girlfriends, meanwhile I barely have a handful of people that only know the ''social'' me and don't care, and I have to see the girl who I like everyday on my way to school which hurts.

I am tired of all of this.
