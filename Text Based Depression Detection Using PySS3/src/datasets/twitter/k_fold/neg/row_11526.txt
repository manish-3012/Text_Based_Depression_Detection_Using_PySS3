Cant take it anymoreEveryone who told me that they will be here, that I can talk to them, or that they care has left me now. I cant hold everything in and I'm just ready to explode and do something irrational. I cant talk to my own parents either because they start yelling at me. I really just want to leave this world and see what happens when I'm not around, see if anyone who has abandoned my hopeless ass will even care.
