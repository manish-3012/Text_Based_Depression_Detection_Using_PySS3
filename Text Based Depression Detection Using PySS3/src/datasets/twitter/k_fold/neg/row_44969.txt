Tired of depression and anxietyIt just never ends... the medication I am on doesn't help and idk if when I tell my Dr. she will give me something that will help or if there is anything that can even help.  

I have social anxiety, I hate crowds and public places and practically the only time I leave my house is if I am going to work or university.  I feel like no one wants me and thus every relationship I have been in has ended because "oh you just work too much" or "oh we never do anything."  

What's the point anymore?  No one even cares what I have been through.
