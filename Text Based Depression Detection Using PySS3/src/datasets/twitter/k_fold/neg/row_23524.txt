I'm tired of everything.I can't take it anymore. Every day that passes by I just get more and more mentally tired. I stopped caring about my well being because I just want it all to end. I've been depressed for a long time due to my abusive mom and even though I no longer live with her the trauma she gave me still lingers even years later. Nowadays I just feel like I'm nothing but a burden to my grandfather who I am living with. I am unemployed no matter how hard I try to get a job. I can't drive a fucking car cause I'm to busy looking for a job. A friend I had for the longest time cut ties with me making me feel abandoned. I just can't anymore. I wanna just end my life and stop all this pain. When I said I stopped caring about myself I meant it. I almost got hit by a train once while walking with my cousin to a near by park to meet up with her friends and simply didn't care. I didn't care that I almost died right in front of my 12 year old cousin. I wake up everyday and question why do I bother getting up? Why should I have to close my eyes only to open them back up several hours later? Why don't I just end it today?.

Sometimes I have the urge to just go to the tracks. Sit there and just wait for the next train to come and take me away from this world. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. This life i live is trash. I burden those i love and care about the most. I just want it all to stop.
