I just need helpI feel like a heaviness in my stomach, like a poison that is sucking me out of reality i feel alone like i donâ€™t fit in, i moved from Mexico to California to be with a girl because i thought that would make me happy, 3 years later i feel lonelier and emptier than ever before i just donâ€™t see any reasons to live anymore. Iâ€™m 21 and i want to die
