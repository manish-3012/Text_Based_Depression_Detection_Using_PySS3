i have nothing to live forI have nothing worth living for anymore. My family and 2 friends just aren't enough anymore. I know if I did it they would be hurt, but they'd soon get over it. I'm nothing special. I'm unbelievably forgettable and replaceable. School does nothing for me, and is honestly a waste of my limited time. I see a future of despair and loneliness, and a degree isn't going to fix it. And yeah, things might get better at some point, but I don't think I can wait for that. Things now are too bad, and any reprieve that I may get in the future wont last. So I might as well end the cycle.
