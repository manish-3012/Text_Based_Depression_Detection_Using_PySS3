SuicideHello everyone, whatever my name may be, it is not important, I come asking for, why the fuck should I keep on living, I fell in love with a person, the person, they who I thought I wanted to be with for the rest of my life, but now, I don't know, I love them, I truly do, I wanted to marry them one day, have a family with them, even die of old age with them, but I feel hurt, like, a knife stabbed through my heart, I once felt this before, a bit younger, it took me a full year for it to subside and I got better and felt happy because of this person.  
The only time where I am truly happy is with them, I am not sure, but I think I am addicted to em, I love them so so much, I don't know if others have felt the same but, after so many betrayals, so much pain, so much anger and frustration, I don't feel anymore, I truly don't, nor happiness nor sadness, the only thing I felt that made me go was rage and anger, with them, I became alive, I TRULY am only alive with them, I cant live without them, I have confessed my love, and they have said that they are also in love with me, but now, they've said they are afraid of falling in love with an individual who I shall not name.  
I don't know what to do, them saying that, it hurt, it really fucking hurt, a pain that I thought I will never feel and or again, I have tried to kill myself before, but, I couldn't, I am a coward and a pathetic human.  
I guess I am only useful for getting advise from and then bye bye.  
I do not think I'm a good person, never was sure, what is being good, is it you anting to get out of your way and helping someone, or is it about being naturally good, whatever it may be, I am not a good person.  
I am cold, merciless, and ruthless, I help, but what does "helping" does compared to my past and sins.  
Neither does my country give a fuck about me, I am from the middle east, and the country I'm in is one of the worst countries I'd say in the whole world, in here, it's an animal kingdom, you don't get to be happy, you don't get to live, just maybe survive.  
Some have said for me to get out of here and seek somewhere else, other's have said by leaving and finding a new home I will feel better, but, my life is only good and happy with the them, The one I love  
I don't even know why I am writing this, probably no one will see it, if anyone does, thank you for reading my hectic and maniacal writing, it's just, I don't know, and, I don't know what to do.
