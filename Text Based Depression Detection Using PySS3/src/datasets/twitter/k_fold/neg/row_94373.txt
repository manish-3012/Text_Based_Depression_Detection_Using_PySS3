Would you consider dedicating your live to others instead of killing yourself? What do I do?That's the question my mind ponders. Maybe I don't like capitalism, maybe I don't like my life (and that means I am willing to die if my situation is bad enough), but I can't stand thinking other people could have had better living conditions thanks to me, but with death, I can't help anyone anymore.

Is it worth fighting one more day if that helps someone? Maybe you could even study something just to help people with your job, it's really satisfying to know that a human being has a better chance of happiness because of you. I know, you must be thinking that is not, but with the right perception you could start to see it this way.

What makes it satisfying for me is the fact that life is unfair and we with our actions have a way to impact other people's lives for the better. Maybe it's not such a strange idea, maybe it's worth fighting for.

That's what I am thinking about lately, to be selfless and live at least a few more years just to help others in need, to become a "small buddha" (as in accepting the fact the job may be tiring sometimes) that focuses on doing something worthwhile with his time.

I used to think something like "but you can't do anything important to help, it's not worth it". Maybe I can, and I just don't know yet. I want your thoughts.
