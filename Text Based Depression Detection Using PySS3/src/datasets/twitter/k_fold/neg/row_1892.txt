EnvyI heard about three people that are friends of friends who died this past week. All women, all under 40, all unexpected and natural causes. And all I can think to myself is why cant I be that lucky? Why do people who want to live, who enjoy life and all it offers, have to die when I'm stuck here living and dont want to?
