Is this ever gonna go away?Ive been suicidal for most of my life. I work hard at two jobs and take classes at a university. I have hobbies. I exercise. I eat healthy and am okay with budgeting. I have a significant other. I dont have many friends now a days but I have in the past. Yet Im still detached and overcome with depression. 

Ive been seriously considering killing myself these past two weeks and Im thinking about buying a gun.
