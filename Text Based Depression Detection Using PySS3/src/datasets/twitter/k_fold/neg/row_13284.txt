Gods, I am tired.I... I just want the pain to stop. It's been 20 years, my happiness is always a lie. Or something just gets in the way. They lie, they say they love me but they hurt me as soon as its convenient, they all get bored of me eventually. And nobody gets it they say your smart find someone on your level... who is? Why should that matter. Just let me end. Please.
