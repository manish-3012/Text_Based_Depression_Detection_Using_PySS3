I dont know what to doI'm 15. My parents despise me. In fact, I was just called a massive disappointment by my father. I probably deserved that. I dont do much, because im scared to try new things. Honestly, its the pettiest fear ever, i mean no one thinks of me to begin with, so why worry? Im overly self concious, so much so that i get anxiety easily. I dont have anyone to share personal details with, and my family could care less, especially with how much ive let them down. 

I want to so badly talk to someone. I consider killing my self every fucking day yet no ones there for me, because im too scared to ask or i push them away. Im terrible at whatever hobbies i pursue, and i dont know how to fix myself. 

I cant stand my body. Ive been recovering from BED, however i still look like shit. No one could ever love me, and im convinced thats partially why my girlfriend left me. No one even knows that im gay, and was pressured into a relationship with her by her friends. 

no one knows me. the loneliness is crippling, and the silence is deafening. I dont know what to do now..
