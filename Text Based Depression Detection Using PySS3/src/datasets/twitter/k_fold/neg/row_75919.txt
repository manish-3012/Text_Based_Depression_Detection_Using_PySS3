Running out of reasons not toI don't know what I'm hoping to gain from posting this. I've fixated on my own death for well over a decade, and it's honestly remarkable that I'm still alive. I could ramble on about my problems, but I'll spare you the details. 

I know I have people in my life who care about me, and having lost my best friend a few years ago to suicide, knowing the pain that it causes and seeing his parents grasping for answers, my last and only reason is them. But at what point is your quality of life so dismal that it takes priority over their feelings?
