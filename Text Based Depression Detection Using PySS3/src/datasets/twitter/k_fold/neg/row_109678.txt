Ill be gone in a year or two (or maybe day or two)You know how everything in life seems so against you? against all odds, or everything is stopping you, even yourself. Im tired, im really tired, i cant cope, im jelous with people who can cope with drinking, smoking, and all that things that make them forget about everything for a while. Im tired of sleeping too much or sleeping so little, im so tired that i cant even cry or even feel something, i became numb. I am used to pain and suffering that i cant feel other things, its so tiring and it keeps on a cycle. I always sing that song and alter the lyrics based on when i will end it, "in a year/month/week/day or two". I always wanted to sleep forever, a pitch black of nothingness like my life where it is headed. Its time to sleep forever. Please let me sleep forever. Please let me leave forever.
