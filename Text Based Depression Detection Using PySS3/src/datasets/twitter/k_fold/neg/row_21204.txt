I don't really see this ending any other wayI tried to get help. I even told the Navy psychologist that I constantly think about suicide and he just scoffed at me and asked me why he shouldn't just send me to the ER. I lied and told him I wasn't actually thinking about actually doing it. I asked him how I was ever going to get better or restore my status in the military. Not his problem, he's just here to "talk therapy." Though he rushed me out. So I guess that's the final sign. Even when I felt relatively better yesterday I still don't feel enough to make life worth living. I gave up every opportunity I had while I was trapped in the navy just so I could see this guy and he tells me I'm basically fucked and he doesn't give a shit

I know that I'll probably kill myself in the end no matter what. Why delay the inevitable. I'm trapped here and there's only one way out.

Tonight on watch I went off by myself and climbed and stood up on the railings over the well deck. The closest thing I've felt to peace in months was knowing that when I work up the courage to take a header this will finally be over.

I don't know what my family will do but I can't keep existing for them. I tried to ask for help but I can't do this forever
