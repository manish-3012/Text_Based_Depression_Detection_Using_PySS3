There is only one thing I have to do before I kill myselfI have been thinking about killing myself for about three years. I have severe depression and anxiety, money problems and frankly not much to live for. Every day is a struggle for me. Even thinking of my problems gives me so bad anxiety that I am unable to move or speak for at least an hour. 

There is just one thing I want to do before I die. And that is getting married. It is something (basically the only thing) I've always dreamed of and I can't just let that dream go.  

I do have an amazing partner and I know that I want to marry him. But we haven't been together very long and are also a little young to get married, which is why he would probably not be willing to do it yet. 

I don't know how to address this topic with him. He knows that I have been thinking about ending it but he tries to talk me out of it. And I don't want to hurt him by saying something along the lines of "Can we please get married as soon as possible so that I can finally kill myself?".
