I want to kill myselfEverywhere I go no one wants to talk to me, I recently moved cityâ€™s just for a fresh start and Iâ€™m flatting with these guys that Iâ€™ve never met before and they claim they like me but when I go out with them and their mates they never seem interested in what Iâ€™m saying, this was the exact same in my old town itâ€™s like I always try to socialise and be nice as I can but I get no reward from it. The only people who I can talk to is my family and I hate having no friends. My flat mates always ditch me if Iâ€™m stuck talking to another person and I always end up just going back home by myself  because there is no one to hang out with. I feel like I am too socially awkward and I have tried therapy and pills but nothing seems to work. I just want to have atleast a few friends that actually care and hang out with me. I hate feeling like this and I hate doing this same shit everyday without anyone else to do it with. The only happiness I find it when Iâ€™m with my family and on drugs. Can someone please talk me to me :(
