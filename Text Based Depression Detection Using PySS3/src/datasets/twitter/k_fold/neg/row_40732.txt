I wish I could just disappear.I don't want to kill myself because I don't want to put that suffering on my friends and family. I wish I could kind of just ... *fade* from existence. Like everyone would peacefully forget that I even existed and I could just disappear into thin air. 

I just feel ***so*** emotionally and physically drained by my depression and suicidal ideation, and every moment I'm home I have to pretend like I'm mentally healthy because I no longer feel safe around my parents. In death I could finally stop having to work so damn hard to function normally while incredibly depressed, and I could just ***rest***. I want that rest so badly.
