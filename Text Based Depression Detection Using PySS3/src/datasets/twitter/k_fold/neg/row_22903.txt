Why do I even try anymore?I'm so fucking tired. So fucking tired of always getting my heart ripped out. I've only been in one serious relationship and it ended horribly. Ever since then, everytime I get feelings for someone, I get hurt all over again. No one ever loves me back, and now I've reached that sad conclusion that no one ever will. Everyone else in my life is succeeding with their relationships and are having the time of their lives. They find out someone likes them or they like someone and it turns into something amazing. Why am I the only one who can't have that? Why is no one interested in me? What's wrong with me? I try to be nice to other people, even if I don't like them. I feel like I'm somehow defective. Unwanted. Unlovable. I hate myself more and more everyday. All I feel is pain. I can't even see or hear about my friends' relationships without my pain and failures hitting me like a truck. I'm hopelessly alone. Why do even try to have love anymore? It doesn't exist. Not for me anyway. A few years ago my friend killed himself for this exact reason. I want to do the same but I can't because I made a promise. I'm trapped. I'm drowning and I just want air.
