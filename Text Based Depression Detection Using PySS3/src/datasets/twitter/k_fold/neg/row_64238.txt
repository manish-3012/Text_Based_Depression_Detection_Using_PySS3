I want to be at peace alreadyIm tired of begging and talking. Why am i not allowed to be at peace? I am tired of the pain 
I can't do it anymore. I spent a whole day crying and vomiting up everything i ate. I don't. Wanna live like that. I have fought too long. I want freedom.
Saturday morning after work I will take a few sleeping pills. A plastic bag and park my car somewhere secluded. 

Im gonna link this to people who deserve to know what happened. 
Sorry to everyone i was a burden on.
