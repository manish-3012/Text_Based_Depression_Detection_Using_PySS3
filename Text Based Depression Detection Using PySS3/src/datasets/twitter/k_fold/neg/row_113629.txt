i feel like i have nothing to live for17 y.o with no skills, hobbes, money, looks or even grades

no past, no present, no future

i think i have one friend, who's the opposite of me: talanted, rich, muscular, has a lot of friends and a loving family (basically, i can't relate to him at all)

i have been diagnosed with depression when i was 15, all i can feel is anger, jealousy and sadness

suicide has been on my mind since 14, but now i can't even stop thinking about it

i don't know what to do
