It feels like the only optionI have lost all motivation. I cant study, cant exercise, dont want to hang with friends and I dont even feel like hanging with my girlfriend because I know I'll just get her in a bad mood. She always tries to cheer me up. I love it, but it just doesnt work. I've told her to stop because shes wasting her time but she keeps doing it. I have lost all hope. She'll probably leave me soon. Shes like the only one keeping me alive. We've talked about how we're gonna spend the rest of our lives together and shit. Its basically a textbook relationship, and I love that about her. Shes my world. But Im just dissapointing her and her family all the time. Shes really smart and happy and social and all that shit. Im the exact opposite. Im ugly, dumb, socially awkward and that. Sometimes Im ashamed because people have to see her with me. I just want out of this world. I dont want to do it muself. It'd break her heart. I just want to die of some accident or something unfortunate. Suicide is my only option though. I wont end up in a car crash, I wont get murdered, I wont get cancer. Im not that lucky. I want to do it quick. As horrible as it sounds, when Im dead, I cant care about what people feel about it. Even if I wanted. Worst part is, my life is faaaaar from bad. I just cant help feeling that my life would be even better if I didnt have one to begin with.
