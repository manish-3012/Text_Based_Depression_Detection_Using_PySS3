Throw awayI made this account just so I could type this to distract myself. Iâ€™m feeling so extremely low right now. To the point here the only thing I crave is a train smacking the fuck out of me just so everything will stop. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m physically and emotionally just drained. I dont have ANYONE to turn to. I pushed all of my friends away years ago. My family may as well have disowned me and my roommates could give less a fuck. This month has been incredibly hard for me. I lost my job. My good paying job. Of course that was my fault so I canâ€™t be mad at anyone but myself. Iâ€™m late on rent. With no income I had to sell ALL of my possessions off. I havenâ€™t eaten at all today and Iâ€™m just so fucking empty. My head hurts. The only thing keeping me here is my little baby brother. Heâ€™s the only reason I havenâ€™t tried anything. Heâ€™s already lost his dad and his mother Is a drug addict I couldnâ€™t do that to him. Just the thought of someone having to tell him what I did makes me feel 10000000000x worse. If thatâ€™s even possible. Since Iâ€™ve moved out he always FaceTimes me and asks when Iâ€™m coming over. It breaks my heart each and every time when I have to tell him I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t have a car I donâ€™t have any money I donâ€™t have any fucking thing anymore. Except these selfish rude ass roommates and the loud commotion going on in my head. I hate it. I hate it here. I had to cover the whole cost of rent by MYSELF. I only just moved out on my own 4 months ago.  I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT DO THESE PEOPLE WANT FROM ME
