Itâ€™s been on my mind a lot lately.I keep thinking about it, more than ever. I keep thinking how would I do it? Whatâ€™s the quickest way I could die? I think the only reason I havenâ€™t taken any steps towards it is because there isnâ€™t many ways I could do it painlessly. No guns around here, no tall buildings I could get up on easily. I could climb the mountains I suppose, I could jump off the bridge but Iâ€™d need to make it there with something heavy, it wouldnâ€™t be quick though. But now tonight I remembered thereâ€™s a train station not too far from me. I could do it there I suppose. Maybe at night when thereâ€™s less people around. It would be quick at the very least, the pain wouldnâ€™t last too long. Lifeâ€™s bleak, I havenâ€™t got much hope for something better.  I donâ€™t want to dredge on, one day to the next for my whole life. Problem is Iâ€™m still scared of death. I was raised by a very religious mother and I suppose the idea of a torturous afterlife has stuck with me even Iâ€™m no longer religious myself. Is what lies beyond worse than what Iâ€™ve already got? I donâ€™t know. That indecision, the fear of the unknown is the only reason Iâ€™ve got to keep living really. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this tbh.  Just venting, putting my thoughts to words.
