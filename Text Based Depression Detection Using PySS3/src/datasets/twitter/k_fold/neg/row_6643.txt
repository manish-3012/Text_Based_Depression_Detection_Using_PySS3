I just can't anymoreToday has been a really bad day, I managed to fuck up so manny things in just a day. I started crying tonight, thinking about how my problems took over me. And now I went to the bathroom and cut my wrist, it's not bleeding a lot, I went too far from being normal. I don't know where my parents fucked up, but they will pay for it. At my funeral, all of those shitty people in my life, I will name every one of them so everyone will know it's them who made me do this. I just feel bad for my sister and grandparents. I don't want them to miss me. I might make an impact if I do something to myself today.
