I'm all out of answers and I'm looking for someone who does.So I have no idea what else to do. For the last two years I've been going through hell trying to figure out what to do with my life. I've been going back in forth in this poisonous cycle with the girl I'm absolutely in love with, on top of my social anxiety and just a general lack of self confidence. I'm a senior in high school starting the day of writing this post, and already, I've found myself beginning to fall in a pit that I can not go through again. I'm not willing to commit suicide, or any other kind of self harm, I'm too afraid for that, but I have no one else to talk to about this and I feel alone and quite frankly I'm terrified. I don't need anyone to pick apart my psych, or try and go down this from some medical bullshit route, I need a real answer from people who know what it's like to be a 17 year old boy caught up in a social nightmare on a daily basis.
