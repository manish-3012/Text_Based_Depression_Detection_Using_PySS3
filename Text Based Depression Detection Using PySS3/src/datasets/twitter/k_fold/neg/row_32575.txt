Why Canâ€™t I Stop?I made my plan. Iâ€™m going to do it. Iâ€™m finally going to be free. I should be happy, absolutely elated. Iâ€™ll finally be rid of this pain and this shitty life Iâ€™ve been given. So why? Why canâ€™t I stop crying? It feels just as painful as before, if not more so. I canâ€™t stop thinking about all the things I wanted to do and all the things I wanted to see. I wonâ€™t get to experience any of it. I realize now that my life has been so lacking that maybe Iâ€™ve never lived before. But I have my plan. I have to do it. Because I know itâ€™s the right thing for me. There is no happiness for me if I stay alive. I really wish there was but this isnâ€™t a game. Thereâ€™s nothing that I can do about my life being absolute shit and I just donâ€™t have the strength to keep at it. Iâ€™m not strong enough, Iâ€™m a complete wreck. I have nobody to rely on and my parents hate me. They even wish I was dead so that they could have a new daughter of their own. One that isnâ€™t screwed up and broken like me. I have to do it. Everyone will be happier without me. Theyâ€™ll hardly even remember there was something like me.
