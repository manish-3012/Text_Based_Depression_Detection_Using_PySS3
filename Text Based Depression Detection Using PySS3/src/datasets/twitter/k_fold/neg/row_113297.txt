Staying alive for my cat right nowI donâ€™t want him to be unhappy and not understand where Iâ€™ve gone. Iâ€™ve seen how my dadâ€™s dog reacted when he died from cancer. Animals canâ€™t understand a suicide note and thereâ€™s no guarantee your pet will be looked after properly following suicide. I donâ€™t want to do that to my cat. People in my life will get over it very quickly and will probably rejoice that Iâ€™m not there being a pain anymore. But my cat wonâ€™t understand where Iâ€™ve disappeared to and heâ€™s so loving and affectionate. Iâ€™m in so much pain and I could literally just OD right now. I have the means. But my poor kitten. Ugh. Sorry, this is a stupid vent, no one will read it and Iâ€™m sorry for wasting your time. But youâ€™re the only people who might even remotely understand.
