I legitimately cannot think of any reason suicide isn't okay.And I'm a therapist.

I always do my duty and encourage my clients to stay. I guide them to think of the possibilities, of what they're hoping for, of their potential. If need be, I have them evaluated for hospitalization.

But as someone who thinks about it often, I also feel like some of us are just going to keep suffering until we die. Especially those of us with chronic conditions that are extremely painful.

I feel like people should have the right to hold their own lives (and, thus, theirbown deaths) in their hands. Their body, their life, their choice.

Will others suffer? Yes. But we are not reaponsible for that. We are not reaponsible for surviving to keep others happy. We must do what we can to find happiness for ourselves, and sometimes we just can't do that, even if we've tried, and tried, and tried. Sometimes we have to know when to throw in the towel. Some of us are playing a losing game.

Have you heard of the sunk cost principle? InÂ economics and businessÂ decision-making, aÂ sunk cost (also known asÂ retrospective cost) is aÂ cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered.Â Sunk costs are contrasted withÂ prospective costs, which are future costs that may be avoided if action is taken. Essentially, it's when you keep throwing money into a lost cause, as though you were on the Titanic and trying to toss buckets of water overboard as it rushes at you. Some of us live lives where it just costs too much -- emotionally, psychologically, etc -- to live.
