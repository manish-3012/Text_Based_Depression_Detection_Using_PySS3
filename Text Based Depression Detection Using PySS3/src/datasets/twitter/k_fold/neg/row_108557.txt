Dead 1/2 outside.I'm 14 and my life started going downhill straight from my birth. My father started drinking heavily from the day of my birth. One day, when I was 7, he almost killed my mom. From that point on we started having money problems. We barely had money to continue my education. 

Soon after that my friends told me to come over. They didn't know about my problems and 'just for fun' threw me out of a window on the first floor. I landed on my legs and had to go to a hospital (healthcare in Poland is expensive and the doctors are crap at their job). My legs were so badly damaged, that to 'lower my pain' they had to be amputated.

My mother lost her job due to her frequent attacks of panic. After that I just felt like a train wreck. A psychiatrist had me go to an asylum. I spent a month in there.

Yet it didn't help. It was such a shock that one day I woke up and was completely paralized. My mother told me that I had a seizure. Later I was diagnosed with epilepsy and diabetes.

I have just one friend. I can't make more because of my epilepsy. Nobody except that one friend and my mother wants to know a guy who can just fall down and start shaking uncontrollably. At least that's what they say.

My friend tells me jokes to make me happy. Sometimes I post them to reddit.

Recently my mom got angry and started calling me an idiot, and that she wants me dead. I can't just go away because I don't have legs, and my arms are too weak to push my wheelchair.

I want to just take all my pills (there are 15 types I take), and drink as much alcohol as I can.

I don't think it can get much worse than that. I hope I can take more of it. I can barely type.

I'm sorry for mistakes
