Not One Person in The World Left That Gives Two Shits.My two grown kids are starting their new adult lives. They barely have time to chat much less visit. I'm divorced (12 yrs) and still haven't gotten a new bf. I also have bipolar which gives me less of a chance to have a man ever love me again. Mother and sister have borderline and have split me into black/white--I'm either princess or the devil. They go YEARS w/o talking to me. I find myself wanting to die more and more often. I was in a coma last year due to OD on klonopin. Yet STILL no one makes time for me. I'm totally worthless to everyone and no one to anybody. I have only a couple of friends and they are BARELY and I mean barely friends.

I'm so fucking lonely the world is sucking me into a black hole to disappear forever. The pain is ineffable. I just want someone real to care.

I want a reason to live, and I have nothing left.

I'm going to die alone. Mostly likely sooner rather than later.

Fuck it.
