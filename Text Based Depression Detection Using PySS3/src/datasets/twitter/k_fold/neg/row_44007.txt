Legitimately considering suicide todayMy depression has been really awful the whole school year, about 3 weeks so far. Considering suicide has been a pretty normal, daily thing for the past week or so. All related to school-related anxiety. Just today, I got my second F quiz in math in two weeks. I don't know why. I was a star math student last year, and my depression was really bad then too. I've been holding out for a while. Not actually doing anything. Just sitting in class, not paying attention, just thinking of suicide methods, ways I could start it and not cause myself too much pain.

But now, after this second F, not having my math homework done, not having my physics homework done, not knowing what math is, not having my english done, not having my Japanese done, and more than anything not being able to bring myself to do any of it everyday when I get home from school.

My current plan today is to wait until I get home, write "Sorry" on a piece of paper, and swallow an entire container of my Zoloft. I'm not capable of living in this world, and I just can't imagine that it's going to work.

I know I shouldn't.

I know it's selfish to just kill yourself without considering what it'd do to others.

But I cannot live like this any more.

Please help.

Somehow.
