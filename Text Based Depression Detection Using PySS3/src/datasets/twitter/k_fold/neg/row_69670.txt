Suicide seems impossible, I want to get out of this rat race so badly thoughItâ€™s like Iâ€™m begging someone please give me an easy and painless way out, every day I feel so dull, no one cares, everyone I know leaves because they are sick of me being like this, they never know what to do and idek what to do for myself. As much as I love my mother I resent her so much for bringing me into the world. Every day is becoming torture
