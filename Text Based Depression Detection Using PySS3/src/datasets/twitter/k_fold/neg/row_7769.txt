Just called the national suicide hotline...Tried hanging myself tonight.  Again.

Failed.  Again.  I'm 6'4.  It's really fucking hard to hang yourself.

Broke down, and called the hotline.  I just needed someone to talk to.  I didn't mention that I was staring at a noose that was around my neck 15 minutes prior, mostly because I can't deal with going back to a hospital right now.  I'm 700 miles away from anyone I know (I live in a new city now), and there's no one that can take care of my dog should I be admitted.  Not to mention that I'm already in massive debt because of medical and legal bills from past suicide attempts.

13 minutes later, "David" is basically saying I just need to "straighten out my life" and that he's "going to let me go now".  Followed by both of us hanging up.  

Guess I wasn't suicidal enough, or my problems weren't bad enough.
