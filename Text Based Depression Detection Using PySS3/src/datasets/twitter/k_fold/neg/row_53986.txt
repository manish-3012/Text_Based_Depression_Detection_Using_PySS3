UnsureI don't want a bunch of messages or comments telling me things will get better. People have a cruel way of belittling your problems. People have a strange way of seeing things so narrowly instead of seeing the big picture. Not that I didn't walk right into my problems with trusting eyes and open arms, I almost always bring my problems onto myself expecting for good only to find the worst. It just seems that each rut I find myself in is worse than the last, and that scares me the most. The cliche advice "things always get better" has always been confusing to me. Yes, things do always get better, but then they get worse again. It scares me how much worse the next rut will be than this one. 
I don't want to be alive to find how deep this next rut will be. I am too afraid to actually do anything, of leaving my parents in pain and emptiness of a daughter raised only to chose to waste their time. Though I hope one day I can push them far enough away to not care where I am. I hope one day I can make the decision to jump or fall into eternal sleep leaving behind no regrets. I hope that day comes soon.
