I wish I could just kill myself...but I can't. I'm too much of a pussy. I have the means. A drawer full of MAOIs and SSRIs. Serotonin syndrome doesn't sound like a pleasant way to go, but I can always order poppies off the internet and OD on those. I have 30x1mg lorazepam, 120x5mg ritalin. So many options from 5 years of failed treatments for depression.

But I still can't do it. I don't have any friends that would notice or care, just my parents. I tell myself if they were gone I'd have no reason not to, but I still probably wouldn't do it. I don't know why. I'm out of hope. Why should I expect anything to change after half a decade? SSRIs failed to help, MAOIs failed to help. I'm moving on to TCAs soon but I don't have any confidence there. In the meantime I have to "wash out" of the MAOIs, which is causing me shitty withdrawal symptoms.

Nothing can help me. No one can help me. And I can't follow through on the one thing that's left to do. I'm losing my fucking mind. I can't take this anymore.
