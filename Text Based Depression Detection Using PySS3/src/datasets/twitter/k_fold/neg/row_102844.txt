Itâ€™s too muchItâ€™s been a year since I had a argument with who I considered a friend. I tried to say I was sorry for what I did but he kept arguing about the stuff I said I was sorry for. To this day I still ruminate on it and itâ€™s driving me to the point to where I want to end it. Whenever I talk to my parents about it, it feels like Iâ€™m just bothering them at this point. When I tried to chat with someone at the National Suicide Hotline, they just pointed me to another chat service. It feels like Iâ€™m trapped and I want to find a way out.  Should I just leave it and try and move on? Or should I try to bury the hatchet?
