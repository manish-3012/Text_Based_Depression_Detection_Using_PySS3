i think i might have ruined my best friends lifei donâ€™t really know where else to post this, i think it fits the critera here somewhat so give it a read if you feel like it. 

i typed out my life story earlier but managed to delete it somehow without saving it. i suppose it doesnâ€™t really matter that much. i plan or planned on killing myself but i managed to do  something terrible before i could. 

i have essentially ruined every present chance of being happy as far as friends go and as of this last week or so every future chance of being happy in terms of education. yesterday it was a really bad day. one thing led to another and in a moment of weakness i ended up telling my best friend about what i wanted to do.  

sheâ€™s been really supportive because well, of course she has, shes suggested stuff and and tried to help â€”and this and that and â€” honestly sheâ€™s a literal gem, but i have put her in a horrible place. 

i was under the impression i could just slip away and yes it would be i suppose a gut punch to her and a i think a few others but after a while that would be it. now iâ€™ve told her about it if i actually manage to succeed i fear sheâ€™s gonna hate herself for not being able to do anything about it, in fact i know she will. the plan was to just slip away before anyone caught in something was amiss.

i should never told her about it but i just ended up being i suppose selfish. i donâ€™t know what to do now. i have no desire to change mindset i feel like itâ€™s too late for that. i know i want to not continue living and i absolutely hate that she knows. if i died in the next week or so she wouldnâ€™t be able to forgive herself. 

iâ€™ve considered stalling my plans and buying enough time to somehow fall out with her so she hates me and it doesnâ€™t hurt her as much but i think sheâ€™s too smart for that.

i am literally at a loss

if anything does happen i think this is my way of a fucked it apology 
iâ€™m sorry KM, you deserve the world
