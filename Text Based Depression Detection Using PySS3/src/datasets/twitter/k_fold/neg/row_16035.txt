I've been having urges to end my life for the past couple of monthsAnd the only thing I feel is holding me back is my own lack of will to do anything at all. I'm partly afraid of the pain that will be involved with it but that seems tolerable compared to the emptiness and sadness I feel every day. I haven't seen anyone I know in months and I know that nobody will even notice that I'm dead for a few more. I don't entirely know why I'm posting this on reddit as this is my first ever post on the whole site but I feel like I need to get these feelings out today without them being dismissed before I try and bring myself to do it.
