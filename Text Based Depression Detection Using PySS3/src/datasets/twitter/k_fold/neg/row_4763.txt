I ran across this posting, and I'm not sure what to make of it...Throw-away account...

I ran across this posting:

* http://phoenix.backpage.com/SportsEquipForSale/please-do-not-sell-a-gun-to-this-girl/12580222

Which links to the following, one which contains her phone number:

* http://suicideproject.org/2011/01/partner-in-us/
* http://suicideproject.org/2011/01/partner-in-canada/

I'm not sure if anyone could look into this and possibly give her a call, or email her?

I probably won't check this account after this posting, because I am not qualified to be involved, however, I just thought I'd put this out to the reddit community, since you all love to help people so much.
