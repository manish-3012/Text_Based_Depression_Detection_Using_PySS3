HiI don't know how to start this so i'll just say i'm in my schools musical, i'm not a lead or anyone important, i'm just ensemble. I've  been thinking about, well, this, for a while now. I haven't been diagnosed with depression or anxiety or anything for that matter. I've been planning on committing the act the day after the last performance, March second if I remember correctly. I've asked for help from friends but all I really seem to be is  the guy unable to be serious, everyone agrees that I could say anything and no one would know if i'm serious, people also say i'm just faking it for attention. I know my problems are almost basically nothing compared to other peoples, but i've learned that people online are the only people who listen anymore. Sorry for wasting your time, I just wanted to say something
