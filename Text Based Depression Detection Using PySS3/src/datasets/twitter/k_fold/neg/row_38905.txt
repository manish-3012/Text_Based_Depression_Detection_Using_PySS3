Atheist, depressed, why live life?I don't want any crap about jesus loves you or some other try to brainwash yourself crap, that's one of the biggest reasons i'm here in the first place.   I"ve been thinking about killing myself for a few years now, I have a glock 21 with a p+ hollowpoint &amp; a large amount of blood thinners waiting in case I ever decide to follow through. My primary reason for not killing myself thus far is fear. I'm in college right now, 26 years old / just started. I thought that getting out / trying to experience life would change things for me. I'm a month in and nothing has changed except I've now made social connections that make life all the more draining / tiring to live. I get no joy from talking to people nor keeping in touch with them. I have no desire to live life / don't enjoy anything / no idea what I want to do with my life. Currently living with parents. I struggle to keep going to college because I frequently get anxiety attacks in class which makes it impossible to even pay attention in class. I just want to die,The idea of nothing after death seems so peaceful, yes I know I wouldn't feel that feeling of peace, but the idea of it here and now seems amazing. The fear part of me wants this to stop so I could live life and be happy. I tried medication for a while and it just numbed me to the point of not caring or thinking about much of anything. I feel pathetic for even posting this. I would like to have a happy life but I truly don't think I'm capable of living one mentally. Anytime something good happens I realize in the end it's pointless, and that just gets me feeling down again.
