I See No Point in LivingI hate where I live, I hate my college course and can't change it, I've wasted all my potential, I hate the person that I am. 

There is nothing that makes me happy, there's nothing that I have to look forward. All my future contains is more disappointment and failure, why bother suffering through it?
