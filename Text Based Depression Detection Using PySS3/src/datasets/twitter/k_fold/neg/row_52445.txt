Having existential Crisis, My life is not really bad but i don't see any point of living ? I just want to die.Hi all,
So i been struggling to find my path in life for past few months, and i now feel like there is no point of anything i do.
I have a nice life way better than many other people who live in poverty which i feel bad to even saying such things, and no i'm not rich or anything like this but i can for sure save up a bit of cash in order to travel somewhere with my Long distance girlfriend.
I have really beautiful girlfriend and really nice parents that care and family and everything im just sad and i don't want to disappoint these people, they raised me for so long tried their best and yet im here thinking about just stopping existing, its difficult living with my girlfriend apart but seems liek we have no other option shes one of the few that brings me true happiness and smile and make me feel like life is worth living.

But then i have side thoughts that i keep fighting with that what is even point of living my life and working and traveling and retiring or opening my own business coming up with inventions etc but whats point of all this i don't know im just confused about life i used to be all good but recently i started feeling like my life is worthless and there is no meaning to it i dont see like living here seems like im not suiting all people my age and im on side and overall i feel like my thinking is different than other people and i just feel like i should end it because im tired of live and idont see i point in it but i dont want to hurt anyones feelings, sometimes i just wish there was "stop existing" button and you just stop existing like just disappear and no one is sad that you disappeared.
I dont know what to do with my life
