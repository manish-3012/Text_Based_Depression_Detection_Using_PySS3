My mum just told me that she wouldnt care if I died. I feel the same way.I'm overweight, but when I try to lose weight I relapse, sometimes as quick as a few hours. I have no skills, talents or anything else interesting about me. All my 'friends' just use me as comic relief and don't actually like me, but I stay with them because they're the only people that I talk with. I am literally sitting on my windowsill writing this, ready to turn around and jump. I've suspected I was depressed for  ages, but only got diagnosed a few weeks ago. Since that, it's gotten way worse. I argued with my mum this morning and when I turned to walk away she shouted at me and told me that she wouldn't mind if I killed myself. This has put me on the edge. A fucking bird could chirp the wrong way and I feel like it would put the final nail in the coffin. Fun way to put it. Please help. I'm *this* close to fucking killing myself. I wouldn't even feel bad about it.
