If â€œsomeone caresâ€I donâ€™t know why people say that â€œsomeone cares for youâ€, if they really did I wouldnâ€™t be online crying over every single thing. If â€œsomeone caredâ€ I probably wouldnâ€™t believe that I am useless and I am never gonna be enough for me or even my family. I have accepted it, that if I donâ€™t get the guts (more like that tiny hope that stops me from killing myself every other day) to kill myself, Iâ€™ll just disappear so I am nobodies problem.
