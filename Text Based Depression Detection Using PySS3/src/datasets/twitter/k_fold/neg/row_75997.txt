Looked for help Day xI don't know how long its been since i posted here my last post. So this is 'x' is just a filler and not the day to end my life. I just wanted to tell you all, that i'm doing fine and i'm alive and kicking. I'm taking meds every day, visited a psych clinc and met wonderful people. Today i will meet those people again and i'm really excited about it. I want to tell you guys how much you've helped me going through this hard time and i was away for like two months... It worked wonders. Sometimes i still have those thoughts about suicide but not that much to mention it. Long story short: Felling fine and happy :)
