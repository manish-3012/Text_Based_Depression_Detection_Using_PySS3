My friends after a recent suicide attempt (Relapse/Crisis) Hi guys.

First off, I have been diagnosed with BiPolar 2. I manage it pretty well I think. Had a relapse/crisis for the first time in about a decade. Support system had a friend who I felt was leaning on more than was reasonable. Before we could figure out what was good ground, I went into crisis, magnified the imperfections of the friendship. I sent her texts and tried calling asking for help before I found another friend (who is now in my more detailed and reasonable support system) who helped and drove me to a crisis center where I went under observation for about 3 days.

My other friend, we haven't talked since I got out. I texted her I got out, and found out from my mother she tried looking for me after I had been admitted. I thanked her for it. She replied very short, but I haven't heard from her since. She did mention she was going through something. This has been about a month already when we used to talk all the time.

I'm awful with this stuff. How do I navigate this? What should I reconcile with my friends?
