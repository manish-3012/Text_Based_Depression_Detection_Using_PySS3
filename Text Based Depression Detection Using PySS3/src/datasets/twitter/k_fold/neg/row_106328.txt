this world is hellits all fucked. they got me, they won this tiny battle and they will win the great battle that is to come as well. their propaganda is simply too strong. so many people are brainwashed by them. the propaganda has become a part of the regular human being at this point. its so fucked. everything they planned is working out. the population is so degenerated. the youth especially. degenerated beyond hope. me included, although differently than most others. non-degenerates are the exception now. its truly maddening when you really think about it. its fucking fucked. fucking disgusting. and yet "normal". its incredible. if only it could be reverted. if only things had turned out differently all those years ago. many many innocent people would have died, probably. but at least it all wouldnt be so crazy. perhaps it shouldnt have had happened and a better solution will emerge in the future. it might very well be the case. but the future doesnt look bright to me. it seems as though the western world is doomed. i am sorry for taking the easy way out my brothers(if i commit to it in a few months). i shall not be forgiven for this selfish act. perhaps i wont do it though. if i wont, i will fight alongside you. maybe we can even succeed and finally stop all this madness and make it so it will never happen again. if there is a hell, i hope the people responsible will suffer in the worst ways imaginable. in the case that this world is a simulation or whatever and its all fun and games then it doesnt matter. but if its not and all of this is really happening. my two only hopes are the victory of my people and the suffering of the enemy.
