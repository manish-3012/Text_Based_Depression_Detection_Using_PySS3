I feel like I canâ€™t do this anymore. People keep leaving me and I canâ€™t stop them.25M. Iâ€™ve been struggling w depression and sleep deprivation for weeks ever since my girlfriend left me for a job in a different state. I think I mightâ€™ve aggravated the situation by trying my hardest to find a compromise. I couldnt pull it off. Nothing works. Iâ€™m too scared to be alone again. People like me dont get many chances at happiness and I feel like that was my last shot. My friends left me because they feel like im prioritising saving this relationship more than their feelings. People keep leaving me and hurting me and im so sick of it. I just wish i could forget about literally everything and start anew. On some days i just wish my heart would just stop in my sleep. I dont want to live anymore.
