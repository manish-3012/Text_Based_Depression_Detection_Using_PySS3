Nothing actually matters.Iâ€™m not a priority in anyoneâ€™s life. And if I was, Iâ€™d ruin it. I lay in bed thinking about how I rely on a small group of people to help me and bring me slight bits of happiness, but then I realize that Iâ€™m not a priority to them the way they are to me. Even if I was, my asshole brain canâ€™t accept that Iâ€™m important to them, because nothing seems genuine or I overthink what friendships actually are and that Iâ€™m not important. Iâ€™m a minor footnote. This is the loneliest Iâ€™ve been. I know I can never be normal and not think these things. So, I often think about just killing myself just to get over it. Then once I start thinking about it, I think of ways to do it, and who Iâ€™d say goodbye to.
