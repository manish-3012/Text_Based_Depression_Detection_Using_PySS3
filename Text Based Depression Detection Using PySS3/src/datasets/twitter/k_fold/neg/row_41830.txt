Girlfriends mental health is destroying her, and im afraid of what she'll do next.Kinda long post, so thanks for reading up to this point. 

Saying my girlfriends life has been hectic is an understatement, aside from the mental disorders she has lost a lot as well. 

Her father died in a car crash at a very young age of 8, leaving her with her drug addicted mother who put her out on the street when she was 13, which resulted in her mothers ex boyfriend, becoming the "step dad" of her and her little sister. Her mother has tried to rob her home, has made credit cards in her name, and recently put her other younger sister out. On top of that, she recently told me she was molested as a child, and i worry about how she still thinks of that.

But that isn't it, from the harsh childhood it resulted in her developing BPD (Borderline personality disorder) whic in description is: 
&gt; A mental disorder characterized by unstable moods, behavior, and relationships.

Which is just the worst of it, her OCD has also gotten to the point where she is harming herself doing her rituals and she cant stop it, and the severe anxiety doesn't help at all. Id love to get her to a doctor, but just know that is impossible for at least 5 months. This girl has so much on her plate, i could list on and on, her life is totally hectic and i can almost see why she told me she wants to kill herself lately.

God i wish i knew what to say to her when she tells me how bad things get, all im able to say is she doesn't have to be through this alone, im fine with bending for her just to make her day slightly better. I just dont know how much more she can take at this point.
