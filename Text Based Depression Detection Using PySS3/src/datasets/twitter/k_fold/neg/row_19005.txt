Didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be here againNo matter what do or whatever good comes it always leads back to here. I thought I wasnâ€™t suicidal but I saw something before about just stopping checking for traffic and ignoring people you love and Iâ€™m here like damn, Iâ€™ve been ignoring my gf for the past 12 hours over some dumb argument despite the fact that sheâ€™s messaged me on pretty much everything begging me to talk to her and trying to say things thatâ€™ll make me happy. She knows I can do dumb things and I wonder how much Iâ€™m making her worry. Iâ€™ve decided that since sheâ€™s probably already pretty upset I may as well go the full way, this is like the third time ive done this in the past month but hopefully the last. I really am a shitty person.
