I kind of have an inclination to shoot myself in the face with a shotgunI have a pretty good life. but about a year ago I experienced, and still experience depersonalization, which basically means, any form of enjoyment i still had i.e. food, drugs, music, sex, movies, tv, art, reading, radio, basically anything that i could use to distract myself and feel something from i now feel NOTHING from thanks to this condition of DP/DR. its dissociation apparently.. i dont really care for the names termonoligy and what not.. all i know is all forms of entertainment and positive feelings in my life now basically supply zero good feelings. its not depression. it happened in a matter of seconds and never left.
