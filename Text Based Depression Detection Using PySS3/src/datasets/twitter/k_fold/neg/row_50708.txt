lets wrap this up and put an end to ittoday i lost my passport. called everywhere (airport police, buss central office ect), nobody answered. last week i broke my phone, so i spend the money that i was collecting the past 3 months on a new one. two weeks ago, i lost my student id. Fuck me.. why am i such an idiot? Cant i do anything right?

I am supposed to be part of the popular group or whatever you call it. As i was crying today i realised i still dont have anyone i can talk to. I am empathetic and supportive towards the people i know but anytime i have an issue (ex: told my best friend i lost my stuff, it was turned into a joke and then i was ignored). lol

i called a family member when i was crying and they called me useless too. The worse part is i know they are not wrong. I just want a hug. or a shot in the head or two. idk . im tired.

Basically i dont excell in something, i dont have people that actually care about me, i am a totally broke student that barely passed their classes, no job (im 19), no intrest in improving my appearance, no intrest in having a love life at all and a total piece of shit. 

the only reason im still alive is because i have 3 little siblings and i want to make them proud and teach them things (so they dont have to have bad experiences on their own) and support them. if it werent for them id have blown my head off 4 years ago. 

haha.. shit, i even tried to be happy this past year. i really tried. fuck this. i want out.
