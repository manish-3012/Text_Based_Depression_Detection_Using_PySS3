Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill myselfSeeing as I have an overwhelming amount of chronic health conditions, including:

* IBS
* GERD
* Chronic gastritis
* Gastroparesis
* Bile Reflux
* Dysmenorrhea
* Anemia

And an also-overwhelming amount of mental illnesses, including:

* Autism (I know it's technically not a mental illness, but I'm categorizing it as one because it does affect my neurological well-being)
* Social anxiety
* Hypochondria
* General anxiety disorder
* ARFID (an eating disorder, otherwise known as "Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder")
* Major Depressive Disorder
* PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder)

And seeing as I'm 32 years old and have tried everything from modern medical remedies to woo-woo "alternative medicine" (like Reiki and acupuncture), with little-to-no benefits, and have gotten very little help from medications and therapy for my mental health conditions, tell me, why shouldn't I kill myself at this point? (And I'm looking for real answers, not just hackneyed Hallmark-like sayings like "suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem" or "just keep putting one foot in front of the other.")
