just daily thoughtsHey /r/sw

Before I begin, I'd like to say that I'm not about to kill myself right now, so if you'd rather spend your time helping those with immediate intention to hurt themselves then please do (and thank you for being here for people in need).

This is going to be a wall of text :/ (I just need to get my feelings off my chest and sort through them)

I'm a 24 year old realist in crippling debt, with no well paying job prospects in my future, who a psychiatrist, after only one 20 minute visit deemed me to suffer from depression, mood disorder, and adhd. I never went back because I'm extremely anti-pharmaceuticals and felt as if the doctor was trying to push drugs on me that I didn't need. The irony being that I'm addicted to marijuana to the point that I really don't know how I function without it. 

I've tried to quit, but I would get hysterical to the point of hurting myself followed by a euphoric release. If I didn't do something to hurt myself then I would cry while planning my immediate demise. When I try to stop now even for a couple days, my mind will just kind of.. I don't know how to explain it -shutdown? To where I feel something deep within me about to come out when I'm alone and have the eye glaze come over me... so I keep on using instead because even though I hate myself when I'm high, I'm still far happier. It's a vicious cycle of hating myself for using yet feeling so helpless in stopping to the point where I've considered joining MA.  


I moved to a big city when I was 10 and can't really remember a time when people weren't trying to come down on me. Fights during recess in elementary school spawning to subway stations (or whenever it would happen) in high school. I was always the loud mouth trouble maker with a face you'd want to punch. Sadly, I then went to a customer service job while in college which left me getting into shouting matches with grown adults face to face at the age of 18 until I was 22. During this time I suffered from terrible acne, had glasses, and went through 2 1/2 years of braces. Now, I'm extremely uncomfortable with getting into someones personal space. Touching, flirting, even basic eye contact while not working is really hard for me. 

People scare me. I'm always left worried what they think of me, why most don't like me, and how I can get more of them to like me. While at the same time feeling as if I getting in someones personal space will make them like me less (I really don't rate myself at all) Because of that most people have no idea how depressed I am. I talk to a few friends about it then I feel embarrassed and awkwardly try to end the conversation by blowing it off. I'm usually smiling while being unnecessarily generous, timid, and quiet. I think about everything I say before I say it when trying to have a good time with people which is leaving me with so few authentic connections that I'm watching all my relationships erode before my eyes and at the same time being completely useless at meeting anyone new. My mind has a hard time letting go when I get nervous and in turn am always down on myself for it. Always something I can be doing better that I'm not. 

"It was the old depression exaggerated; all the world had become Cordelia Street. Yet somehow he was not afraid of anything, was absolutely calm; perhaps because he had looked into the dark corner at last and knew. It was bad enough, what he saw there, but somehow not so bad as his long fear of it had been. He saw everything clearly now. He had a feeling that he had made the best of it, that he had lived the sort of life he was meant to live, and for half an hour he sat staring at the revolver." - Paul's Case

And this short story is why I'm here again. I really felt like I related to the main character after only a few paragraphs and then it ended on a note that often clouds my mind. Suicide. I grew up believing my best friend as a child killed himself, only to find out 7 years later he overdosed on morphine getting high with a friend. Followed by that my best friend after moving to the city attempted to kill himself due to depression stemming from an accident leaving him in pain constantly. Also with drugs.

I don't think of using drugs to kill myself, I mainly fantasize about hanging. I can't seem to shake the thought of me hanging as being poetic, which I know isn't healthy. It usually happens once a day, sometimes more depending.  

I really could continue to talk about all the things that I feel makes me feel this way, but are they even real? Or am I merely providing myself a never ending crutch for inaction? I just want to not worry, for once since I can fucking remember, about anything. It seems impossible at this point as even being in public and walking by people has me worried about what they think of me.. even for a second. 

Like I said before, I don't rate myself highly at all, in debt, don't drive, live at home, work a shitty below 30k a year job with no idea what to do now but work and hope people don't hate me while numbing my brain with ganj daily.
