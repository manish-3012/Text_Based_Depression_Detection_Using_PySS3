Ready to go failureIâ€™m struggling hard financially. My mom says she wonâ€™t help me anymore because she says Iâ€™m a lazy spoiled man child. It hurts because sheâ€™s right. Sheâ€™s been drunk most of my life. I have a legal case pending so every job denies me no matter how menial. I have bipolar 2 too. I have epilepsy too. Canâ€™t get disability either so Iâ€™m depressed and in a tight spot. I just want to get someone to give me some courage and I want to leave a record.
