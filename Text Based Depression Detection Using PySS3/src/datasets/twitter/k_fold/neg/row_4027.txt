I want to do it, but I know that I won't so I'll just rant here, sorryI don't know, I feel like my life doesn't really belong to me. And not in a bad way, what I mean is that all my happiness and sweetness and just everything good about is what I give to others, but to myself I don't really give anything. It's like I don't exist for myself in this reality, and I guess that's the outcome of wanting to get out of it for such a long time but, I want to die because there's nothing inside of me for me, but I feel like it would bad (probably selfish) to do so because of how other people feel about me.
