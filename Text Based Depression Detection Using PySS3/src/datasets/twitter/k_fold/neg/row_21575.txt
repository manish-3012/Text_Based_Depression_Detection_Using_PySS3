20 years old, ending my miserable existence in a monthJust tired of it. Hate having to coexist with other people, hate seeing other people alive and walking around me, hate being ugly and unable to at least get laid, hate literally everything about existence. It wouldnt be so bad if I could at least stay in my room 24/7 and never acknowledge another human's existence, but obviously I can't do that. So suicide is the next best choice.

Obviously don't say anything fake nice or anything attempting to dissuade me from doing this, because that is fake as hell and not meaningful. I hate you all, and you all are perhaps indifferent towards me, but indifferent in the sense that someone seeing garbage on the street is. You view me as unsightly, but not your problem. 

Anyways, hope you all have miserable lives, more miserable than my own. Peace out, and eat shit.
