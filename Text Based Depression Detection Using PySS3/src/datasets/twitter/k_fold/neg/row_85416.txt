Advice maybeI want to kill myself but can't bring myself over fearing the physical pain invloved despite knowing it'll be only momentary. The methods that hurt the least are not really ones that are easily accessible by the average person. I'd rather prefer getting something like cancer but unfortunately that's not a choice. So is there really a way to get over that fear maybe?
