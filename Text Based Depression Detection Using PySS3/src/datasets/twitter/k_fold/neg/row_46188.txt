I know this may be unsettling, but I'm pretty sure this is my last night here. I think I've just reached the point where it's just become too much. I've talked about what has happened to me before. I've posted here before. But I think I'm just ready to try killing myself again. I'm just so unhappy. I don't even know why I'm posting. I guess I wanted to say goodbye to someone. Just have someone listen to me for a few minutes and not think I'm crazy. This is what I truly want. Thank you all for trying to help me. I wish everyone the best of luck in their fight. I'm sorry if this is inappropriate.
