The only thing Iâ€™ve learned this year...is that I donâ€™t want to live anymore. For over 20 years Iâ€™ve been lonely, and much of it I now understand. All of the pathological tendencies that my family created in me are self-sabotaging, and itâ€™s even more disheartening now that I understand them. I now see how and why I am where I am, and I am ashamed. 

I hoped that I would be able to finally escape it this year with a new life in a new city with a new job, and I made the leap... but now Iâ€™m alone. I hoped for chance to finally be able to find myself, the life I wanted, and love, but the pandemic swept that all away. Just with every other attempt to steer my future I get cast away by something I canâ€™t control. No friends, no release, just myself, alone. Iâ€™m just a cog in the machine as all I have is work, but nothing to work for.

I just donâ€™t want to be anymore...
