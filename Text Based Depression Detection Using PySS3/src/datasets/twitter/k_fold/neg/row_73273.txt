I think I should just give upI been thinking that I should just give up. Everything things sucks. For the past year I haven't been feeling well. I would get dizzy spells and I've been to like 20 different doctors and they can't find what's wrong with me. Also I have very bad anxiety so basic I say home and stay on the computer all day. I don't go to school because I'm to stupid and I have a learning disorder so its hard for me to do the work. I can do it but i have a hard time writing it down and trying to communicate what I'm trying to say. I should just jump in front of a train on something. I have nothing. I have no friends and I won't be able to move out of my parents house because I can't get a good job because I can't pass school. Everything thinks i'm stupid. Nobody talks to me at work. Idk what I should do. Sorry if what I wrote doesn't make sense I not good and putting my thought into words.
