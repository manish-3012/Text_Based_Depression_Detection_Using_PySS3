Unrequited Love Has Led Me To Wonder "whats the point?"It all started In late June/ early July when I developed a crush on a guy 2 grades above me (I'm a freshman and he's a junior) We are in marching band together and are in the same section so we are naturally close. And every night at band camp there were dances. And that's where the suicide thoughts started. He seemed to dance with every girl except for me. Including his ex. He also had a crush on one of my best friends and it's so painful to hear him talk about her. Just a few days ago one of my other best friends told him that I liked him and he responded by saying that I was "nice and funny" and my friend asked if he didn't like me and he said "I never said that" giving me false hope. Well, yesterday he asked me if I liked him, and me being the fuckhead I am said "In a friend way, yes. Anything thing else, not really" and he said "good". which leads me to believe he doesn't want me to like him, and he doesn't like me even as a friend anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm in so much pain. I've already written half of a suicide note and perfected my noose tying skills, and picked a location. I know that isn't a great option but it seems like the best right now. God I'm such a fuckup

Edit: It should also be noted that there is an unrequited love train sort of. Of course, it starts with no one liking me. Me liking the dude who likes my best friend. Then my best friend likes my other friend, and he likes this girl who likes someone completely out of the band.
