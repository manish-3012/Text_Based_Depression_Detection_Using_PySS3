Pros and Cons of apologising to people before endingSorry this post isn't exactly about suicide - more about cleaning something up before I do. 

Alright so I never really went as far as bullying someone, but I specifically remember teasing someone when I was a child (like six or seven years old). I'm pretty sure they had just moved to my school and I was ganging up on them with other people in my class. I want to apologise to them before I go.

I only remember it happening once, but kids can be mean so maybe it happened more. I get that this sounds neurotic, but I try to live my life being nice to people and this one of the only times where I remember being deliberately mean. So from here I have two options:

____

1. Some person you are friends with on fb, but haven't talked to for a literal decade says sorry for a teasing that you may or may not remember and kills herself a month later.

2. You see on fb that some person who may or may not have teased you in grade two kills herself.

___

On the one-hand I don't want this person to think this has anything to do with my suicide or to drag more people into the sadness I will eventually create, but on the other I don't want this person to think that I didn't care enough to remember them.

Thoughts?
