I don't know what to do.So I'm not sure if this goes here. But I've got serious depression but I don't treat it in anyway. Sometimes I choke myself and take pills (never enough to OD) I hate myself, I'm a liar, loser, I can't talk to people. This is going way out of my comfort zone already.. I just feel useless and that if I would die no one would really miss me.. The only thing that keeps me alive is my girlfriend.. But I'm starting to feel like a burden to her.
