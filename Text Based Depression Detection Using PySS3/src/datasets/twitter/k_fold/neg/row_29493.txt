Not me, nor a person anymore.Just whatâ€™s left of one. 

Used . . . Meat . . . Surrounding a void. The hole was always there. It comforted me as I grew up. Then it was filled all at once and for a brief second I saw it. Felt what everyone else gets to feel. A single breath of air. A fleeting moment. A scar. Always reminding, never speaking. Mercy is pain. Faith is pain. To act is to die. Standing still keeps me alive. Fatigue, eating. The saddle and edge. My only friend.
