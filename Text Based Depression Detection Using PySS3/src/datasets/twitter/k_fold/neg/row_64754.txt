Im 13 and I cant fucking do this anymoreI don't even know how to word this. I feel so tired and 'hollow' all the time. I haven't felt anything real for too long. No one ever takes me seriously, they brush me off thinking i'm joking. I legitimately fail to see any reason to grow old. If I wasn't such a pussy I would just do it but I can't. I just wish I was happy for once in my pathetic existence.
