I can't stand lifeI am so alone in this world. Everyone ignores me and I feel like I am invisible.I have no friends. I'm super stressed out and bored from life giving me the same things everyday. I feel trapped and nothing and no one is willing to help me out of this box. The only logical way of getting out is to commit suicide. I think ending would be more fun than seeing another day on this miserable world. I need help.
