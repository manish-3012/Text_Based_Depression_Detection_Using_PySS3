I have been ignored for so longMy "friends" have done absolutely nothing for me. A few weeks ago, I told one person I cry myself to sleep every other night and was told I would get over it. We haven't talked since. The rest of my friends? I have told them I will die on New Years. I told them I explained that I'd kill myself by hanging or gunshot. They think I'm joking. The only reason I haven't explicity told anyone that I cannot go a single day without a suicidal thought is because these people don't give a shit about me. Nobody does or ever will.

When I die, everyone will see the details left in advance and the multiple signs THEY ignored. Either that, or no one gives a shit and moves on. Either way, all my suffering will be over.
