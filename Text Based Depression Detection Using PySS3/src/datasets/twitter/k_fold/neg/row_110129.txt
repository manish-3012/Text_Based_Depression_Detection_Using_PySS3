Stress is so bad my hair is falling outMy mood swings are horrible and my attitude towards my family is shit. Iâ€™d take a bullet for them yet Iâ€™m a bitch to them. I do nothing all fucking day, I donâ€™t a have a job, i graduated last year and have done nothing since then. 

My social anxiety is through the roof to the point I shake and on the verge of crying. I rely on my mom because I canâ€™t talk to strangers or do adult things because Iâ€™m fucking scared and pathetic. 

My abusive father fucked me up emotionally, psychologically and socially, whatever ways he can. Iâ€™m not normal and Iâ€™m a piece of shit. I canâ€™t look at an attractive without automatically wanting to slit my wrists and jump off bridge. 

I fucking hate myself, thereâ€™s no point in being here when youâ€™re a loser.
