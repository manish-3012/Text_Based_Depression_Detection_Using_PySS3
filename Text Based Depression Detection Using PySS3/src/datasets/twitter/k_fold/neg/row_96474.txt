Why isnt there an answer for people who don't have any family?I don't see the point of life If I don't have a loving family. I want loving people but it doesn't feel the same if they are not family. All my family is either dead or alienated and it's difficult to get in touch with them or have a good relationship with them. Obviously since I can't choose my family, bring my dead family members back, make my living relatives who I want them to be, or make new ones the solution is suicide.
