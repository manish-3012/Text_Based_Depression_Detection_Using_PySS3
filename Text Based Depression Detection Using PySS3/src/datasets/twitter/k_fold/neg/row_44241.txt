How do I make sure it works?I want to kill myself with Trazadone but Iâ€™m afraid it wonâ€™t be enough. I have 24 50mg pills but Iâ€™m afraid it wonâ€™t work. I donâ€™t want to fail and live with lung problems for the rest of my life and get admitted and cost my family a ridiculous amount again. Iâ€™d rather just end it because a funeral would be cheaper in the long run.
