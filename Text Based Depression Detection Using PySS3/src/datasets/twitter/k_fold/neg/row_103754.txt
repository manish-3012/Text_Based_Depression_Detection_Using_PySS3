Why I'm unfortunately still aliveIdk why I'm even saying this. Not looking for pity or anything like that. I guess maybe I have the smallest amount of hope that saying(or typing) this will make me feel slightly better. (Doubtful) So the two reasons I've yet to kill myself, even though the sweet release of death is something I've craved for as long as I can remember. 1. I've done great deals of research on suicide and its various methods. Thru this research, I've discovered only one method that is both foolproof and seemingly painless(or as close to painless as killing yourself can possibly be). This would be, of course, jumping from a great height. Ideally, a building of 35+ stories. The reason I have yet to do this is that there is always the very distinct possibility of harming another human being. Someone will either see me smack the pavement with a horrendous thud, and very possibly be horrifically traumatized by this. Or worse, landing on someone and almost undoubtedly ending their life inadvertently. If this, however, was the only reason, it would not be enough to stop me. I would take that plunge in an instant, giving zero fucks about the consequences. Which leads us to reason number 2. My older sister, my mother's only other child, died a little over two years ago. This destroyed my mother. And I feel that if I were to also die young (currently 22), she would lose what little sanity she has held onto. I'm disgusted in myself for resenting my sister for this because, as I stated earlier, I've been wanting to die so desperately for years. So, I'm seemingly trapped in this miserable existence by nothing other than my own principles and my love for my mother. I wish I could just do it but I can't. Again, I don't know why the fuck I'm saying this. Maybe someone else on the depression subreddit will gain valuable insight from this but I find that to be highly unlikely. I'm just screaming into the void, aren't I...
