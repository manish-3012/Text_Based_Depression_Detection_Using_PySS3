masturbating in the same bed as someonea few years ago my parents were repairing our house and i was stuck sharing a room with my younger and older siblings. it was my bedroom and they were staying in there. one night i (22F) decided to masturbate simply because it was a routine to do that and fall asleep and i didnâ€™t think they would notice. i feel really guilty about this now because at the time the only intention of it was to do that and fall asleep which i did but now i feel like i really wronged them because they were right there? one was asleep and the other blaring music in headphones i didnâ€™t think about them and it was completely seperate from them but i feel suicidal over this because i was so selfish and inconsiderate. i think i might commit suicide. idk if i can live with myself.
