I keep writing draft letters in my head.I can't stop it. No matter how hard I try to think of something else. I sit in my room and write draft suicide letters in my head. Apologizing profusely, begging my family not to blame each other, trying to explain myself all of these things and more. I'm just scared as to what will happen when I finally find the best way to say what I mean. I'm getting closer every day. I know it. My birthday is tomorrow. My 21st actually. I have no plans. My mom offered to take me to the only bar in town. She invited my dad and brother. They don't want to go so I guess it's just me and her. I can't stop picturing her face, her reaction when she hears the news or god forbid is the one that finds me.
