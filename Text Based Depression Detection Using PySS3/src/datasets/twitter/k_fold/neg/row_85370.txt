Teetering on the edgeI'm so close to just being done with this bullshit game we call "life" and ending it all. It just seems like everywhere I look I see people who are doing much better than I am. I've had suicidal thoughts before but I've never been this close to actually doing it. I'm literally sitting on the edge of a building as I type this. All I want is someone to talk to, but nobody seems to give a shit. Like my uncle once told me, I'm just a "lost cause". The only person that I loved which is my girlfriend broke up with me a few days ago and it just makes everything so much worse. 
Even she wouldn't care if I jumped from this building right now. I mean after all, that's what she told me as I was pleading for her to stay. "I don't care".
Nobody would even know that I'm gone besides my girlfriend (now ex I guess), and like I said, I told her that I wouldn't be able to go on without her but she clearly stated that she gives zero fucks. I just want someone to talk to, someone to talk me out of doing this. Suicide hotline hung up on me so I'm not trying that again. Fuck this
