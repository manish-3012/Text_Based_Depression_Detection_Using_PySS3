I'm confused.I'm thinking about suicide everyday about two years. I think I will never try it because I afraid to die, but the idea of suicide gives me chill... and sometimes it seems like the only way... 

things are getting worse every day where I live. almost everyone I met is stupid, unreliable and angry. I hate to talking people except my family, in fact I don't even talk with my family because they always find to say things that makes me angry. it just makes me sick. but I have to survive. I'm not working since I graduated from college. I need money. I can't live like this forever. I have to communicate with those people. I have to work with them. even this idea scares me, not like social phobia or something else, I just don't want to do it. it always surprises me that how I graduated from those schools without any nervous breakdown. except the fake friends, I was always alone and I can say that my most beautiful years gone wasted, and it was just because of this two faced society. they were/they are hypocrite and abusive every topic you can imagine. I preferred to stay away for not to get any harm, but it wasn't enough. they broke my heart a lot. and I know nothing gonna change about them.

I know what I don't want to do, but I don't know what else I can do.  even if I decide what I'm gonna do, the place where I live  won't give me any chance. and the time is running out. I'm looking at people around me, on the internet... and they don't think deep. they don't even think. all they do is talking about themselves, talking about their endless problems...

I love this life. I love breathing, my eyes, my ears, every part of my body works just fine. but somehow, it's not enough. it can't stop the things going through my head. sometimes I'm planning every single detail, and sometimes the idea comes like " hey, jump from there. it's gonna be fine". 

this is not a help call or something, like I said I'm not gonna try to suicide. I just wanted to share my thoughts...
