Failing at the only thing that makes me happy.The only thing that keep my mind of off killing myself is playing this competetive game. I've had a bad streak as I wanted to play but no one was online to play so I queued with random people.  and met a few trolls which lost the games on purpose, reminding me I didn't solo queue losing my rank makes me quite frustrated as the season ends soon and you have to reach a certain rank to get limited items. I've tried to gain back the lost ranks but I still have to solo queue as no one is on to play so I keep losing making me more and more depressed. now I'm here wanting to play to make myself happy but if I lose more I'll get further and further away from my goal. if I don't play I'll not get better game wise and situation wise. I'm a mess
