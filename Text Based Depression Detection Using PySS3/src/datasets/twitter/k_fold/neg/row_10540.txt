Getting my mind straightSince January I've been going to a church and it's been nice but it's also been hell. I have a few friends there which is a HUGE step up from 2014 when I have no friends and kept to myself... 

Since I've been going I've met some really great people... people I can't seem to get off my mind... and this is difficult because well they know nothing about me and how I've gone through severe depression and severe anxiety and the only reason I haven't had an attack in a few months is because I've actually started taking my medicine...

I'm afraid they are going to find out that I tend to think about suicide a lot and that i get random anxiety and panic attacks when they aren't around...

I made my mom promise not to tell them at all because well it's something I don't want people to really know that much... Also because I don't want to guy I like to find out about all of this... 

Thanks for reading and I hope I didn't waste your time.
