What do you do whenYour girlfriend that created the best period of your life vanishes, your best friend vanishes to be with his new girlfriend, you put effort to make plans with people but no one reciprocates, no ones responding to you, you try to check up on people and do good things but no one reciprocates, two of your favorite artists die - one that helped you get through all this. You realize people keep saying it gets better but you havenâ€™t been stably happy since middle school and wasted all of your high school/past 6 years no matter how hard you try to make change. Iâ€™m coming to a dead end at this point
