i cant stop thinking about how much i want to dieI just want to end my useless, worthless, stupid existence. Every waking moment I think about it, I haven't gone more then 5 minutes without fantasising about death, I can't remember the last time I was happy, or even content with my life. I just want to die, I want it all to be done so I don't have to live out a depressed lonely life, I'm not afraid to die, I'm afraid to keep living, and I'm a coward who can't face my fears.
