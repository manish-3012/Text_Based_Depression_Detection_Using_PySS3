I canâ€™t...I just want to end everything. I hurt myself again today. I donâ€™t know what to do, or who to turn to. Im suffering from major ptsd, anxiety, and depression. I have nothing, and no one.i just want to feel happy. Itâ€™s been so long, I just donâ€™t think I can do it anymore...  I want to hurt myself for the last time today. I want to never wake up.
