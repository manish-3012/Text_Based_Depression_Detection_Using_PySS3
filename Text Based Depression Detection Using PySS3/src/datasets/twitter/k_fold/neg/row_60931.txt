I have no reason to be suicidalI feel wrong feeling now I do.  I am a 16/M, come from a very well off family, and have chronic anxiety, and high functioning autism. I have a strong group of friends and positive interests but I canâ€™t do anything to shake my continuous wish for death. Itâ€™s all I can ever think about, but I feel terrible because I have so much and I donâ€™t even know why I feel the way I do
