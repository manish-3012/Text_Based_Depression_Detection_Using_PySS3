The only reason why people are ok with me is because im really good at hiding who i actually amwtf is wrong with me. I'd say I have a decent amount of friends at school and at least I think I have good social skills, but only superficial friendships, nobody I can really talk to. It's not like people are fucked up here though, everyone is cool and friendly its just me that's the problem.

It's not like I don't try either, i'm really outgoing but its never enough. I make friends with someone, we're cool at first but as soon as they start to get to know me they distance themselves, every time. I wish I could have a video of my first person POV and thoughts throughout the day, just to show how lonely i am. I cry everyday after school for the past two years.

Nobody hits me up, nobody invites me to anything, nobody wants to hang out with just me. I understand when people say stuff like "it's an open invite you can just say you want to come" and I know its kind of lame to be sad over small stuff like that. But is it too much to ask for to feel wanted, why doesn't anyone wanna be friends with me...

my parents didn't want me, my peers don't want me, i'm not one of those people that can be by themselves. I wanna have friends to share stuff with, to talk about my day with, to vent to.

what's the point in living if nobody cares about you, I know that sounds irrational or over dramatic but it's just how i feel
