I dont know how long I can keep going.I hate this bitter complaining yet again! I had hope for the future but it is slowly diminishing. I feel trapped. No energy to push foward, no energy to get anything done. I have such a weak will. Im pathetic. Im better off dead. Real life is just too much for me to handle.
