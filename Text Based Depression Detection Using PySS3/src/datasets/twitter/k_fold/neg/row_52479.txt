I WILL kill myself, please give me advice on how to do it.I know this subreddit isn't created for these kinds of questions. But no one can change my mind, I've been lurkig here for a while now. Talked with many friends, loved ones etc. Every second I spend on this planet is a second full of agony.

I WILL kill myself soon, no talk here can change that. Since you fellas are the redditors who know the most about suicide stuff, what I'm asking you is to give me an advice about the steps. I will get a shotgun and shoot myself in the head with it. But what can I do to make this a clean, stable shot? Do I just hold it against my head and pull the trigger? Will it not recoil and misdirect? Should I build a system which will hold the gun for me?

If you help me now, I will die with no agony. If you don't, I might suffer much more. At least give me the advice that I want, then talk about ''don't do it'' stuff. 

Please, don't delete this thread. Please help me. This is my final wish from this world. Let me end this cleanly.
