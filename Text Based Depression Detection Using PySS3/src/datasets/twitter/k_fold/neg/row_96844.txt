tales of a suicidal cowardiâ€™m too scared to kill my self. iâ€™m worried about consequences too much and i donâ€™t want my family to deal with finding my body and the embarrassment of explaining their daughter wiped herself off the planet. 

iâ€™m not religious, iâ€™d probably consider myself an atheist but my anxiety and how i was raised makes me worried about the fiery pit of hell waiting for me. 

i just want an escape. i want to be able to go through the rituals of preparing to end my life but at the same time iâ€™m too depressed to even shower properly, how could i collect all my supplies and make everything  at peace? 

all of this has made me extremely reckless with my life. i hope someone isnâ€™t paying attention and accidentally kills me to save me the time and effort.  it would be easier on anyone that cares about me to be able to blame another living being for my death rather than accepting i reached out to receive no help and blew my brains out. 


i donâ€™t want to hurt anymore
