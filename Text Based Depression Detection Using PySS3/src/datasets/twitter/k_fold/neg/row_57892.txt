Hey.It's been really bad. I don't know what to even say right now. I want to tell my friends suicide is haunting my mind, but I don't want to deal with the consequences of telling them. I don't want the attention.
But I guess I do want to talk about it if I am here rambling to strangers who choose to read. I can't find a way out. I don't want to be here anymore and suicide sounds so comforting. I hate people would think I am selfish. I think it is selfish to want me to live a life I didn't choose, or can't handle. I can't do this.
I feel these people who would call me selfish are selfish, too. They want me to live just so I can dab in there life here and there for their own entertainment. I contribute more bad than good. If I were to die I feel people would cry and pretend they knew me. Use my death as a means of attention from others. That is what sickens me. All of a sudden people would care and act we were so close and they understood.
I want to do it. It makes sense to me. I hate how sick I am, I know this isn't normal but I don't know what normal is. How am I expected to get professional help when I can't leave my bedroom for days/weeks? I lay for hours and can't get any energy to even go urinate. It's painful not going to the bathroom for hours or even days on end. It's pathetic, I give myself UTIs. I don't shower, I don't change clothes, I don't brush my hair, I do nothing. Whenever I do shower it's a small victory to me, but for what? Nothing good comes out of it. I end up in bed all over again.
I wish I wasn't clinically diagnosed with major depression. This is hell. I am only digging a deeper hole for myself and I can't fix anything. I just want to end things and not be me. Suicide just sounds so soothing. Suicidal thoughts seem to be my only friend lately. I can't handle this.
