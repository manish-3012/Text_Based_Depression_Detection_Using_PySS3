Im so weak...So, i have GAD and Bi-polar. I have been happy and stable for a whole year! 
 Recently on my birthday i hurt my back and had to go to hospital, since then i have been having consistent anxiety attacks and the constant feeling of panic, coming and going in waves, strong and soft, i cant eat anything other than bananas and water, im currently seeking help from doctors and mental health professionals but i still cant cope.. my body is weak and tired from fighting, i was taken to the ED twice in 3 days, i am suppose to just wait for my "Meds to kick in" but im struggling. My GP has stated that im not to be left alone since i have hurt myself once already. 
 Im taking vitamins and trying to eat and using grounding and mindfulness exercises but nothing is helping, in the morning i wake up very early and the anxiety starts straight away and i cant get back to sleep! Im becoming increasingly suicidal and im scaring myself..
