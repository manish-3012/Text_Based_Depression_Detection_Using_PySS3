Severe depression 44 years long completely aloneâ€”goodbye.I don't want this or any other life. It's worthless and useless. I'm neither wanted nor needed. 
Each day older, more in debt, always alone. 
I hate myself and can't see why anyone else would like me. 
This is all just too much. I've had it with everything. 
Goodbye.
