I'm a waste of spaceI didn't ask to be born. Everyone around me would be so much better if I wasn't around. My family has made it clear that they'd be alot happier if I wasn't around. I wish I had the the courage to end myself. Maybe one day I will. I'm miserable almost every day and I don't want to go on if this is what the rest of my life will be like. I such a pathetic loser I wish I could sleep forever.
