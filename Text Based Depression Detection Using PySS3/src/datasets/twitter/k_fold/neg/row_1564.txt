If I don't finish my game, I'm gonna kill myself.If I do not finish my game that I have been working on for months, I'm gonna blow my brains out. I have been working on it for years and if I fail at it, that's it. There's no reason to live. School is shit, my personal life is shit, I have no one to live for, no light at the end of the tunnel. I will probably live stream it too.
