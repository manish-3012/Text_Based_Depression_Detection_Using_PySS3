I can't do this anymoreIts been days i've been planning to take my own life. My life itself has been nothing but pain for years but especially bad in the last 6 months. Everyday I wake up in pain and have to rely on painkillers and wait for phone calls from doctors to tell me what is wrong with me. I've had multiple blood tests every month and nothing keeps coming up. I can't live like this. My dad who I live with thinks i'm just lazy that i'm making up this pain. Its driving me crazy theres nothing I can do. I spent my savings because I had to stop going to school to take care of this man last year and I am now trapped here looking after him. His kidneys are failing but apparently hes being elevated on the donor list so he has progress on the way. But me on the other hand can't even get a straight answer or even a second opinion from another doctor in this town. Its months and months of painkillers and feeling like I am slowly dieing and being taken advantage of. I've been planning on getting my car running and taking as much alcohol and tylenol out into the boonies and just over dosing aiming to be far enough away from people it would take a few days to be found. I know I need to consume at least 15 grams+ to finish this and I want the alcohol to help. Therapy is getting me nowhere and same for doctors. Part of me thinks maybe I should look for help but really what would that do other than make me labeled as an attention seeker? I need to kill myself right the first time. I just can't do this anymore this life isn't enjoyable its a hell and honestly anything has to be better than this i'm hit from all sides.
