My life keeps crashing just as I start to recover/pick up steamI was broken up with about 2.5 months ago. She didnâ€™t block me on social media until two days ago, and that was the fourth time I considered suicide (this time more seriously than others).

I realized I have had depression for a while (I didnâ€™t know I had it while dating), but I had curtailed it sufficiently at first during the relationship, but then started sinking back into it (unintentionally) in the latter half, and the breakup only exacerbated matters. I lost control of myself badly, including several instances of thinking of suicide. When I realized Iâ€™ve had depression for a while, that was the third time, and it was a dangerous instance because I was actually on public transit (my thoughts have always been to jump in front of a train).

Since then, I got better, even laughing at my failings while dating. Iâ€™ve been going out more and my life has generally been on the upswing. I was actually working on removing her tab from my brainâ€™s browser. Until she blocked me. It was at that point I was seriously considering suicide, which made me afraid to get on public transit, and I ended up asking a friend to take me to the emergency room for it. I am really worried about myself now. Iâ€™m still afraid to go on public transit. Iâ€™m also really worried that the next time my life is in an upswing only for it to crash hard I might not just _consider_ suicide (if you get my drift).

Iâ€™m already getting professional help for it. Iâ€™ve set up a plan of action in case those thoughts came back. But Iâ€™m worried it may be too late.

* Iâ€™m writing this on mobile, so there might be a chance that last â€œconsiderâ€ isnâ€™t underlined. If that is the case, just know that â€œconsiderâ€ is the stressed word, not â€œsuicide.â€
