What is even the point of breathing at this point?I'm literally just a waste of space at this point. I'm 22, can't drive, no job, high school drop out, just basically a waste of a human being. I'm taking away air that something worthy can breathe instead of me. My stupid fucking anxiety rules my life and I'm letting it, simply because I'm not strong enough to help myself. I'm losing my friends left and right. They're all getting tired of me. Constantly whining and complaining about my stupid worthless life. My boyfriend is about fed up with me and more or less just ignores me anymore to study. No matter there, college is more important anyway. My father hates my guts as always. My mother pretends to care but she really doesn't. Nobody cares anymore. They pretend but they really don't. they don't understand my fear and pain everyday waking up. Waking up to another day dragging my stupid life out. I can't deal with it anymore. Yet I'm too cowardly to take my own life. I think about it constantly. Knowing that if I just hang myself or slit my own throat, it'll all be over. I few moments of agonizing pain is nothing compared to a lifetime of pain ahead of me. But I'll never do it. I'll continue sitting here, suffering, alone. I just wish my heart would stop beating, my blood stop pumping, my body just shut down so I can finally be released from my pain.
