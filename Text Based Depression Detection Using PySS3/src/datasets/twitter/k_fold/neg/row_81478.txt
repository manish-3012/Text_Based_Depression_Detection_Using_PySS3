Never thought I would make it past 18.I'm laying here thinking about how I thought I would never make it past 18. I wish I hadn't. Every day suicidal ideation creeps in to my head. Last night I self harmed again for the first time in about 2 years. Maybe my mother was right and I would be better off dead. I don't know. I think about turning on the bathtub and taking somw sleeping pills and taking my boxcutter and locking the door. Slice a clean cut down my legs and just lay there as I bleed out. Has anyone ever tried to drown themselves? My mind feels like its rotting and falling apart. Curse my mother for making me. I never asked to be fucking born. All I feel like is a burden upon others. I hate myself and I hate my brain. There's no cure for how I am. Maybe a better alternative would just to fling myself off the 3rd floor balcony. Not sure if that would actually kill me unfortunately. If only. If only I wasn't a miserable shitty person. All I do is wallow in my own sadness. Well soon my sadness will surround me and I'll drown in it.
