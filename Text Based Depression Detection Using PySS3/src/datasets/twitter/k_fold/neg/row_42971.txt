Goodbye.I'm not going to write a huge wall of text. This is just a goodbye to whoever cares anymore. I am ending my life tonight. It's more of an end to the pain that I feel everyday. I broke today. I can't get myself back together. I started to self harm. I don't have anyone anymore. I always seem to lose everything. I can't wait to finally die. Goodbye.
