i need someone to speak tomy life feels hopeless rn lol no friends and I honestly do not feel anything towards my own family anymore, the only person I've grown to love left me and seeing her everyday tortures me because it reminds me of something I'll never feel again. I feel like disappearing one day in the middle of work and just flat out kill myself. I feel empty and like nothing I do matters again
