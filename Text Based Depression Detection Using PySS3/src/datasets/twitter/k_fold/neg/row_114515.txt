I finally have a planMoray of all, yes, I get it.

The username is ironic.


I walk with a cane and I'm constantly popping pain pills. 7 650mg of acetaminophen a day.

If I take enough of these I just pass away.

I drive out to the other side it the country where no one knows me, down the whole bottle, and die in peace.

All I have to do is get my car on Tuesday.
