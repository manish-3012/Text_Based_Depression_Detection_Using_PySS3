i regret not killing myself a few years agoI'm tired of hearing the same overused statements from people that know about my mental situation "It gets better" "Suicide is a permanent solution to blahblahblah suck my ass karen, it got way worse. As soon as I grasped the concept of death as a child I had this feeling that I'm going to die young. Now I know what the cause of my death will be. I feel so stupid for being hopeful in the past, hanging onto life only brought me more suffering. I just wanted to be normal, I didn't ask for my chronic illness, my eating disorder or my suicidal thoughts. 
I don't have any people I consider my friends and I don't care about my family members, they abused me in the past both physically and emotionally and they're like the main reason behind my trauma, I don't care about their feelings, I actually wish they'll suffer if they find about about my death. 
I work a minimum wage job so I obviously can't go to therapy when i barely afford rent. I keep going to work even if I hate my job because I'll never find a job I like or at least I'm okay with since I dont have any passions/interests.
I dont have anybody/anything to live for and I OBVIOUSLY don't want to live for myself, I'm tired of waiting for something good to happen and I'm tired of trying to make myself feel better and failing miserably. I quit.
