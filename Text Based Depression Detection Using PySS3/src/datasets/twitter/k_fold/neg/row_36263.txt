I want to kill myself because of the absolute shit show that is my bodyAs I growing up during my later childhood and teenage years, I was unfortunately in a bad mindset and wasn't educated in the ways of cleaning myself, looking after my health and general hygiene, I would go days without showering or bathing, weeks without brushing my teeth and months without exercise. It wasn't until I was nearing my 20s that I started to realise, thanks to my brain switching on, that I needed to look after myself.

Unfortunately, in my mid-20s I'm so depressed, ashamed and frankly, given up on the idea that my body will ever be attractive or healthy looking in any way.

There's stretch marks, light and dark, covering nearly every inch of my body, on my shoulders, upper arms, arm pits, breasts, stomach, upper thighs, back and inner thighs. They are hideous and very visible.

My gums are receding, a few of the top front teeth have bumps where the gum would be, it used to be only on one, now it's on 5-6. My dentist said it would gradually stop if I kept brushing regularly and flossing but it's become worse, I'm no longer visiting the dentist because of anxiety.

My face is covered with black heads, clogged pores, redness and greasiness. It's extremely unpleasant to look at.

I have hair folecules all over my skin and on my breasts, if you're close it looks like I have hair growing on them, which is awful.

I wish I looked after myself when I was a teenager, but my single mother didn't tell me anything about it, she didn't mention I needed to brush my teeth, nor that I stunk, which now I realise that I did, incredibly so, especially from the bullying I received.

I see no other way that my body will ever be free of this other than to stop my condemned self from continuing this torture.
