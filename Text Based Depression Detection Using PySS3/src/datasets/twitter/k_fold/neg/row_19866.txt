Im a loser and a disappointment and I'll never amount to anythingI can't drive, don't have a job, have a girlfriend that never responds to my messages, dropped out most of my classes I was supposed to take this semester, and am so stupid I can't do simple actions like playing video games. Im no where near where I'm supposed to be in life. Im a complete loser. A disappointment to all those around me. I tried changing myself to make others like me but it didn't work. I just wanna fucking die so I stop being a disappointment.
