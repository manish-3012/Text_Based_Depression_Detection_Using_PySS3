Why can't I just die.So many people who want so badly just to live die every day. And here I am, almost 22 and I'm ready for it to be over with I should take the place of one of those people who want to live. My life will never be anything that I want it to be. I guess I'll just have to end it myself. Maybe this fall? I'm so goddamn tired of this life I feel as though I'm ready. I very much wish I had never been born or died as an infant. There's nothing but cruelty in this world, but there's nothing so cruel as hope.
