It seems like everyone wants to die.Everyday I bottle up my own feelings and struggles so that I can do my job and help everyone else around me. I want help so badly but I am afraid to ask, to be a burden to anyone because it feels like everyone else also hates life. I don't want to make anyone else feel worse by telling them I want to die too when they all look up to me. So I just go through the motions, wishing I could have a psychotic breakdown or a heart attack, anything to change this mindless robotic life I've created for myself. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so overwhelmed with the responsibility of being a manager and with my families health problems. I don't know what I need, I feel like I duck at life and I don't deserve to breathe everyday.
