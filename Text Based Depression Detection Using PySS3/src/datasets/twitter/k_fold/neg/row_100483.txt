i just want someone to talk to, anyone. just someone to listen to me for a little while.I just graduated from high school 2 days ago. I have a new car. the happiness stops there. my girlfriend broke up with me, I have no self confidence, I feel like I don't matter half the time and nothing seems to make me happy. and to top that off, I just got a speeding ticket. is this really what life is going to be like? my school years were hard, but I don't know what to do if things get any worse... someone just please let me share my story with you because there's so much more, ill also gladly listen to yours to. Ill help whoever helps me by talking, it's the least I could do. just talk to me that's all I ask :(
