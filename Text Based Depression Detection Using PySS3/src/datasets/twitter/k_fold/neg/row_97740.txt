All Suicide Hotlines BusyIve tried the texting service for the National Suicide Prevention lifeline... I've been in line for 27 minutes waiting, I texted 741-741 and I have been waiting 15 minutes, and I called the 1-800 number and I have been listening to hold music for 15 minutes. I need help I'm not well.
