Every night I look at my noose and wonder if it'll finally be the night I have the balls to do it.It's been a shitty day just like every other day. Tonight is good of a night as there'll ever be. I think once you've reached the point I have where suicide is inevitable then you realize there's no point in waiting, but sometimes I still can't do it. I even hate myself for that. I wish I had the nerve to end it. I have nothing to live for, no hope, no second guesses, I'm certain of this. I just have to fight to actually do it and then that'll finally be the end of it. Maybe it'll be tonight maybe tomorrow who knows
