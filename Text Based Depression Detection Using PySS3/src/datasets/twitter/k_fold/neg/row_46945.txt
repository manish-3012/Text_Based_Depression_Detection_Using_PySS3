Friends left me, and with them my last tether to life.Over the years as my friends became adults and started moving into life, we've drifted apart, and not my any lack of effort on my part. At this point I don't think I can really consider them my friends anymore. I have had 0 luck making friends with people as an adult now, and it seems like life has taken away the three I'd kept throughout highschool.

I think thats really the last thing that kept me from killing myself. I think it'll be inevitable at this point that I'll just kill myself. I don't really have anything that makes me want to stay here in this world. No joy, passion, connections, so I guess I'll just leave?
