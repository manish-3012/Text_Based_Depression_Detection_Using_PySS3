i had the knife in my hand, but i didn't do it.&gt;an audiobook played in the background, a switchblade with a skull print stuck out of his throat. his body convulsed and spurted out blood from his mouth and wound onto the wooden floor as he slowly lost consciousness.

was the scenario i imagined. why didn't i do it then? i don't think i'll know, but the idea felt nice. the commitment to death is terrifying, but the process itself and loosing consciousness seems strangely pleasing.

i'm guessing i didn't do it because there are things to do. my life isn't half bad. i have good grades, i have supportive friends, i came out as trans and everyone near me accepted me, my parents provide me with anything i need. why am i depressed if my life is so good?

i attempted suicide last spring, and sometimes i regret i didn't go all the way. other times, i'm glad i didn't die. i don't want to live for others, but for myself, but sometimes i can barely get out of bed in the mornings.

is anyone else a mess like me?
