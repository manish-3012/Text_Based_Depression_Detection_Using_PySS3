Im 14 and been thinking about suicide for some years months nowIm starting to feel a little suicidal again these days and ive been wondering what happens after you die in this world do people hate you for it how do they feel about it because i feel you can live all life long with everybody hating you but when you are dying or you are in your deathbed everybody suddenly likes and loves you then im guessing if i die everybody around me will like me right?? Since my whole class hates me if i die they will like me right?? I wont be the same person who is called shady and gets thrown around like trash right? I will be like some a higher human dead being because in this life i understand there are people who like you and hate you but since in my life everybody hates me so much and my parents think im gonna be so happy that they bought me something and im supposed to forget about all those shit memories of them beating me since "money buys happiness". Man but i remember what you told me that there are people that care and im going to find them sometime in the future and that you care but every single day im just walking closer to that hill of so much despair the only thing in my mind is sadness pain and suicide
