Help, maybe. Not life threatening.Hi, I've been on this thread before. In some really dark moments. 
I'm actually trying to stay out of one of those now. I just started coming back from a pretty intense panic attack. I could really use just a little conversation to pull my thoughts together so they don't go towards suicide.
