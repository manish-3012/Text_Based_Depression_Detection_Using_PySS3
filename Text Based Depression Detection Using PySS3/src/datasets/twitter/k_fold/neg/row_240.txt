I hate this world so muchI wish I could just create my own planet and live on there. I'm so sick of people. I do not want to live anymore. I mean I want to live but NOT ON THIS PLANET. No matter what I do people will always treat me like shit. It's like once you have been bullied in highschool you are deemed to be the victim for the rest of your life. Because that's how your brain has been wired. It knows no better than to be the victim - even after highschool - in any situation. My life feels like I'm stuck in playing a shitty game day after day over and over again. And always the same shit happens. It's like a vicious cycle - you think you grow as a person and you're not in the same position you were 5 years ago but you always realize that you' re still a loser. Why can't there be a button that will just end it all? Is that too much to ask for? :/
