There's no hope for me anymoreI dont have interest in living on anymore and i dont have any desires. The amount of interest i have in things like family, religion and health are close to nonexistent. There's nothing that can make me believe that I won't die alone and that I'll ever be happy or satisfied with my life. I don't see the point in having a future anymore. Im getting extremely close to truly not caring about anything and i dont know what to do.
