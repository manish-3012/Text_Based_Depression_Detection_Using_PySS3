Useless motherEveryone would be better off without me. My child is 23 months and the bond still isn't there. That feeling you get when you first hold your baby - nope. The bond grows as they get older - nope. I don't wish my child to not be here, I just wish they weren't stuck with me. My child had more fun with others. I want the freedom I had before I became a mother. I'm selfish. I can't have any of that. I don't enjoy any of it and I don't think I ever will. I keep thinking of how to end things and thinking through the various methods in my head. If I get physically I'll, people show concern. They know I have postnatal depression but that barely gets any attention. My therapist discharged me despite knowing I was in a worse state than when I started and in the middle of a huge run of terrible luck, which has continued. I keep trying to imagine that things can only get better, then something else bad happens. I'm not religious but, if I was, I'd wonder what I'd done to anger the gods. I hate myself. I need a break but then I get one and I can only cry and then contemplate suicide. I want the old me back and I can't have that so I don't want to be here.
