please i need some helpSo i have been having suicidal thoughts for some years. Some periods the feeling was almost fleeting like just a thought. Other times it lead to some kind of attempt. Lately things have started to become better and better. Still feel like this though. Still whenever i see some wire i think that i could hang myself with that. I am ok with the idea of dying. Just dont want to think about the ones i leave behind. On the other hand, the ones who know about my "condition" , i feel like i am a burden to them.Anyway the reason i am writing here is cause i need help. I am afraid of going to the doctor. Is there anything else i can do? Or should i just end it?
