I am patheticHere I am at 11:46pm writing this crying sitting on the wall of the tub crying listening to juice wrld wishing I died all because my stupid fucking father wanted to rape my older sister when she was 12 I haven't felt like living in over 4 years it's been 7 years since he went to prison and I can't believe it 
I feel like I would've been open to living if I was able to experience life the way all my friends did but instead I got taken out of school at 13 (I'm 16 now) and didn't get to experience the "best years" of my life already not liking life I have nothing anymore and I just hope my sisters don't get sad when I kill myself soon 
Oh what am I saying they probably don't give half a fuck
