I canâ€™t live without physical intimacy anymore, but the only person I want it from is with someone else...Iâ€™m 35. In a long term, dead, sham of an open relationship. She still loves me, but mostly as a friend and buddy. I still care about her, but I havenâ€™t loved her in 11 years or more. Sheâ€™s incredibly low libido and has no desire for any sort of physical intimacy except cuddling while we sleep (and only then). Zero sex drive as well. Iâ€™m incredibly high libido and I crave physical affection more than anything. Finally, Iâ€™m not attracted to her at all. 

In fact, I find that even though my desire for physical infancy and sex has never been higher in my whole life, I literally canâ€™t get hard to anything or anyone but a single, specific person.

This person and I reconnected in April after at least 15 years of not speaking. There was a LOT of sexual tension right from the word go, but because of some...unique circumstance I canâ€™t talk about, nothing happened then. But in early June I went and stayed with her for almost a week and holy fuck, it was the best week of my life. Iâ€™ve never been so happy or so fulfilled, physically, emotionally, mentally, or otherwise. Ever.

We made plans to see each other again soon. The 27th Iâ€™m supposed to be seeing her again. We made all sorts of plans. And since then, sheâ€™s started seeing someone else. And while she still wants me to come up, itâ€™s just as friends. Iâ€™ve spoken to her a bit about my feelings, but our unique situation makes things near impossible for us long term.

But I donâ€™t want anyone else. My body doesnâ€™t want anyone else. I canâ€™t get hard to even my favorite porn anymore. Just her. And Iâ€™m losing my mind.

All I think about is her and this other guy and all the plans we made that apparently now donâ€™t mean shit and how desperate I am just to hold her again.

And Iâ€™ve realized I canâ€™t go back to the way things were. I canâ€™t go back to not having that physical intimacy, love, and yes, sex, in my life. Iâ€™d rather be dead. Life without those things isnâ€™t life at all. Itâ€™s a fucking miserable existence and I canâ€™t tollerate another second of it much less another 30-40 years.

So Iâ€™m gana go see her, lay everything in the table, and then, when the hammer falls and I get the reaction I expect, Iâ€™m going to kill myself there.

Itâ€™s funny. I was always so scared of death. Terrified. I thought nothing could be worse. But going even a few more weeks without someone to touch me and love me and want me is far, far worse. Itâ€™s so empty. Makes me feel so worthless and ugly. Like thereâ€™s this huge hole in me, this gaping wound. I just want her to touch me and Iâ€™d be healed. But she wonâ€™t. And I donâ€™t want to cry anymore or miss her anymore or hear her voice in my head making plans weâ€™ll never keep anymore. Sleep isnâ€™t even a refuge. I either dream of me and her making love or her and him. Either way I wake up sobbing.

So Iâ€™m fighting with everything I have to eat there and make the best case for us I can. But I know that itâ€™s not going to be enough and that I wonâ€™t be coming back to where I live now.

There are so many things Iâ€™m gana miss. But I canâ€™t deal with this constant pain anymore. It gets worse every day. And if I canâ€™t be with her, Iâ€™d rather just be dead.

Thank you for rreading this. Iâ€™m not looking to be saved. Unless youâ€™re her, thereâ€™s literally nothing you could do or say to make this better. Iâ€™d do anything to make the pain stop, but it seems thereâ€™s only one thing to do. So, yeah. Wish me luck when I talk to her. And wish me goodbye after.
