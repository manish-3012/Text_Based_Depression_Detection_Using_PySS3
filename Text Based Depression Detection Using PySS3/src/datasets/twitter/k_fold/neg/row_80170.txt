I want to dieI've had chronic depression since 6th grade. My parents don't believe me and don't let me go to therapy (I couldn't go alone, they're my only ride). They obsessively check my phone and computer and highly monitor the internet server and use something as small as a meme against me so I can't talk to anyone about my feelings. I've been so depressed for so long that it doesn't even feel like depression anymore. Come to think of it, I've felt almost nothing about anything for years. I don't have literally anything to live for. I only have one friend who talks shit about me and is stoned 24/7. Death is the only way to escape from my depression and loneliness.
