Iâ€™ve given up.I hate my self and my life. I feel like I want to jump off a cliff every day. I just want it to stop.
Iâ€™ve been emotionally abused for 2 maybe more years by my own parents, for every time they fight between themselves they somehow always find a reason to blame me for their marriage, Iâ€™ve been said to my face that I was a mistake, It was my fault that their marriage was going south (I was born and it put a strain on them), they always deny that they have said something that hurt me, they sometimes smack me (not hard enough to leave a mark) and itâ€™s only gotten worse since quarantine hit, I hate my self and Iâ€™m so angry at everything and whenever I try to talk about my feelings to them i get called dramatic and then they argue about how I shouldnâ€™t share my feelings with you guys because â€˜whatâ€™s said in the family stays in the familyâ€™ and I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore and I feel like itâ€™s all my fault that this has happened, Iâ€™ve already written my note for them to find and I have a cupboard full of pills downstairs. I donâ€™t want help, I just want people to remember that all abuse is abuse, no matter if you can see it or not, I love you all, see you later, maybe
