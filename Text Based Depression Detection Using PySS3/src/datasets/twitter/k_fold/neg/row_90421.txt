i guess i am sated with life enoughsorry for my terrible english. i am 34 years old. i am feeling like i am sitting at a dinner table with people. i am not hungry, i tasted almost all meals, deserts, fruits on table. but i can't leave table because will be shame for other people. i am not feeling tired, i have energy, so problem is not depressive mood. just i dont want eat anymore, i dont want part of this logic circle anymore. i can't say them "just let me go" , because they will not understand i know. i am bored enough about this life games, i don't want to be part of these things. ok i played and enjoyed enough. i loved and be loved so much, i had a life not so beautiful but it was ok. so yes i know it can be selfish now leave table but also keep someone in somewhere forcible is selfish too, we all know that. i don't know what to say but i guess i can't pass this winter as alive.
