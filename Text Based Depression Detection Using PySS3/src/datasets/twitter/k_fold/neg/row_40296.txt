Don't really think I'll be killing myself, but I feel like I want to.Title. It's mostly a matter of feeling this way. I've attempted in the past. I feel like I want to kill myself, but I kind of know that it'll subside. Sorry if that doesn't make sense. Still, life is just overwhelming.  
I hate being trans. I hate the fact that my father will disown me for who I am, and that my mom will be emotionally devastated. I thought school would be an escape, but that's just more people treating me like a guy, and more people treating me like some freak. Yeah, there's the support group, and seeing them is the only thing that keeps me going. But I'm just sick of not being able to do anything. I just want to be treated  like a girl. I hate existing in this body. Even my brother, who was really accepting, is still calling me "dude" and things like that. It's frustrating to no end.
