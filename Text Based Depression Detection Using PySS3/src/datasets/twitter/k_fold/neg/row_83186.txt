ugly fat ugly fat inferior unfit WORTHLESS specimenFor the third time this week I was rejected by a tinder match after they found out I was a natural blonde. Iâ€™ve even had a date say EW to my face when she found out. I dye my eyebrows brown so it isnâ€™t immediately obvious. Then just now my most recent match blocked me after asking if I was naturally blonde. I feel like fucking shit. Born inferior. Born worthless. Never able to be a man. I know itâ€™s true that as a male, being blonde is at least a three to four point reduction in attractiveness if not a complete dealbreaker. I canâ€™t change that. But I can change other things. I donâ€™t eat anymore and I have not in a long time. I was 230 lb last summer and I am 168 now (I am 6â€™3â€). Mewing. I beat myself on the cheekbones too in hopes of making them a little more prominent. Saving up for plastic surgery. I have half a mind to never speak to anyone I get until I get it. I am so ugly that people want me dead just for existing. Iâ€™m not some incel, I have had a pretty dynamic and vibrant sex and dating life for a long time and I donâ€™t know why none of that validation sticks with me. I donâ€™t know anything. I wish I was a brunette. Iâ€™m so subhuman. I can literally never look masculine or handsome because of my disgusting putrid blonde genes. I have been hanging curtains over my mirror at this point because its tok hard to look at myself. im drowning, i dont know what to do, how can i accept being SO inferior
