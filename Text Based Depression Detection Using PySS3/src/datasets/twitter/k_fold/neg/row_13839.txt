I'm going to kill myself when my parents dieI've been sitting in fear for a few days now, of people I know dying. I get panic attacks when the phone rings, thinking it's news that someone in our church has died. My grandfathers are gone. The losses were painful enough for me. I can't LIVE without my parents, so when they die, I'll kill myself.
