AccidentsAccidentally posted a video of my mom trying to hurt me and a video of me talking about suicide and how shitty my life has been.

I ran out of space because my phone is full of videos of my mom hurting me, screaming at me and just the normal abusive stuff. I posted the latest videos on Facebook and put it on private, but I put it in a folder, but the folder is public, so quite some people saw that. Lol. Didn't noticed it until my friend asked me if I'm okay. Deleted it instantly. Some people has been reaching out to me, but I still feel like shit.

I wasn't really gonna commit suicide though. I mean I wrote letters and all, but i didn't continue... Anyway my family are still pretty quiet about it, even though I know a lot of my family saw it. Hurts, because it's their sister who's hurting me, but they don't care. Even though I grew up with them. That's a really shitty feeling.
