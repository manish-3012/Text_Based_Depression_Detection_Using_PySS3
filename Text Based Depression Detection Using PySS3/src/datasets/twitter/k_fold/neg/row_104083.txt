Having a really bad day todayI've been having suicidal thoughts for most of my life. I'm 22 now and lately my state of mind has gotten much worse, culminating in today when I spent the whole day beating my leg with a piece of wood and struggling to do even basic things like wash or go to the bathroom.

I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to go into detail about methods of suicide, but just now I physically 'tested' one to see how it felt, and it took a lot of effort not to just go through with it, to the point where I stopped in a panic that I'd suddenly commit to it. It's shaken me a lot more than I expected, because when I was doing it the urge to just go all the way felt so powerful. It wasn't like sitting on a ledge and getting the urge to jump, it was like eating one biscuit in the packet and realising you could just eat the whole thing - like it would be no big difference.

I didn't expect to feel like that at all, and it's really frightened me. I've never spoken to anyone about how I feel before, but I think I'm going to have to talk to a doctor about this as soon as possible.
