Going to make a third attemptI've been massively depressed for three months, i have constant panic attacks, and can't sleep more than two hours a night. I can't stop thinking about dying. About inflicting pain on myself, or killing myself, or the ways I should do it that would cause the least problems for the few people who it would actually affect. 

I've attempted suicide twice in the past and failed both times, unfortunately. If i'd done it right things would've been so much simpler. 

I hate everything about myself. I wake up every morning disappointed I didn't die in my sleep. I want to simply disappear from the world as if I never existed. I feel as though I'm a constant burden to anyone and everyone I come in contact with. The world would be better off without me.
