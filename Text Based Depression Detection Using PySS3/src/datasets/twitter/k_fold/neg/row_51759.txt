All alone, everyday, a lost soul...All alone, everyday, a lost soul,

Disconnected, abandoned from life,

See through this life as a whole,

Not emotionally detached,

I took the blame, the blame for it all,

The changes that came to me that I approached,

Made me happy also pressurized against the wall

I can say, I am not affraid anymore, 

Everything must come an end,

Like the last time and the time before.
