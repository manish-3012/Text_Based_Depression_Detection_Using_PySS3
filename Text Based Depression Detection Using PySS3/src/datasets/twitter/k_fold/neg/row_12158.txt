OK momCan't sleep... Almost 2021. Not sure if I'll ever be happy at this point. My mom literally told me there's a chance I may still be a loser when I'm 40. I'm 29 now. Yes, my own mom has no faith in me. I fuckin can't stand her. I get it, I'm the fuckin black sheep of the family. I haven't been successful monetarily. I stay at mommy and daddy. I've had jobs but ok mom I know I haven't impressed u I fuckin get it. U are embarrassed of me.

I'll move out soon before I'm 30 and you will barely see me. I'll be free of your constant negativity and harsh criticism...

Sorry for this, just had to vent guys.
