Please help mePlease. I need help. I feel like I'm in the end of the line. I'm so young, yet I feel so gone. It's been a hard 15 years. I'm 15 years old. ONLY. But already want to stop. I live in a home where it shouldn't be called home. I've been fostered by my aunt because my real mother didn't want me, so I end up with her. HER. Oh god.  All these 15 years of verbal assaults and attacks. I can't deal with it. I treated her like my own mother, despite what she has been doing to me. I'm young. Why is it like this. Being constantly called a moron, a mistake, a useless piece of shit, a dumbass, a no good fucker, hell-sent, demon, a moron, a moron, a moron, a moron, a moron. I keep getting pulled down, no one is helping, I've been degraded all my life, I kept holding on to this thing called "hope" and I keep trying to not think about it. I stopped. I'm thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about it. It's getting to me. Help. I'm always abused, hurt, and heavily insulted. I want to talk to someone. Or atleast hear from someone. I can't talk to her. Any for of communication. I can't. A single "Hey Aunt?" gets me "I don't want to fucking talk to you, ugly moron." it's the exact line. It hurts, this happened just an hour ago. It hurts to hear it from someone you treated like your own Mother. I wanted to love her. I wanted her to love me. It doesn't happen. It won't happen. I'm still in pain, I'm agonizing, I've lost it. the scratch marks on my cheeks still hurts. WHAT DID I DO WRONG? Help, I can't anymore.
