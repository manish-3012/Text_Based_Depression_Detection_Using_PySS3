please respond if possiblemy ex gf feels very hurt by me, her family, and her other ex and is again expressing suicidal thoughts and drinking semi heavily which is how it went the last time i had to call on her. i'm trying not to leave her alone but she is repeatedly telling me that she needs space and i don't want to anger her right now. i'm in the other room in the apartment and i've talked to her other ex but i'm afraid of how her family is and how that might make it worse to tell her. i also don't know if i should force her to be institutionalized yet again. i don't know what to do and i feel very stressed about leaving her alone but making her angry at me
