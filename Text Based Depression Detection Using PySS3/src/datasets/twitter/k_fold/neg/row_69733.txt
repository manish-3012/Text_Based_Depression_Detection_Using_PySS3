Why is it taboo to say that you genuinely no longer want to live?A while back, around my 18th birthday at the start of September or a month or so after, I determined that I no longer wanted life. The why is irrelevant and too long to explain, but since I know myself and the situation best, I know that nothing within the realm of possibility will actually make me want to accept life again (unless some miracle happens, so I am giving myself a while). Obviously I haven't told anyone because they'd probably freak out and be all "get help" or they'd offer help themselves when in reality is I don't want their help because it won't help at all. I would love to just say, "I'll be gone by (whenever)" so that I can live the remainder of my life more normally and remove some of the would-be shock and grief or whatever, but I can't because I'm scared they'd try to force me to live, and "living" is the last thing I want. In this situation I have to prioritize myself because if I didn't, I would just get even worse. So why is wanting to reject life such a bad thing and huge scene anyways; people die of other things like accidents or disease UNINTENTIONALLY and it's not as big of a deal as a suicide because people who are close would be wondering what they could have done or whatever. In my case, they can't do anything and I want to clear that up so they can be at peace afterwards while still having the ability for myself to move on. Because it's one thing to see "there's nothing that could have been done" on a piece of paper and another to actually hear it from somebody who has accepted that and is ready to move on.
