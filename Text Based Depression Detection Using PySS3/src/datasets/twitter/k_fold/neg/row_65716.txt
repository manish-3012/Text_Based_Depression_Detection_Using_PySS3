How to deal with it?So, yesterday I opened up about my suicidal thoughts and attempts to my mom and my gf, basically cried for help, but instead I got a lot of shit that made me mad. 
My precious girlfriend yelled at me saying: â€œYou have better life than most people do, you canâ€™t think about suicide, there is people who feel much worse than you.â€ 
I donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t be suicidal if somebody somewhere feels worse. Itâ€™s just doesnâ€™t make sense to me.
My mom said that basic thing like â€œYou just have too much free time, you should get a hobby.â€ which is better, but still so useless. I believe I saw a post about such phrases here somewhere.
I instantly regretted about asking for help, I just got mad about them blaming me when I didnâ€™t choose to be suicidal. 
I donâ€™t know how to speak with them when they canâ€™t understand me at all. 
(If thereâ€™s any mistakes Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m Russian.)
