Where are you guys in real life?I'm walked on. I know I'm special; I know I'll make someone happy one day; I know I'm smart and funny; but no one seems to want me around.

People tell me they've never met someone who cares about others as much as me but it doesn't make me any less ugly

It doesn't make me any less undesirable

It doesn't make me any less walked on by others.

I swear I'm like therapist to like 10 people when all I want every Sigle
Moment is a hug. 

I hate myself. I'm 6 lines of coke deep. I'm on summer break from college. My ex keeps hitting me up to hang out and cancelling. I'm 19 and I've only had sex with two people when it feels like everyone else I know is having the time of their life at this age.

I feel worthless. I feel like I'm too caring now for the social norms we've set for ourselves. 


I just want to die

I can't make a difference, not with my attitude 

I can't do anything and I'll never be loved 

I know there are good people out there

I know there are people like SW but all the people around me are just preppy fucks. Of corse I care about them but if I were to
Talk to them about my problems I'm 200% sure they'd just go "oh Gordon's been hella gay recently".

I hate feeling this way but it's been years.

I go to therapy it barely helps until I remember I'll always be ugly. 

I know I'm worth something regardless but I can't convince myself that.

Fml
