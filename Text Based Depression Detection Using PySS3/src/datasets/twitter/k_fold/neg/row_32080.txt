Grades.Not nescessarily saying im going to die, Im not motivated or planning on doing that, but the thought crosses my mind.  


My grades have been falling, I study hard and my teacher isn't good. Ive watched videos from Khan Academy and I just can't seem to get anywhere. I normally study 2 days in advance but because my parents are concerned, theyve made me stay up late finishing homework, and that's fine. But they aren't supporting me. My sister calls me retarded for my marks. My mom continously acts like everything is easy. And my dad, is the only one who understands my problems. He didn't get good marks and is succesful now, but that doesn't solve shit, the lack of support makes me understand that im just a mistake. Everyone I know gets better marks.   


Id like to be something big, change the world, but to achieve i have to learn all this useless stuff, I wish I wasn't dumb, and when Im away for 3 days and a test is the next day and I fail, no one understands.   


Ive gone silent, I don't talk to my parents unless I have questions anymore, excluding my dad.  
I'm not scared of them, they aren't physically abusive, I just don't feel like putting effort into literally speaking and talking, like I don't deserve to.
