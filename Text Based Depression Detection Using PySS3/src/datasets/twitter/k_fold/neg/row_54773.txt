Do I have a problem if I get suicidal over small things?Iâ€™ve been having thoughts of killing myself for the past few years now, and Iâ€™ve been having anger issues for a few years too
I tried self harming in the past but didnâ€™t because I didnâ€™t want it to hurt
But a while back I got so pissed about my sister leaving her shit lying everywhere and I scolded her for it, telling her I thought about killing myself Everytime I saw her shit lying around. 
She replied with something along the lines of â€œover some shit? Lol okâ€
I know what happened, I guess I was feeling upset because she wasnâ€™t taking me or my thoughts seriously. So I took my razor and tried cutting myself. It didnâ€™t break skin though, so I chugged a bottle of soju and tried it again. I thought that if I was drunk I wouldnâ€™t feel the pain. But in the end I never really broke much skin, but the next morning my wrist had red cuts
But like I didnâ€™t even draw any blood

Another time my sisterâ€™s alarm was ringing while I was doing my work, and I yelled at her to turn it off. She told me to shut the fuck up and I got so mad, but I still did. I donâ€™t know why I couldnâ€™t say anything to it, but I felt so so mad. 
I googled the lethal dose of antihistamines to od on, because Iâ€™ve got a box in my home, so itâ€™d be easy for me to go in that way. 
But google is useless so I couldnâ€™t find out the accurate or approximate dose. And I donâ€™t want to waste my pills on a death that isnâ€™t guaranteed. 

But anyways, Iâ€™ve been thinking that maybe I have a problem. I know I have anger issues, but is there something wrong with me, that causes me to turn to suicide as my first choice whenever something makes me angry in the slightest?

I donâ€™t want to see a therapist, or talk to my friends about it.
