Is there a point?To whoever is reading this I am a teen, I have made a lot of really bad mistakes in life even at my young age; the relationship between my family (mostly dad) is very patchy because of this. I have struggled with my Confidence since about 2 or 3 years ago and that's when things started to go down hill, I'm still really self conscious about a lot of stuff I do, I'm starting to wonder if there's a point and sometimes the only thing stopping me from jumping out of my flat window is how disappointed my dad and brother would be :/ (My mom left me when I was 3 years old so she's out of the picture) so I'm not even sure if there's a point because I feel like I'm starting to go a bit numb inside I'm just unsure if life is really all that it is made out to be any more I'm just a bit lost I guess...
