I'm not contemplating suicide out of depression, more out of curiosity..I don't know if this is the place to post this.. But my life is pretty average. I go to an average private school, engineering major, no girlfriend, reddit etc. I'm very run of the mill, cookie cutter.. In essence average. I have resigned myself to the fact that I will never change the world, nor become a being whom everyone treasures. I'm merely plodding along this dirt path called life, neither sprinting nor crawling. 

I just.. want to break out from this monotony I guess.. Go somewhere where none have gone before. (well.. experience what no one can explain) Seeing as how living my current life will just be going through the motions...whats the point?
