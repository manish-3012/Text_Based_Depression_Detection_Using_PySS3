So much pain in the world...There is something terribly wrong with this world. Sometimes i think im the only sane (insane?) one on this planet. Our priorities are so screwed up. We pretend we care about more than just ourselves but the truth is we're all selfish and really only care about our own self interests. This world is cold and uncaring. I cant wait to leave it behind.
