My life is mundane.I have done some thinking. I am convinced I'm not set for this life. It is built on an a system that is easily manipulated. Strings pull in the way I want them to go. I haven't figured out why the majority of the time this happens.
But when it fails..  I fail.  I can't understand this. I feel no joy for succeeding. When I don't reach that taste of success ... I fall into deep abyss with shadows I can't climb out of. 
I don't understand why anyone would want to activate any kind of task. We have no gain in life.
Why then would I continue a journey that yields no progress.
