I don't want to kill myselfAt times it might feel like I do, but I don't. I know I have so much more to do here. I know I have people here for which my death would deeply wound. I have more than many on this subreddit can say.

But that doesn't change things. That doesn't change how poisoned my mind feels. It doesn't change the fact that I dread the evenings lately, when my mind seems to drop into the lull, and when I start looking through this subreddit trying to justify the thought of killing myself.

I guess at the end of the day I'm just too damn scared. Some call it bravery to keep going, others say it's cowardice. But none of us know what's on the either side, which is the ultimate factor in all of this.

I work one day this next week, and then I'll be starting college. I've been trying so hard to work myself up, tell myself that this final two year push is all I need if I work hard enough. But I don't know. It's all too uncertain, and the alternative would be just so damn easy in concept.

I don't want to die, but I like the idea of not living.
