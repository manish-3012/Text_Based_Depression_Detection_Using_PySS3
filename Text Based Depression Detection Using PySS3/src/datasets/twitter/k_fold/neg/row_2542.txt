Started inpatient todayI've been in the hospital ever since my overdose, people are telling me I'm lucky to still be alive, which I don't feel. Anyway, I got transferred to a young people's mental health unit today and it's all pretty new and scary. My autistic brain hates new environments and new people and this is all of that at once. Maybe it's the best place for me right now but I'm really scared.
