Whatâ€™s the point.I donâ€™t understand what the point of life is when Iâ€™ve never been and probably will never be loved by someone who isnâ€™t family, Iâ€™ve never had friends and I havenâ€™t been able to leave the house for 14 years at this point because my mind is so messed up that Iâ€™m scared of everything and everybody and I canâ€™t even chat online because I donâ€™t want to get close to anyone because I donâ€™t want to bother other people with having to know me or wanting them to find out that Iâ€™m a monster inside and Iâ€™m too scared to kill myself but I have no urge to live at all.

I just want to fade to black.
