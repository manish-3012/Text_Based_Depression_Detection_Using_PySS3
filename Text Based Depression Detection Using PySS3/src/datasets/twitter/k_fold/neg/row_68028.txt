What exactly is keeping you alive?For me there are several reason though none are really technically worth living for.

1. I never been with anyone.  I never even touch, kiss, and hold much less have any type of sex.  Never been in love, doesn't seem like a possibility anymore.

2.  I would miss out on good foods.  

3.  I would miss out on the first colonization of Mars and potentially Titan, Europa, and Callisto.

4.  I would miss out on the slim chance that some newly discover surgery could fix me.  

5.  I would have suffered for nearly 3 decades for nothing.  

6. Hope die when you are dead unless you believe in reincarnation (which I do). 

7. My bloodline end with my death.

What about you guys?  What is keeping you alive?
