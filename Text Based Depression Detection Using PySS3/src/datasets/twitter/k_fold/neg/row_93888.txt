Ready to let goI got engaged in August, so I should be happy and celebrating all that...but a week afterwards, I somehow get into a devastating car wreck while in an Uber. I was rushed to the ER and was lucky to get out with only minor cuts that have since become scars. But for what itâ€™s worth, I shouldnâ€™t be alive. Neither should the driver or my friend who was the other passenger in the ride. We all cheated death, and it has weighed heavily on me along with the pressure from parties trying to collect money from me for medical services while I try to reach an insurance settlement with Uber and the guy who rear-ended us.

I got out of a terrible job situation in June after MONTHS of searching for something better...and then I abruptly got laid off in September. I felt secure enough to use my investments to pay off most of my credit card debt that I amassed after leaving a different awful job situation. Because of all this, my savings are minimal and I hardly have enough to make it through November. With the clock counting down and nobody requesting job interviews, my self-worth is in free fall and a deep depression has swallowed me as I approach the worst-case scenario.

Every time something good happens to me, something else takes away that joy tenfold. This has been the pattern of my life since I was young. 

I am not meant to be happy. 

I am not meant to be here.

The only thread holding me to life is the fear Iâ€™ll survive an attempt or I wonâ€™t die right away and experience an even worse pain and agony.
