I talked to him.I was finally having an okay day. Everyone warned that your exes would try to creep back into your life during the holidays. He did. And I actually talked to him. I'm so stupid. I can't believe myself. I've been planning bitchy things to say for months and I didn't go through with it. This whole month has done nothing but make me realize how worthless and weak I am. I don't wanna talk to anyone, anymore. I don't want to be here or anywhere. I want to be dead. I'm a waste and I want to be dead.
