WISH GETTING HELP WAS EASIERThis is my first post on here I donâ€™t use Reddit really often. I am someone whoâ€™s been suicidal since 4th grade. I am 21 and although some aspects of my life have gotten easier other aspects are breaking me. I have been hospitalized both inpatient and outpatient help. I wish there was a way to get help and be honest without repercussions of being â€œlocked upâ€. Mental hospitals have never helped me and if anything they just took away my dignity and made me feel I had to lie about how I feel. I feel stuck a part me wants to seek help again but the other part knows the path that leads me on. 


Thanks for hearing me vent ðŸ˜”
