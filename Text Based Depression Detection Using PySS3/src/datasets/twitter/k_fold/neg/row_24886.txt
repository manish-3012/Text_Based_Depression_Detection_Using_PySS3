Over this.I find that I just donâ€™t want do do this any more. Iâ€™m tired of just going through the motions. My mother will die soon, the cancer is incurable. My father is on the brink of dementia. My husband deserves someone better than me. My daughter needs someone not as broken as me. I just donâ€™t have a whole lot to live for. If I was out of the way, life would improve for people. I wouldnâ€™t be holding them down or making them drag me behind them. I donâ€™t work, so no one would lose an income. I just want to disappear. Go into a field somewhere remote, lay down, and just die. The animals could eat whatâ€™s left, and itâ€™d be over. Iâ€™m already alone. Letâ€™s just make it official.
