Lost a sentimental piece and now feeling suicidalWhen I lived with roommates, one of my roommates gave me her pepper spray because she knew I felt unsafe when by myself. They reason is because my mom put me in very dangerous situations. Situations where I could get killed and raped. She made me feel like I'm trash.

This pepper spray always reminded me that I had someone who cares enough for me to give it to me. And I lost it. It breaks my heart. I would carry it around with me everywhere and I would be reminded that someone cared. Now, I have nothing where it used to hang on my keychain. I feel so heartbroken. I won't be reminded ever again how valuable I am when my mom yells at me and makes me feel useless.

My heart is so broken and I feel so lost.
