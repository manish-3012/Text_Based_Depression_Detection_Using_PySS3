Which is better, hanging or overdose?Iâ€™ve heard that an overdose could just leave you brain dead, like a vegetable. I donâ€™t want that, I want final death. 

Iâ€™ve also heard conflicting stories on hanging. My plan is to just kick a chair out from under me. Iâ€™m ok with it hurting, as long as it works. 

But which one would work best?
