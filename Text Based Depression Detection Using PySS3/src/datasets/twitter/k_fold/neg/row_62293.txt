So does life have an actual â€œpointâ€?I wish I could see it, everything feels pointless. Weâ€™re all gonna end up dead anyway so nothing really matters in the end, I just canâ€™t see the point of life when itâ€™s so finite.

Fairly certain thereâ€™s no God or Heaven either, so I donâ€™t have any â€œrewardâ€ to look forward to either.

I have severe autism as well so no one will ever have relations with me either so I canâ€™t even fulfill the basic human drive to reproduce.

I know it could potentially get better but Iâ€™m never in control no matter how hard I try, Iâ€™m tired of watching everyone surpass me in every way imaginable.
