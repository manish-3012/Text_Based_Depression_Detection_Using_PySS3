will this kill me? give me a reason not to leaveI'm female only about 5 feet tall and weigh around 105 pounds. I have never taken xanax before and I'm in my early 20s. I want to take however much I have in this prescription bottle and take a few shots. Add in some nyquil and hydroxyzine. Haven't had alcohol in a while. I see people surviving their attempts because someone finds them or they metabolize it well enough. I hope it'll be different for me.

You don't have to tell me you love me. I know you love me because I love strangers on the internet, too. I have plenty of friends and family who love me. But I want to say goodbye and I want things to be over now. I had a good life and I don't want it to continue. I don't have the will to live anymore.

I'm reaching out because I want you to have the chance to change things in my head if you can. I'm looking for words, inspiration, something, not advice on how to better my situation because I've already done everything I could do (therapy, exercise, meds, good diet, comfortable living, meditation, etc.).

I know I've got potential. I know I have things to give in this world. I just don't want to. I can't cope, sorry.
