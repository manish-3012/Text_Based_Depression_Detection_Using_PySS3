"Choking game" vs suicide?Ive read some stories lately about people, mostly teenagers, who have accidentally killed themselves while trying to get "high" from the apparently euphoric state reached right before you pass out from hangimg yourself. This is tragic of course.. but it has made me wonder how bad hanging actually is. Ive read a bunch of horror stories about how terrifying it is, but if people are doing it accidentally in an attempt to get high, it seems like it couldnt actually be that bad? Ive gotten closer in recent days, but haven't actually gotten to the point of reaching that euphoric state, but Im curious if anyone else has?
