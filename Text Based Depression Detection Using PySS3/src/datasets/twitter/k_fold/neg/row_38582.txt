I am done. I can't take anymore. This is the end.I am a 38 yr old guy and I have been single and alone for 18 years now and can not take being single and alone anymore. I have absolutely no family or friends and no matter what I do I can't make or keep them. I try hard to make friends but it never lasts. 

I also have CPTSD and Severe chronic depression and severe social anxiety along with severe abandonment issues. I literally can't handle it anymore. nothing works, no therapy meds etc doesn't work. 

I am tired of living this life feeling unwanted, unloved, uncared for, undesired and not needed. And going through my entire day feeling like a ghost. it is not a way to live life or to be. I literally can't take it anymore. 

So I am ending it tonight because I can't handle being alone anymore and can't handle the loneliness. goodbye world.
