4:44am and about to do itposting here again for the second time in like two days lol pathetic.
i either need to do it or commit myself into an inpatient psychiatric hospital but i'm scared of the inpatient thing.
i don't want to hurt my mom or my girlfriend but i'm tired of being such a fuck up and disappointing them and causing them problems.
i have so much shit to do but i've been so unmotivated.
if i check myself into the inpatient thing then i won't be able to do my scholarship applications and shit but idk if i can survive another few days. if i miss the deadline because i'm in a psych ward i'll kill myself anyways.  if i don't go into the ward i have absolutely no motivation at all to do them and if i wait too long the deadline will be over and i'll kill myself. idk which option is better. 
sorry everyone
