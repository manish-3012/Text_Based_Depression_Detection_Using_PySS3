unfairmaybe itâ€™s really selfish, but i find it so unfair. itâ€™s unfair that out of all the sperm i had to be the fastest. itâ€™s unfair that my mum decided to have a baby when she did. itâ€™s unfair that she has me. because iâ€™m nothing. i feel like iâ€™m slowly fading away. itâ€™s unfair that i was born in the wrong body. itâ€™s unfair that i feel so alone. what did i ever do to deserve this. i love my mum so so much and iâ€™m not blaming her for anything, i just wish i had never been born.
