No light at the end of the tunnel!!!Not sure how much longer I can continue to zombie thru this existence people call life. At 41 I can honestly say my life has ment nothing, nor has my life been for anything. It has been a waste. Everyday all I ever feel is lost, invisible, and in a meaningless drift. And there is no hope that things will ever change. People always say "there is light at the end of the tunnel", guess what there is no light at the end of this tunnel, it's just a brick wall and a dead end like everything else in my so called life.
It's meaningless to continue, and to be honest I don't want to continue...the only ecsape is death.
