I don't want to do it, but it feels like there's nothing to look forward to.I feel like im losing control of myself, that i'm suddenly going to burst out and pierce a knife through my neck.

And honestly, i want to do it right now.

But i'm scared and confused and i don't know what to do. What if i survive? What if there actually was something to look forward to?

I feel like i'm just trying to fix the emptyness by not being here anymore.
