Tips? Advice? Help?I want to make this short. My mom treats me like shit nearly everyday. I have to follow her nearly all the time. The only thing that makes me happy are videogames and they restrict me from that Monday - Friday. When Iâ€™m not playing videogames I feel tired and I feel like I want to sleep then never wake up ever again. I tried to talk to them and they didnâ€™t let me even explain they just immediately declined. Iâ€™m not sure if I am too sensitive or if it is just me but I felt really really bad and I was sad for another month. Videogames mean a lot to me and I can confidently say that I have high and consistent grades usually B+ - A+. I donâ€™t want to end it all because I made a lot of progress in life but I am really tired of this life. Online Classes are also a huge bumber and it is very annoying and it stresses me all the time. I tried to keep this short but please I need advice.
