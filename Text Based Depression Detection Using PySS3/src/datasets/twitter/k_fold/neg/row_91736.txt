Long story (tl,dr: I want to die because I'm a failure)So, if you are interested in reading, grab some popcorn, a soda (or tea if you are into that) and sit down. Here is the story about how I became a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, I'm 21 years old, Im from a third world country and I want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

So, this starts as the typical suicidal story. You have me, a shy skinny kid with kind of low physical capabilities, but high intelligence (I was humble at that time, don't judge little me). In my country, everyone is all about soccer and my father was the same. He got my little brother and I into practicing it a lot when we were little. I didn't like it even though I was supposedly kind of good at it. I didn't quite like sports in general, I enjoyed more being in a peaceful environment. I didn't quite know what kind of things I would like to do in my free time since all I knew was soccer and school, so I focused more on school. Everyone else in my elementary school was also a lot into soccer, so when they reunited to play, I didn't join. I think I didn't consider worth it to bond with them if I had to do something I didn't like. 

Forward to high school

I changed schools since my mom got into arguments with some teachers and the principal.

I didn't befriend heavily with anyone, so I didn't really care. My brother on the other hand was very social and went to visit that school a couple of times.

&amp;#x200B;

My situation in high school was the same as in elementary school. Most people liked soccer, I didn't like soccer. They played every afternoon, I didn't.

Until now I still don't like soccer btw.

I grew up being really shy about talking to new people, so that also didn't help.

It was kind of weird since most people in my classroom were friends with my little brother (we are 2 years apart) and not with me.

&amp;#x200B;

In my country we don't have prep school (or that thing most countries do after highschool). 

The rule is: Universities have entrance exams. If you already finished highschool, you can take it. If you are at the top, you enter.

Most people take 1-2 years to prepare for those exams, but I passed it just finishing highschool (again, I didn't think too much of myself, I had/have kind of low self-esteem, but I just don't care anymore since it doesn't matter) (I had 16 when I enter to the university, I turned 17 the next month tho)

&amp;#x200B;

It was a private school and my family is kind of low income, but there was a support program for that, so it was around 500 dollars a month (still kind of expensive for me tho).

&amp;#x200B;

Now, you know how I said I didn't know what I would enjoy doing in my free time as a kid? The thing is that I didn't know what I actually wanted to do in every way. I didn't have a hobby, a goal or anything I wanted to do with my life.

I was kind of feeling empty since my career choice was just me wondering around Wikipedia. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, side note. I have an uncle. He is a professional (my parents aren't) and my mom helped him a lot in his college years, so he supported me a lot. He paid half of my English lessons and half of my university monthly fee (I forgot the appropriate word). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I started to think about what was I doing with my life. I didn't actually liked to study. I was just good at it and didn't have anything else to do. I started to not go to classes and just wondered around the campus thinking. I also didn't go to some evaluations. 

I was kind of feeling like I was just doing what everybody else wanted me to do. I mean, is not bad to want your children to study, but I don't know. It's kind of confusing to me.

Also, I didn't have friends here neither. Again, everyone was all over soccer. And I just hated the game at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

End of the semester, I failed all my 6 classes. I didn't want to study, but also I didn't want to be an embarrassment to my parents. They and my uncle put a lot of money in me and I failed. 

I was still reluctant, but I asked them to give me another chance and with that I started the second semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Second semester, I still didn't like to study, but I now had a new pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

My university had this rules: You are expelled if you fail the same class 3 times. You are expelled if you don't finish general studies (is a 4 semesters curriculum) in a maximum of 7 semesters. You are expelled if during general studies you fail more than 10 times.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to study, I didn't like the career I chose and I didn't like the pressure, but I didn't want to be a failure. 

I always felt like everyone had very high expectations to me. Also there was money being invested.

&amp;#x200B;

My head was a mess.

&amp;#x200B;

I failed 2 of the 5 classes I had that semester.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't want to continue wasting everybody's money and hopes, so I left the university.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned 18 that year, so I started working at a call center (I hated that job).

&amp;#x200B;

Getting to the end of the year I had to get hospitalized. I had a tumor behind my nose (not cancer).

&amp;#x200B;

All the money I earned and a lot more from my parents and relatives went to the surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

The near death experience give me the strength and hopes to try again. Also I wanted to pay back the money spend.

I was convinced I could go through college and my parents believed me, they gave a new chance. (My uncle wasn't part of it this time. I can't blame him)

I went back and continue my "journey".

&amp;#x200B;

First new semester, I passed everything. Second new semester, I failed 1 class. Third new semester, I passed everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth new semester, the story continues.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the thing. My university had a "merit" system were the best qualifed students had priority when choosing they classes they went into. If you remember, I failed a lot, so I wasn't there.

&amp;#x200B;

There were this "series" of courses that had to be passed in this particular order: intro to physics, and Physics 1, 2 and 3.

&amp;#x200B;

I was one of the last students, so in one semester I couldn't get into any physics 1 class.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in my 6th official semester and I was in physics 2, calculus 4, a elective and digital design.

&amp;#x200B;

I only needed to complete physics 3 and one other class to finish general studies and get my record clean. I had 1 semester left, I was really stressed out, but kind of okey.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the thing. Even if I failed 1 class, and even if that class was physics, I was "out" yet. You can take classes on summer vacations (here they are one December - February) but a maximum of 3 and again, priority order. But, there was this exception for people who were about to finish (like me) that got priority for that. If I failed, I wasn't in "more than 10", so I could take physics 2 again in summer and then physics 3 in a regular semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Digital design was a group class. Me and one other student were in a group with 2 of the clueless people of all the campus. They didn't do anything and I was to "shy" to say something even to the teacher. I hate myself for this, but I know that I could reverse time, I still wouldn't be able to say anything. (I'll see them in hell)

&amp;#x200B;

I failed both Physics 2 and Digital Design.

&amp;#x200B;

I was out.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother entered college after 1.5 years of preparation. He goes to parties every now and then, and he is not titular, but still on the official general course soccer team.

My uncle is paying half of his monthly fee and he is being an average student.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 5 months. Every now and then my parents indirectly mention how disappointed they are. I for some reason can't find a job. I just clean the house and help my parents in every way I can, but nothing is going to be enough. 

I have no one to talk to since I could never make a friend who I could talk to about my problems.

I got into anime and videogames to scape reality when I started college. My mom always hated that I was always in my room, in my laptop (gift from my uncle when I entered college). I never had any hobby and I could enjoy being in my fake reality, so I felt bad that she encouraged my brother's soccer hobby, but told me that my hobby was bad. I mean, I understand, sports are healthy, but I don't like soccer, I like to be at home, relaxed. 

If I wasn't allowed to do the one thing I enjoyed, then what was I supposed to do? 

&amp;#x200B;

I now feel bad when I'm using my laptop, so I avoid it and have nothing to do. 

I have no one to talk to, I have no professional future, not even a crappy job and I'm not allowed to enjoy my hobby (also morally speaking since I'm unemployed and I can't just be at home playing all day).

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to see if I could get into videogame development, but it's a "career" only available in some institutes (in my country most are shit and the most "regular" one is even more expensive than college). My parents now focus on paying my brother's education, so even if they were willing to give me another chance(that I won't ask), they wouldn't be able to afford it.

I can't afford it since even if I got a crappy job, the minimum wage is half of what the "regular" institute costs. I would have to work for 5-6 years to pay the 3 year career (3rd world country, "regular" institute, not so very high hopes for jobs even if I do it)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just being a problem here since my parents still have to spend money on maintain me alive (food). And I'm not giving anything in return, nothing for my current life and nothing for everything I owe to them.

&amp;#x200B;

They would be better with just my brother. He is a better version of me, what I should have been, what everyone hoped I would be.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate my life, I hate the fact that I lost everything I had.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate not having money to repay everyone that gave me their support and I disappoint.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate not being able to make friends. Maybe I should have tried soccer, I mean, I hate it, but at least I could have made friends, I don't know, maybe if I got into parties and drinking (I don't like the taste of alcohol and cigarettes, although I don't really care if people surrounding me does it, but I don't feel really comfortable in big parties)

&amp;#x200B;

I always wanted to die. I was tired. The pressure of always being on the verge of being expelled, the feeling of being expelled, everything else. I tried to kill me before, multiple times. I didn't do it in part because I'm also a coward that doesn't want to feel physical pain and that I felt that I couldn't go without paying back.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to pay back, but I can't, I am tired. I've been on a stupid journey that I didn't even asked for. I'm paying for my first semester mistake, I know, but I don't know what to do now. I have nowhere to go, nothing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know why I told the first half of my life, I don't think all that was relevant, but I don't even want to go up a erase (I'm on my phone). 

&amp;#x200B;

If this post gets deleted, I don't care, I just wanted to write this somewhere. I think I omitted some things because I didn't know how and where to put them, so this counts as a summary I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I'm off to go, I probably won't kill myself right now, I'll wait until morning
