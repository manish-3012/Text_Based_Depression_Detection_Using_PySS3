I think my mom knows, but she doesnâ€™t care.Mothers always know, right? Iâ€™m pretty sure she knows I want to kill myself and I even made some comments of wishing I wasnâ€™t born so she couldâ€™ve gone to school and been something and she even agreed with me. Iâ€™ve gone to 2 funerals in the span of 3 weeks, I feel like this is my calling. 

Ever since my boyfriend broke up with me itâ€™s all been spiraling down hill pretty fast. My mom knows Iâ€™m going to be alone for New Yearâ€™s Eve and she could careless. She has a boyfriend now why spend it with her daughter whom she hates when she can spend it with some guy she met a couple of months ago. 

My best-friends, friends hate that me and her reconnected (we had a fallout earlier this year). No one wants me around. Iâ€™m going to therapy but itâ€™s not working. Iâ€™m trying really hard to find something to live for. My time on this earth is coming short, Iâ€™m tired of existing.
