X-post from r/survivorsofabuse. I have no hope for the future anymore. I really want to die.I broke up with my abusive partner about 4 months a go, and moved away to the other side of the country to live with my family again about 2 months a go. Things were meant to get better but they just haven't. I still feel so isolated. I feel like none of our friends believe that she was abusive, in fact many think I am a dick for calling her manipulative and controlling. I don't know how to trust people anymore. I don't know how to set boundaries so I'll probably get stepped on again. I get stepped on at home by my brother. I have to go back to my old city this month to retake my exams as I fucked up this year of uni, but I can't concentrate at all so I'm going to fail again. Most my friends live with my abuser so I have no where to stay. I'm going to need support from my friends so will no doubt be in contact with her again. I can't bare the thought. She still lies to them about me. She still controls my whole life. This is still happening for me, always in my head, I feel like it will never end. The only way I can see to get away from her is to kill myself. All passion that I once felt is gone. I have nothing anymore.
