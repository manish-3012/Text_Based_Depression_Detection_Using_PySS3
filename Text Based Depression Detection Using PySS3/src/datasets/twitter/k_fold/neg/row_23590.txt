The worst part is, I live in Australia and don't have a gun handy around the house like in AmericaI've had enough, was born with a disability which makes a lot of things difficult in my life, I've just started university at the age of 22 after finishing two years of TAFE only to be told sorry there isn't any jobs in the film/tv business anymore. The course I'm doing is rubbish, 3 years of laborious work, I have zero work ethic, I have one friend but he had to move to a new place that is a 90 minute drive away from me. I can't sleep or find the motivation to do anything, I've heard wrist cutting in the bathtub is actually really painful, I've been thinking about doing a train jump, quick, pain less and my family wouldn't have to clean up, the worst part is I'm here on this subreddit for attention because i don't get it anywhere else, im not an attention seeker, but i dont have anyone to talk to.
