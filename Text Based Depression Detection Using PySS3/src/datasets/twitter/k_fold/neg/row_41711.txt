Can I please have someone to talk to right now?I would like someone to talk to right now. I'm going through a really tough time and I am afraid of what I will do. I'm alone and I have no one to talk to. I'm sitting here thinking about ending it. I'm so tired of trying so hard to make things better. It is just so hard and my will to continue is lessening each day. Please, someone just talk to me.
