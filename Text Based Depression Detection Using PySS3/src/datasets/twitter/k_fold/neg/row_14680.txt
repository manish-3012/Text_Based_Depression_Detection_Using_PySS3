i can't anymore.im so tired of everything. of everyone. of anything life has to offer. i have no one who cares to help me. i don't trust anyone anymore after some experiences with some old friends. i constantly stay in bad friendships while pushing away anyone whose nice to me because in my head that's too good to be true, and i don't want to trust anyone who seems like a good friend because i know i won't be able to bear being hurt again. i already can't bear anything else. i dont wanna bring anyone else down but apparently thats all i do by being here. im done. i dont want to be here anymore. and with the friends i havent pushed away yet, im hiding everything from them. they know i have problems but from how im acting they think im improving. i cant continue burdening anyone and although i wish i had the strength to keep this to myself, i know i don't. everythings just getting worse and i dont know how much longer i can handle it for. nothing's worth it, so why try?
