[20] having thoughts again after gf of 4 years dumped me over text todayI've had depression since we met, but this past year has been an all time low.

In the past year and a half, I've been in a nearly catotonic state, laying around, doing nothing. Staring at walls. I've been going to class, and besides that, I've only worked 4 out of those 18 months, quit the first one due to depression...

I understand she could only stick along for so much, but it hurts. Now I'm alone.

I've been having thoughts since she sent the text. I've been through adolescene with her. On a cruise. To Disneyland. We sleep together every night. We finished Death Note and Kingdom Hearts 3 together.

All that is gone. My only friend is gone.
