I want to join the army this year but itâ€™s too late now.Iâ€™m not sure what I was supposed to do anyway, I had to move from my city that meaning I had to leave my family and I donâ€™t know what the hell I was supposed to do, tell myself every day it will get better? I think army is too rough for someone like me, I wasnâ€™t planning on living this much anyway. If things will get more bad until 2021 Iâ€™ll actually donâ€™t give a fuck anymore about anything and anyone who says they will miss me. Iâ€™m starting to feel what is to get your dreams ruined.
