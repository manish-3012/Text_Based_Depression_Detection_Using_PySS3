I can't do it anymore.I've struggled my whole life. I remember wanting to kill myself when I was 5. I remember trying to slit my wrists when I was 10. Because of this "safety net" I had, I never felt a desire to even try living up to anything close to my potential. Got into drugs for a while, then found myself in rehab and the 12-step rooms. Got sent to psych wards twice in recovery. I'm getting kicked out of my halfway house on Wednesday, and though I have a solid support network, I feel I can't live up to expectations, no matter how hard I try. I'm going to be homeless because my only other option is with my coworker who raped a friend of mine. My parents love me and will do anything to help, besides let me come back home until I figure something out.

I feel like I'm rambling. I'm going to buy a shotgun, a hotel room, a bottle of gin, and a baggy of xanax tomorrow.

Edit: I wish I could write down every thought racing through my head that's furthering this decision. The big thing is that happiness has been promised to me from 12-step people if I do what they did. And I'm actually trying now and things are just getting worse and everyone is making sure to point it out to me.
