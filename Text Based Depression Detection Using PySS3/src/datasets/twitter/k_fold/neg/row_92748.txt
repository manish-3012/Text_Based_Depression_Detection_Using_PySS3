I'm only alive because I haven't run out of pot yetSmoking is the last thing left in this world that I enjoy. I have a disability so trying to date is a fucking joke, especially since I don't have much to offer anyways. College seems like it's just gonna be me in my dorm wishing someone would invite me to something. I'm so mentally damaged that I'll start crying out of nowhere or get so touchy that everyone thinks I'm an asshole. When I tell people any of this they tell me to just get over it, and I don't think I have to explain why that's frustrating. Fuck this
