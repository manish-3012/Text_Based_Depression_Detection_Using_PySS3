The more I envision my future, the more I see pitch black. I feel like I donâ€™t belong here and I want to leave. Why canâ€™t people let me leave?Recently been crashing at various peopleâ€™s places because it was either that or going to the hospital. Iâ€™m so stupid for telling my boyfriend about wanting to die. I shouldâ€™ve stayed quiet. I just wanna go away. Or at least cut. But I canâ€™t do that at somebody elseâ€™s home. Waiting until Iâ€™m free to be alone, so I can take a train and bus downtown and throw myself into the lake at night. Less messy, less chances of there being witnesses, and no more me. Thereâ€™s nothing for me here and thereâ€™s no point staying here much longer.
