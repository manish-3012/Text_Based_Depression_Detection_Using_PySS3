I don't knowI've never been this bad. I feel like someone close to me has died constantly now. I don't even wanna talk about my issues. I don't want help I don't know what to do. I want to be done. I didn't want to make this post. My girlfriend, my parents, my used to be best friend. They all make it worse. I have nothing and I moved 3000 miles away from anyone that could make me feel any joy right now. I have a lot of resentment and anger right now.
