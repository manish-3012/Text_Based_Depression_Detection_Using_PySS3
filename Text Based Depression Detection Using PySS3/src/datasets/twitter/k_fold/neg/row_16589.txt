I can't bring myself to do it so I'm making my life in a way I have no other choiceI keep quiting and not going to school stuff so I don't get an education and there for can't get a job, I keep buying recklessly and not saving for important stuff, I keep selling stuff I enjoy, I keep getting rid of money I was saving for events and stuff I was looking forward to, if I make my life a living hell, real hell (if it exists) won't be so bad
