BeautyI felt like I needed to share something. I feel like everyone can benefit from this

Regardless of where you are in life, how well you've done, if you're wealthy, if you're not, if you feel like a loser, it's ok. Beauty is the most amazing thing. It can temporarily numb your problems. And it can be found anywhere. In music, in a video game, in the sky. If you don't like where you are in life, just take a moment to find beauty in something.

I was bored tonight, and I felt like taking a drive around town. It's night time, almost winter, it's 15 degrees Fahrenheit, there's frost on the windows of my car, and it's very foggy. As I'm driving down an empty street in my small town, all I see are the dim streelights in the fog. And I just thought it was absolutely beautiful. 

It made me take a step back, and realize that there's more important things in life than wealth and glory. It's the small things that really hold the key to being happy in life.
