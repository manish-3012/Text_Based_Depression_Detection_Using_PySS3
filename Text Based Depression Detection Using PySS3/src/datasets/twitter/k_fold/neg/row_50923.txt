It just keeps getting harder.I guess I'm here, because I'm looking for someone to just give a fuck about me. I have a daughter and am in therapy and that is what is keeping me up, but I'm starting to slip away.  
I just feel like every day my life gets harder. Every time I try and do something to make it better, I end up having it blow up and I have to struggle with everything being worse. I'm literally facing homelessness and having nothing left. If this happens, I won't get to see my daughter more than maybe once or twice a week if that. That might be it for me. I make next to nothing money wise and I've been trying to find a better job and a part time job. Its just not happening.   
I'm alone. I have no friends, and I'm barely able to keep from losing it at work anymore. I don't know how much longer I can keep from having a full breakdown. I just want to be done struggling and being alone. I don't even know what the fuck I'm suppose to do anymore.
