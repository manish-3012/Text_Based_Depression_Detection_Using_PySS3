iâ€™m a weak linki feel so numb. i know someplace near me where i could climb enough stairs and just let myself go. iâ€™d kill myself just to spite the people that hurt me, show them i am not just a â€œthingâ€, iâ€™d jump just to free myself of the burden the future hold, i know we, as a species, are not headed down a good road and i know i donâ€™t have any special skill that could make me stand out above the crowd. 

what has been holding me back so far has been the thought of hurting my family and a friend that i didnâ€™t want to let down. now i donâ€™t even care about my family anymore and my friend has left me. 

i could do it next week but some part of me still hopes to find some happiness but i am so tired i am so tired i am so tired i donâ€™t want to wait anymore i just want to go to sleep one last time and never wake up again

survival of the strongest, right? thereâ€™s no place for me here i feel so weak i am 17 but i might as well be 10 i canâ€™t last
