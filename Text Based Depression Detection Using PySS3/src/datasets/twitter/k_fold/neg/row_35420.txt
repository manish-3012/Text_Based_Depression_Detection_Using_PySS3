I always feel stuck at a crossroadDo i die and cause havoc in my family and close ones, or do i free myself of this miserable life i live.


Sadly i know that as much as im a loner loser with nothing redeeming, me ending myself would break everything in my circle of people.

from my parents to even just people who remember me, to my classmates.

I honestly don't know anymore. I aint shit, i dont wanna destroy everything but i need to free myself of this miserable life.
