Black OrchidThis song is exactly how I feel on a day to day basis. Each word is true. Its fucking beautiful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever been so lonely  
There is no one there to hold?  
Just pull me in or disown me  
And then climb inside  
My arms are open wide  
Have a look inside

It is not that I am scared to learn  
Just why I'm empty inside  
Hold my hand or show some concern  
If I live or die  
My eyes are open wide  
Help me look inside

Singing ha de de ha ha de de ah

I hear the water drip from the faucet  
It's sweetly falling in tune  
I'm gently closing the closet and I  
Fall to the floor  
And crawl to my room  
The thought of ending it soon  
Just let me sleep in my room

Hear me cry! Cry! Cry!  
I hear a knock at the front door  
Don't come in!  
I try to look at you  
But I can't stop shaking  
Leave me alone, just go away  
Mother I'm so scared, I'm so scared

An empty bed and all of the sheets are gone  
They're wrapped around me and you  
All is quiet but the drop of my gun  
'Cause I, I want to belong, to someone  
But maybe life's not for everyone

Ha de de ha ha de de ah
