Being a poisonFor the longest time I've always felt that I was less than everyone. I feel insecure all the time and unimportant to the point that if I was gone, no one would care. I try to put my efforts into helping people in anyways to keep my mind off those looming thoughts but, it seems like every time I try to help it seems as if I'm just making everyone around me feel worse. I'm like a poison to them. They keep trying to help me because they care but everyone is running out of things to do with me. I'm becoming more of a lost cause by the minute.

And to top it off, it's ruining my relationships too, because my insecurities and depression give me this obsession streak, and I can never feel comfortable or loved. I always feel as if I don't deserve anything because there's always someone better. I can't live like this any more and I just want to die and get it over with. My life has always been like this.  People always tell me that the world will just go on anyways.  People get over things.
