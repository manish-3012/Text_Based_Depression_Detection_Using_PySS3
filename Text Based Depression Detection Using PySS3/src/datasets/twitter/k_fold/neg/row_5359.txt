I really want to cut myselfSometimes i look in the mirror and i just wanna cut myself, i feel like i dont actually have friends and i feel like im on my own. Im pretty social but seeing other people having fun and having a great life and seeing my self doing the same shit every day with my boring ass life it just angers me. I dont wanna talk to anybody about this because i feel like an attention whoring piece of shit and people will think im a loser. I dont know what to do except cut myself, i dont wanna die but i want to see if i can cut myself enough to bleed out or something maybe a miracle will happen
