Why should I even keep trying...I have had a rough 4 years, in and out of rehab for the first two, relapse and pills and legal trouble the next year and this year has been the worst/best. Iâ€™m dealing with a theft charge from  the beginning of the year, and recently spent a weekend withdrawling in jail for felony charges of small dope and thc wax(.06g) and when I was RWC (Bail with conditions) I got sober, itâ€™s been 3 weeks of that except I smoked bud last night. I recently got the job of my dreams as a security officer, and my doc and family are so proud of the progress I made... but now, I get a text from my boss my background info need to be run again and may pull me from my dream job.. my attorney isnâ€™t contacting me. Iâ€™m in the dark on court stuff, and I just got a text reminder of a different court date in 3 days I was never aware of or who is defending me, it just seems the more I try to better myself the worse everything else gets... Iâ€™m the best me Iâ€™ve ever been right now, clear head I donâ€™t wanna use even if I was paid to, I have my dream job and was gonna enroll in outpatient for the courts. But now everything is falling apart right when Iâ€™m trying to piece my broken soul back together. WHY THE FUCK WHOULD I EVEN KEEP TRYING. Everything just falls back to nothing when I try to better my self, itâ€™s like the world doesnâ€™t want me or like god gave up on me, I just want this all to stop... I thought I was doing right?!? Where did I go wrong?!? WHY IS EVERYTHING AGASINT ME. I wanna be done.... I donâ€™t wanna keep trying cause I know it wonâ€™t last like everything else...
