Honestly, I don't care anymore.If I'm coming clean. I can't really be bothered to care about others emotions anymore. I've spent years being the foot of jokes and 'roasts' to entertain my peers and siblings. For so long I was told, "it's just a joke. No need to feel hurt by it." Well guess what, it did hurt. It hurt everytime you said it. It hurt everytime after that too when I learned just to not react. You told me bullies would stop if I didnt react. You didnt stop. Theres honestly no point anymore. I can't care about your feelings because in all honesty I have no empathy left. I used it all up trying not to hate you for years, always making an excuse for you. But I couldn't care anymore. Last night you told me I'll always be 'worthless.' This morning you tried to defend yourself saying that's not what you said, or that's not what you meant. It's been years of this. You know I sit on the edge everyday just hoping I can find the courage to leap. And still, you've harassed and played pranks on me. You embarrassed me in front of my crush. Then you told them I had a crush on them and asked if they would ever date me now. Of course she wouldn't. Who would after their older brother pantsed them at their own birthday party. The worst part was everyone thought it was hilarious. Even mom and Dad. So idk what to tell you, bro. Maybe I'll find love for you at the bottom of a six foot hole, but I doubt it. So until then, good luck, you're gonna need it.
