My own mother told me she wished she aborted me.Every day this house is hell. Absolute hell. From the minute I wake up in my tiny room there's nothing but negative words thrown at me. All my 52 year old mother can do is drink and curse at me and is in deep debt. We don't even own a house we have to live with my christian grandmother is equally as mentally abusive. I've always been told I'm ugly, just the other day she sat and told me how disgusting I looked and how her 50 year old friend looked so much better than me. She comments on my body a lot it's horrible and I hate it. They'll both be extremly nice to strangers but when it comes to me I get nothing but hate. I can't take this anymore. I have health issues too which I get mocked for. I've tried and tried to apply for jobs for years, no one ever answers apart from rejection emails. I have no friends and no family and every weekday/weekends are spent with these two people who hate me. I live in a tiny house with mold/spiders too which is equally stressful as I find insects in my room daily. I don't know how much more I can take.
