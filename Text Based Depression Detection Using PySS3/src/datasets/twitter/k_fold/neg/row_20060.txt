Got caught trying to hang myself but family has said nothing about it. Iâ€™m not sure how I feelSorry if Iâ€™m doing something wrong, this is my first time ever on this subreddit. So a couple days ago i had a very bad breakdown after my parents yelled at me at how I never wanna go out and do anything. For the record, I have some very bad anxiety and I usually go through great lengths to avoid people/situations and my parents are well aware of this but they still like to poke fun at me for it or get mad because of it. Iâ€™ve seen a doctor and Iâ€™m on medication which they also know about. Well anyway my parents left without me and whenever I have any kind of mental breakdowns I usually have this really bad urge to kill myself, and I kinda get this weird but good tingly feeling whenever I think about it. So I went to grab a step ladder from the garage and put it next to a tree in my backyard and I went to my room to grab some rope that I keep because it makes me feel safe. 

I started trying a noose but the step ladder didnâ€™t let me reach quite high enough to tie it to the branch so I went back to the garage to get an actual ladder but right when I walk into my house my parents walked in cause they forgot something. I hid in my room until they left and then I get a text from my sister saying something like â€œDad said youâ€™re crying and tried to kill yourselfâ€ and my stomach dropped. I made a few half assed attempts at killing myself this year but Iâ€™ve never been caught. I expected them to come and ask me what i was doing but they just left. I went outside and the rope is gone and so is the step ladder. Itâ€™s been a few days and my parents havenâ€™t even mentioned it nor has my sister. 

Honestly, seeing that text made me cry but feel kind of hopeful that my parents would take it seriously and Iâ€™d maybe get help but now that a few days have past I feel even worse than I did before. I just feel so alone and like I have no one. I donâ€™t have any friends at all (at least in real life) because of my really severe social anxiety and I donâ€™t think my parents wanna hear about it since they didnâ€™t ask. I seriously donâ€™t know what to do
