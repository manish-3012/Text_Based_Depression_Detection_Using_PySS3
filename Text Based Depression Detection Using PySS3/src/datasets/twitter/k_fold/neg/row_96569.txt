I'm so freaking useless.I'm 22. Work a low paying BOH job at a restaurant and I hate it. My dad wants nothing to do with me because he views me a mess in his own words. My mom is severely handicapped. Don't have any true friends. Broke as hell. Got traffic tickets I can't afford to pay off and might end up going to jail over them. Am a huge failure at 22 while all the other people I went to school with all got degrees, good paying jobs and starting families. Why bother?
