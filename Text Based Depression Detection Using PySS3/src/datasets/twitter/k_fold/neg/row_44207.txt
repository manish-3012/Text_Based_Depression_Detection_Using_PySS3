Life isn't easy and that's why I want outI don't have the toughness or ability to strive through trying times. To come up with solutions to problems in my life and actually follow through with them. I really just don't want to. I can't stop asking myself what the point of existing is, and really, I don't even want there to be a point. I don't even know why I'm typing this m. I guess I'm just complaining about the nature of life because the fuck else am I gonna do with my time? Everything is a chore. There's no thing or person that makes being alive really worth it. The other thing about this is that I beleive when we die, we reach an eternal state of peace. I wonder why I should still keep going if I die and I find that peace, when I don't really give a damn about the world around me. I guess I don't do it because I'm aftaid of the pain. I want the world to kill me. That isn't hope for the future talking either; I really, really do not like the prospect of having to trudge on with life until then, having to work hard and learn and build relationships just to make it a decent run with minimal amounts of misery. It's too much work.
