Read this before you make any decisions.To anyone considering suicide-
I've been personally affected by suicide in the last 12 months twice, and I want to provide support to those who are considering it. I was never able to tell those who passed I loved them and that they meant a lot more to em than they could understand, and I want all of you to know that even though it seems nobody cares sometimes, they do. I care, at least. Suicide is devastating, even for those who you haven't seen in a long time. The first friend of mine that died last November I had not seen in two years, and yet almost everyone that had ever known him showed up to his wake and funeral. I've never seen so many people crying in one place. The second (hopefully last) friend that died killed himself the night before Halloween. I knew him really well and have not been able to stop thinking about him since this morning. I could't stop thinking about my first friend that died for months, and this time around its more personal. I won't even be able to attend his funeral because I go to college out of state, and that fact is destroying me on the inside. It's going to take a long time for me to understand or accept my friend dying, if I ever do, and I really do not want any of you to make the same decisions they did. Even if you feel everything is wrong, please please please do not choose death. You'll affect more people than you ever thought would be possible. I want you to know there are people there for you, you just have to find them. That said, your decision is yours alone. Just remember that I love you all, even though I have never met you, and that I care. Please, choose to enjoy the rest of your life, and have a safe night.
