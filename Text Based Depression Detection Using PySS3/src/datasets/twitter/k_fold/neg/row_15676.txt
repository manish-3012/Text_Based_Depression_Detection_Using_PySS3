Numb.I self harmed for the first time today, in a few months. I really screwed up and I don't know what to do. I wanted to go deeper and end it, but I became too tired. I still have the urge to "off" myself. I feel hopeless, disconnected, numb. My chest aches so much anymore from sadness. I can't stop messing everything up. I want to leave myself. I hate myself, I hate who I've become. I hate that I hate myself. I don't know what to do. So many things have been piling up and I just want everything to be figured out and I feel like the only way things would be figured out is by leaving.
