Weird coincidence.The last time I posted here (now deleted) I made an off-hand comment about if I ever pulled anything it would be my mom's fault. And these days things are not really better, I've been feeling tightness in my chest for the past hour or so after a comment she made so it's why I'm here (a stop on my journey through SH, raisebynarcissists...). Everything is tense these days, we have a splintered relationship and I am waiting for the day I can be on my own (completely, not with other toxic family members). 

The morning following my last post she told me she had a dream that we were walking along cliffs or something and she kept telling me not to get close, stop, don't walk there -- and then I fell off a cliff and she couldn't save me. It was disturbing. I felt like someone's normal reaction would have been "Jesus, scary" but I was kind of like "lol what a coinkidink" 


I struggle with paranoia. I always feel like I am being watched (I know the root of this) - and while this could have been, as my mom would put it, a message from "universe" (she learned nothing considering she's still being shitty) -- I felt like she had seen the post, maybe she has access to something with the internet that I didn't know she does. It was really disturbing to have her explain that dream. Really fucked up timing. Still want to die tho.

Hi mom.
