I honestly donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with meIâ€™m 19 and I live in Australia, I think Iâ€™ve been depressed since my father died to now but Iâ€™ve never been checked and after I moved out i donâ€™t want to cause Iâ€™m scared of it effecting my life later and getting overperscribed medication. Thatâ€™s kinda been the biggest problem because Iâ€™ve never known if so things wrong with me cause whenever I say do or think somthing weird I just think in the back of my head that Iâ€™m making it up for attention so for a long time I kept all these feelings to myself. Iâ€™ve always tried to be a mild mannered person and have always done my best to be known as a kind person but I spend conservatively 30% of my day thinking about dieing, and that is specifically just imagining ways to die. Itâ€™s usually not just suicide though so I would say that Iâ€™m probably not suicidal though I think about it a lot and do think of it as an escape option if I ever royally fuck up, Iâ€™d say I more have a death wish. This whole situation started coming to ahead after I moved out because I started taking more drugs then and noticed that it does lead to me getting foggy and paranoid of things that donâ€™t make sense. But more recently Iâ€™ve been doing lots of psychedelics and the other night I did a few mushrooms and just started saying the things I only thought to myself and my friends looked at me like I was the joker but it only made me feel good, to get it off my chest and to have someone confirm that there was something wrong with me itâ€™s weird but being told Iâ€™m mentally disturbed made me feel sane for the first time cause I couldnâ€™t doubt it and I think that doubt had made me a much more paranoid and second guessing pourpose. I know these arenâ€™t useful but Iâ€™ve been trying those online tests and psychosis seems to be a consistent high risk, Iâ€™m honestly not sure what to do with this though, part of me kinda wants to be okay with it and to take it into account so that I can atleast live my life know whatâ€™s wrong up there. Any advice about this would be appreciated though cause Even know I donâ€™t have a clue what Iâ€™m on about or why Iâ€™m putting this here, it was just the only place I could think of I guess
