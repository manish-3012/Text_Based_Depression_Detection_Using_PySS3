Does anyone else feel weirdly relieved when they remember that suicide is an option?I legitimately get warm feelings and I remember that if things got bad enough suicide would stop it all and it somehow keeps me going. I feel as though the fact that I have some emotions and that it provides some level of hope is a reminder that Iâ€™m also not ready to die, and yet thatâ€™s because itâ€™s an option. Perhaps itâ€™s simply reminding me of what it feels like to look forward to something, but obviously Iâ€™m not in such a dire situation that itâ€™s the *only* option. So thatâ€™s actually a pretty positive reminder in a way.
