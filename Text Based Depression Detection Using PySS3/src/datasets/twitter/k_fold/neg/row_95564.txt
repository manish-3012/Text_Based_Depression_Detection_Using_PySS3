Fucking hate lifeI've been depressed and been doing everything to try and get past it. Today I find out that I got a 45 on my math mid term. And one of the home works I got less than a 50 (I got a perfect score on every question but the one question out of 20 I didn't do was worth over 50%). I love everything else about what I am doing (CS/SE) but I fucking hate integral calculus (I had to jump a year ahead or risk graduating a semester late). My friends treat me like shit and always attack me over different things and one of them tries to stir up a mob mentality kind of thing against me. And so I'm always having to fucking hide how their insults affect me. I had a shitty past and I really really like my girlfriend but I have so many insecurities because of past things with parents abandoning me and exs cheating on me that I don't know how to deal (I don't want to keep running to her about it I just don't know how to deal with it) I just started a job and I keep getting scheduled for ridiculous hours and so in the past month I have had only one afternoon of actually being able to relax and work on a side project. Money is fucking tight. 

I just don't really enjoy any of this. I get a day or two here and there that something good happens. But I don't think I can keep this up till I'm 80. I have considered suicide since I was 14. Life has sucked so much for me and I don't know if I have the power to make it not suck.
