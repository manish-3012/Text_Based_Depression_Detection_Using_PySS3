I donâ€™t understandWhere I am from there has been at least a dozen suicides from my area all 16-18 year olds. 3 girls from my old school all in the same year at school - have all committed suicide,the last one was last night. Our whole community is hurting and I just feel like our younger generation is going down the drain with suicides. Itâ€™s scary and I donâ€™t know how to address it. I knew one of the girls since year 7. a quite very kind innocent girl. I spoke up for her when some girls were being mean to her on the bus one day. She was the sweetest girl and I think about her time to time. No one saw it coming. She said she was going to school and never came home. Then 2 other 17 year olds girls. I didnâ€™t know where the right place to the post this is but to anyone thinking of suicide please donâ€™t do it. You will be so fucking missed and you are loved. Please.
