I had a few â€œgoodâ€ days. But Iâ€™m feeling hopeless again. Even okay moments are sour when you know the depression is looming.I had a streak of good days and by good I just mean I didnâ€™t feel out of control, I didnâ€™t feel lost, I had a sense of peace. I was still sad but I didnâ€™t want to escape life in every way I usually long to. But my worst fear,  the thing I dreaded every second of these â€œgood daysâ€ came true. Nothing has happened, nothing triggered it but Iâ€™m back to wanting to sleep all day. Iâ€™m back to wanting to run away from friends or do something to self destruct. Iâ€™m back to thinking it would be better if I hadnâ€™t gone to the hospital back in September and I had just killed myself like I had planned. 

I know I have to hold onto those okay moments and days. I know I canâ€™t loose hope for that one day Iâ€™ll get this terrible fucking thing under control. But right now Iâ€™m exhausted and alone. Itâ€™s impossible for me to hold on to those okay moments right now. Iâ€™m exhausted yet I canâ€™t sleep and Iâ€™ve never been so alone before. Iâ€™ve felt more alone before but Iâ€™ve never truly BEEN this alone, if that makes sense. Itâ€™s like when I stop drinking and every time the withdrawal symptoms get worse. Every time I have a few good days the depression gets worse. 

I havenâ€™t turned to alcohol yet. Trying hard not to because Iâ€™m sure that will just increase it and Iâ€™ll loose any control. Iâ€™m trying not to cut or think about suicide anymore but itâ€™s so had. But damn does everything just feel pointless right now. 

Well thanks for reading.
