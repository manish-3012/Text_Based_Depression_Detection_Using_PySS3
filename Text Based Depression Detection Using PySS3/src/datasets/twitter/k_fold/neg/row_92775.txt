The world is burning and there really isnâ€™t anything to live forI feel like thereâ€™s nothing anymore. The world is filled with hate, I never see humans anymore, and I feel instantly hated. It feels like world has given up and decided everything is shit so letâ€™s make it worse. Idk, how is it affecting you?
