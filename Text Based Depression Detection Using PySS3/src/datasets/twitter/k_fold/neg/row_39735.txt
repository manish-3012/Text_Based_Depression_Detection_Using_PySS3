The more you are depressed people the more people hate you I am 24. I've been unemployed for 1 year and a half ( I was only able to get 1 job in my life ) , i had 1 exam left to finish school but i left like an idiot because of my depression . I was sexually abused at 4 years old ,I got bullied a lot when i was a child, I hate my family , I have diabetes, I am in debt , depressed , , I also have OCD , I have body dysmorphya and horrible Eating disorders i have a miserable pathetic life . I wish i could die too . I m a worthless looser too. I hate this life , I hate this society and this sick system , I want to see WW3 , I want all those bastard who enslave us , all those mafia bankster who are destroying humanity , I want Big pharma , governments bastard and Mafia corporation to burn . In my religion suicide is not allowed . My life is only pain , fail and suffering . I wish we could all build a small community near the beach in a beautiful tropical south asian island and leave this disgusting place. Im so sick and tired , the pain is non-stop , I didnt cry for years , i cant even cry .I also  noticed when i refall in severe depression , everyone around get meaner and digusting . Sick world. I just  want to cut all my ''friends'' from my life , since no one understand my disease. My family was already intolerant and disgusting towards me , but i find it more surprising that none of my so-called friend could show a little bit of sympathy. I am unemployed , i cannot work i have a disease and i also have diabetes .... But none of those f-cker understand that i cannot do shit !It's not my fault . I am tired of blaming myself day and night. FUCK THIS SOCIETY , FULL OF ASSHOLES AND SELLFISH CUNT! ( not everyone of course but at leaste 75% of people).
