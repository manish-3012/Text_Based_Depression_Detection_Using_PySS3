The only thing keeping me from ending it all right now is that I donâ€™t want to die aloneI donâ€™t want to go into the details, Iâ€™ve just struggled for so long. Been through things that would make your eyes water. Half of the people I grew up with are gone because they couldnâ€™t cope with living with what they experienced. 
Iâ€™ve toes the line so many times, but tonight I finally realized, Iâ€™m scared to die alone. 
Iâ€™ve never felt real love. I have a terrifying fear of abandonment because thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve ever known, and the idea of ending my life with that feeling in sharp focus is terrifying. 
But I canâ€™t keep going. I canâ€™t do this. 
Everything I touch turns to shit because my mind is so broken. I have borderline personality disorder. I am toxic as fuck and I try so hard to not be, but itâ€™s so overwhelming. I cannot see a future where I donâ€™t break everything I love. 

Not even my daughter is a convincing enough argument for me anymore. I just wanna stop being here. I have nothing. Sheâ€™s better off without me, objectively. All I do is end up hurting her because I canâ€™t cope. 
But Iâ€™m scared of leaving feeling this alone.
