EscapeI know itâ€™s late but I just need to vent. My earlier post on r/depression went over it but basically these thoughts keep coming to me. I just want to feel pleasure. Bad/inappropriate thoughts keep coming to me, especially at the wrong time. I am so deprived of human interaction that the only faces I see are online. I just donâ€™t see how long I can function. Other people look so happy and I am envious of those who find people who care about them. I am so tempted to cut but there are no sharp enough objects near me to do so. I am in my room. Itâ€™s like 4 am where I am but I canâ€™t sleep right now. I am going to listen to music like always to get a break from my intrusive thoughts. Music is all I have. God, I am so tired or fighting. I want to quit but my family will have to suffer then. I wish I had a blade right now.
