RegretI wasted my youth and can't get over it. I'm 27, no friends, no career or degree. I dropped out of high school at 16 due to social anxiety and major depression and never bounced back from that decision. I can't believe it's been almost 12 years since then :/ I haven't made friends or maintained any relationships in that time. I got motivated last year to find friends and started going to tekken tournaments and joined a ping pong league but I couldn't make any friends. I am broken and don't see how Im going to dig myself out of this. not that it matters because I'll never get those years back. Maybe the afterlife is real and I'll have a good one.
