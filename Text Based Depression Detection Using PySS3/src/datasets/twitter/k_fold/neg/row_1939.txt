I am extremely concerned about my best friend.We both have struggles with mental illness, he has depression and anxiety, I have paranoid schizophrenia, anxiety, autism, and PTSD, and despite only being friends for around 6 months we are extremely close, we both tell each other things we don't dare tell almost anyone, and have very similar interests. We talk almost every day for hours on end, and today he messaged me saying he is just done with life, he doesn't want to be here anymore, and he's not one to just say this when he feels a bit down, I've never heard him speak like this before. 

We spoke back and forth, we had plans to meet up tomorrow so I've been begging him to just hold on for one more day, I said that I am not in any way ready to lose him, he's the only person I've ever felt a proper connection to, and he means more to me than I think he knows. He says he'll be safe tonight but I don't know if he's telling the truth and I'm fucking afraid.
