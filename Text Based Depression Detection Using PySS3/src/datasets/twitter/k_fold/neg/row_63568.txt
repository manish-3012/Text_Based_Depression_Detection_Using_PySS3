I'm quite unhappy and feel like I've no way out, but don't want to end itI've been thinking to myself lately that I'm going to be stuck in the situation I'm in for a long time. I'm struggling to find a job with my degree, am in a job that isn't great, and live at my home with a dad who's pushing me to succeed constantly (and even gets annoyed if I don't hear back about job applications). On top of that, I barely get to see old friends and the friends I do see are from work and they like to party a lot whereas I don't, so I feel a bit out of place.

I've started to wonder if this situation is one I'm going to be in forever, or even a long time, and the thought of it is really depressing me. I hate the situation I'm in and feel miserable going through the same cycle over and over again. A lot of times I feel hopeless and that the best way to get out of this situation is to end it. I'm not suicidal, nor do I want to die, but I'm simply unhappy with how my life has turned out and I feel like this is the only real option to get out of it.

The only thing really keeping me from doing that is knowing how devastated my dad, brother and girlfriend would be, and I don't want them to be hurt.
