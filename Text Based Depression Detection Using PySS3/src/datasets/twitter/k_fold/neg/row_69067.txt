Why do I have to be like this?Some may know what gender dysphoria. It makes you feel depressed for looking like the gender that you were born as or being treated like it etc. I have it and not being a girl, never being able to look like one, have the organs and never being really treated as such just kills me. I tried to live like it for a while now but everything goes wrong as usual. The things that failed add up to the depression. I get more depressed for every part that doesn't look like that of a normal girl and it stacks up my depression and frustration really bad. I have to hold my tears back everytime I look at myself and feel bad seeing girls on the street or especially online. If I would have just the problem of not being female, no my body has even more problems then just not being female, it's fucked. My past makes me want to die even more. The surgeries, hormones can't do enough to help me out of it so there is no solution to my depression and even if there were surgeries to help me enough, I would never have the money for that. People won't understand why but I am just sitting here preparing to cut my wrist and write the few friends I have that they were the only ones that they helped me so much.
