I just need someone to need meI've done some bad things in the past, and I don't know how to move past those when I can tell how it's going to affect my future life. It feels harder and harder to get out of bed in the mornings, knowing that I place a burden on everyone that I have to work with. I try to help people to stop feeling so bad inside but it doesn't help enough for it to matter. I've been feeling worse and worse this summer as college admission season approaches, and I can't see myself going on much longer if I feel worse every passing week. Sorry for making you read this post, I was just hoping for anything that makes me feel needed enough to stay here.
