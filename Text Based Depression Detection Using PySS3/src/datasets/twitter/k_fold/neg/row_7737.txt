I wish I was dead.Honestly, I'm worthless garbage and I'm better off dead. I'm a disappointment to my family and most of my "friends" abandoned me. If I weren't a cowardly, useless pig, I'd put a shotgun in my mouth and blow my brains out. I know I sound like a desperate attention whore but this is how I genuinely feel about myself and have felt this way for years. Honestly, whether or not I want to die is irrelevant because in the end In know it's what I deserve.
