I can't talk to the suicide chat line because they want my name and email address...I would phone the hotline and talk to somebody, but I don't have a phone and the internet connection in here is too weak to carry a VOIP call.

I would leave a message on their chat service, but they want me to identify myself (which I know is just going to bring cops to my apartment, and they'll take me away in cuffs).

I would talk to my friends, but I was just told "Everybody has their days. Welcome to the world."

I don't have a plan.

I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts for two years. I think I have like eight suicide attempts, which is ridiculous, like I can't even fucking die, which honestly I'm starting to think that I can't. This past year has been so much better and I've been healing, but it still comes back from time to time.

I should be really happy right now. I just opened a new exhibition of my work; I have an amazing job; I'm dating girls; I have lots of new weather appropriate and work appropriate clothes to feel pretty. Really, I have no reason to feel like this.

But I feel like life is empty. I'm supposed to go to work in two hours. I don't even want to. I've been crying on and off since 7am. I've been laying here trying insomnially to sleep since midnight. And I just feel like giving up.

___

Should I go to the hospital so I can talk with the psych nurse? I just want to say fuck opening up the space today and deal with my emotions. My boss is out of the country, so if I don't show up, we're not going to be open today.

I don't know. I don't expect any miracles. Maybe I should just go to work and suck it up.
