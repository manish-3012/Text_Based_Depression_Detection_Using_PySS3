I really wish people took verbal abuse seriouslyI am so sick and tired of people calling me sensitive when I bring up alll the verbal and emotional abuse I went through. Like stfu, please stfu. I am an adult and I still don't feel comfortable in my own body and I can't trust myself. 

Please live to traumatise people untill they show signs of trauma. 

There are days when I ask myself if being an functioning adult is even worth it. And whether just giving myself up to alcohol and drugs is a better option. 

If it wasn't for my younger brother, I would have booked a car, drove off to a secluded place and gases myself with carbon monoxide.
