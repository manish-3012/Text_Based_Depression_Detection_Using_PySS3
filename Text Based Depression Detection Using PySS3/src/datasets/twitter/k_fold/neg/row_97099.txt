I don't knowI'm sitting on the couch of my brother in laws house right now. My wife just told me about two hours ago that she hasn't been happy for the last two years and she wants to"separate"for awhile to work on ourselves.  About six months ago someone accused me of something and I'm being brought up to courts martial next month. I pretty much have nothing I own to myself, I'm horribly depressed, and I can't really think straight right now. I've thought about suicide before, how easy it would be to just get rid of all my problems like that. I love my wife to death and I can't lose her but she is leaving me. I don't know if I could kill myself, but I've been thinking about it. I don't know anyone here but my wife and brother in law and we don't go back home until Thursday. I don't know what to do anymore. My plan for getting out was to come here and work as an electrician but she will probably stay here so I have no plan and nothing in the future to look forward to. I am just ready to give up.
