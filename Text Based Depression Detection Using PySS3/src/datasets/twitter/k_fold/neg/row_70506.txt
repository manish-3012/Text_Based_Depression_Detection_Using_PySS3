I thought I was getting betterI thought I was fucking getting better but I was not I was digging to pit for my self to plumer back down I hurts more then the first time. Iâ€™m so done with being here. I just want everything to stop. It is so loud. I canâ€™t forgive my self. I am sorry to those I hurt and let down I messed up so bad. I donâ€™t know how to forgive myself. So please when I am gone donâ€™t remember me by the problem child or the kid that cut. Just forgive me for what I am about to do. Iâ€™m so sorry. I sorry I was not strong enough to stay here any longer. Good bye
