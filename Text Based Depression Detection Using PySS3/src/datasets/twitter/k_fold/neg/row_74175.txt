Back in the hole againAfter my girlfriend left me 3 months ago, dropping some hard truths about me as she went, I spiraled into the deepest depression Iâ€™ve ever had, and I was spiraling the drain for 3 or 4 weeks. I moved back home when the pandemic hit, and I wrote so many notes and made so many plans to end things. I almost failed my semester (which went online) because I simply could not get out of bed in the morning or concentrate on anything. It felt like a waste of time to do any work for my classes since I knew I would be dead before I went back in the fall anyways. My mom figured out that I was contemplating and I started seeing a therapist. I was finally doing a little better and just managed to pass my semester (Iâ€™m usually a good student and I go to a really good college). But then something triggered me I guess. My mom cracked a joke at the dinner table about how I spent three months moping about my stupid girlfriend instead of doing my homework and helping during the pandemic. This really hit something in me. I think the root cause of my recent depressive state is that I know that I am pathetic and fragile enough to let a breakup destroy my self-esteem, my will to live, and potentially my entire academic and professional career. She reminded me of how pathetic and useless I am. I feel like such a failure to my professors, who I really respect. I wanted so badly to do well in their classes but something in me just shut off. I feel so bad for not helping out around the house more. I feel like such a burden on my parents. They didnâ€™t ask for a mopey leech. Itâ€™s hard enough for them already these days. I should have killed weeks ago when I sort of had the courage. The only reason I havenâ€™t gone through with things is because Iâ€™m scared. Itâ€™s ridiculous when you think about it. How pathetic can a person be.
