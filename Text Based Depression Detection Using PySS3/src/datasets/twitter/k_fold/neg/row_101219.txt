What do you want death to be like?Always talking about the ending it here but not what comes afterward. If there even is anything.

I hope it's like sleeping. I've been doing a lot of that lately and it's so lovely and peaceful and nonsensical. There isn't any depression in my dreams or really much emotion at all, it's mostly just going through some strange event and then long stretches of nothing and then more dreams. It would be nice if there was that feeling of going to sleep too, where I'm all huddled up in bed with tons of blankets and warm and drowsy.

I can't say I don't want it to be nothing, since it's not like I would know if it was nothing, right?

But I don't think I want it to be some heaven or hell scenario. Since plenty of people seem to think that suicide will send you straight to hell. And anyway, I want death to be the end of consciousness as I know it now. I don't want to have to think about right or wrong or what to do. I want to be free.
