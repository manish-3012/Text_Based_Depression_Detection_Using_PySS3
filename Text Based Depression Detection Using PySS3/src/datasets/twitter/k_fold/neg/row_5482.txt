Life is empty and without purpose, why do I feel this way?I donâ€™t want to self diagnose myself with depression or something, but I just always feel depressed. I have two parents, a brother, family, and â€œfriendsâ€. (By friends I mean friend groups where I have to invite myself over if they wonâ€™t or that I am too distant from. ) I never had addiction, illnesses or anything, so WHY do I feel this way? Why do I feel like life is a burden and without purpose? I have people that care for me but feel so alone. I donâ€™t want to have them worry about me. I donâ€™t think I could ever actually commit suicide, but if I were to die I wouldnâ€™t even care, it would probably be a burden lifted from my shoulders. Am I just hoping someone would notice and I am just looking for attention? Iâ€™m in college and no matter how many classes I take, or degrees I pursue, I canâ€™t see myself doing anything I want to do in the future. Everyone says â€œFind your passionâ€, well that is easier said then done when I half-ass everything and am not particularly good at anything. I had to delete my social media because seeing all those â€œcelebsâ€ or even just other kids live a life full of happiness and not being lonely started to negatively affect my psyche even more. I feel like I donâ€™t even have a personality because I just look for others recognition or am willing to do whatever with no care in the world. Iâ€™m not even religious anymore. Even now, Iâ€™m probably only posting this to crave more attention to temporarily give myself value. Life is just lonely. Sometimes Iâ€™ll fall into a deep hole, and start wishing I was never born and just cry. What is my purpose in this f*cked up world? Has anybody else felt this way?
