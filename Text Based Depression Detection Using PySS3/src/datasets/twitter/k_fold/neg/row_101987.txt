My previous narc ex destroyed me, and now my current GF has left me and I am struggling to find a point in all of thisI lost my career earlier this year because of my narcissistic ex that spread rumors about me once I posted an image of my current gf of two years on my story... These rumors were about sexual abuse but I never heard any details except for the fact that around 40 of my network acquaintances just dropped me over the course of a couple weeks. 
This got me hospitalized due to depression and suicidal tendencies. I lost more and more freelance work, went from being the provider to one month needing help from my gf to pay rent.

Later went to start a new education for something I thoughtâ€™d be fun. It ended up being interesting but stressed me out to the point where I couldnâ€™t give close to any attention to my gf. On top of that I still had freelance work left over to do. Our previous problems on my end that were caused in part due to my narcissistic exâ€™s sabotage of me started to flare up again and the emotional attraction faded...

My gf tried to break us up a couple times telling me I was a narcissist, which I agreed to and have been working on for a good while by reading stories of narc abuse. I just held on for dear life until the day after my birthday (the 17th this month) when I cried my heart out, apologized for everything I put her through and gave her the break up she wanted. She never got introspective or apologized for anything she did but it didnâ€™t matter... I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

I left for my apartment the next day, almost jumped in front of the subway, fell onto the floor as I got home, cried like Iâ€™ve never cried before and once I couldnâ€™t cry I took the closest metal object, my keys, and started grinding my wrist til it bled. Iâ€™ve never actually gone ahead and self harmed all the way before... But it would never get deep enough so I stopped and just lay there motionless.

Then my mother called because my gf who I just left told her to check in on me. I guess she really did care after all...

Iâ€™ve spent every day since hating myself, crying to myself saying if I fuck up something as nice as my gf that I donâ€™t deserve to live or be happy or to move on with my life. And I believe it. I barely eat.

My gf, now ex, is giving me the cold shoulder and minimal contact treatment which I understand. And Iâ€™ve had friends every other day to lean on and talk to.

But I just donâ€™t want to go on. Iâ€™ve had two meals in the last three days and Iâ€™m in bed until 3pm every day even though I wake up at nine. I have even more work to do now and start school again in two weeks. Iâ€™ve lost so much weight, used to be in fighting shape for martial arts... I see no way out of this

I think this is goodbye soon
