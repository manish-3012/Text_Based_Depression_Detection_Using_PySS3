Jump.I've moved to the UK recently. They have bridges that are over roads. If I jump, will I die? 

I don't fear death. I know I'll do to hell if it does exist. If it does not, I will forever be in the state of sleep where you do not dream. 

All I do all day is sleep, eat, drink, listen to music, go on the internet, draw...

Nothing has meaning now. Life is empty and fruitless.
