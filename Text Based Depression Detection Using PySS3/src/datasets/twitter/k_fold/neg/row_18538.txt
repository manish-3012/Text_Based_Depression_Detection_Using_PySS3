It's never going to get any easier. I have no one and I can't do this by myself.I'm 17, in college, and struggling more than I have in a long while. I have pretty debilitating PTSD and OCD as a result of severe and prolonged childhood trauma. (I was abused, neglected, witnessed my father's affair and parents' divorce, lived with adults with mental illness, had several family members go to rehab, etc.) I feel like I don't deserve to exist. Every fucking breath feels like a burden. I have never believed in God and I have quite literally been *praying* not to wake up in the morning. I'm all alone and this is too much to deal with without having anyone to trust to help me. I'm in so much pain and I want relief so badly. I set up an appointment with a counselor but I don't want to be alive to see the end of this week.
