I'm coming too close to the edgeDisclaimer: first reddit post, never thought I'd make it here

Can't feel a thing. That's the best way to describe it. I can't remember the last day I've felt truly glad to be alive. Every day feels greyer and colder than the last. There aren't any good days for me, only some being better than others. Many know me as the fun guy but on the inside I'm just a shell of what I once was. The facade requires an inhuman effort to maintain and it drains me by the time I get home. It's an agony to live like this, see everyone around you happy and properly enjoying life. I don't know what there is to enjoy anymore. Already another day and everything has gone to shit. Like trying to run but frozen in place. I'm failing and no one knows why. 

Can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it scares me. I fear the nothingness that awaits me if I take my own life, but there is no other option. I'm of no use but I pretended I was until now before the inexorable truth revealed itself. What is there to do? Go to college, join the Army and live out my life as a slave to stronger, better people and then lay down and die? I cannot see what purpose God has endowed me but I see a rich irony instead. It came upon me, a sudden epiphany. That is ultimately the purpose of my life. I am a nobody, will live a nobody and die a nobody. Completely pointless. There are worse ways to die than suicide, and I absolutely deserve them as I shame myself and my family with my very existence. If I die, I die on my own terms and with whatever scraps of honor I still have.

But listen to me ramble such nonsense to you people because nobody else gives a shit. I've been living out this purposeless existence, this abject suffering for far too long. It's time to make a trip to Home Depot, buy some rope and hang myself... high. I am doing you all a favor. Goodbye.
