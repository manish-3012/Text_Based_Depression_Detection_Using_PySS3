Advice needed for moving on after a suicide attemptI tried hanging myself two days ago but was interrupted when someone knocked on the door (turned out to be the mailman.) I took this as a sign that my life should turn around and I should live, but now Iâ€™m back to being depressed and anxious as ever. Abused mentally, physically, and sexually by my father, have made awful mistakes I regret, haunted by trauma and shame, plagued by mental illness, you know the drill. I snapped two days ago because my best friend didnâ€™t seem to care that I wanted to kill myself and I think her friends insulted me about it. It also disappoints me that hanging like Kate Spade did on a doorknob with a scarf seemed more difficult and slower than I expected and now I have less hope that I could actually do it and would have to choose a scarier method like jumping which Iâ€™m pretty sure I would not be able to get myself to do. Does anyone have any advice on moving on after a suicide attempt?
