I'm getting there pretty quickly..I just came out to a few friends and my dad about wanting to become a woman instead of a man. I have felt this way my whole life and I still can not accept it myself but they all support me. I was just released from prison and probably just failed my drug test for alcohol (I was drinking to deal with this pain), so I will probably go back to prison for yet another 2 years. This is all so hard to deal with and I'm getting more and more thoughts about killing myself. I feel like an abomination. 47% of transgender people commit suicide, that's not a promising statistic. I have been so emotionally drained I can't think or even listen to another person talk for more than a few seconds. I don't know what to do. :/
