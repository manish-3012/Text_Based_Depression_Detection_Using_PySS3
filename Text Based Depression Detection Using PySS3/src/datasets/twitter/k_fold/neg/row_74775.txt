i'm so scared - xpost from offmychestlast night i had a dream about killing myself.

i was sitting on my mom's bathroom floor, with a knife. i cried for a while, then i just went at it, over and over. i feel like something happened after that but i can't remember what.

i can't stop thinking about how nice it would be if i could actually do that. if i could just mutilate myself as much as i wanted and not have anybody around to care. i can't even look at myself without thinking about what i could do if i had the chance.

i've been depressed for a long time, i self harm a fair bit and i've been suicidal before, but it's never been like this. it's never been this intrusive or graphic, i've never felt this "okay" with the idea of fucking myself up like that.

it's like i'm having an argument with myself in my head and i'm worried that it'll get worse, but at the same time, i hope it does. i'm scaring myself but i don't want to go to hospital again. last time, i only stayed in pediatrics for a few nights and that was bad enough, what if they want to keep me in for longer, or put me in a more specialized place? i couldn't cope with that, i'm fine at home, i just get too stressed out sometimes.

i don't know, i don't know anymore. i can't talk to anybody about this irl and it's killing me.
