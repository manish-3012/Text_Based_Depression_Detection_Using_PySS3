I want to dieI'm 18. My life really isn't bad, but for close to a year now I've objectively thought about whether or not I felt like living was worth it, and I've decided it isn't. I just don't think our shitty world makes sense and I don't want to be part of it anymore. And honestly, the inevitable devastation my mom would feel is one of the only reasons I haven't offed myself already. I don't know, I just think this pathetic rat race we call the American dream just isn't for me, and that marching to the beat of a ticking clock to rush to a shitty job that I'll hate for 55 years and then dying is even more depressing than suicide.
