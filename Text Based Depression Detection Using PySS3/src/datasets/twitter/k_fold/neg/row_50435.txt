Who? What? Where? Why?I don't really have much of a story. That's a large part of the problem. I have nothing. Everyday for the last six months I've toyed with the idea of going to the Golden Gate and jumping. 

Why not? I guess some friends and relatives would miss me. but all in all they judge me. I'm a college graduate, 27F- I have nothing to show for my life but debt and a vagina. I almost married recently. Turned out we werent right. After that I.. well I've been seeing this guy who is "that asshole" who says I'm easy and when I try to talk about things that are more serious to me he defers the conversation to sex or... whatever. He can't really be real with me. 

Why am I doing this to myself? I have no confidence left. I feel like because I don't have a resume I can't do anything. I have no dreams. I have 0 ambitions. Everyone around me has it figured out. Me? I sit and wallow. My grandpa died. My friends are all better than me. My ex has a brighter future. I have nothing. I serve no purpose. I have no motivation. I want to just melt into the couch and not move.

I am bored with life. There is nothing left to see bc i have seen everyone's faces and they can't be real with me. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense. I'm not really sure who is out there. Anyone?
