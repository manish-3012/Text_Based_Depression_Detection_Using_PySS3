Why do I always do shit and then realize it's a terrible mistake afterwards?- Smoked at least 5 spliffs and 15 cigarettes for 9 years straight while only eating garbage
- Became extremely depressed because I regret it so much after turning my life around, hitting the gym 6 days per week and gained 20 kilo in healthy weight.
- Became suicidal due to the regrets and started crying to my ex. She blocked me when I told her I missed her. Then I made a new account and wrote extremely suicidal texts to her. She gets angry and blocks me, but then I try to save it by constantly making new accounts, don't accept her refusal to talk until she explodes and writes an extremely mean message that completely fucks me up.
- Instead of leaving it at that, I constantly spam her with explanations, apologizing, a little bit of insulting stuff back and so on. I do this for like 4 to 5 months because her insults repeat at an unbearable rate in my head. I even wrote an e-mail to her work that got forwarded to her co-workers...

Now I'm 7 months later. Still think about it all the time. Completely fucked myself up. Extremely scared of the consequences. Worried that my ex will retaliate.... And feeling like the worst person on the planet for wasting so much time on pointless shit by spamming her. Why couldn't I stop doing that? :( :( :( I just feel so sad about how much better my mental health would be if I hadn't contacted her and cried about how I think it's too late and I'm going to die young. It's so embarassing... It must have been so annoying for her too. Like what the fuck does my fucking ex want from me... But for me it was extremely serious stuff because I'm afraid I'm living a failed life and she said stuff like 'you'll never learn how to live your life' and that made me feel so hopeless. Unbearable insult for someone in my position who's already feeling extremely hopeless.

It's been almost one year since my grandma died and everything went downhill in my life after that. I just started ruining EVERYTHING for no reason except how I'm living healthy now.
