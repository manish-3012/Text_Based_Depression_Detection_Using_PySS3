my gpa is 0.8I left a university because my gpa was a 1.8 and i was suffering from depression, anxiety, and a loss of a close (and pregnant) friend. iâ€™ve always struggled in school and my mother and older sister are always trying to encourage me to do internships and join orgs and shit i honestly do not have the energy for, but my bad grades stress them out and they just want whatâ€™s best for me. but this was the worst gpa iâ€™ve ever had. my depression has gotten worse especially due to daylight savings. i donâ€™t want to live. i really donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing with my life and the future is very blurry. i go to therapy, and even before then in the summer i was making a lot of mental progress, but none of it can save me right now. iâ€™m home alone and i want to relapse back into self harm because iâ€™m too pussy to kill myself and i donâ€™t want to hurt anyoneâ€™s feelings, but i donâ€™t see a future for myself either... i donâ€™t know what to do..
