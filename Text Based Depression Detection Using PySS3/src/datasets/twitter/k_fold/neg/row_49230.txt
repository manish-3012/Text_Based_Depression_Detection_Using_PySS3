I'm scared. Incredible anxietyCurrently I took 20mg of Zolpidem and it does all it gets me is to normal behaviour 

No sleep. I don't sleep well in 330 days


During the day I'm so anxious all the time


Can't stay still. Even with 6 or 9 mg of Bromazepam administered 


I'm scared this will never end. I rather die than live like this

I need for the girl I like to give me a chance


I'm so scared
