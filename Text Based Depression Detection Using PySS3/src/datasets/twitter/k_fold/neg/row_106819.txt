Couples counselor says I can't talk about my suicidal thoughtsSo my wife and I have been having some relationship trouble since I came out to her as trans (having realised this only a year after we got married, I know, not ideal, I wish I'd worked it out sooner).

We have a few others things on our plates but my wife has consistently said that she wouldn't be able to accept me if I transition, until a couple of weeks ago. Her response to my coming out has triggered my depression pretty intensely, she's threatened that she will leave unless I get therapy for it from someone other than my current psychologist (who specialises in therapy for transgender +more generally lgbt individuals).

So, we get some couples therapy while I'm still looking for a new depression focused psych, and during a session the therapist says that my depressed ideation isn't healthy (no shit) and asks if I have a plan. I say I don't, my desire is to get away from my situation, not a specific plan. She says she wants me to say "I don't know how to cope with this" instead of "I want to die"... Sure...

But I do know how to cope with this, my usual approach will lead to my own self hatred, giving in and giving up on things I care about and being a door mat. It'll be me being increasingly frustrated and distressed while those around me are alienated and become impatient. It'll be me, basically just waiting for death or for some miracle to come and change my life.

I don't want that any more. I want to get out of this cycle, but I don't have the support or energy to make change myself.

So, I know what I want to do, I want to end things. I want out.

Fuck anyone who wants to take that from me. It's the last thing I have left.
