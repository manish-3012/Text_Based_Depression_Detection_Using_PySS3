I fuck everything upI don't even know where to begin. All I can think about is how I fuck evertyhting in my life up. I have no job, my health is fucked, i am depressed, have anxiety along with fibromyalgia and dormant SS (systemic sclerosis).

About 5 years ago my life was great. I had a home of my own, I had friends that were not on the internet, I had just began dating a guy i met online and it was going great. then about 4 years ago I married the guy I was dating, 2 weeks after the wedding I fell pregnant. From there on my life has rapidly gone downhill. From the moment my son was concieved i have had nothing but health issue after health issue. I suffered with Postpartum depression and struggled for a year to overcome, just to find myself back into a black pit of self loathing. After my son turned a year old I had a breast cancer scare which tuned out to be cyst. then over the the course of the time since then to now i've been diagnosed with SS &amp; Fibromyalgia. I can't work because im always in horrible pain, im depressed and i've had enough. I just want to end my life. 

tonight I told my best friend that if they hadn't walked back into my life i would probably be dead already and to walk back out of my life and let me go. all I do is fuck everything up. I just want to end my life, I wan't to go to sleep and never wake up again. I wan't everyone I know to just stop caring about me. I dont deserve to be cared about. I dont deserve to be loved. I only cause people to hate me. I'm a coward but I want with the last of my strength to just kill myself then nobody will ever have to deal with me again.
