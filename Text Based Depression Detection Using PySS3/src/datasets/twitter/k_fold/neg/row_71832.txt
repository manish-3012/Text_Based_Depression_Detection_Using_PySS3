How Normal?I have been thinking about suicide now almost every day for a couple years now. I donâ€™t know if this is normal as an adult, but I just canâ€™t get the idea out of my head. I never go through with it because the only thing I hate more than myself is hurting others. I donâ€™t know if the lack of motivation is from the same cause, or if itâ€™s from its own causer? I probably never wouldâ€™ve let any of my friends or family know I feel like this, but after a big mistake some of my friends know. I moved right after that and now Iâ€™m basically alone and there is some weird mental block causing me to stay that way. Maybe the same cause? Maybe because of my failure? I guess Iâ€™m only on here though because of a lack of people to hang out with. Sorry for the rambling but I havenâ€™t had anyone to talk to recently and I know enough about myself to understand that I learn by vocalizing.
