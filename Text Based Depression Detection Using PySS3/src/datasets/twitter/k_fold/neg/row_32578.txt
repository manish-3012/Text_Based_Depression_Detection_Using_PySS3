i am insane n there is no hope for me :Dhi im 19f and I am going to kill myself. I have been mentally ill since I was 12 and it has only gotten much worse since then. I am diagnosed with, anxiety, social anxiety, bipolar 1, a personality disorder, adhd and an eating disorder. I struggle every day and I canâ€™t function at all i barely graduated high school, I I have no job, I still live with my mom and I have no plans for my life at all. Since I was 12 the plan was to just kill myself when I turned 18 and obviously that didnâ€™t work out at all lol. I have attempted many times and have been In a psych ward 3 times, the last time being in September. I have been receiving help for 6 years and have only gone down hill. I have been on hundreds of meds and in therapy and it just doesnâ€™t work for me. I feel like there isnâ€™t any hope for me and I donâ€™t see the point of living just to be miserable everyday. I know life isnâ€™t fair but itâ€™s sucks so much that I am crazy, there isnâ€™t even a reason for my problems which makes me feel even worse. My life has been pretty decent, I have a loving and supportive family who care about me. The only thing that has had an impact on my mental health is my step dad committing suicide, which is also one of the reasons I am still here right now. I donâ€™t want to put my mom through that again but at this point I donâ€™t know how much more I can take. My brain feels like a prison and itâ€™s exhausting to just be alive. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore I donâ€™t have any more reasons to keep going and it scares me. I just want it to stop. I said I would wait until 2021 just to see if the meds they just put me on would work but I canâ€™t take it anymore and I donâ€™t think I can wait any longer. I feel so sick just thinking about leaving my mom but i think this is for the best. If anyone reads this, thanks for listening and see you on the other side ! &lt;3
