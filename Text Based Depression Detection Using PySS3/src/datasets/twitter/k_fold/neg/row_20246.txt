My dreams have taken a turn for the worse....So I've been severely depressed now going on almost a year, came very close to killing myself a couple of times.  I used a service they have at work to go talk to someone privately and she set me up with some meds and that has kept me above the "I want to die" line for a while now, but tonight I've reached my wits end.

The one thing I have kept holding on to was that I didn't want to hurt my wife and kids.  Even still, I kept having dreams every few nights about killing myself in various ways, but I was able to mainly ignore them.  The last couple of weeks though, these dreams have turned horrible.  I find it difficult to even think about them and it's taken me hours to get up the courage to type this.  In my dreams, I have been killing everyone first and then killing myself...

So first to be clear, I've NEVER been a violent person and if I were to ever hurt my family, I know for sure that would be the end of me, no question.  It's been like torture, seeing these images over and over and over again.  I'm afraid to go asleep, and I lay awake at night wondering how shit like that even comes out of my brain and I spend most of my time these days terrified that something could happen and I "snap" and act out?  Christ, the mere thought of that right now is making me twitch.  

I certainly can't talk to my wife about this, I don't want to scare her.  It took me months to work up the courage to tell her I was even talking to a damn therapist.  So here's pathetic me, no friends I can confide in, and trying to decide if I should kill myself to protect my family from me.  I just can't frigging take it anymore.....  I fucking die every few nights.

I'm sorry for pissing all over your night... I just don't know what else to do.
