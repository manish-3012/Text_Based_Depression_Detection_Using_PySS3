Spending this Christmas holding on for my lifeI thought taking my meds would help but they haven't. Now I'm just calm and contemplating blowing my fucking brains out. I don't care anymore. This world sucks, everything sucks. I'm absolutely done with existing. It's ok to let go forever. It's ok to leave, no one is going to miss me.

I'm pathetic and I'll never have my life together. I'll never be happy. This is the anniversary of the last time I tried to kill myself and today is just as bad as it was last year. I'm not risking another year of this.

Good bye everyone.
