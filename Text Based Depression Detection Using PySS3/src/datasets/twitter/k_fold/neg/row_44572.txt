I contemplate life and can't help but thinking: "wtf is all this bullshit?"Sorry in advance. This is just me venting with big words. Bottom line is that I'm lost and tired of life.

I'm not a failure ; I'm even pretty functional for society I would say ; and yet I feel like I have no value, because I think that I know I have no value. This isn't even an emotional business anymore, it's a philosophical one. Now, sometimes I distract myself, I numb or entertain my consciousness, and I'm 'ok' again; this doesn't last very long. I've been depressed for a year now. Honestly, I've never been the cheerful, happy kind of guy, except when I was a kid. I didn't know anything then. I did not acknowledge meaninglessness. Now, one can live without an universal meaning, by creating one for oneself, I guess. I've always believed existentialism to be a joke. People seem fine with it. They have to. How can they live without any framework to believe in ?

I feel different, but really I'm not. I feel intelligent, but it really does not matter. I don't really want to kill myself, but sometimes it feels like this is going to be the way out in the end. I have built illusions across time that made me go on: I believed that intelligence was the best thing to have, that it is the most important feature for humans; I believed in love, true love, and that led me to limerence, numerous times, the last episode being extremely painful; I believed in self-development, and still kind of do, treating myself as the most important person in the world, but feeling all alone at the same time. All of these led me to walls. Now I'm floating in space-time. What the hell is all of that ?

"Happy" ? Come on now. Does that even exist ?

More than ever, I have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I feel mediocre and worthless. People think I'm a kid that is just discovering life. I'm 25 and I feel lonely, even if I have friends and a very supportive mom. I'm locked in my skull, unsure of reality, and no one understands me well.
