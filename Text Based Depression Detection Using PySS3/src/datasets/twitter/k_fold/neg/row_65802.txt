What Now?I don't know if this is the correct place to post this or not. If not, remove it.

Failing suicide is a confusing, overwhelming feeling that has left me even more drained than how I began. I didn't even know that was possible. I tried to kill myself a few days ago, but the spotty vision and pounding in my head ignited some carnal, stupid impulse to tear the belt away from my neck. So, what now? Do I tell someone? Do I call someone? Do I pretend like it never happened? In the days since, I've stowed away from everyone and let music tide me over, but it's night and I'm alone-- the guilt (how pathetic is that?) is so raw and I just feel so confused. I feel so conflicted and I don't know what the fuck to do or say or think now. I'm so fucking alone. I know that all of us on here are trapped in our own shitty little worlds, but fuck, man. I hate feeling this fucking way!

So, what now?
