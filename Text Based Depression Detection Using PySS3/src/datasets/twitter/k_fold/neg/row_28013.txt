Aways feeling so tired.Everyday, I feel so tired. My heads always feels so extremely heavy. Every day feels like trying to swim upstream of a river. I'm a 20 years old male, but I feel as though there is no point going on. Christmas was spent mutually breaking up with my girlfriend, which hasn't helped me as I've never never had many partners, support from my family or friends to begin with. Every other day this year has been spent slowly getting out of bed to find out I've been turned down for another job. I've even sent out many, many job applications to places located in different states of Australia, such as ACT and NSW. Video games help take my mind off things if temporarily, but, afterwards I'm done playing, the sudden influx causes me to cut myself on the wrists. 
I've tried killing myself with alcohol and sleeping tablets before but that didn't work, and instead made me more depressed, as the only suicide attempt I tried didn't succeed. Nothing really pushes me forward anymore through life. No hope at making new friends, definitely no partner (who'd want to date a sad excuse for a man like me?), no future. I only want to die, it's the only thing I think of day in and day out. I guess the only reason I write this is on the slim chance someone could convince that suicide isn't the answer, and try and turn me around. I say try because I have been like this since 2007, and attempts to try help from therapists and such have not succeeded. Sorry if this is a jarbled mess, I didn't really have an idea on how I was going to write this.
