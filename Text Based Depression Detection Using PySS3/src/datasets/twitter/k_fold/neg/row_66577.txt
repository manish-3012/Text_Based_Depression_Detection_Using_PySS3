No one wants me here. I'm sorry I lived for this long.I'm sorry. This is my only way out, out of this hell. My whole life I've been beaten down like I was nothing and I've became nothing. Everyone loves to see me in pain so why not give them this? There is no happiness. No light. I have no useful skills. This world will be 10x better without me. This time I hope I succeed.
