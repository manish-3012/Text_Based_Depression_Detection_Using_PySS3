One more attemptHello everyone, I'm a 20 year old male and I have been stuck with this mental illness for over 5 years now. 

It's not getting better so that's why I have put together a plan and will hopefully (finally) somehow muster up the courage to go through with it. I'm truly just realizing how lonely I am in my life. I have no one to talk to and I've never had any relationship that I could consider that close. 

People keep using the same "It'll get better" but honestly is there not an equal amount of chance of "it" getting worse? I don't doubt there will be more good if I live, I just know that the bad will ALWAYS outweigh the good no matter the amount. 

I guess the problem is that I want the world to work a certain way and that's just not possible. I'm far too empathetic and care too much about a world that is indifferent towards me. I've always thought I believed in God but I guess I can never be certain. 

I guess this is just one last call for anything. Of course I don't want to die, I'm just getting very tired of it all. A permanent solution to a temporary problem...a temporary problem that keeps coming back again and again and again and will never leave me alone
