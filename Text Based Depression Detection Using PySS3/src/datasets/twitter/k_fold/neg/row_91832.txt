i really hate myself. i'm lazy and i have no money. 

i moved back in with my parents, im moving back out in september but only if im able to pass this exam thats coming up.

i think my family doesn't like me. not really. whenever they're angry at something else they take it out on me. i don't sayanything. 

i am trying to be good and not a burden. i dont go out ever.
they dont like it. i cook and clean. i am trying to prove my worth and not be a burden.

my dad calls me really fat and ugly. and i knw because my siblings are much more slimmer and are very good looking. i go to the gym four times a week and eat healthy. im technically a good weight but i know its not good enough i feel very ugly and i hate myself.
