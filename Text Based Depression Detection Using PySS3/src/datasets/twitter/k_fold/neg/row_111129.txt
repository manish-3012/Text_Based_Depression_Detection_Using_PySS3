Really need some advice regarding my depressed girlfriendHello all,

I'm very distraught and scared at the moment so sorry if this comes off ranty. 

I've been with my girlfriend for almost two years now and she suffers from depression. When we first started dating, she would occasionally get a little down, and she told me that things could get really bad, and in fact went as far as trying to break up with me on the grounds that I would eventually leave her over her depression. We got through that (over a year ago) and things have been pretty good overall.

Over the last two months or so, she has had some serious ups and down. After one spell of uncontrollable crying that lasted all day in which she told me that she didn't want to live any more, she improved pretty heavily the following day and she opened up to me a bit during a walk. She told me that she had been diagnosed with depression when she was about 19  (she's 25 now) and has a family history of it. Apparently she tried several different antidepressants but many of them either did nothing or made her depression worse in the sense that she began actually considering suicide whereas previously it wasn't even an option in her eyes. Eventually, she was prescribed Adderral for the mood enhancing properties. She still takes 5-10mg a few days a week, depending on whether she has school or a lot to do at work.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, we were again on a walk and she confided in me that a few days beforehand she had half-seriously tried to kill herself. She said that she tied a poor version of a slipknot in the belt of her bathrobe and tried to hang herself, before backing out and throwing up. Obviously, I was horrified. 

She assured me that she was now doing fine, I need not worry, and that she regretted the action. She also said that she was hesitant to tell me because she knew it would change the way I looked at her and she was afraid I would assume she was suicidal every time she got sad from now on. Both of those were fairly accurate - I now get sick to my stomach at the slightest sign of her being upset.

In the past, I have suggested that she see a professional and this is always met with anger and incredulity. She feels that psychologists have tried and failed with her and that psychiatrists pushed the drugs that made her consider suicide in the first place. When she told me about the suicide attempt, I of course suggested professional help again and was met with the same repulsion. 

Over the past two days, my girlfriend has been going through a really rough patch again. I sensed that she was off on Saturday night and by Sunday evening she was getting very quiet and distant. Today, she is in a deep depression with crying fits and talk about how she doesn't want to live anymore. She says she knows that she may be happy again at some point but she knows she will just get sad again and she's tired of living like this. 

As I type this, she is parked in her car somewhere, on and off the phone with me between crying spells and she refuses to tell me where she is at. I don't get the feeling that she will harm herself tonight, but I am obviously terrified and worried for her. I had considered calling the police/paramedics, but she is in a field where a psychiatric hold would ruin her career and is assured to end our relationship, probably making her depression 100x worse.

I love her so much and I'm so worried. I think she will pull out of this spiral in the next few hours/days but I really want her to get some sort of help once she's back to baseline (or close to it). How can I all but force her to seek professional help for herself when she is so hopeless and resistant to the idea?
