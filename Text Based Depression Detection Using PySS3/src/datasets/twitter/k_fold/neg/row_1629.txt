Make it look like an accidentI'm 55, three kids and married for 20 years and retired military. 
My life has been on a downward slope for years. I hate everything about myself will  spare anyone who reads this the details. 
I'd like to die but feel a suicide would be a selfish.
I have very good life insurance and my family will be taken care of.
Any suggestions.
