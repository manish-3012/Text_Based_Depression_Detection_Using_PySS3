Casual Suicidal ThoughtsHey. I have a more indepth post on my situation in r/depression so I'll save you from it unless you want to [read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7vb8gj/depression_questions/)

My main question is, for a generally functional mid-20s adult that is leading what others would call a lucky &amp; good life... how is it possible that I have casual suicidal thoughts? I could be walking down the street and a voice will pop-up into my mind calling me a POS and that I should kill myself. It's something I've lived with for years.

Is there any scientific backing to this that I could read? I don't totally know where to start. I am against the idea of taking medication to 'cure' this and much rather want to find the best ways to live with it or overcome it. Sometimes I've had pretty dark moments where the voice is extremely strong and other times it just comes and goes. Mostly I try to separate it internally from my true self and attempt to observe and understand it. Through the years I've discovered certain triggers that will make it easier for these thoughts to get louder - being able to catch the beginning of the path early usually helps to mitigate the impact of the voice.
