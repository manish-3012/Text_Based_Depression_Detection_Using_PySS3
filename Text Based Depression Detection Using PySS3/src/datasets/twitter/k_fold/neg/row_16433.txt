BefuddledIdk what's going on. 

I have a girlfriend I love, but I don't actually want her because I'm too messed up, but I can't leave her because she needs me. I feel like I'm in manic state atm. I'm trying to slow myself down but my mind can't focus, it's all over the god damn place, flying at a million miles per second, on everything except what I'm supposed to be focusing on. Idk how to deal with people, they're so overwhelming, but I love them so much. I can't do this anymore. There's no reason for me to stay. I'm worthless and useless and good-for-nothing. I can't live like this anymore, I barely ever leave my god damn place because of anxiety. I can't talk to people but that's all I really want to do.
