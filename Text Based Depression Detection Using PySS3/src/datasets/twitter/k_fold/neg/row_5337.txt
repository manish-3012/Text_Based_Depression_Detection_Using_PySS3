I'd like some help, if you have a seclet me just say, I don't consider myself a current high risk of suicide. I just want some advice on things I can't talk to anyone I know about. About a year ago, I was in a really bad place. I don't really want to go into detail, but let's just say I had been rejected by everyone and everything that mattered to me at the time. So I set myself a deadline, that within a month or so, if a number of things didnt all go my way, I would just go and end it. I consider myself a rational person. This wasn't a spur of the moment thing, I had taken months of internal debate to decide on it. I had an extremely detailed plan to avoid failure, the correct type of pills, a place where I wouldnt be found before I was done, so on and so forth. I was, at that point at least, completely ready to die. obviously, as you can see, things turned around. They're miles better. But I still remember the feeling of having planned my death, of it being certain, and a done deal. I can't describe how it feels exactly, but it's almost a physical coldness. so that's where I need advice. how do I stop feeling like this?
