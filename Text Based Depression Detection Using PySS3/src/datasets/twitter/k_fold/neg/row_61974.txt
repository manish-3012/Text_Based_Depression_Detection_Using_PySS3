I'm not religious but honestly god, please let me have a stroke or a heart attack ... i'm too tired to try to kms for the 3rd time.Just kill me..... no one would realize when i'm gone because no one realized that i'm alive. 16 years of trying to be a kind and reliable girl for nothing. 

Not everyone can have a happy and so ... may god end story of living 

Whoever reads this... i give you all my energy so please have a good life because you deserve it more than me.

I'm praying to not wake up tomorrow so bye bye (eventually).
