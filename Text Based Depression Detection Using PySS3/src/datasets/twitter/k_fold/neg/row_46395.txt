They told me I could succeed but I know they knew I wouldn't make it I'm readyYesterday as I listened to an old voicemail with my boyfriend's voice I cried.  I cried because I think something bad happened and I don't have any idea how to find out what.  I also cried because I realized that basically everyone in my family told me we would never be happy and they were right. Why bother telling me I could be like others?  Why encourage me in my childhood to push past the boundaries of my disability?  Why not teach me to stay down.  Teach me that adults lie because they feel uncomfortable or they feel pity and are ashamed to say so. It would have been kinder don't you think? Now I'm lost in an eternal sea of pain and despair.  I'm sorry but I'm ready to get out of here.
