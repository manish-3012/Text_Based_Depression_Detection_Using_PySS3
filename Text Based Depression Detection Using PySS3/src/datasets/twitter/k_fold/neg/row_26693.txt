I see no reason to continueI am a 23 year old female and I got divorced in March just as the pandemic started. We were married for 3 years. He convinced me to date him, to marry him, despite my hesitation. I should never have given in. All that love, all those years were wasted. He was a terrible husband, even though I would have done anything for him. Never one gift, not even on my birthday, never one thoughtful moment, so much anger, so much dismissiveness. I was depressed during that last year of marriage, but he never really helped me. I had no job, because he preferred me at home, I was scraping by in college, losing all my friends, gaining weight. He was my best friend and he just one day vanished... abandoned me, because I wasnâ€™t well. I know I hurt him sometimes too, when my resentment became too much, but I really was unwell. Will he ever understand that? Probably not. He called me to tell me he wanted a divorce. He couldnâ€™t even tell me to my face. He left me homeless during the pandemic, so I had to sleep on friendâ€™s floors, until I got over my pride and accessed local resources. I tried to get better, even though all I wanted was to kill myself, I felt so so worthless after being thrown away like trash. I took the pills, I did the therapy, I reached out to friends, I exercised, I lost 40 pounds in those firs three months. I was making some progress, despite my renewed high school eating disorder, but less than two months later, before the divorce was even official, heâ€™s engaged to a coworker. He blocked me on every platform. He acts as though I never existed. This stings so bad, because for three years, he became my whole world. I didnâ€™t have anything beyond him. All wasted, all worthless. All that I devoted to him, he throws me out because Iâ€™m too sad, too difficult to help...

Worse still, I miraculously fall in love with someone else I meet. It happens slowly, but the connection is real. Thereâ€™s lots of drama and mistakes, but the love was something I really felt... that I still feel. Yet, tonight I ended it with him. Despite how much I loved him, there were so many red flags: controlling behavior, purposely hurting me verbally, broken promises, lies. I knew if I stayed itâ€™d never work out, that I would only be hurting, even though I almost didnâ€™t care... I thought if I just want to die anyway, why not just stay and tolerate the abuse? But itâ€™s too late to back out of the break up now. Thereâ€™s no way he would ever forget this. I hate hurting him, it hurts me more than he will ever know.... but maybe he will, once I end it. 

I find no purpose in life. All Iâ€™ve ever wanted to be was a mother. I fought through college just so I could have a decent job just so I could afford to be the mom I wanted to be, but itâ€™s nothing without a partner. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever find a partner like that, to make a family with, that wonâ€™t lie or break promises or hurt me...
