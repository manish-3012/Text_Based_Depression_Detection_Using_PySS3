Do these thoughts ever go away?Every time I think Iâ€™m getting there they come back with full force. I canâ€™t see a way out of this mess Iâ€™ve made for myself. I tell other people it gets better but it doesnâ€™t. I still want to die, I want to hang myself, I think I might do it tonight when my boyfriend goes to sleep. Iâ€™m tired and I canâ€™t go on.
