It's less that I want to die, and more that I don't want to be alive anymoreI don't really know why I'm posting this but anyways, here it is. I'm a freshman in college right now, and for the first time in 5 years I have something resembling friends. But I know that when this year ends, that will end too. That I'm just going to be alone again, and this time I most likely won't make any friends, and I'll go back to where I was in high school, alone. And just the thought of that makes me cry. And it makes me just want to not be alive. To not feel any of these feelings anymore. To not feel loneliness or pain or anxiety or guilt or anything. To not feel like the worst piece of shit or that I annoy everyone I care about or that I don't deserve love or good things. I would Just be nothing. Like I'm asleep or something. I think that would be really nice. I can't of course because of the pain it would cause my dad, but it's still a nice thought.
