I've never had to help someone before.Hey Guys/Gals,

I am a web community outreach director for an inner-city hospital in the US. Due to patient confidentially I can't say anything more. Basically, I helm the facebook, twitter, linkedin, yelp, all that stuff in trying to promote us online and dealing with negative reviews and stuff.

Today I recieved a suicide message through our Facebook page. The woman claimed she had overdosed on pills and was waiting for death. All I had information wise was her name. Due to it being an emergency, I called several people in the hospital and was able to track down her real name and address and call 9/11 and hopefully get someone there to help. I have no further information and I'm pretty shaken up. I don't know what to do.
