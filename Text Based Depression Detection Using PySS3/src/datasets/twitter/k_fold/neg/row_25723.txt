SUICIDE SHOULD BE A HUMAN RIGHTThe brain matures fully by 25 when it comes to decision making. If someone has come to the realization that life is garbage, and has reached an age where their decisions are not tainted by the hormonal imbalances of adolescence:

THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO IT

SOCIETY SHOULD NOT GUILT THEM INTO NOT DOING IT

THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LIMP OFF TO HOTEL ROOMS OR GARAGES TO DIE ALONE LIKE FUCKING ANIMALS. THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE DIGNITY OF EUTHANASIA, A PEACEFUL DEATH, AND A GODDAMN HERO'S SENDOFF FOR NOT WANTING TO CLOG UP THIS SHITHOLE FOR THE INSUFFERABLELE FUCKS WHO ACTUALLY THINK LIFE IS WORTH LIVING.

I WILL NOT REST UNTIL THIS IS MADE LAW AND CULTURE. AND THEN I WILL BE THE FIRST TO AVAIL OF IT.
