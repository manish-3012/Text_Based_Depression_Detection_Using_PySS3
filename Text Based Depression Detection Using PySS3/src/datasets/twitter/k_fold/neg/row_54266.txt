I'm so fucking miserable.God damn. It just dawned on me how shit my life is. It's just the same fucking garbage, day in and day out. Now I've got insomnia and my face and jaw are fucking numb and tingly all the time. For fuck's sake. My mind is just so fucking hazy I don't know what to do anymore. I wish I had a gun to just shoot myself with.
