There is no other way. This is destiny.Since adolescent i have always been an outcast and a loner. I have an anxiety disorder and heavily depressed. I simply cannot fit in. Why? Why can't people just accept me? I see all these people my age or even younger laughing and enjoying themselves with groups of friends, having a girlfriend. These are things i longed for. No matter how hard i try I'm just a freak. WHY?? WHY WHY ME?????? I DON'T LOOK THAT DIFFERENT FROM PEOPLE, I'M NOT UGLY AS FUCK, WHY PICK ON ME? JUST BECAUSE I ACT DIFFERENTLY? THERE IS NO LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.
