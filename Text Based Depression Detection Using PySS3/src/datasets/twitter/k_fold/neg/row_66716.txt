I'm almost done...I'm really getting tired of life... I honestly, truthfully cant take it anymore. I can't reach out to anyone. High school is breaking me down part by part. My parents forcing me to do my studies. Stress from my friends, and more.. I just can't take it anymore you know? Each day comes by, I think , " When will this life end?" " When will I die, I bet it's really calm up there. " I love so many things, I love my parents even if they force me to do stuff, but people have their limits. I cant bring my self to tell my parents "Hey, I am feeling suicidal and I'm done. " or " I wanna quit everything." I really don't know how people get by these times. I'm slowly losing grades in High school, I cry on my bed every night. I hide my sadness,  I forcefully laugh. I'm honestly up to kick the bucket. **I just can't take it anymore, what more can I say for you people to believe me? I did another post yet only one person replied. Please, if my problem is unsolvable, just don't say anything, and let me die.**
