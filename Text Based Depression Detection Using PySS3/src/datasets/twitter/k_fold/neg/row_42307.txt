How do you deal with the constant anxiety?I've been suffering from anxiety and hyperthyroidism (which makes it worse) for the last two years and I have some days my actions become so compulsive it's driving me nuts.  I've always been a very lively person and along with this anxiety I overreact to things, I talk too fast, my thoughts are all over the place and I can't stop thinking things over and over.  I'm far away from my family or friends and don't have anyone I can talk with.  My coping mechanism became work (7 days a week, sometimes working 2 days w/o sleep) but my body couldn't take it and I had to quit my part-time.  

I constantly think of just killing myself but I know I'm not going to do it but these thoughts are more constant (thus my last post here during my panic attack).  Any advice on how to deal with this?  I'm currently unavailable to get professional treatment.
