I took 100 Acetaminophen pills. Will I die?Two days ago I took about 50 pills of OTC extra strength pain relievers with Acetaminophen (it was Walgreens brand, not Tylenol) and yesterday I took another 50. 

The thing is that Iâ€™m doing fine. Better than fine. The last time I tried this it was with brand Tylenol and I feel nauseous/not great so I ended up going to the hospital early enough and everything was fine   

But this time I feel nothing. I did puke 3 times but thereâ€™s no way that most of it came out, right? I mean, I took 100 pills!


Just let me know if I should expect things to get worse so I can get the sweet eternal rest Iâ€™m looking for.
