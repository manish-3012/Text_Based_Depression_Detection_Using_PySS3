I called the hotline and they hung up.Iâ€™m not depressed or in crisis. I am going to kill myself by carbon monoxide poisoning. I called the hotline and they said since I donâ€™t want â€œhelpâ€ they had to go. Iâ€™m self-actualized and am not willing to go on. 

Things are this way because this is the way people want them.
