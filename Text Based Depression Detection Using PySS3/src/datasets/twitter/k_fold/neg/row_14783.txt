I'd rather kill myself than learn to driveNot even an exaggeration. Five years of therapy and medication and it's just not happening. My life can't get together until I can be independent. Nobody can love me. I can't move out. I can't tell anyone that I want to kill myself because the county mishandled my medical records and any hint at a mental health crisis would have my siblings removed from our home. It all comes down to not being able to drive. I get sick just thinking about it and I don't want to die and but my desire to not put the effort into improving my life is stronger than my desire to stay alive.
