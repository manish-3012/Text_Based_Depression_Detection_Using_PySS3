Give me colourBecause even though I can see it all around me, it won't reach deep enough to fix me.

It's my 21st year of living here with all of you and in that time I've come to submit to a strong sensitivity and alienation. I've been given a few important trials recently (University, sustaining friendships, love and loss, family, giving as well as receiving, loving, serving, growing, growing humility, growing focus and mastery) and have succeeded in none. Granted, my expectations are high, but failure to these standards only pulls me out of the delusion that material successes can give happiness (most people say they know this, but few believe it).

Some set backs in the career, some setbacks in opportunity are only to be expected. There's enough motivation talk out there to know that it's only how you respond to them that determines who you are.

And who am I? 

I'm not responding well. Again, I find myself in a black hole that steals away from me all the ambition and will to live. Why?

I can observe myself closely. As much as I analyse and assess others, even as they talk wide-eyed and merrily in to my eyes (neutral), I find it challenging to stop doing the same to myself (negative). 

My minds eye has the vision of a hawk, and it won't turn outward like I want it to.

This breeds an ultra critical and depressive persona. Since I was young I recall being at  restaurants with my parents, seeing a classmate happen to enter, and plead my table to be quiet and attract no attention. How dare you, you little shit? I haven't been given the tools, or I possess no channel to grow thick skin and that leaves me eternally anxious and feeling stuck. Trapped, when the people that surround me would lovingly cradle me out of my cage, if only I could be strong enough to unlock the door.

And what is that strength? Why is it so hard to connect with others now? The present frustration that led me to write this (you are lovely people) is the observation of my social disintegration. I can see myself gradually losing my confidence, and the small amount of eccentricity, charm or love that I used to seep out when comfortable enough. I'm very emotional and I truly love those around me just for who they are. But I don't get it back. I can come off as pretentious, disinterested, flakey, like a loser, quiet, inconfident, witless, and even gay (obligatory /nothing wrong with gays but I am not) ...all because there is something stopping what I feel on the inside coming out; a discordance between in and out. A massive dam built with the concrete of unyielding insecurity.

I don't even know what it is either. I'm a cancer. I'm a cusp of oscillation cancer. I'm an abandoned kid cus my parents divorced. I'm untrusting of people because I've been raised as a total judging asshole of everyone and everything. I'm moody because my brain hormones aren't doing the right thing. My bones are slowly weakening and my 20 nails are clubbing because of some chronic inflammatory thing caused by a fucked up autoimmune disease. I'm frustrated and angry because of this too and it all just makes me feel like less of myself. In front of those I want to love and in front of the mirror. 

Some things dive off the top of my head.

That joke of not wanting to fuck my day up by looking at a mirror is funny and all, but its too poignant. It's too sharp and prickly to accept the emotions associated with: people just aren't comfortable in your presence. People look at you funny in the streets several times a day because of how you walk; at every encounter in a shop because your voice sounds strange and in any situation involving more than a couple people because you inexplicably go red, often, and for no reason (even if the topics of peodophilia, stupidity, LGBT, etc. come up I go red in the face). 

No, you may not be severely disabled or have anything infinitely limiting for you to lead a fairly healthy life. But these things don't cease in forcing me to a continual critique on /Life.

What is it? Why am I here? And all the "bad things to good people" sort of stuff that my mind uses for a dash of pity.

I'm writing to you tonight for a reason. 

You could predict this thought pattern early in my life if you took a close look and connected the dots. No real friend group, ever. Spend school breaks walking around school in circles instead of making fun. Be blind to, or reject the advances of girls who would have given my preteen and teen self the much needed base for confidence. But, no, that and the other shit piled up and now I'm confronting life as a fresh grad with slim social skills, depressive and inconfident tendencies and the worst of them all: fading hope. 

But tonight I'm being dramatic. A teary eyed lone sole. Looking for help. For attention. For help. For warmth and for colour. 

My bodily ailment (legs bowing, joints twisting, back hunching, fingers clubbing) and my lack of confidence mean I am slowly coming to see the world outside my window as harsh and hostile. I didn't want to be here! I just want to be accepted. That's all its about right!? You can get as rich, as much pussy or as many promotions as you want, but if you ain't got people to ride it to the top with, you're not worth shit! A caveman tribe and a modern day soul mate! That's all I want, but I'll die as a lover before I ever get the chance to see it as a soldier, a sage or a father.

So I'm writing to you. Tonight I got the last bit of light holding on for dear life in that black hole ripped away from me. She wasn't my girlfriend. She was an ex and I thought there was a chance for more. But its not just her. It's not just all the shit that I'm writing above, but its the non stop meddling of my mind. A scarce moment of calm passes through me once or twice a day and I forget about the demands I have for a happy life. Im happy for a second before it fucks right off again.

Consciousness is nothing more special than moving particles are to heat; water is to the sea or electromagnetic waves are to light. The result that is your experience of living is not the touch of a supreme fingerprint, but the culmination of concrete and unemotional biological processes. Why torture myself with the illusion of hope for better things?
