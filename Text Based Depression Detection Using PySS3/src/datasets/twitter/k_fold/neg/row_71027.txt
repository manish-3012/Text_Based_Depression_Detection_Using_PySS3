I asked for helpIâ€™m bipolar and I recently went through a hypomania but for the past 2 months the depression has been getting worse. 

Last week I told my mom that Iâ€™m feeling depressed and feel like giving up. I told her I wanted to schedule an appointment with a therapist to get help. 

She told me to wait until January when I have better insurance. 

Tonight I told my parents I want to kill myself. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it everyday. 

My dad said Iâ€™m too strong and I would never actually kill myself. 

I have no one else to ask for help.
