it didn't get better.Preface: I find talking about this sort of thing unbelievably difficult. I have been a person that has hated talking about his thoughts pretty much my whole life so, uh. This will likely read disjointed.

I'm 30, as of this year. I've failed at every career I've attempted. I'm gay, but I'm the type of introverted, dumpy, depressed guy that everyone ignores. (I'm in a LGBT-friendly city and have been to bars, so, no, it's not like my location is bad.) I'm ugly and short. The few "big creative projects" I pursued in my life became laughing stock embarrassments. I've worked my fucking ass off to try and "be happy/successful" and all I have to show is insurmountable debt, bowel problems and testicle torsion. In my quest for anything I've gotten nothing.

I have no family. My friends are great but it is increasingly clear that I'm simply the burden in the group. A group of excessively intelligent and talented individuals that I could never hope to compare to.

I'm really good at bitching, I guess, reading back at what's above. That seems like it's it, for me.

And it's not going to get better. It has arguably gotten worse as I've gotten older, despite syrupy feel good anti-bully campaigns trying to tell me otherwise. (Perhaps I was always too cynical for them, though.) If I didn't have a fairly okay dead end IT job within walking distance, I would not have a source of income. The one I have feels like a scam somehow, and it doesn't pay enough for me to save up to get a car (I haven't been able to afford a car since an accident I got into years ago) but it's keeping me afloat.

I've been almost exclusively kicked around by life and it seems incredibly unfair to me that I am just supposed to continue to take it when there is absolutely no chance or opportunity for it to get better.

I... worked on this comic project for 3 years. 3 years of my life was spent pouring my god damn soul into this thing. The thing about having stats for visitors is that you get to see reality. I think I'm realistic, but maybe that's the tricky thing about depression. Regardless, numbers tend to not lie. I had a reasonable start traffic wise, but it wasn't going anywhere. Then a game came out semi-recently that did very well and it did a concept that I was going to incorperate in my project very well (much better then anything I could do, frankly) and between watching dwindleing interest in my own work vs. the overwhelming success of this media's use of a somewhat similar concept... I had a breakdown. I deleted the comic off the internet and have just kind of spiraled ever since. Years of my life and energy gone forever.

It's been months now. I have not recovered. I know this logically. But that side of my brain is losing out, every day. I wasn't a terribly happy person before, but I had a lot of hopes and dreams riding on that thing and all the colour of my life just drained out all at once. 

This is so rambly. I tend to bottle things up when it comes to stuff like this, so... I'm just kind of sitting at work right now. Hitting keys. Exhaling. Stupid shit.

I don't want to just keep being this shitty failure. Younger kids that are depressed get to at least have hope. I don't get to have that. Most of my life is gone now. I wish I had killed myself sooner so I wouldn't have to be me, now. The single hardest thing for me to do is wake up and realize I'm still the same person.

I don't know man. I just googled shit desperately and saw this place and wrote so that my hands had something to do. I could keep going, but even talking about it seems so stupid. I'm just some idiot in someone else's world.
