I hate myselfI hate my body, my skin, my hair. I wish I was a more attractive person, and  people would notice me and have a crush for me, but it's been 2 whole years since I dated somebody. I hate having the personality that I have, hate my mental illnesses. I always cringe when I think how stupid I look like when I'm around people, but I can't change. I hate living where I live, hate the parents that I have, hate the fact that I was born in a poor family. Maybe if I have more money, I could work on something. But now I have 0 money. I've never had a job, and I don't feel like I can get one, I did some interviews before but they didn't approve me. So I use this as a daily reminder to how shitty I am, I would never accomplish anything because I am a total garbage. I am so broken and I'm sk done with myself. Now, I am so lonely, I miss the friends that I had back in high school. Now they're out there making their lives, getting their jobs and being someone. Me? I am standing home all day, feeding my depression and social anxiety. I can't stand be around people, I am so awkward omg, and I absolutely hate it about myself. 
So, I think I said it all. I don't know how to keep on living anymore. I am planning my second attempt at ending it all (the first was last year, I just disappeared from the world in order to kill myself. 6 months passed and i just failed at it. So I decided to give life another chance... But I ended up caught in this spiral again, and now I hope I can finally end it all).
Thanks, anyway, for reading all this, I never told anyone about all this. And sorry for the text, I am not a native English speaker.
