Good life, but depressed and want to dieUsing a throwaway for obvious reasons. Iâ€™m in my early thirties, married to a wife that loves me dearly, but that Iâ€™m no longer physically or intellectually attracted to. I love her to death, just not in love anymore. I have a good job, make good money, low stress at work. 

The last 2 weeks Iâ€™ve had zero motivation to do anything - play my favorite  games, watch my beloved sports teams in the playoffs, interact with anyone. I wake up sad. I take a few Klonopin at work to float through the day and try not to cry for no reason, I get home sad and want to do nothing except sleep. 

A divorce would ruin my wife, especially if I went on to see someone else.  Even after years I still think about â€œthe one that got awayâ€ and it hurts my heart knowing I had what I wanted, and ended up like this.  Iâ€™m too old to even try and start a family with someone else. 

Recently Iâ€™ve been looking at painless ways to die as Iâ€™m sick of waking up and spending all day feeling like shit. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it and what my last thought would be before I slipped away.
