I'm embarrassed that I want to die. But I'm too humiliated to live.29 years old.
2 year old ostomy.
Because of Colitis I lost my teeth, my right cheekbone, my colon, my appendix, gallbladder, parts of my liver and stomach. 
I have spent 6 years in near constant pain. The lowest I get on the pain scale is 4. 
Doctors are frustrated.
My mother is all I have, and she's emotionally barren. "Why can't you get over this?"
I'm disabled by the Government's standards, and I can't argue, the writing is on the wall.

I want to put an end to being trapped in a shrinking, suffocating, metal box. 

I had so much potential, I've ran for public office twice, I've run businesses, I've inspired people... But I hate myself. I hate waking up. I hate feeling this disgusting bag of shit sloshing around against my stomach. I hate looking at it as it falls out of the bag into the toilet, and splashes me upon its landing. I hate seeing the outline of it in ALL of my clothes. I hate shopping for clothes because I have to take so many things about this cursed fucking husk of a human shell that I'm stuck with. I hate thinking that if I ever did let someone love me, I would one day cover them in my feces because this bag falls off so easy. I hate thinking about the poison in my DNA and how horrible I would feel if my child also developed colitis.

I live with my mother. I can't live on my own because I'm not strong enough to run a household by myself. 

I am a monster. A horrible shit monster, covered in scars, more plastic than man. A blight on my family name.

I just don't want to be remembered for dying.
