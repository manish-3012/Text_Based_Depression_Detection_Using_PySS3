The punchline is missingIt always felt like a half finished sandwich, or a novel half written as a kid. The thought that you didn't understand why people do what they do, why they think and care about what they do.

And me, sitting there, thinking that I dont understand why people like life, but I am only 12, so I figured I would understand it later. Cue entering college, and still not getting it. Is being social supposed be worth the drudgery of soul draining employment?

I still dont get it. Mid 20s, stupid useless corporate job that I hate, in another overdeveloped subdivision. Wondering if this what I burned 12 years of my childhood getting ready for.

I dont get it. I dont understand what I am supposed to look forward to. What is the spark that makes the monotony of living worth fighting for? Am I seriously supposed to be happy with spending my life sitting in a fucking box, or getting the "priviledge" to have some corporate bullshit invade my house? Am I supposed to be fulfilled by Netflix and a new phone?

Am I supposed to desire this charade of a culture? Why should I care about living? Why is suicide wrong? I dont want to be here anyway.

Covid19 or not, I don't really understand what I am supposed to even enjoy in life. It seems like looping obligations, with periodic silver linings to temporarily distract you from those obligations.
