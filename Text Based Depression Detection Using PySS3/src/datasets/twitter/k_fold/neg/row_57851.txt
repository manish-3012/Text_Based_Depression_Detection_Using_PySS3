Someone has to loseAfter 50+ years, I think I'm just done with this world.  I'm finishing up a few passion projects with my work, trying to figure out the best way to leave my wife a little money and as the time gets closer, the fear has faded.  I think I'm even looking forward to it.  If certain things happen, I'm taking it as a Que to put things in motion even sooner.

I dedicated much of my life to building a business that helped a few people and after all these years....I had to accept it's just not that important or a good business model.  I'm grateful for the opportunity to have lived in a free and prosperous country, given what I believe to be every opportunity to succeed and yet still manage to consistently fail.  All me 100%. 

The frustration of not having anything or anyone else to blame adds to the pity party.  I had to finally accept that my role in life is to always fall short.  Financially, socially, whatever.  It's hard to explain that definitive feeling, it's just that the realization is so jarring at first, but In time, it does sink in.   Now the indifference washes over me every day.  I just don't care about much of anything anymore.  

Almost every day, I take my gun, empty the chamber, put it to my head and pull the trigger.  I've done it so many times, it's just muscle memory now...which is what I wanted.   

I just don't think I have the energy to come back again from another failure.  I just know the hammer is going to drop soon, like it always does, but I'm just not interested in trying to overcome it anymore.

I'd love to offer some wisdom, but you should never take advice from someone more messed up than you are :-\\
