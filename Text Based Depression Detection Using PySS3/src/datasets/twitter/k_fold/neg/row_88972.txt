i hate my body, and i would die to be rid of it and look like heri feel like a complete and utter freak. almost 24/7 im thinking about how ugly humans are and how excruciating and humiliating it feels to be trapped in this body, with this artstyle. over and over again my brain keeps telling me that the only way ill ever look just like fenneko from aggretsuko is if i kill myself, ad if i do that, ill be just like her and be so happy, with her artstyle and face and ears and voice and everything. my body is wrong, and it feels wrong. so fucking wrong. and im ready to die in order to have the form i want. i honestly dont think i can last much longer like this. im such a fucking freak
