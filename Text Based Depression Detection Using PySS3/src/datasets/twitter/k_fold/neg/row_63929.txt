My father says I'm the greatest disappointment in his lifeI don't know how to explain this, but simply he says that once I was part of his pride, but now as I grew up I turned into a "stupid adolescent who can't do anything right besides taking drugs" (his words). He said that not only him, but my mother, my brothers and almost everyone who cares about me are tired of trying making me change, and that he doesn't want to see me anymore. I don't know what to do, it's like I can't find peace or happiness anywhere, everything is just despair and overthinking.
