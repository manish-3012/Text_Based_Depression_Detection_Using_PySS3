Some people were never meant to be aliveI thought I had beaten my suicidal tendencies. My entire life I have thought I would be the cause of my own death. I remember being five years old and wishing I owned a gun so I could kill myself. Until I was 20 those compulsions haunted me. I tried multiple times... Petty attempts. Never for attention because nobody knows but me. I cut myself, I starved myself, I emotionally beat myself up daily. 

I thought the depression passed after I tried MDMA and LSD for the first time a year ago. All of 2012 was a year of forgiveness, self exploration, and love. But I have since gotten the message and hung up. I truly hate all that I am- this hatred goes much deeper than I could ever express in words. I've spent years trying to change bits of me that I disliked, but in the end I realized I am who I am and I cannot change me. 

I don't want to die. I want to live and be happy. But I cannot go on living the way that I've been. I honestly believe some people were never meant to be alive, and I am one of those people. Consciousness is the enemy of humans; it is far too powerful for our purposes. I often think myself into depressions and the more I think about life, the more existentialistic I become. 

I am extremely intelligent, too intelligent. I want to live, but I am ashamed of who I am. Truly.... I am embarrassed of myself. I don't know what I expect from this post, I guess I just wanted express my thoughts. The only thing keeping me here is the thought of how sad my mother would be if I beat her to a grave.
