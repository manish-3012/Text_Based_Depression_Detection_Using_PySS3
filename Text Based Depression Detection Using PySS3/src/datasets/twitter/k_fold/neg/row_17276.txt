Slowly slipping awayYou know, I look back on life. All 28 years that I remember or think I remember, and I really don't know who that person is. I don't really know who I am, and I've never known who I want to be. I'm losing myself. My whole grip on reality has been slowly slipping away for many years, but so much has slipped in the past year. 

Am I depressed? I really see no point in living. Wake up, go to work, go home, and go to bed. Throw in some eating, shopping, and mild forms of entertainment which barely interest me anymore, and that's all life has and will ever be to me. All I ever think about is how to end things, if I feel I've reached the point to do so, and where should I leave this world. I mean, why would I want to go on suffering this life? 

I'm just waiting for something which will finally push me to pull the trigger. Of course, I'd prefer an instant kill switch, but since this overpopulated world thinks inventing that is wrong, I have to choose a more gruesome method. 

I'm fed up with life, with people, with myself. There's no fixing me. No amount of therapy can change this mindset, and anything that could would be blatant brainwashing. I'm just tried of existing. At the point, I'm not slipping away. I've made the choice to let go let the darkness take me.
