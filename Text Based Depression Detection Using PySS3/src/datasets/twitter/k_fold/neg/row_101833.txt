excusesI was raped by my best friend at the time when i was 10. About a year later he spread a rumor that i fucked my dog and told him about it. He was well liked by other kids and it spread to other schools. I have not told a soul. He has a girlfriend and a job and a good life.

I have 2 friends now that im very close with. They are the only ones who look past my social anxiety and depression and actually enjoy spending time with me.

Im 21 and I never really leave my parents house anymore. I had been bullied a lot throughout school. Made it out of highschool at 19 with 50s.

I cant connect with people irl. I've been told im not a bad looking guy but i cant talk to girls for shit and have been rejected by so many girls i dont even try anymore.

I dont work. All i do is waste money. I've been to therapy and counselling and im on ssris. I've tried to kill myself before.

"You're such a virgin". Been told that by a few girls. I guess I'm an incel but i dont blame women at all cause im a mess.

I know with enough work everything could be fixed. I could get a job and a girlfriend and go to college and make something of myself but I have no motivation. Woe is me.

I have given up on a good life for a long time. I just want to die. I'll hang myself in the woods soon. Woe is me.
