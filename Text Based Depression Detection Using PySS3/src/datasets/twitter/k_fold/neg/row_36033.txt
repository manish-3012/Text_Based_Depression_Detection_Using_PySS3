Why do I botherI'm honestly just feeling so shitty and hopeless lately. Lately = 20 years. Nobody really reads my posts, just like nobody really cares irl. It would be amusing if it wasn't pathetic. I'm so exhausted today. I tried to hang out with anyone this whole weekend but all anyone wants to do is have sex and not hang out with me, so there you go. I had a lot of casual sex in the past seeing if it would lead to my demise but nah. Drug use hasn't killed me yet either. I'm just such a loser. I contribute nothing to anyone. I can't even function in a social setting anymore because I'm constantly hating myself and critiquing everything I say. I just want to be done. I can't escape this headspace, I'm fading away... nothing brings me any type of joy. I'm just so miserable all the time. Is this any way to live? Count me out man. I'm beat.
