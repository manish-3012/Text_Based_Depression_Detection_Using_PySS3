I'm not going to make it.
I've posted on reddit, on various forums quite a lot lately. 

Nothing gets better for me. Every day is worse than the last.

I am 30 years old, that might be important here.

I am currently halfway through a very expensive and high-quality program of therapy, which uses a variety of techniques, including CBT, Hypnotherapy, and EMDR (eye movement desenitisation reprocessing). The quality of the therapy is excellent, the therapist really goes the extra mile, plenty of follow up contact, uniquely handwritten reports and objectives/goals after each session, phone calls every few days to check on progress, etc etc. I have never had a therapist this good before, out of all of the professionals that I have gone to. This is designed to deal with social/generalised anxiety, which is by far my main problem.

However, it really doesn't seem to be making much difference. Of course, I'm not finished yet, and intend to stick with it, but I think I have figured out what's happening.

Firstly, there is no "transformation" possible for me. Therapy, whatever type it is, doesn't change the person that you are. It doesn't take a deeply depressed, antisocial, anxious, broken person and turn them into a happy, cheerful, confident party animal. That's not possible, because that isn't the person that I am.
The best case scenario is that I make very slow progress, gradually doing a little more here, and a little more there. This is just not enough for me. I am severely limited in my life. I took a bus alone for the first time at 27 or something, I went abroad for a holiday for the first time at 29. I ate in a restaurant for the first time at 29 as well. This is embarassing, but when I went to college for the first time, I used to brush my teeth in my bedroom and spit the toothpaste out the window because I didn't want to risk running into someone on the stairs. THAT'S how bad I am. Slow, gradual progress will not work fast enough for me, and unfortunately, that's the only way. There is no quick fix here, there is no eureka moment, just a long, long battle. It would take me many years to even get to be barely functional, if I can even be functional at all.

The second thing I have realised is that with any kind of illness, or issue in life, there are two ways that it can go. You can have issues that you can work through, and overcome, and you can have issues that you just have to accept. For example, my dad hurt his knee badly when he was young. He has had to have several surgeries on it over the years, and it still causes him issues, but he has managed to live a full life despite it, he can walk, he can climb stairs, it doesn't really affect his day to day life that much. However, years ago when he was a kid, he was very good at football, and there was a chance he could possibly go pro, or semi pro. His doctor looked at his xrays after the accident and asked him: "Are you good at school?" "No" he said. "Get good at it, because you are never going to be an athlete". Due to the nature of the injury, it just wasn't possible for him to become an athlete, he just had to accept that, and cope with it.
I have learned that I just have to cope with being alone. I have tried harder to find someone than I have tried to do anything else in my life. I honestly have, and I am still completely alone. Totally, completely, alone. I get pains, physical pains, when I think of the people in my life that I allowed myself to care for. They have all rejected me, and forgotten me, and I wanted so much to be a part of their lives. I wanted to have a life with them, and matter to them. I know now that due to my issues, that will never happen.

I cannot move on. I know I *should* but I just can't... These people meant so much to me. One person in particular. I will never "get over" her. She was very special to me. 

I have been told many times that I am "Not ready" for a relationship, and I have to admit, much as it terrifies me, that they are right. I am not ready for a relationship, and it will be a very, very long time before I am, if I am ready at all. Even with all the therapy in the world, I will be pushing 40 before I'm ready to date for the first time. Imagine how much LIFE I have missed. Ca you imagine? A young man at 30, having never experienced what it's like to have friends, or be with a woman? Knowing it will be at least 5-10 years before you even have a CHANCE at experiencing that?? 

Even then, think about the odds against me! An inexperienced late-30s early 40's guy with mental health issues trying to compete with normal guys?? Even if I could compete, my heart is not in it. I mean I just can't start another conversation with "Hi, how are you? What kind of music do you like? Oh yeah, me too, I love that band!" I just... I just can't... I'm 30 years old, I just can't go through that for the 10,000th time and hope that THIS ONE TIME will be different from all the others...

Being honest, I can, and likely will, continue to make progress. I think I could learn to drive, eventually. With my lack of confidence and anxiety it will likely take several years, but I think I could eventually get a drivers licence. I think I could travel. I have done a very very small amount of travelling, so I have proven that it is possible for me. I think I could build on that, and see a little more of the world. I think I could maybe do a few more of my bucket list things, I've had a list for a while.
But those things bring me no pleasure. None. I feel numb. I travel alone. I see movies alone. I go out for meals alone. I do everything alone, and I feel no pleasure. None... 

I cannot and will not live my life alone, and that leaves me with no other option than to commit suicide.

So that's it.

I'll be finished this course of therapy early in the new year, and then I think I'll do it. I don't know where I'm going to get the courage, but that's what the therapy is secretly for, to give my the courage to die. 

I wish I could have felt love before I died. That's all I really wanted. Even when I was a kid, that's all I wanted. I remember I used to keep little bits of jewellery and trinkets that I got in christmas crackers and toys in a box. I was going to give them to my first girlfriend when I met her. I used to write letters to my future girlfriend, I was so sure... I was so so sure there was someone out there for me. I never lost faith, and then... I did...

I don't know what I would have done if I had known then that I would never find anyone...
