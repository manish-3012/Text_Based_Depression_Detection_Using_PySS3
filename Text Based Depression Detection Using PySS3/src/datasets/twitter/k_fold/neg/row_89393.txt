Do you think if assisted suicide existed for everyone, the world would be a better place?I've thought about this a lot. Here's my pros and cons list

Pros:
Many people would be able to peacefully leave this fucked up world without any pain.

The population numbers would drop.

Families will know that their loved one went in peace instead of a traumatizing way like slitting your wrists, hanging yourself etc. it'd be awful to just find the dead body of a loved one and know that they went in pain

Suicidal people might be relieved that there's a way out, and maybe try and live a little longer, since they can leave anytime (I'm suicidal so that's how I'd think... I think)

Cons:
Many families will lose their loved ones. (But that'll happen anyway)

People who are impulsive or are having a temporary episode might jump into it and die when they'd really be fine if they'd just wait a little longer.
