I shouldn't feel this wayBipolar guy here with past drug addictions. I shouldn't want to kill myself. I finally got a job and I am busy again. However, the job is long hours and I work later and therefore I get so tired. My thoughts are so stupid and lead me to want to end it all because what's the point? I stopped hanging out with people. I have trouble forming close friendships or relationships with women. Maybe I'm scared of getting hurt. I am comparing myself to other people thinking I don't make enough money. It takes me 90 minutes to get to work and I'll never move out of my parent's basement(26) to live closer because my salary isn't enough to live closer. It took me a long time to finish college and get a job because of all the hospitalizations I had as a result of manic episodes. I could go on and on. The point is I'm not happy with what I have. I read some posts here and it seems that many of you have had much worse history's but the feeling I get is the same regardless. The negative thinking never ends... I stopped telling anyone I have these feelings cause they don't understand. The meds don't seem to make a difference... I still fall into deep depression, especially on weekends because I don't want to do anything. fuck
