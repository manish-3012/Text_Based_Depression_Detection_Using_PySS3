I have no friends and I'm a big dumb failureI've lurked here a lot but never posted. It's pretty bad tonight, though, so I'm just going to talk for a while.

I've always been sad. I can't remember a time I wasn't fighting with some deep-seated sadness, even when I was happy on the surface. When I was 13 I tried to kill myself. My mom found me and took me to a therapist. I was gearing myself up to try and express how I was feeling to her and what drove me to such desperate measures, and I was all prepared to let it all out, but when I started off by telling her I'd tried to kill myself, she laughed in my face and asked me why in the world I would want to do that. That really fucked me up. I was going to be more open with her than I'd ever been with anyone, saying really fucking difficult things, and she acted like it was all some big joke. I have a really fucking difficult time talking to people and trusting them now, and while that wasn't the only trigger for that, it certainly didn't help.

Now I'm in college and I'm pretty shy, so I don't have many friends. And I'm weirdly jealous over the few I do have, and I hate that about myself, because that's not somebody I want to be. The shyness/withdrawal from people has become worse lately because my grandpa just died and he was one of my best friends and it's just all so fucked up and I just can't handle the idea of seeing anyone or doing anything. And then I wonder why I'm lonely and don't have friends. And throughout all of this there's just these thoughts in my head, like, you could always just kill yourself. I can't get rid of those thoughts. 
I don't know what I'm trying to say here. I just want a friend and I want to not feel like dying for a few seconds. I don't think anyone's online but thanks for letting me talk, anyway.
