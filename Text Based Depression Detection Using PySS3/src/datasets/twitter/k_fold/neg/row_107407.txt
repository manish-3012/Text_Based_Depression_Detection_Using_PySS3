nothing in my head makes senseliving is such a joke. i swear, if i didn't have my dog, i'd be gone. gone gone gone. i'm too weak for this. my thoughts are like pages and pages of notes that got dumped in a river. i can't salvage them. it's noisy and dead silent at the same time. my head isn't throbbing but the emotional part is. there is no way out.
