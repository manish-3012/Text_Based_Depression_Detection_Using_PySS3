It feels so badI just want to escape my head. A few days ago, I was completely ready. I had two bottles of advil and one bottle of sleep aid and I was going to take it all, and I said my goodbyes, then the police showed up. They were very very sweet, kind men and talking to them made me feel so much better. They asked if I wanted to go to a mental hospital and I decided it would be best for me, but while I was there a psychiatrist decided I could go home. I really wish I wouldâ€™ve stayed. So now Iâ€™m here, stuck with my horrible fucking mind and every thought is a jab to my heart and it all feels horrible. Earlier I was standing on a stool with a belt around my neck, but I was afraid it would fail and I didnâ€™t jump. I wish I did. Nothing at all has made me feel better besides when I talked to those cops that night for some reason. They felt fatherly and comforting, but now theyâ€™re gone and Iâ€™m stuck with this shitty life. I just want to talk to them again. I didnâ€™t get any of their names. Iâ€™m so out of hope.
