I'm not worthless.I don't feel worthless, I can recognize mine and everyone else's value. I'm not underprivileged. My parents love me, and even support me. I have a goal in life. But for some reason, I can't stop thinking about suicide. It's not in a depressive way (except during late nights and lonely days), but in a sterile, logical way. I don't know why, but when contemplating about how my life is going to go, suicide is always at the forerunner of my mind. I make off-hand jokes about not making it to thirty with my friends, maybe to rid myself of the feeling, but it's disturbing. I don't want to die. But for whatever reason, I can't stop thinking that I'd rather be dead than continue living. I have every reason not to think this, but when absent-minded or not occupied I'll drift into thoughts about the best way to kill myself, the least messy, least painful, etc. Why? I want to live, but I'd rather die.
