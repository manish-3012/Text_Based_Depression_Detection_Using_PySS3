nothing is getting betterhonestly iâ€™m pretty much over all this every time i think iâ€™m getting better i just fall even deeper into this mess. i try to find something to live for and itâ€™s usually my dog then my messed up brain decided he wouldnâ€™t care either i think at this rate iâ€™ll have the courage to finally do this right. iâ€™m not sure why my minds like this at 16 but all i do know is iâ€™m done living and maybe it wonâ€™t be tonight but it will most definitely be before 2020.
