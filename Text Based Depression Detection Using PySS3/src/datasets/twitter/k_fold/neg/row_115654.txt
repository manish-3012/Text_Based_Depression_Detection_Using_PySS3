My Ties and Ends Pt. 1Hi again, I made one post here before. Iâ€™m brand new to reddit and I had no idea how raw it was. I learned somethings, grateful. I just turned 21 barely 3 months ago and I think it is my time to go. Iâ€™m buying the materials I need tonight... then eventually I will make my last post. Iâ€™ve had thoughts since I was about 10. But now, I just canâ€™t fight anymore, nothing is worth staying... so to be continued.
