SARS-CoV2Is it bad that I kind of want to just catch the virus already? I have a lot of health conditions and if I die from the virus, oh well it was tragic. Just get it over with. My odds are getting it are pretty high anyway, seeing that I live in the epicenter of the US outbreak and have to go out in public for work. 

Iâ€™m already a burden to everyone around me. Iâ€™m an inconvenience and my pain is over dramatic. I donâ€™t have the right to complain and donâ€™t want to annoy those around me by saying anything or accidentally letting on that something is up. The way I feel is disproportionate to the severity of my problems and I should be over it. Dying by COVID-19 would solve that, honestly. I donâ€™t really want to die, especially not from suffocation and pneumonia, but it feels inevitable right now.

Sorry for the rant. If you read to the end, have a good night and wash your hands. Maybe itâ€™ll end this thing sooner.
