How much longer can i take it?I'm slowly sinking back into bad habits again. I'm drinking more than I ever have before. I'm desperately trying to find drugs to numb the pain. I can't self harm anymore because if my parents find out they will send me back the mental hospital i was at. Things are getting bad again. My  thoughts are getting darker, my art is getting bloodier, My body is getting weaker and thinner. I'm slipping away, and it hurts So badly.

I don't have much of a choice. I've promised I won't try to kill myself again. But it hurts, I'm just going through the motions one painful step at a time. How much longer til I collapse? I'm sorry I'm just ranting I'm just scared. I want to die so badly I know that I would try again without any regrets. But I'm trying so hard for everyone else. 

I'm going to do it eventually. I'm only 15 and I'm so fucked up that I know there is no way I'll recover. My therapist gave up on me after 4 months of treatment. Life just isn't for me. But i Have to keep going...it's just idk how long I can do that. Help? How do I make life less miserable?
