Kinda scared to post here.Long time listener, first time caller, etc. Iâ€™ve been in a better place recently and on meds. But some stuff out of my control is happening and feels like Iâ€™m back at square one. Do you guys ever wish you could just be a robot? Like, just resigning yourself to reality and removing ambition/hope would alleviate the pain of coming to the same realization over and over again. Iâ€™m tired of feeling disappointed. Every time I try to get out of a dark place something plunges me back in, and hitting â€œrock bottomâ€ hurts the same every time.
