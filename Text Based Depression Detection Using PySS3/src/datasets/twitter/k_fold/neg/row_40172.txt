Seeing the lack of support for the people here has made me want to kill myself even more.The state of the world and the people in it is such that I don't really want to live among them anymore. 

Disease ravaging my body and weakening me more and more every day does not help alleviate that feeling either.

I have barely left the house in nearly two years and here I am, at rock bottom, about to beg Reddit to talk me out of killing myself.

I have two guns two arms lengths away from me right now and every single day, I get closer and closer to putting one of them to my head and pulling the trigger.

Now, I get here hoping for the humanity that is so sorely missing in my life to magically appear before me and bring me back from the brink. Instead, I see people stating their intentions with little to no reply and I can't help but think how foolish I was to think I would find different.

This is pointless. As pointless as life.  Good luck to those of you struggling. May you find some kind of peace.

I think I might walk outside and blow my brains out.
