I can tell when a character in a movie or TV show is about to commit suicidePeople seem to say that "they didn't see that happening". The reason they don't is they don't see all the prepatory signs. Like all of you, I know what it is like to be prepping for killing myself, and all the little in-betweens. For the most part, I have an easier time watching depictions of suicide than I did two years ago. Sometimes though, when a writer expertly lays out all the steps (emotional changes and physical decisions), I break down and cry.

Sometimes, the smallest clues that people miss can make me really morose. It can even be a look or physical gesture. A man who puts on a suit in his own living room after leaving out three meals for his cat. Stuff like that.
