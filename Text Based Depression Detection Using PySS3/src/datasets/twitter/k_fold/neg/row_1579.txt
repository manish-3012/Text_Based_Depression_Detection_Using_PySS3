I want to die but I still have hopePretty much what the title says. I've been thinking a lot about suicide but torn about whether I should do it. I keep telling myself that things will get better in the future. That I just need to hang on and have hope. That if I kill myself now, I'm being a quitter. But I know this isn't true. There are too many things holding me back. If things do get better, it may be years or decades from now. I can't wait that long. So I'm leaning towards suicide, but I'm also grieving for the life I won't ever have.
