Iâ€™ve had enough of lifeThis will probably get buried but I just had to get it off my chest.

Iâ€™m a 20 year old male from the UK, and Iâ€™ve had depression and suicidal thoughts for around 5 years. It started when my grandmother who raised me passed away just before my GCSE exams, this put me in a deep depression and I didnâ€™t revise for the exams at all which led to me failing nearly every single one. I went to college (UK college not university) but it got too much for me there and I dropped out. Ever since then, Iâ€™ve bounced between jobs and even though I work full time now, minimum wage isnâ€™t really something to brag about, I feel so fed up with how bad life is and just want to end it all. I have a ridiculous amount of insecurities, Iâ€™m noticeably skinny despite overeating every day and to top it off my hair is receding, Iâ€™ve been rejected by just about every girl Iâ€™ve ever tried to talk to which obviously doesnâ€™t help. All my friends seem to be going places and I just feel stuck in this endless cycle of depression. Iâ€™ve tried talking to people but it just makes me worse and I have been judged for it. At this point I donâ€™t see any other option than to just hang myself
