It feels inevitable at this point.20yr kiss-less virgin w/ a failure to launch

I just got out of a big fight w/ my mom (more of a big rant, I was silent w/ my head in my hand) about how I'm such a terrific failure, that I need to "grow up", how I'm so so selfish w/ how I expect everyone to cater to my needs, how I lack any and all ambition, etc. My dad is apparently angry w/ how I lack the desire to be at work, much less apply myself at it, and he's getting close to having me fired. Which, as I was told, the only reason I haven't been fired is b/c our boss was worried it would upset my dad. They're so sick of my useless shit they're 'done with it', alluding to kicking me out I think.

I didn't bother to argue back, or to even explain myself in any capacity. I know I won't be understood, I haven't been understood thus far, I can hear it every time I'm chastised like this. But hell, I may as well take a crack at it, if only to keep myself from going any crazier. 

I don't want or try to be this lifeless. I don't deny that I am this way, I just don't know what to do about it. I don't expect any one to cater to my needs or to take care of me at all. I know I don't show any ambition/try/apply myself at anything. I don't want to make my loved ones' lives harder for them. I don't want anything, I don't care about anything really. My day-to-day focus is to bring myself joy in the things that still can (friends, video games, tv, entertainment in general, etc). Outside of them, I feel such an utterly blank hole of pain and nothingness (and I hate to describe it in such an emo way, but I honestly can't describe it any other way). I really can't see past my need to seek happiness (even drowning myself in the things that bring it, however slightly). Like, I logically understand the world of possibilities of happiness and achievement in life, how advancing after a purpose can give your life purpose, I just can't functionally live in a reality like that (or I at least currently don't w/o any way of getting to one). I don't think I'm such a piece of shit, I'm just trying to get by. I want to get better some day (and I've tried, as hard as I can it feels. I've gone to therapy, tried to 'muddle' through it, but every attempt just feels like I'm lying to myself), but before I can even think of that I have to get by **now.**

All this is a moot point anyhow, as implied by my title. I've been dealing w/ whatever I have going on for almost half my life, but I've really declined the past year. I'm getting worse &amp; worse, w/ thoughts of suicide and really big eventful "down times" coming more and more frequent. After the whole reveal that I don't even have my work to help bring meaning to my life (I know it's not the only thing available), I'm running out of fewer and fewer reasons to live/exist/care about either. I feel fundamentally useless to the world. That's not to say I even enjoyed my job, I meant that I'm running out of reasons that were struggling to be worthwhile to begin with. 

With the rate at which things are progressing (the whole work thing can boil over soon), it wont be long till the literal entirety of my existence is that 'hole' of nothingness and pain, at which point the only way out I can figure is suicide. And frankly, the idea that I'm circling/spiraling down towards this inevitability, with no happy end in sight, scares the shit out of me. I know I have reasons to live, but I just can't 'see' them, if that makes any sense. They're no help, even if I can logically acknowledge them.

Sorry for the incoherent mess, I wish it made more sense. Maybe I am just full of shit, but why do I feel the genuine desire to kill myself to make it stop?
