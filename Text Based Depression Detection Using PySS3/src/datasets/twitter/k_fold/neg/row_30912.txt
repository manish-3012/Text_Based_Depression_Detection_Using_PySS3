I HATE BEING CONTROLLED!!!!F\*\*k desi parenting! Always controlling every aspect of my life for their benefit. For their wants! Everything is always for them! I want to be independent.  Get a job. Live on my own. Go to college. But noooooo despite being born American, according to my parents I have to obey them for the rest of my life and follow my goddamn anti human rights misogynist culture which is marrying who **they** choose and obeying that stranger for the rest of my life because God says so! I have no control. I never went to school properly. I'm not allowed to travel alone to the point that I can't navigate the streets well. They keep all my documents that I have right to know such as my SSN, passport, birth certificate etc away from me locked up somewhere despite me being an adult. I don't know my own SSN wtf! I can't even ask them anything because they instilled fear in me that they'll beat me and scream if I ask them anything as outrageous as independence. I'm stuck home with my abusive mom 24/7 most of my life. They verbally, emotionally, mentally and physically abused me my whole life but I don't have a way out. I feel like I don't have solid proof for law enforcement to take me seriously because I'm "just a sheltered young women living with her parents in the suburbs". I have nothing to myself. I just want to die so I can get away from all this.
