My boyfriend wants to commit suicideHi r/suicidewatch,
I need your help with a complicated situation, and I don't know what to do.

 I'm 20y.o., and I was in a magic relashionship for 3 years. It was the first relashionship for both of us but one year ago the problems began. It was not matching anymore. It seemed like he had stopped carring about the relationship. I got unsatisfied and I tried to end the relationship multiple times, but he couldn't accept it. He got really histerical at times and it made things so much more complicated but I still care for him and tried not to hurt him but was not strong enough to ultimately make it clear to him that the relationship was over. He started to get really obsessed and followed me around a lot. For him we were still together but I was stuggeling a lot and tried to move on.
So I got into another relationship and he did know nothing about it. I felt already really bad about it at the time but I was simply not strong enough and I hoped the relationship would give me the strengh to finally break up with him. He got more and more obsessed and eventually found out about the other relationship. He started to threaten of killing himself and tried many times in front of me but it looked like he was not getting beyond the point where I was still able to stop him. He categorrately refuses to see a psycologist because he doesn't want any help. He says he just wants to die so why shall he ask for help from a specialistÂ ?
Finally I had to leave for my studies and he couldn't follow me for financial reasons, and had  to stay in France were we both are from. He is currently just spending his time in his bedroom and doesn't want to see anyone or to go out a bit. His family doesn't seem to understand how serious the situation is. He hacked all my accounts and I cannot talk to anyone without him questionning to whom I was talking and forbids that I talk to other people than him. Everytime we call he just tells me again how sad he is because of me and that he is only waiting for death to find back the old Â«Â meÂ Â» that is dead to him.
I have heavy regrets about this whole situation and I know how horrible my mitakes were. I feel I'm going mad too, because of how I distroyed him and our beautiful relationship.
I really am looking forward to your ideas about how I can help him to get some professionnal help, and getting out of this situation.
