I am a horrible and limited creature.Everyday I awaken with the same thought, nothing I do will ever been seen in the same way I see it myself. Every step I take is repulsing to another individual. Everyone shoves and pushes and bites. Life is this conundrum of chaos. I used to love art and music but all is repulsed by me there as well. My femaleness and the attachment of being silent, talent-less, and useless hinders me. they just want a sexual display. there is nothing for anyone here. it's all just moderated by someone else greater than you who created normative ideals. music is the only thing keeping me alive but now it's just an embarrassing horrifying mess of sound. We're just water and carbon, salt, and phosphorus spinning in a massive void. i can never be who i am and neither can you. we are nothing. the best thing for man is to die soon.
