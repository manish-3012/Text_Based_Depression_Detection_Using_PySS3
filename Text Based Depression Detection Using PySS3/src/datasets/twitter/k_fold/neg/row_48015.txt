I think I am dyingIt really feels like it. I feel like I'm getting weaker with each week. I've noticed small red spots around my body and I've been experiencing a lot of pain in my chest and stomach too. I've also been experiencing voices in my head that tell me i'm sick and that i'm going to die. I believe it's caused by stress since i've been getting very anxious over a harassment campaign against me that has been going on for months. I think my body is breaking down and I don't care anymore. If i feel I'm on the breaking line I have a good way out, at least. I feel comfort in that thought more and more.  


Sorry for the rant.
