Seeing beyond the dark tunnelIâ€™ve been feeling like I need to disappear

Like Iâ€™m not worth living anymore

I feel like trash

It started with a breakup, but that triggered my own childhood issues. Not I literally sit here constantly thinking how life is easier for everyone if I wasnâ€™t such a burden.
