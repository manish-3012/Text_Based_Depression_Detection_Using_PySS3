Will They Ever Stop Hating You For Getting Help?Mods, let me know if this isn't proper in this sub, I'll do my best.

My girlfriend of 3 years told me she's suicidal last night. She said that tonight would be the night. I didn't really know what to do at this point, we had been talking for 4 hours now over the phone, so I texted her sister (GF still lives with parents) and my GF was taken to hospital. She is very upset with me, which I understand, I won't hold anything against her. She's blaming me for stuff I had no control in and has been berating me every time I've tried talking with her today. I'm not trustworthy anymore according to her. I would be lying if I said it didn't hurt a lot. For now, I am trying to look on the bright side, she is being taken care of now and her family who has never been a big fan of me now seem to see me in a better light. I apologise if this is word soup, I'm having trouble focusing right now. Thank you for reading.
