The world isn't worth living in anyway. I don't see why it would matter if I killed myselfI've been more and more disillusioned with life and the world as I've gotten older and now at only 21 I already feel like none of this is worth it. Humans are only motivated by selfishness, sex and greed. Nothing else. This world won't be saved; we'll not only destroy our species (which itself would be great) but also our planet with climate change, all so some billionaires can wring out any last bit of cash they can.

The world is burning. Our society is collapsing, the poor suffer and die agonizing deaths constantly and nobody gives a shit. Everyone's great at making it seem like they care about other people and the planet but that's as far as it goes. They need it to seem like they care about more than just themselves.

As I get older now this world will only get worse and worse and worse. I don't understand why I need to stick around for it other than to be a cog in the machine. I think misanthropy, nihilism, depression and even suicide are just natural reactions to our fucked up world. I don't blame anyone who commits suicide. It makes too much sense.
