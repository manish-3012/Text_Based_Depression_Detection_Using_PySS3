It didnâ€™t work and Iâ€™m so dumbI have never posted anything on reddit (just lurking) so sorry if I mess it up. Donâ€™t know where else to go honestly. 
I took an impulsive overdose of venlafaxine yesterday. I donâ€™t recommend it. I took a very large overdose and became really sick really quickly. It was actually horrific. Realised that wasnâ€™t the way I wanted to go out and managed to call an ambulance. 

Iâ€™ve spent the past two days in hospital feeling like pure crap. Turns out thereâ€™s no â€œantidoteâ€ to venlafaxine and they just have to let it work itâ€™s way out of your system without letting it kill you. I felt like a right idiot being in intensive care with a failed overdose during a pandemic. I have never felt that sick before though, I was actually wishing for death more than usual 

Iâ€™m home now but I still canâ€™t stop twitching, my head feels like itâ€™s been run over by a truck and I havenâ€™t been able to keep anything down since I took the pills. My pupils still look like dinner plates and it hurts like hell to look at anything bright. Everything just kinda hurts. 

Nobody knows that I did it, other than the doctors, so Iâ€™m trying to take care of myself. It just kinda sucks and I have no one to blame but me. Canâ€™t even bloody kill myself right
I donâ€™t know, I guess itâ€™s a warning to anyone who impulsively decides to take an overdose like I did... I would not ever want to repeat that experience. Apparently I still have the withdrawals to look forward to. Donâ€™t be dumb like me.
