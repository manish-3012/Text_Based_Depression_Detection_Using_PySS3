Don't know what to do, am scaredHonestly, I'm tired, I don't know how to ask for help.  
I can barely pay for my meds, and then I can barely gather enough energy to go and work the only part time job I could find, which allows me in return to barely live.  
I feel bad for my previous relationships and I think about my ex all day, I was too dependent on her and now that I'm alone I don't know how to take care of myself.  
Every day I can feel my mind slipping a little bit more, I can't afford to pay for anything that helps me be it a new therapist or something to keep me busy.  
Every day I feel scared of myself, scared of what I may do, and I don't know how to cope with that feeling.  
I need to talk about this but I don't know how, I just want to leave this country and start over or have fucking amnesia.  
I hate myself and I can't help it, I can't feel anything but disgust for myself, for how weak and shitty I am.  
I just want to feel better, but I don't think I can.
