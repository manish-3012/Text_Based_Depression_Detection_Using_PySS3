I don't know how to feel okayWith the new year coming around, and my birthday in a few days, I've been thinking a lot about my life. Lately I've been feeling a lot. And I mean a lot. I go on a rollercoaster of emotions in just an hour, but in the end I seem to always come back to thinking bad thoughts.

I think about suicide and self harm and all of that. Lately I've also been pretty out of touch with the things going on around me, lost in my own head, and it hasn't been good for me. At this point I just feel and feel, and think too much for my own good. My anxiety kicks in and I end up getting suicidal. 

I've been dealing with this for a while, so I notice the pattern of myself starting to get better, but crashing dramatically after a bit. I'm starting to crash again, and I'm not sure how to cope. Each time, life hits harder than before. I'm about 8 months clean from self harm, and I've been trying so hard to keep this streak up, as it's the longest I've ever gone, and I'm scared that I'll end up hurting myself and then killing myself from guilt and overwhelming feeling after.

I don't know how to be or feel okay, and it's taking a toll on me worse than ever.
