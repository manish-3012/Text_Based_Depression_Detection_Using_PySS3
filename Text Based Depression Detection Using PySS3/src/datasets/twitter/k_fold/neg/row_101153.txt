I don't want to be a burden anymore.I'm absolutely sick and tired of being who I am. I'm a burden to everyone around me. I'm 18, have no job, no girlfriend, no real friends, nothing except writing and my computer. All I do is just eat my family's food, use their electricity, and just leech off them. Every day is exactly the same as the last. Wake up, play games, eat, go to sleep. I don't want to go outside at all. There's nothing that interests me outside. I just wanna go to sleep and die.

I have nightmares all the time, each one vivid and frightening. I wake up screaming from them sometimes. I have severe depression, and i'm worried that soon I might become a schizo because my father was one. He's also a deadbeat druggie like me, though i'm not as bad as him, yet. I'd at least like to kick his ass before I die to thank him for being such a good father and leaving me and my mom when I was a baby.

Also, no woman alive wants me, I mean I understand, i'm a worthless mess. I guess they can smell the loser past the perfume. I like to think I do a good job of hiding how dysfunctional I am. Most people think i'm distant, and I like it that way. The less they know, the better.

Another thing that bothers me is how much of a waste of space I am. Me killing myself would be a blessing to my family. My mom can barely afford her own meds for her diabetes, and then she has to buy mine as well. I feel so bad that she has to pay for them, but I can't find a job anywhere to help her.  Whenever I don't take my meds I can barely get out of bed.

I just wanna die. Nothing is worth the struggle anymore. There' no hope. Everything is just black. I just wanna chug my pills and sleep in peace. I already tried once and failed, but maybe second times the charm, eh? 

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to vent. Thanks if you listened. It means a lot to know that someone cared enough to read.
