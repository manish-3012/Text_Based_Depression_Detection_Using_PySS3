True lonelinessMy mental illness got worse (bipolar and depression) and it made me lose some friends. Iâ€™m living alone with my cat, and I have a girlfriend who lives at the other side of the world. Sheâ€™s amazing, I think sheâ€™ll be the last person I think of before I die. I have 2 years left in this shithole of a city, alone because Iâ€™m studying abroad. I have never felt true loneliness until 2018 happened. I guess I need to be patient for a while before I can die in peace.
