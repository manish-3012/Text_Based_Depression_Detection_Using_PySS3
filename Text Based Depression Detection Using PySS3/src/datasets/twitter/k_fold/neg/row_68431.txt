Dont want to try anymore, thinking about it within a week.Tired of it. Nothing works to fix the issue. As somebody once said, hope is just awaiting disappointment. For what? I too am alone in a room full of my favorite people and feel like I'm in some dream world where nothing is real. How am I to bare anything else when I couldn't even bare my own life? Tired of trying.
