I can't stand living here anymoreI'm stuck with my goddamn father. He's so so fucking abusive. He did so much shit to me that I don't even have the energy to express right now. And he still acts like I'm his little fucking plaything. 

Like I'm 18 fucking years old and I still can't tell him not to abuse his fucking dogs close to death over going in the goddamn kitchen. 

I'm constantly afraid of him. Every little twitch of anger from him throws me back to feeling like a little kid again. Subjugated. I can't fucking stand it anymore but I can't move out, I can't run away. I have no options but to just sit here and endure it.

Now the dog has a fucking limp. His hip probably broken. And I've gone and pissed off the one person I can talk to about it. 

I'm just going to drink his fucking beer and do something stupid.
