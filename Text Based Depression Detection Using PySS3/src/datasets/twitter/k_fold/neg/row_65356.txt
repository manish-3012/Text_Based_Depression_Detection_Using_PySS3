I want to die, but Iâ€™m too worried about the aftermath for my loved ones.Iâ€™m (24F) extremely depressed and have been for years upon years. (Probably 10 years). At this point, Iâ€™m really just done with suffering. I donâ€™t believe in any sort of afterlife and really struggle with the fact that human life is so insignificant. Apart from that, I am just so deeply, painfully sad. I really want to end it all, but I canâ€™t because of my boyfriend and my family. I wish I could literally disintegrate into thin air so no one would have to deal with the aftermath of it all. I donâ€™t want to negatively affect the rest of my boyfriends life, I love him and I want him to be happy. My mother, it would tear her to pieces. And my father, well it might push him over the edge with his already existing drug problem. My younger sister would have to live with the fact that her older sister killed herself. So Iâ€™m fucking living my pathetic life for others. I feel nothing anymore but sadness. Itâ€™s either Iâ€™m numb or Iâ€™m physically ill from the sadness. Iâ€™m exhausted. People say that not killing yourself for others is just your brains way of keeping you alive, but I donâ€™t feel that way at all. Iâ€™m suffering. I want it to end. I can still want it to end, yet simultaneously care and worry for my loved ones lives without me. Fuuuuck I hate this
