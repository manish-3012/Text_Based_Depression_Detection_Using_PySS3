GullibleYeah, that's kinda how I feel.

&amp;#x200B;

So, first thing's first. I'm the weird kid. Just a little off in the head and stuff, so not many friends. Two, as a matter of fact. Well, one now, but I'm getting to that.

There's was my best friend, and then my boyfriend. That's it, besides my cats. I had a deep trust and connection with them both. At least I thought. My best friend decided to inform me that she'd been living a double life. There was the one I saw, and then the other life. A very bad and immoral life. One that went against everything she told me that she was. And that that was the life she's decided to live.

It hurts. I've lost her. I'm mad at her for choosing that life, but also scared for her sake. In the end tho, she's old enough to make her own decisions. I just feel betrayed. Empty. And yes, gullible. Gullible for never even suspecting this. It makes me wonder what else I've missed.

I  just wanna quit tho. I wanna quit life. If I knew that it wouldn't break my bf, I would. I want to scream, I want to cry, and I want to vomit all the time. As many times as I've had people ditch me like this, you'd think that I'd get over it easier. Guess not.
