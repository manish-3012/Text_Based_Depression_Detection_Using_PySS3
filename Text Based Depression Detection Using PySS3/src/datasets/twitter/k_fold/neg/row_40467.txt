15, 0 friends, obese and just ruined my education.Here it goes, im obese, i literally have 0 friends except a few girls and a few friends i talk to on the internet who are from my class or somewhere else, i barely go outside and i just ruined my education and probably wont even get into  highschool, although i was already accepted, i fucked up one of my courses and probably will have to redo it which means i will not get my "middle education" thingy before summer work, we have a system of Middleschool ( grade 1-9 ) and highschool (10-12) where i live, just to clarify. And it's too late to apply to anywhere else, im in shame infront of everyone i know and nothing to do, i completely hate myself
