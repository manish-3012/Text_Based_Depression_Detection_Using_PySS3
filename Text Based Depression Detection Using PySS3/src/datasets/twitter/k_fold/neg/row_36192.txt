i genuinely canâ€™t take it anymorei really just canâ€™t all i want is to be cared about. but whenever i talk about my issues i just get a â€œdamnâ€ or i get ignored or i get an â€œokayâ€. iâ€™m clearly struggling and it could have been helped if they showed they cared. all i wanted to here was â€œwhatâ€™s wrongâ€ or â€œare you okâ€. at the time of my death i didnâ€™t want much more. iâ€™m writing this right before i slit my wrist and thereâ€™s nothing anyone can do that will stop me. by the time you read this i would have already been done. i didnâ€™t need them to love me just to care at least a little bit or show it. just a bit when i needed it most. i fucking pretty much begged for it with my actions. the drugs,the self harm,the OD atemps,the losing a bunch of weight. all to here the words â€œare you okay?â€
