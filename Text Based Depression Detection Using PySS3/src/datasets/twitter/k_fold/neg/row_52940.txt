I've set a dateThe 20th of October. If things haven't improved by the 20th of October I'm fucking killing myself. I'm going to leave a note, head into town and throw myself off a bridge. At this point I don't care about anything or anyone. I know it won't be pleasant, but at least I won't have to suffer any more. I've started hearing voices again and I just want it to end. The only thing I'm afraid of is surviving.
