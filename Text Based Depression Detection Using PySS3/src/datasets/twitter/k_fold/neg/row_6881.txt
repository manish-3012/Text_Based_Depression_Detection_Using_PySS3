Not Sure If This CountsSo recently I have been doing these things. I don't think of suicide, I don't think I want to kill myself but I keep doing these things. I have gotten a feeling of wanting to get hit by a car, like I see a car going somewhat fast and I continue walking, in hopes of getting hit I think. 

I don't wear seatbelts and constantly think of flying through the windshield. I put myself in situations where something bad may possibly happen to me and I am curious if this counts as suicidal thoughts. 

Thanks for the help in advance. I am worried for myself and people around me and if I should get help or not.
