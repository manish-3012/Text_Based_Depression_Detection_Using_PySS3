Why cant I just be normalThere is no way I can do the things I really love to do because of my physical conditions I cant socialise, people stare at me all the time, because I look different. My head is stiff so I cant move properly to look at people when they at least try to talk to me. I donâ€™t have a girlfriend, Iâ€™m getting depressed of just thinking of how many times I tried. I feel there is no hope, that my live is full of limitations and not possibilities.

Im just alone 24/7, I canâ€™t even pull me together to do simple stuff no more. People sometimes Give me weird faces just when I try to interact with them. I canâ€™t really work anymore, I fail all the time.

Anger and frustration has started to come slowly, And I am just wondering why I should have a life like this. Why not just disappear, then all the problems would be gone. The thought of it makes my stummack not hurting.

Live is simply not fun any more.   
I know deep down that I will not die of age, probably loneliness or an accidentâ€¦
