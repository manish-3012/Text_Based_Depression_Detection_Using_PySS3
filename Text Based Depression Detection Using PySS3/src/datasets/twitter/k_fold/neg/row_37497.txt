I had been good for a yearAnd hadnt let depression or anxiety rule my life. But now. I just fucking hate my life. I have kids and a SO but he doesn't care. I'm pretty sure he's a sociopath and would only say he cares and act offended over the fact that I said he doesn't care. But I know he doesn't. He's cheated, and worse, and just acts like he doesn't care. Never says loving things, never makes an effort to make me feel loved and appreciated. I want to die so bad. I hate being trapped in this life. I have kids though. I can't leave them.  But I've never in my life wanted to die as much as I have lately. I have no time for therapy. I have one friend and no family that can help or really cares. I wish I had no kids just so I could kill myself and die without worry. It seems like several times a day I just picture and fantasize over slipping to death. And it seems amazing. I'm sure there would be regret as I'm dying but at the same time there would be relief. Relief over the pain I'd no longer have to feel. Relief over the anxiety and worries. 

I would never hurt my kids. I love them. The only reason I haven't hurt myself is because I don't want to leave them without their mother. But god I fucking hate my life.
