Another pleaMonday was horrific, it is now 3am Tuesday, dreading work, out of meds, I canâ€™t do this. Yesterday I was shaking, I had a panic attack, I want to quit. I need to quit, I canâ€™t handle customer service anymore, but I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m so scared I walk closer and closer to death, suicide, planning, I need help.

There is no help, Iâ€™m trapped here, Iâ€™m stuck here and the only way out is to end my life. Iâ€™m so scared, I just wish it was so hard, I am so tired of suffering, Iâ€™m tired of being so anxious all the time, Iâ€™m tired of being unhappy but Iâ€™m so trapped Iâ€™m trapped and scared.

The only way out is to sleep forever.
