Not suicidal...yetLet me start by telling you that if you are here to stop a suicide, don't waste your time. I'm not going to kill myself. But I very commonly post in this subreddit offering help and advice, and I know how warm the community can be.

I don't know why I don't want to live any more. I am a semester away from graduating with a degree and enough experience to get a job right off of the bat (or close enough).

I have a pseudo-girlfriend. She doesn't want to be my girlfriend for a variety of reasons, although we have been best friends since first grade and have been hooking up/going on dates/etc since my birthday last April. We live about six hours away and as much as we try to see each other, it's never enough. She wants to move here after I graduate but I don't want to support her unless she is my girlfriend, which is a leap I'm afraid she will never take.

I just can't shake this feeling of no self-worth. I'm a hefty guy, and I know that it influences her decision to not be my boyfriend even if she vehemently denies that. I've never had a serious girlfriend and that's another thing that upsets her. She always tries to cheer me up but doesn't understand that her refusing to make a commitment to me tears me up more than anything she could ever to do hurt me. I feel like she's waiting for something better to come along, and to be honest I can't blame her.

Objectively, I know that I'm a "good catch." I'm funny, people laugh at my jokes. I'm a sweet and charming guy, but that never seems to translate into success with women. Moreover, even though I "know" those things about myself, I don't believe them. Does anyone have any resources or solutions for that?
