done all my prep, just waiting until everyone is asleep.i think this may be my last post before i die ?

itâ€™s hard and hurts and i cry so hard i almost throw up and when i get anxious i canâ€™t even breathe 

iâ€™ve printed out my letter

cancelled subscriptions 

cleared out some storage

given my passwords on my note 

scheduled emails to send my final notes to my friends 

sent gratitude and positivity messages to all my friends 

i tried to be cheerful today, i donâ€™t want them to remember me sadly 

i canâ€™t take it anymore 

please just end it all for me
