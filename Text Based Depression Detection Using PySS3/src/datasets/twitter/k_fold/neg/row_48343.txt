This is a long oneIâ€™m in my early 30â€™s and over $30,000 in student loan and tax debt, not to mention the $11,000 I owe my mom for a horribly failed apprenticeship and parent plus student loans for my previous education that she canâ€™t afford to pay off because she wants to move to Florida and retire.  Sheâ€™s disappointed in the person Iâ€™ve become. Iâ€™m living paycheck to paycheck and right now and I have $120 to my name. I might be homeless in 2 months. I canâ€™t stand to be sober. Iâ€™m eating potato chips for dinner tonight so I can make it through till my next paycheck. My family has pretty much written me off and my only friend is verbally abusive and I put up with it because I literally have no one else. Iâ€™ve mentioned a couple times to him how Iâ€™m feeling suicidal. He doesnâ€™t seem to care. Every relationship Iâ€™ve been in has failed miserably at my own hands. I have debilitating anxiety and panic attacks that Iâ€™ve been unsuccessfully trying to treat for over 10 years. Iâ€™m 90% sure I have a milder form of autism or ADHD that nobody addressed in my childhood and no health insurance now to get any sort of diagnosis/treatment. I have no clean underwear and Iâ€™m not even able to afford to do my god damn laundry. I stink to high heaven but I donâ€™t have the energy or motivation to shower. Whatâ€™s the point anyway. All of this is my own fault. Itâ€™s rough. Dying seems so much easier than living. Iâ€™m ready to leave, but incapable of choosing a way to go. Every decision Iâ€™ve ever made in my adult life has been a bad one. And god forbid I try and fail. I canâ€™t fail. I need the one smart decision I ever make to be how to die. How fucked up is that? If anything I hope this post makes at least a few of you feel better about your situations. That would make me happy. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be here much longer. I tried my best but it was just never good enough. And bless your heart if youâ€™ve read this whole thing.
