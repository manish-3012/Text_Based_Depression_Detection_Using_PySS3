Today is the dayJust in case my note isnâ€™t found I took my passcode off the ph. There will be a voice memo on it only one I just downloaded the app. I donâ€™t want help or support to find help.
We want to die.
Our DID collective lost our host and none of us can cope anymore. Itâ€™s too much. We want peace from an abomination of this
Life and eternal suffering. We. Donâ€™t. Care. Anymore.
We donâ€™t have anything left to lose. This will kill us. And we are relieved.
