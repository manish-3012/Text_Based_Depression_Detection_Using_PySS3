I've had enoughSo I'm a forever alone who lives with his rich parents and apparently girls don't like guys who don't have jobs and live with their parents.  Basically I have three choices:  1.  stay alone in my parents' basement reading books, ect and feel terrible occasionally like now.  2.  Get a job somehow and even this isn't a guarantee I'll get someone.  and of course 3. Kill myself.

I talked to a girl for the first time in about a year and misinterpreted her friendliness for flirting and asked her out.  Of course she said "no" and just went on and on about all of the things wrong with me like being lazy and stuff like that.  It seems like it would be impossible for me to find a girl who likes me for who I am.  I don't want to lay awake at night pining for someone.  I don't want to wake up early and go to some stupid job either.  I just want to be dead and be done with this whole mess.
