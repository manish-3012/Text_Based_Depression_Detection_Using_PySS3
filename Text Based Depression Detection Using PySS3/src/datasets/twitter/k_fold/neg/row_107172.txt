called a hotline today and chickened outthey asked â€œdo you want to talk about somethingâ€ and i said â€œthis is a bad ideaâ€ and hung up like a giant dweeb. i donâ€™t know how to frame how i feel anymore besides i want to die. i canâ€™t explain it as a specific Something to talk about when it feels like itâ€™s been my whole entire life. it makes me feel like iâ€™ll never really be able to reach out the way i see that other people can. not to mention the all-consuming anxiety of having the other person waiting for me to articulate my feelings in a way they can understand. im sure a lot of this pressure is imagined but itâ€™s still there. i canâ€™t stand having this sadness inside of me with no real gratifying way to drain it out.
