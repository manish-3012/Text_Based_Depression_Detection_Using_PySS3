i'm just tiredno throwaway because it's not like anyone knows me or cares. i don't want to live any more, i'm just tired of life. my parents are getting divorced and i have to be a rock for my little brother, and i just cant do it. im a closet atheist but my parents are very religous, my entire family would disown me if i was atheist. being forced to pray for forgiveness from a god you dont believe in is numbing. my dad's cheating on my mum, and he just recently got a job, if they file divorce papers and my mum lists that he's been cheating then he's going to be jailed. i don't know if i want that or not. i'm only 16, i've got IB to deal with, everyone expects me to pull a 4.0 gpa and deal with this but i can't. i dont know if i want to live any more.
