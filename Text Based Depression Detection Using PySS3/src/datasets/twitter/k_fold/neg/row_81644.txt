I really wish people would stop trying to encourage me to improve myselfSeriously, can people stop telling me I'm worth it? Words cannot describe how angry it makes me when someone tells me to "work on myself" or "love yourself" or "be positive." Seriously, words cannot describe how damn pointless it would be to try any of these things. The amount of effort and work it would take to "improve myself" is so pointless and not worth it that I really wish people would just agree with me and say "yeah, you're fucked beyond repair." Why is everyone so damn hellbent on trying to make believe I should fix myself, or that I'm worth something? What in the flying fuck do you see in me that I don't? I'm dead serious, I literally can't see it. The idea that I'm worth the effort of fixing or "improving" is unthinkable to me, like I actually cannot conceive of that. Why can't everyone just agree with me and admit that I'm worthless? Why do people even bother trying to prove me wrong? I just don't understand! I'm a fucking awful person and I hate myself and I wish I died a long time ago. I'm a lost cause, now please stop making me prove it!
