Everything feels so dark now (sexuality and gender issue)I am 26, and over the last couple months, it seems I have lost what was once a sky high, almost obsessive level (for example, I have a folder of over 1,000 photos of women, ranging from women in porn, on TV, and ones I know in real life, which I would often pleasure myself with) of attraction to women, and in its place, gained a small degree of attraction to males (At least I think so, I notice them a little more I think, but none of them have caused me to feel aroused in the same way women did), as well as gender confusion. Feeling like I lost that attraction has taken a toll on me, as it's one of the things I enjoyed most. I would always fixate on women in some form or another, usually sexual thoughts about them, romantic ones, and the occasional fantasy of being one, which I will go to again later.

This began after a chat in a fetish chat room, involving a gender change fetish. I had for the last few years, had sexual fantasies about being various attractive women. In regards to that chat, one user told me my attraction to women is envy, and that's why I am so obsessed with them, basically saying I want to be one myself. Ever since then, it seems my attraction to women has disappeared, and a mild attraction, or so I think, to males has popped up. Prior to this, I had actually been getting more confident with women, for the first time in my life. Also, I feel intensely depressed, and a strange sense of depersonalization, like my identity is gone. On the topic of gender, for the last few years, I had also taken a big interest in trans issues, trans timelines, the lives of women who transitioned, and was doing things like looking the effects of HRT, sometimes obsessively. I also a few times engaged in a chat on the random chat site, Omegle, stating I was female, but in a completely non-sexualized conversation. Some of this makes me wonder if what I thought was a fetish might be something more, that and the idea of living as a woman doesn't bother me. Also, the range of women I imagined myself as expanded over time, starting as the hottest ones, then going to more average ones. As for the sexuality aspect, in those fantasies, I would imagine myself in straight scenarios, lesbian, and sometimes, even non-sexual ones, the last of those being kind of telling. I sometimes wonder if this depression I feel isn't really a form of gender dysphoria. I didn't seem to have any noticeable signs as a child of being trans, but being told that I envy women and want to be one seems to have triggered something in me, also, me not feeling anything wrong with the idea of living as a woman is also suggestive. Currently, I don't know if this is a gender or sexuality issue at its core, but regardless, it has me feeling my lowest, and at times, I get thoughts of just ending it all, or wishing I wouldn't wake up. This is my lowest point ever, by far.
