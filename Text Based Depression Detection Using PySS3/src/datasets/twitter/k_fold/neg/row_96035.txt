AloneJust got dumped by my fiance just as we were starting to really plain out joining our lives together. We had been planing this for 3 and a half years. 
I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time but this relationship was the first thing that made me feel hope and motivation and any sense that I would have a chance for a happy future. I was improving and starting to develop some feelings of self worth. Now I am far worse off emotionally than I was before we were together. 
I dont believe that there is anyone out there who would be willing to put up with the broken person that I am. 
I dont care about myself enough to try anymore and no one is going to want to be with me me until I improve. 
So I'm stuck, until I feel loved I will never try to improve and no one would ever want me in my current state. I don't think I can be happy alone.
Why should I keep living and suffering when there is no chance for happiness?
I cant keep living just because my family will miss me, I cant keep feeling this pain anymore. I can't stand waking up knowing this is my life now.
