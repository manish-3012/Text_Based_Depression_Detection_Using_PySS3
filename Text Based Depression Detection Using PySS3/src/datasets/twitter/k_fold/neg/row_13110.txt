Im about to give upI used to be on here. My last girl broke up with me a year ago and I was planning on taking my life. But 2 weeks later I met the girl I thought I loved. Then she just left me a week ago and took back everything she ever said. I'm a freshman in college. I figured that without her I could party and meet new people but no one will let me into one. I sit in my room and contemplate how to kill my self. I don't want to live in a world of back stabbed and douche bags. I'm sick of false hope. I just don't know how to do it. My parents are gone for the weekend, I will take a train home, and start the car in the garage. I'm done- I did my best
