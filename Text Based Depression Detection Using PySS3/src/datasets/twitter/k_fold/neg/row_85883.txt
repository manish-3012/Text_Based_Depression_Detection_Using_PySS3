Iâ€™ve wanted to die since 7th gradeMy parents know Iâ€™m depressed but not how bad. The world is choking me, and my matter of fact logic isnâ€™t helping me explain myself.
Ex: I wonâ€™t cut myself because I donâ€™t have anything to cut with. 
Does anyone else relate to this and how did you explain it to your parents?
