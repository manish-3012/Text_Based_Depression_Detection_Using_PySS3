its so hard to wake up everyday and be aliveSorry that this is really roundabout and confusing. one of my first posts ever.

I've been depressed and had GAD and SAD for about a year now. I've been cutting but then my mom found out and took my blades away. That was in October and since then I've pretty much been fucked up. Everything has gotten worse and my mom and sister and dad actually care about me. I sorta wish they wouldn't because it just makes everything more complicated and harder to just go away and do fucked up things by myself. I honestly want to get better, but its so hard to be alive. I just want to give up and die rn and i just want to go away. Today my mom said that she found a therapist whos available and she wanted to go see her, but i didn't feel really ready so i begged her not to go. basically we fought and she ended up crying and i started to have a panic attack. side note- i have panic attacks about every other day. i don't know what to do. i feel like going to therapy rn isn't going to help because im not ready or motivated. I just wish everything would go away and i could die in piece idk. this is basically just a rant im sorry. this is really bad and i don't even know what i wrote or why i wrote it. basically i guess just give some words of hope please? if you could, i would really really appreciate it. also, i dont care a shit about those stupid sayings like "suicide is a fucking permanent solution to a temporary problem." or "there is always hope' or "suicide just passes the sorrow onto others". thanks for reading i guess. i'm sorry to bother you.
