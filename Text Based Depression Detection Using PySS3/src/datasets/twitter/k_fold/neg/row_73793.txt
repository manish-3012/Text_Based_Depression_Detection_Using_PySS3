This is not my journey.This journey is not my own. It is the journey of so many others for whom I am but a small part.  I sense my time is nearly done. I know I have failed you in so many ways, so many times. And I know I have not given you nearly my best. I have procrastinated, slept, cheated and indulged most lustful desires. I am gluttonous and unworthy of your respect or admiration. I am grateful for the blessings you have bestowed upon me and my family.  I donâ€™t know when or how, but I know I wonâ€™t be abusing the privilege you have wasted on me for so long.  Thank you - Sincerely - Thank you for all that you have given me. Forgive me please for being so umworthy. May God have mercy on my soul.
