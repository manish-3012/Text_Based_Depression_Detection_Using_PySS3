LostI donâ€™t know what to do anymore. My anxiety and depression make existing a battle. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because of my dog.


My boyfriend makes it all worse. He just always tells me Iâ€™m doing this wrong, not doing enough of that, etc. Iâ€™ve been controlled in some form, by everyone in my life. 



I just want to be free. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to by staying alive. Iâ€™m tired of being miserable, of having nothing worth living for. 


I want to die but Iâ€™m scared.
