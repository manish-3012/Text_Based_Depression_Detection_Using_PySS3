no courageSo I've been planning on committing for so long. I've been depressed for over 2.5 years now (but not diagnosed cuz my parents dont allow me to, so I guess it doesn't matter anyways) and have come to the conclusion that the best way for me would be hanging. The first rope I bought in winter 2018 I think but the first time I brought it home (I'm in a dorm during the week) I forgot to hide it, so my mum found it in my schoolbag but didn't talk to me abt it, I just never saw it again after that. The second one I bought like one or two months after that n since then I basically plan on every goddamn weekend. And I just find myself crying on my bed at 3am, reminded of how much of a baby I am. One time I tried to hang myself in the bathroom in the middle of the day, but as I felt the noose around my neck, I could hear my parents talking in the kitchen and I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't let them find me this way. 

The second more or less real attempt happened just an hour prior. Both my parents were and still are not at home. I got everything set up in my room. I stood on the chair. I just had to kick it away, that's all that it would've taken. I chickened out again. Everytime. Now I gotta embrace at least another week of failing. Disappointing anyone. I fucking hate all of this. I can't do this anymore but I'm also too much of a coward to off myself. I don't know how to progress. Maybe some of you have some advice or... anyhting, really
