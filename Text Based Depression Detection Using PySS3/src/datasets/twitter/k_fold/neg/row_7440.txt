I genuinely wish I had the strength to kill myselfIâ€™ve never wanted to end my life as much as I do now. I donâ€™t believe that anyone loves me enough for me to even consider continuing to live in misery but Iâ€™m just scared. Iâ€™m scared of death. I keep telling myself everything is going to be okay as long as I keep living but here we go again. Iâ€™m at this point where nothing makes me want to be alive. My life has barely even started and I want to end it. I really canâ€™t take it. I canâ€™t take all the sadness and anger. I canâ€™t take all the exhaustion and all the stress. I canâ€™t stand all the issues I have. I just want to be good at something. I want something to just make me happy. I have absolutely never been at such a low point. My anxiety is growing. My stomachaches because of it are coming back. Iâ€™m trying to starve myself again. Everything bad is coming back but worse. My insecurities wonâ€™t go away. I can never love myself. I have tried so so so many times. I really do make everything worse. Iâ€™m so fucking pathetic someone please run me over and take this miserable excuse for a life away from me.
