I need someone to talk toI've been so suicidal lately. I've always been really depressed and have wanted to die or been suicidal for years, but it feels more like I could actually do it now. My anxiety seems to be getting significantly worse too. 

I don't know what's wrong with me, I have everything I need in life and I should be happy. I have good friends, a boyfriend, I go to a good school, and I'm accomplishing the things I set out to do. I feel as though I've had much harder times, and times when I've felt more hopeless, depressed, and broken than I do now. But it also feels like I'm at a point where I think I could kill myself. Everything feels meaningless and while I know I could talk to someone around me, I just can't. It feels like I might actually do something and I'm not even devastatingly depressed, I'm just tired of trying.
