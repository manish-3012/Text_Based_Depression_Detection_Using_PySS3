I am the most easily forgettable person ever amaAnd honestly it's 100% my fault for letting myself get my hopes up that people want me around and aren't just going to ghost me every single time. It's so fucking stressful. Don't even take pity on me and say you're going to do something if you're not. Doesn't matter how much I punish myself for getting my hopes up ABOUT ANYTHING it still hasnt helped stop it from happening. I don't know why I'm fucking like this. Maybe it's a good thing though, definitely helps knowing they probably won't remember me when I'm not around to remind them.
