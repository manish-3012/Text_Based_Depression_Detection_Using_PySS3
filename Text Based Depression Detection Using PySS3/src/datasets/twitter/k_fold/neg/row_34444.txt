15 years old and life disgusts meA lot of suicides are in an either direct result of someone hating their life, or a suicidal influence from a tramautic event or series of, combined with depressed thoughts. Let's get this on the table now - my life is better than a lot of people's. I'm a sophomore in high school yet I attend university, my parents have a combined 180k salary and I'm an 8/10 and I'm not short or fat or anything, I'm a well built 5'11 150 pounds. I've lost a lot of friends recently and I have a fucking asshole piece of shit of a father who hits me, my brother, and tries to hit my mom (that's why I get hit - defending her) and he's always yelling about how he hates his life and us. But fuck it. I've learned to let it go after a lot of years of bullshit. I just got out of a 14 month relationship (which is concurrent with my parents' divorce) but that's not the reason I feel this way. How do I kill myself and make it look like an accident?

I've felt this way since around October of 2014, when I was 15 years old and 3 months old. To put it quaintly, I thought a lot about life and growing up and the world and I just fuckin hate everything. I don't care anymore and yes I'm sane. It's just that the more I live life the more I hate it. Material possession and experiences (family and friends) have just lost their touch. I've lost interest in all activities, daily and annually.
