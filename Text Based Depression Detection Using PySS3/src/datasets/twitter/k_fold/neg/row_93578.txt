Should I tell my dad?Iâ€™ve been feeling worse every day and pretending to my parents that everything is fine has taken a toll on me. All I do now is sleep all the time, if I don't force myself to wake up I can sleep for 16 hours. If I get any less than 12 hours my whole body feels awful. I fantasize about throwing myself into traffic or jumping off buildings. I hate my life and I hate the fact that I have such hard time forming relationships with anyone. I have no relationship with my family or my siblings, and I have some friends but we are not close. I hate that I have no one to go to, I feel like I donâ€™t have a â€œhome.â€

I feel like Iâ€™ve tried, but itâ€™s just me that wonâ€™t let myself get close to anyone.  Iâ€™ve joined clubs, a sorority, and volunteer places, but it just feels like they all form a group that Iâ€™m not a part of. 

My family life sucks too.  My mom is an alcoholic and is extremely delusional. My dad is in another country, and to be honest he is the one I am closest to in my family, however he was never around most of my life. 

I know that not everyone is given a fair circumstance, but I hate how I can't even feel independent. I feel trapped at home all the time because the area I live in there is no public transportation and walking takes hours. If I make plans someone has to pick me up and take me home. If I want to go shopping I have to ask someone. If I want to go the grocery store I have to ask someone. 

I have asked my father for a car, and I did get one an old and I was happy with it, but I let my mother drive it once and she had totaled it. (I only had the car for 5 months before it was destroyed) My brother speculated my mother had crashed it purposely so that would force my father to buy a brand new car, and that is believable because she does have delusions that my father is rich and has a secret family.

There is so much more to my story but I donâ€™t want this to be long. Iâ€™m currently in university on financial aid, but I feel like taking time off. However, the problem is that I would have to pay the financial aid that I was given, as well as the loans. ($80,000+ and I know my family can not afford to pay it back) 

Iâ€™m really not happy here.  =( 

Also, I have seen both a psychologist and psychiatrist for about 8 months. I donâ€™t feel much better.
