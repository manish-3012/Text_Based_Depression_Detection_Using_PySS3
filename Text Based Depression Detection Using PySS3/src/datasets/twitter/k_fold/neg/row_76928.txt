I donâ€™t know what to do
Hi, itâ€™s ok if you want to respond me in Spanish or English, it doesnâ€™t matter; or if you donâ€™t want to respond Itâ€™s also ok.

Hi, I would like to tell you all what is happening right now, but I donâ€™t know, I just canâ€™t. It is difficult for me to write this.
I donâ€™t know if you will respond me good or bad things, o even if someone is going to answer this but I donâ€™t know, Iâ€™m very sad and something in me â€œtold me to do thisâ€, I donâ€™t know why but here I am haha.


Itâ€™s just that I donâ€™t now what to do, I am really sad.
One of the things that make me to donâ€™t do this right know is my girlfriend and my dad. My girlfriend knows about the last time I had depression and that I wanted to commit suicide and so then she started crying and made me promise her I will never do that, I really like her a lot and I want to have a family with her and to watch our children grow, etc. 
But itâ€™s just that I donâ€™t see any future in my life.

Also my dad, I donâ€™t know if some one is going to understand me but my dad is a very good person that wouldnâ€™t harm anyone. My mom and my sister always yells at him and I am the only one who defends him; they always tell him that heâ€™s useless and a lot of other things. I really donâ€™t know how he hasnâ€™t killed himself. And I really donâ€™t want him to be sad and to cry.


I donâ€™t have any friends, and my girlfriends loves me a lot but itâ€™s like that she doesnâ€™t mmmmmh like understand my problems, I donâ€™t know how to explain it. She is always trying to help me. She doesnâ€™t know about this, and I donâ€™t want her to be sad or to worry. She is the nicest person.

I donâ€™t know, Itâ€™s just that I am very tired of life and I would like a lot to be happy as any other one. 
Happy moments in my life at this time only are like when someone in your class falls, they are just for a moment and they are insignificant.
I donâ€™t have any friends and I always see other people being happy and with friends at parties laughing.

It is very sad to know that the only person who really cares about and understands you itâ€™s you dog, haha; but itâ€™s just that I am tired of being sad all the time.
I would like to be happy as anyone else and to donâ€™t need to smile all the time to donâ€™t worry other people. 

I would like anyone, I donâ€™t know, like to tell me something. I doesnâ€™t matter if itâ€™s good or bad.

Please just tell me something.
