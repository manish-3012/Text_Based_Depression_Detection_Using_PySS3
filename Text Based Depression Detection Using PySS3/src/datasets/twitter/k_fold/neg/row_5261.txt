Simply surviving through it all isn't worth itAfter an overwhelming amount of experiences and so much pain I often wonder if 'god' has something awesome planned for my future that will make me feel like it was worth staying alive for.
I'm scared that he doesn't.
I'm afraid that by the time I'm 45 I'll look back on my life and regret not killing myself right now but I think I'm not going to do it anytime soon. I am actually very interested to see what will be by the time I'm 45 and if it wasn't worth being alive that long I'll come back and bid a quiet goodbye.
