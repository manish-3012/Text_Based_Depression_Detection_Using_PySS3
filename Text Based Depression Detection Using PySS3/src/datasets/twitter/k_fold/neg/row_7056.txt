being dead is far better than being alivehi, i'm desperate to die. life is really bad, because i get no enjoyment out of living, no one cares about me, i'm a bad person, and i want everyone to suffer because i'm a selfish, heartless cunt. if only guns were legal in the united kingdom so i could do it instanteneously, but that's not an option. my only way is to do it a painful way. im fucking tired. death is just like going to bed but there's no work to wake up to in the morning. i'll never have proper friends that care, or a girlfriend or something. I hate absolutely everyone. if anyone finds me dead, i hope my dead body haunts them forever.
