August 30thThat's it. That's the date im going to send a slug thru my brain. Im done guys, I've lost all hope. I've lost all want to live here anymore. I dont want to work anywhere. I dont want to work for anyone. I dont want to be a part of this rate race. I don't want to be a part of society. I so sick of all of this. I search thru books upon books trying to find something that could help me, something that will motivate me to keep going, but nothing, i only create more questions that need answering. I've done mushrooms and lsd, and nothing, only more questions that need answering. Only one thing I've managed to pull out of all of this, its all pointless. There's no point to any of it. We dont matter. I started college this summer, hoping it was a good change, a good step towards something to better myself. A way towards a better future. But Idk now, every thing is being tossed at us 1000mph, and I was so scatter brained on the first fucking day. I dont even want to go to college. I don't want to do all of this shit. I'm just forking all this fucking money, and time into pointless, meaningless Bullshit. Im not going to start fall classes. Its relatively easy to get a shotgun where im at, and I'm 21 now so i can get drunker than I ever have before I pull the trigger. Im done working for anyone, rotting away here. I just want to be free of this, free of thinking about this miserable place, free of stress, and depression. I no longer care what my family will think, I have let go of those feelings. I just need to go to the fucking gun store now, that's the final piece to the puzzle. That's the answer, a shotgun. Thats my escape. One more summer. Im almost free.
