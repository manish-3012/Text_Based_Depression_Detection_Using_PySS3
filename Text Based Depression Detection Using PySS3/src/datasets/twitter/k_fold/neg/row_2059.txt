Iâ€™m confused, I canâ€™t stop spiralling.I was raped. But I wasnâ€™t. 
I canâ€™t understand him. I donâ€™t know what he was thinking. I feel like I canâ€™t even remember what happened clearly anymore.

After the first time, I kept going back. I asked for more. I asked him to hurt me, to kill me.

He almost did. I wish I knew what he was thinking. 

He always told me how delusional I was. And I know. I deluded myself as a coping mechanism.

I always try to make sense of it all but I canâ€™t. Did I make him worse? Was he like this to begin with? 

What if I hurt him as much as he hurt me.

What if Iâ€™m just placing the blame on him so I can feel better.

I canâ€™t even express how I feel because itâ€™s such a mess inside my head.

I recently turned 18 and started university this year. Itâ€™s been 5 months since I attempted suicide.

Iâ€™m havenâ€™t been in contact with him for months too. 

I think about him everyday. The idea of him instantly makes me dizzy, sick and horrified.

But he is not a monster. Heâ€™s kind and caring in many ways.

He strangles me when I keep fighting back. He bites me so hard that I scream. He inflicts pain upon me until I pass out. He has sex with me when I beg him to stop. He tells me everything is going to be okay when I cry. He letâ€™s the room be dark since I donâ€™t want to be seen naked. He lets us stay under the sheets when he rapes me because I want it. He asks if Iâ€™m okay during it. He stokes my head. He asks before he punches me. He apologises after. He wants to kill himself after because he is so sorry. 

I wish I could forget it all. I loved him, I really believe I did. And maybe I still do. I miss a lot of things.

Everything is a mess. Iâ€™ve been to multiple mental health professionals and it hasnâ€™t helped.

One man told me I wasnâ€™t at all depressed and smirked when I brought up masochism. He asked me if my vagina hurt when I was raped.

Others disregard it completely. Theyâ€™re right. I wasnâ€™t raped. I caused it. I was foolish.

Iâ€™m tired. I was depressed before I met him. And after all these years itâ€™s still here.

But Iâ€™m happy. I get my studies done, I socialise often, I even got a casual job, people always ask how Iâ€™m always so full of energy and happy.
Thatâ€™s what happiness is right?
