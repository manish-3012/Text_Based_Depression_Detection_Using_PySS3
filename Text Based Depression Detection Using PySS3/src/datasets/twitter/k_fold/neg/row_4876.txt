failing universityI just finished my first year of university failing 5 papers and I am now in debt over $20000 at the age of 19. I don't even know what to do with my life anymore or what career path I can take to avoid me putting myself in a bigger hole as it is... someone help me. I feel useless whilst all my friends are doing so well for themselves in life and secretly Im here failing miserably. I don't even have any work experience so it is tough to even be able to find a job. Im skinny and broke with no talent at all, and my parents are annoying about school so i had to lie to them about passing all my papers. Now I'm stuck with no hope on what the future holds for me and what I can do to get myself back on track. Life is a bitch
