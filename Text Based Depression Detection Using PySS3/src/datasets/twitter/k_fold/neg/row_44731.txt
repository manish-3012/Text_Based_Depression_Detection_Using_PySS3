the devil inside my head has been coming back. COVID19 is seriously putting a dent into me and i can't take this.All my negative antisocial hostile energy is back, all the hate, homicidal ideation and suicidal idealization is back, my body feels so compromised from the amount of stress i have been feeling. Adjusting to new routines because my sports have been postponed, adjusting to daily life in these times of crisis, everything is in absolute chaos and it is no longer a figment in my imagination, it is all true. I would rather wish riots too start in the street and an actual apocalypse than this.  This is the most depressing and darkest point in my life and it's giving me flashbacks from when my OCD was at its worst point in 2016. I've been fucking medicated, i learn't to deal with my feelings of unreality, now it is all fucking back thanks to COV19. it all feels like a dark episode as a result of no sleep, only difference is i have had good sleep. this is very real and no longer in my mind, this is a reality. i am in yet another mental health crisis thanks to COVID. I don't fear contracting it, but it is adapting to this world of chaos now, it feels like the end of the world. i just wanna erase myself and come back when its all over. what if i get PTSD from this??
