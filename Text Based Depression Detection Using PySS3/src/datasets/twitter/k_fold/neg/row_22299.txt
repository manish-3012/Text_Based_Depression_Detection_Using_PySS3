I planned how Iâ€™m going to do itIâ€™ve been thinking a lot about it and Iâ€™m going to go ahead with it, i canâ€™t take another day of this pain and Iâ€™m alone everyday, i have basically no one, nobody who truly loves me for me. Therapy isnâ€™t working, nobody answers their phone when i call, nobody cares enough to take one second to look my way. I feel completely discarded and i have had enough of it. Years of rejection and neglect. The never ending pain. Itâ€™s finally going to come to a stop. The end is the only thing i am looking forward to. I have finally had enough.
