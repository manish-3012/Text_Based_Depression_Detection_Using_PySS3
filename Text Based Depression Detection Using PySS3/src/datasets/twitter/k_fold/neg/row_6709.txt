I need someone to talk toI've been so stressed and depressed recently and I just feel like everything is going wrong at every turn, ive had a headache for 4 months that gets worse and worse and nobody knows the cause, i keep looking at my pocket knife thinking about how it would be so easy to just end it, and every time I think that I see my little brothers in my head and I just start crying, I don't know what to do, I'm dropping out of school in 2 months, every doctors appointment I have gets cancelled by my mother because she makes up excuses, I only have 2 friends and I feel like they are just there out of pity, I try and act happy in front of everyone and when it slips they just think I have dark humor and I can't keep living like this
