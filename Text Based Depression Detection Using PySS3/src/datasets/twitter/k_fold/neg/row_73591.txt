My anxiety keeps "killing" meMost of the time I feel like if everything was wrong, I feel like if my friends don't really care about me and see me as an option, I never had love from my family sometimes I just wanna die, I don't really have the courage to do it but sometimes I just have suicidal thoughts, I feel like I don't have anyone to talk about it and I just would love to have someone to talk to most of the time, maybe I'm asking for it and it's not the right place to do it but i don't knoe, sorry for making this post but I feel really hopeless
