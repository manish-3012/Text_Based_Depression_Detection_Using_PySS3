I came close last nightI just feel so overwhelmed at the moment. 

I came so close last night. 

I had the chef's knife ready. I had a note all written out. I had a last meal of things i really enjoyed. I called up my mom. 

And after I got off the phone with her, I just laid down on my bed and cried for hours.
