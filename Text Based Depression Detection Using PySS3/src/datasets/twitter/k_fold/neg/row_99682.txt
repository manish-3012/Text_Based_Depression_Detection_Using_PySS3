Concussion/BrainInjury....cant do this anymoreI was in a masters degree. I was going for my "national master" title in chess. I was fast, quick, sharp, funny and fluent. And now. I'm a shadow of my former self. A dulled down genetic downgrade. I'm 12 months post concussion. MY INTELLECT....gone. \[22 male\] I've thought about the concussion every single day since the incident multiple times a day.
