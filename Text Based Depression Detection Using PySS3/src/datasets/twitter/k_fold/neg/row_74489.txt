I'm feeling awful todayI feel awful everyday. I don't have a job and I haven't been to college yet. I have recently been sobering up. Can't afford a therapist. I have bad memories that wont go away. When ever I get them I yell a lot. Sometimes people think I'm yelling at them but I'm not. I get paranoid and I always think people are gonna put things in my drinks or other random cruel shit. I have a hard time getting along with other people because I just see their bad sides too easily. I also feel so ugly I might as well never go outside ever again. I honestly feel like I can not run away from anything and I am just going to have to end it. Whenever I go up I always come crashing down, so there's really no point in having fun anymore. Some advice or anything would be welcome and thanks for reading.
