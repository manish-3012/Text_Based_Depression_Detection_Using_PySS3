Birthday triggering suicidal thoughtsTodayâ€™s my birthday. Iâ€™m 19. I honestly thought Iâ€™d be fine but this is probably the worse Iâ€™ve felt in awhile. 3 weeks ago I planned to attempt today but Iâ€™m still deciding. 

This time, I tried reaching out but none of my friends are free or care enough to hang out so that just adds to the list of triggers. All Iâ€™ve been doing on my birthdays is cry myself to sleep and for once I just didnâ€™t want to be alone this year. But I guess even that is too much to ask for. I honestly think achieving happiness is a luxury for me. Near impossible. 

Maybe I wonâ€™t be alive tomorrow morning, maybe I will. Whatever it is all I know is that I feel so fucking suicidal and miserable today. I really wish I could just end it all right here, right now. The response from people I know just confirms that Iâ€™m indeed background noise, and whatever I do is honestly irrelevant to them. I donâ€™t have any established connections with anyone anyway. So what I do to myself doesnâ€™t really matter at the end of the day. Just so tired of feeling disconnected and constantly on the brink of suicide.
