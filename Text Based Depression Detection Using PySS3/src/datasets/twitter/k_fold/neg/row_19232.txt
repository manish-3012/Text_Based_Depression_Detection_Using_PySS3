I donâ€™t have anyoneIâ€™ve never really posted on here, I never thought I would need too. But I have to get this off my chest.

I donâ€™t have any friends, none at all. Iâ€™m quite a loser, I donâ€™t go out and drink, I donâ€™t go to clubs or parties and Iâ€™m never invited out anyway. I have a girlfriend who is kinda the opposite. She goes out with friends, goes to parties and clubs and drinks. Itâ€™s just a constant reminder about how lame and lonely I really am.

I feel uncomfortable going out, so donâ€™t say to just try and get out of my comfort zone. But it wouldnâ€™t hurt to get a text sometime saying â€˜hey man wanna go out tonightâ€™ Iâ€™ve never had that in my life.

Iâ€™m just so unhappy. Iâ€™m so different from everyone, and I feel like the only way to get rid of this pain and lonleyness is to kill myself. I hate that itâ€™s come to this, but I just wanna be happy. I want my girlfriend to be happy, and I feel like sheâ€™d be better off without me.

Sheâ€™s on holiday with her friends at the moment, going out clubbing and stuff, and it just reminds me that Iâ€™m such a loser and really have no one. I wish I met someone like me before it came to this.

Please me good to one another, and try to not be a loser like me
