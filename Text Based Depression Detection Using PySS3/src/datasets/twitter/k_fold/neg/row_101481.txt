I asked god many times to die but I am still alive.I was on the verge of Suicide something like 30 times the last year only.
I have autism and epilepsy = I am extremely isolated.
I am extremely depressed, I hate talking to others, I panic when near people (maybe because of autism).
I am not good in expressing my self, I am not good in emotions.
I am a university student, living in the dorms, and when I have to leave the dorms I will be on my worst mood ever, because my routine is broken, and I have no family (the family that consist of a father and a mother living in one house), so I either go to my brother house, grandma, or relatives. I hate the instability.
Now I am in my brother house, before that I was in a relative house, and before it I was in my grandmother house. in the last 3 days I have never left the room for more than 15 minutes, I canâ€™t get out anyway.
I have never had friends, the friendship usually never last for more than couple of days, and if it last longer I make enough effort to destroy it.
