I canâ€™t with all thisIm a med student failing assignments, a shitty economic life(not that bad compared to others but still a shit), i feel stupid af, that im not worth it even when people say im wrong, im just thinking, its life really worth it? Is it worth all the fking work and all the  mental breakdowns? Im just tired pretending to be happy and smiling to all the people around, maybe its time to say goodbye, im pretty sure theyâ€™re going to be okay. I donâ€™t believe in hell, god or even a fking heaven with those shitty things that people say. I just wanna fking cry but i canâ€™t, i was told that real men donâ€™t cry. I donâ€™t know maybe all this isnâ€™t that much compared to others but it fells like shit living like this. Can someone say if i should kill my self or not?
