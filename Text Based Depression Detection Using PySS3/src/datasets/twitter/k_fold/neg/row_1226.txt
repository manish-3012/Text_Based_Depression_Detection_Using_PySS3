I think it's because I'm a PhD studentI know that doctoral candidates and mental illness go hand-in-hand and I need to stand cautious against self-destructive behavior, but this PhD is taking me to some dark places.

I'm recently married to a wonderful lady. I have fantastic parents. No debt. Good health. I am in good standing in my program, and I have a job offer for when I graduate. So why am I getting these thoughts? Is it the 80-hour workweek with no sign of reprieve? Am I imaging all the other students hating me? Why don't my advisers ever seem satisfied with my work? Why do they treat me and my time like it is worthless? I always feel rushed and, consequently, incapable and irresponsible. Is this real or just an unreasonable environment? Is this all be compounded by being many, many thousands miles away from home?

No one knows it, but I am struggling. They all think I am making leaps and bounds in my work. I am. But I am falling fast. The only reason I haven't off'd myself is because of what how my family would take it. It would not be not fair to them. I owe them more than that, but if they were to disappear, so would I.

I tell myself this is only for a limited duration, that it will all be OK once I graduate, but could I be dealing myself some kind of long-term mental harm by being in a program that is so bad that I consider ending my life just to escape it?

I want to go home, but if I do that now, I'll be seen a failure.

I'm in no danger tonight, but I operate one day at a time.
