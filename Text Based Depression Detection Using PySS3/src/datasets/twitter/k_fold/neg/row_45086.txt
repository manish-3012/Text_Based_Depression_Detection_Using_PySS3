I Really Need HelpI've been waiting on a call for the Suicide Hotline for almost half an hour now, waiting for somebody to pick up. I want to hang up and recall, but then I'm scared I'll get bumped to the BACK of the line.

I'm really struggling tonight and I needed to talk to a counselor. I'm contemplating suicide and I NEED to go to the hospital, but my parents aren't taking me seriously and are refusing to take me to any sort of mental health hospital. I need help but I'm not getting the help I need. I've already slit my wrists and I'm scared of dying.

I just don't want to call 911. I don't want to bother the emergency services when clearly they have a lot more serious issues to deal with than a stupid 19-year-old struggling with her emotions.

What am I supposed to do now?
