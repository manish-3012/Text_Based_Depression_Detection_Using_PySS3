Will I ever make it backLet's get suicidey up in here was a joke but it's sounding more and more serious. I'm further than rock bottom. I hit rock, drilled a hole, excavated and discovered a new rock. They're working on my statue for the museum.
I always plan and hope on making it back alive.
Back to normalcy, but who am I joking in all rationality it's bleaker than ever and I don't know how much longer can I stay in this void. This zone of neither going up or down. If there was a down I'd still be diving  but today I feel I'm stuck at the bottom.
I guess things could be worse I have my health and things to be thankful for.
But Fuck if waking up is the worse part of my day and going to sleep is the best what's the point.
There's no point to me anymore, my life isn't going to matter I'm never going to accomplish any of the things I wished who Fucking cares anymore.
I just want to grab a razor and press a little harder then before and just quit.
Game over you lose.
