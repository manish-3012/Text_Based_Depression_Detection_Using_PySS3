I'm so tiredSpent the last 5 years of my life watching my father wither away.
I'm mediocre at my mediocre job.
I'm mediocre in my college degree that I don't actually care about.
My girlfriend of 5 years whom I'm madly in love with is slipping away from me.
I have no days off, no time to do anything.
I've been depressed since the age of 12, and it never gets better

I don't think I've ever felt more worthless.
