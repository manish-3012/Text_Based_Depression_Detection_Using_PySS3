Sitting right next to the edge of a cliff, someone please help me.I'm a 17 year old male living in Australia (I won't say where exactly) and I recently moved houses with my parents last month.

For a job I make internet videos and stream on various websites for money and I make just as much money as my parents (who both went to university). Since the move my internet has dropped down from a solid 20 Mb/s download and a high upload to 0.5 Mb/s download and upload. I can't continue my job because the internet is way too slow for me to do anything on it. My mum knows I can't keep working because of the internet but my dad refuses to help me at all.

It was my dream job and its been taken away from me because of my dad hating and probably being jealous of my career path that I have chosen. 


EDIT:Thanks for the help guys, I'll update on the internet situation in a bit but my life is safe for now.
At this point I can't move out of home and I feel like my life is collapsing in front of my eyes and I cant do anything at all.
