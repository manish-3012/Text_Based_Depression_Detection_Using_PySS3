Scared about talking to my GP tomorrow, but what have I got to lose?Fuck this shit. Fuck the constant suicidal thoughts. Fuck all the other shit on top of it.

I'm doing therapy on my own right now, I have ECT starting in the near future, but I don't have someone to talk to about all the shit in my head.

I sleep next to the noose in my closet every night. I have a suicide plan. The only part of my plan that isn't fleshed out is "when". I'm afraid I could act on impulse at any time. I'm trying very hard not to.

I need someone to talk to. On a weekly basis, if possible. I crack after about a fucking week, I've come to notice. I'm going to ask my GP for a referral to a psychologist tomorrow, something I've been meaning to do this past week.

I have a handy list of symptoms written down for him. My plan is to just hand it to him and ask if he can get me a referral to a psychologist with that information. Here's the list:

- suicidal thoughts
- homicidal thoughts
- urges/acts of self-harm
- severe depression
- anxiety/trauma
- Worm crawling inside head/Worm talking to me

Honestly, I'm not going to lie, I'm a little scared to just give him that list of symptoms. My anxiety levels immediately go up as I think of the worst possible outcome, that he reads the list and feels he needs to contact the police. But fuck me... look at that list... what have I got to fucking lose? I need that referral so badly.

So I'm going to do it anyway. I've got a plan for trying to reason with my GP should he come to that ultimate decision. Maybe I'll get lucky and it'll fucking work. Maybe I'll get luckier, and I'll get that referral and get to walk out of the office. Might as well give it a try, if I want to give myself the best chance g of overcoming the chronic suicidal thoughts that have plagued me for eight years.
