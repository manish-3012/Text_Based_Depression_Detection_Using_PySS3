Who else suffer reactive depression in this subreddit ? (caused by a specific event)Hi.

&amp;#x200B;

When i read stories here it seems like a vaste majority of people suffer a different kind of depression. I'm not saying one is worst that the other obviously it's just that i hardly recognize myself in people's experience. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never had bad thought nor depression in my life, everything was triggered by one incident (a break up, I made a thread on this if you want to) and I never felt that bad in my life before.

Can you tell me what your event was and for how long have you been in there ?
