Encourage me to do something I need to do!I'm really anxious to post here. Terrified even... 

But I really need help convincing myself to go to the hospital. I've been a few times as a teen, but now as an adult the facility would be much different. Being inpatient helped me tremendously when I had been previously. But this time I don't know what to expect. I need to go or else I will not last another week, I'm losing my mind and I know where this feeling takes me...


Can someone please ease me into the idea? And maybe tell me some personal experiences of being in an adult facility. It can be good or bad, just be honest please. My anxiety is through the roof just thinking about the whole intake process my family's reactions...
