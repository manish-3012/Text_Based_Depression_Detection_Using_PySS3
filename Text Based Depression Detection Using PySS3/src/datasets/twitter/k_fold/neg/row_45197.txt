No pressure, I just really need a pep talkI quit my job today. This year has been so draining. Covid has basically put an end to progress I've making socially. I talked to my dad and he gave the basics "other people have it worse" that kind of white noise. 

I lost my energy and I dont know how to get it back, what do you need to hear when you're circling?
