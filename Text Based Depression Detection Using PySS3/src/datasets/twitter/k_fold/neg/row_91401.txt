Worthless incelItâ€™s only a matter of time before I kill myself. Seeing couples and attractive girls around my college campus trigger fantasies of jumping off the roof of one of the classroom buildings. Maybe if I commit suicide in public people will finally care. I canâ€™t take this any longer. I should have killed myself when I was still in high school.
