My family curseMy mom comes from a very prominent American family. They started a very well known oil company I won't say directly, but it rhymes with Poconos. When I first started drinking in highschool my mom told me she was always worried about my brother and I because the men in her family have a history of addiction/dying young. My grandfather killed himself when he was in his 40's. Her half brother also died young due to his alcoholism and he smoked like 5 packs a day apparently. She also had a cousin who died in a car crash when he was 19. That's all that I know of but theres probably more.
To keep up with this tradition, I fell in love with this girl who ended up really fucking my head up. She was so beautiful, and we truly loved each other but she cheated on me with a close friend which just made things worse. I still couldn't get over her though. We didn't talk for a long time but eventually after highschool we reconnected and tried again. Things just weren't the same though and I asked her to get a gun and just shoot me. She said no you'll have to kill me first. She ended up killing herself about a year later. On top of this, before she she even died I had blood work done because I could tell there was something wrong with me. I woke up one morning sick and with a hard mass in my abdomen. I still don't know what it is though because I was too much of a pussy to read the results. And after kait died I just didn't care anymore. So for the past 4 years I've been feeling nothing but guilt, sorrow, and the knowledge that I most likely have some kind of cancer or terminal illness. Atleaste I know that when I do die, whether it be self inflicted or natural, I was following God's plan. Life can be so fucking cruel.
