Tell me it's going to be okayI have been not feeling the same me, i feel like there's a different person inside of me. Ever since my step dad moved out i have not been feeling good, mentally, I've not been going to my online classes,i get yelled at, my brother avoids talking to me, and my mom is sick so she can't work, and I feel like I can't talk to my friend's because they're kinda toxic. And i even thought of self harm. I'm 12 which makes it a bit worse i just need someone to tell me it's going to be okay&lt;3
