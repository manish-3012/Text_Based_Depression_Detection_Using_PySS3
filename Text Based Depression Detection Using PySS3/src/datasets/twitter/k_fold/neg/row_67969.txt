Why do i have to burn in hell for wanting peaceI used to go to church when i was a kid but i never cared for it. I don't care about the bible either because there's a bunch of nonsense in there. I do believe in God though, don't ask me why, i just do. My mom is the same way. She doesn't think people will suffer for eternity for ending their lives and i've even heard priests saying the same thing. However, i don't know if it's because i suffer from OCD/Anxiety, i always have these intrusive thoughts about this idea being true and i hate it. I don't think my loved ones who died by suicide are in hell simply for the way they died. They were good people. But my dad keeps saying everyone who dies that way will suffer and it feeds my intrusive thoughts. Then i think "why would i want to go to a god who sends depressed people to hell anyway?" and then "but what if it's true and i throw away eternal peace because i couldn't handle a few years on earth?" I hate all of these intrusive nonsensical thoughts, i probably already have a special place in hell for being bi and wearing earrings even if i die by natural causes anyway according to a bunch of people??? I don't know why suicide is always the thought stuck in my head. I just want to know that if one day i have a crisis and end it all, i'll actually have peace. I wish i was an atheist. Or less of a pussy.
