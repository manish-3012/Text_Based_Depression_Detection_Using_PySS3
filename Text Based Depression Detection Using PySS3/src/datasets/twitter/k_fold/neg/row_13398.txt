any advice pleaseIm 15 years old and for the most part Iâ€™m happy I do okay at school I have good friends great parents however I often have passing suicidal thoughts during the day and I do pretty well at blocking these out by lying  to myself saying itâ€™s normal for teenagers etc but my main problem is every couple of weeks I will have one day where my mind implodes with suicide thoughts I  cant stop thinking of reasons to kill myself what is the point in my life? No one likes me no one cares about me. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because I donâ€™t have the guts to do it but I canâ€™t handle the thoughts and feelings I have about and I always think to myself why donâ€™t I who cares if Iâ€™m not here not me or anybody else. I am in desperate need of advice right now and you have no idea how much it would mean to me thanks.
