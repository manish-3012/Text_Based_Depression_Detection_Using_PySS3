Iâ€™m doneIâ€™ve been a fuck up my whole life,I canâ€™t ever do anything right.cant get into any relationships due to anxiety,canâ€™t drive due to anxiety,my brother and sister are finishing collage and have relationships and Iâ€™m still here struggling in my [20s](https://20s.im/). Iâ€™m tired of only feeling anything beyond self pity and sadness if I donâ€™t take pills.realize that all my hopes and dreams will never com true and Iâ€™ll be the fuck up of my family.i genuinely donâ€™t want to live anymore.

im considering OD on pills or drowning myself in a nearby lake [soon. im](https://soon.im/) done,Iâ€™ve been done for a while now all I have to do is actually go through with it
