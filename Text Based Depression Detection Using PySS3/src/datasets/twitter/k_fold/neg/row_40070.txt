[UPDATE] It just keeps getting worse.Posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4xkufc/i_tried_to_od_on_xanax_and_alcohol_on_wednesday/) here a few weeks ago and woke up at like 2:30 today badly depressed over money issues. Posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/50pg0q/i_dont_know_how_to_make_money_and_support_myself/) while I was paying my bills, which were more expensive than usual, and after that was done I decided to head out for a bit and my car wouldn't start. It's not even my car, it's my fucking parents' car. Just tried to hang myself with a tie and the ceiling fan, but my body weight would just rip the fan out of the ceiling. I don't know what to do. I can't go to the hospital because while I have insurance right nos I don't think it's something I can afford. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if I should tell my therapist because I feel like getting hospitalized will make things even worse. 

I just hate being alive so much. There are good times with friends and what not, and I'm definitely smart and skilled in some ways, they just happen to be ways that aren't valued by society at large. I'm just finished with all of it, and one of the worst parts is it even isn't all that bad. I'm a straight white dude in the USA, I should be grateful and able to use my resources to better myself and the world around me, and I'm incapable of doing so. It's my own fucking fault and my existence feels redundant in such a way that renders me unworthy of life.  

I don't know how to get out of this. I just want to die.
