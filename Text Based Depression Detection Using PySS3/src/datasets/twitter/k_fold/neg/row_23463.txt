The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because of religion, but my faith waivers, and I find myself considering suicide more and more these daysFor the longest time Iâ€™ve always considered suicide, but my devotion to God, Hell and Heaven, is wavering, though I still believe in them as Iâ€™ve always did, Iâ€™ve seen the Worse of Humanity, and Heard stories of it at its best, I find myself distancing myself from my family, especially my Younger brother, and Iâ€™ve been keeping to myself more and more, my life feels worthless and useless, like a Plant with no fruits to bare, talking with my online friends does help, but not enough, and I know that people would actually be happy that I died, since I was pronounced dead once before, and **PEOPLE FUCKING CELEBRATED IT**, so now I think I should kill myself and just make myself useful for once, it would be harder if the people **Iâ€™ve devoted my life to** would be sad but they wonâ€™t so Iâ€™ll just cut the problem at its root, and then everyone would be happy.
