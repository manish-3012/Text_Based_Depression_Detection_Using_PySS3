I'm so angry and frustrated at myself right nowI went to a social place with people and I couldn't go up and talk to anybody. Things could have great tonight but I couldn't go up and talk to one person. I wanna be able to talk to some girl I like someday but I couldn't do it and now I'm angry and frustrated at myself. Things will never change and I'll always be angry and frustrated and alone. Hopefully someone understands but probably nobody will. If I can't get past this struggle in my life soon then I dont know if I'll be able to go on living.
