What happens when you call 911 to stop yourself?I donâ€™t have plans to commit suicide yet but Iâ€™ve been having a scary increase of suicidal idealization lately. Iâ€™m not in immediate danger at this minute, but if I get to that point I was hoping to ask what would happen if I were to call 911 to stop myself? Would I be hospitalized and for how long? Iâ€™m supposed to graduate college this semester. What happens with that? Am I going to have to move out of my apartment and live with my parents again?
