I donâ€™t know if I want to kill myself actually or if Iâ€™m just looking for attentionIâ€™ve had a slow deterioration of my life/mental state form around 10th grade till now (would be sophomore in college) Iâ€™ve been trying to Join the Military for around 7 months but I had injuries my shoulder after a bike crash right after deciding to join (after deciding college wasnâ€™t for me) Iâ€™ve had a drinking problem Iâ€™ve been pushing to the back of my mind for a Long time and never tried to get help for it, giving my self excuses about how everyone drinks and oh Iâ€™m not as bad as that guy. Iâ€™ve lied (not small ones, big ones), Iâ€™ve stolen (small and big, from people who have only been good to me), Iâ€™ve hurt people (Iâ€™ve hit people,that have and havenâ€™t deserved it) now, the final straw... I got drunk on three bottles of wine and hit my mom, got arrested, went to jail, been blacked out drunk ever since despite starting going to AA (need to start anger management too) 
I canâ€™t go back to jail but my charge pretty much guarantees I will, especially since I canâ€™t afford a lawyer. I was in jail for one night before the bail bondsman got me out and it was absolute hell. Iâ€™ve been in shitty situations before but this was something different. I will do whatever I can to never go back to that place. My mom wonâ€™t talk to me anymore. I got kicked out of her house. I will never be able to join the military which is what Iâ€™ve wanted to do my whole life. I wonâ€™t be able to get a decent job with my charge, or rent a decent house. My life is fucked from here on out. Honestly I just donâ€™t see the point in going on. I hate the time I live in, everything is completely fucked now a days and whatâ€™s the point in fighting my ass off to live a life I hate anyway..?
