Game OverEverything just keeps getting worse and worse. I finally got the balls to rent a Uhaul truck and move out of the shitty, abusive, deranged place I used to call a home. Found a place with a yard for my dogs and everything. I thought I had it all figured out. I was ready to move this Thursday. Then they decided to say that if I take my dogs with me they'd call the cops. The only thing I love and the thing they say say they want to get rid of. I can't do shit since the registrations are in my mother's name. I know they will not hesitate to call the cops. So that's it. I'm fucked. My anxiety and depression have been so bad that I literally grind my teeth and cry all day. I'm sick and tired of the world being as fucked as it is and me not being able to do shit about it. I'm sick and tired of being looked down upon for my beliefs. This has been my life. Losing my dogs was the straw that broke the camel's back. It took a while for it to get this bad. But here I am. Nothing left except a a couple hundred dollars, a lot of medication, which include 15 percocet, and a camera to record it all. I think I'll start with the percocet to numb me from the pain all these different anxiety / depression pills are going to cause when i start downing them by the hundreds. I'll use the money to buy something to wash it all down with. I'm thinking the most expensive alcohol I can find.

I always hoped my suicide note would be a better read, but even this was disappointment. I'm done. I can't take it anymore.

Peace.
