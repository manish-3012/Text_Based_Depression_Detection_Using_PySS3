I am very tired and I sort of lay down.Don't know if living this way is worthwhile.Hi there people from Reddit.

I am new in this forum and I'm also not a native English  speaker so don't be so hard on myself as far as the way I write this is concerned.

So my point here is basically I'm done.I find this life unbearable since I turned 17 onwards.I was moderately bullied although that was too many years ago (almost 3) but aftermath is still here and I think it will be.So, well, bullying is not why I'm here but anyway it has influenced my life, my self-confidence, the way I get along with people and my sexual orientation, as well.I've become a sad person (although nobody might state that I am, because basically I don't show it so easily) and reminiscing all my childhood and adolescence and I came to the realization that being so happy as I always used to , I don't know how come I ended up this way.It's so pointless almost everything.

By the way I am a 19-year-old guy right now and in very few time, 20.I suppose that should have been posted in the very beginning of the text but anyway,I'm sorry, so it's just that.

So moving back to my life, I must state three things that make me being preoccupied and frustrated all the freaking time. So these are the ones shown next up: I don't have friends (only acquaintances, classmates and what I mean is having true friends in the way of going out, helping each other whenever we had a problem so that I could at least try to help him/her and, don't know, maybe grabbing some beers or eating out, or just to have a conversation, an interesting one, if it's not asking too much.), the very next thing is I feel frustrated and sorry for myself all the time because of the fact that I don't know quite well what I am sexually.I feel trapped as a a mouse.I'm probably gay, I'm sorry for saying I am, honestly I don't like it, but I just can say I am attracted to guys, and i can't do anything to solve it. I feel helpless about this part in particular. Not having clear such an important thing in life at age 20 and around is something that really hurts and I feel so much pressure to go on in my life.It's such a hard try every single time I get up every single morning just knowing I won't have what I've always loved to and wished ,which is HAVING A FAMILY AND HAVING SOME OFFSPRING.It might occur if someone out from Heaven just shows up.But reality is here and we all know that's not gonna happen.I must be realistic.Depicting a little bit how I feel about my sexual orientation, I can only say that even though I am attracted to guys the most, I do like girls and in fact a lot more than guys as far as sexual intercourse is concerned.Actually emotionally I am attracted to girls but that has almost vanished since I don't freaking care who I end up with, either a guy or a girl.Preferrably a girl, but if it just doesn't occur, I would accept  being with a guy.By the way, a little bit of my frustration comes from the fact of seeing very handsome and hot guys out there in the street or in public transport, or going out and kissing with their girlfriends and just thiniking oh shit, that guy is physically awesome but I don't want to be with (I DON'T DESERVE IT)  such a chivalrous and gorgeous male because he deserves passing down all his perfect genes to a new generation. And I cannot be an obstacle between him and those f*ck**g handsome children he'd problably have.

Forth, related to all aforementioned, I am a virgin and that doesn't seem to change, above all because of the fact taht  I'm shy and have very low self-confidence.Also, I don't have to much money so far, so I couldn't ask anybody out since money is so  important at least in the first phase of a relationship.We are a big family, exactly 7, and the only ones working currently are my father and my second older brother (basically the money coming from my brother is for him and a considerable amount of it is for the family as a whole)so I don't have money.That's clear.I need new clothes and as I try not to cause more economical problems to my parents( I think I am, to be honest, the one who wastes the least money, actually only the necessary), I don't get any money so I have to live on with pass-me-downs and clothes I'm still wearing for years.Well, I try to be humble and comprehensive the more I can, but I don't know, knowing you wear almost the same clothes everyday drags me down more and more until I hit rock bottom.Maybe this problem is related somehow with the pressure I add to myself because I don't seem attractive anymore wearing everyday the same clothing.So because of that I think I don't get girls' attention.I'm as well a coward so don't even f*cki*g expect me to approach to them in case I had to ask them out.I am so let down with the whole girls' topic that I probably get away from it and just shield myself with things don't f**k**g even matter whatsoever.For instance, masturbating.I excel at f*c*i*g wasting my time procrastinating or more accurately procasturbating.And if you want to know, I do it seeing gay pornographic videos, only.I feel so ashamed everytime I finish this stupid, hedonistic ,ephemeral and selfish activity.It's not worth.Is it?

Another thing recently happened to me is that I got a crush on a classmate (aged 26 to 27, I think).He is so nice, so manly, so masculine and his attitude so manlike and he is so quiet.He f**k**g attracts me a lot.When I see him turning around laughing along with his bunch of friends in class, f***ing kills me.I know he has a girlfriend.I've seen her in his Whatsapp's main profile picture and is so cute (him), kissing her in front of the Tower Eiffel.I've also kind of spied him online, a little bit, and I've come across some pictures that must have been taken in classroom and he is so fuc*in* photogenic.Some tears crept down.Well, I think now it does not matter at all.It's just a crush and crushes sometimes are impossible and unattainable.I must stop, not seeing since it's impossible currently, but at least trying not to see him nor "stalking" him online.I just want it to cut down.And also I feel that when I'm near him I behave as a retarded and a dumb would so that even gets me more upset. All the frustration I get every time I see a good-looking guy is just to be wiped out and to feel helpless.

And I don't want to be gay.I refuse.And yes my family has a lot to do, but anyway it is not normal.I accept being told that anybody as a human being can like, be attracted to and go with whoever he or she desires, whether he is a guy or a girl.I respect that.Even share it.But I cannot accept being told we live in a heteronormative society and they f*ck up our lives and so on.I think that if it wasn't because of that, we probably would have extinguished, since procreation is something necessary to survival and thus any species must have to be that way.I suppose you might respect my point over it.

And something I've forgotten is that I've been through depression since approximately October last year.It may be a sum-up of factors which probably overlapped and caused the so unwilling and unexpected reaction I got in the end.I even wrote down a suicide note, I couldn't finish due to its length.Then, i kind of felt that I wasn't into that, I didn't want to die either I want to die today, but if I get overcome by all this I will probably take my life, as it's still the only thing in world I can decide, the most absolute one.Of course i want to live, but don't expect me to stay here when something like wanting to be with a girl is just impossible for me, everytime getting all those disgusting and harmful gay thoughts in my mind all the time.Frustration would define my situation as well as helplessness and disappointment whenever my parents or the acquaintances I have (or childhood friends and other people I met and I see everyday) discover that his so beloved son has such an enormous problem ans becomes a such a monstrosity.In addition my siblings as a whole are absolutely homphobic (I don't think you could never know what it is to hear out of their mouths,verbally, calling themselves or even at me "gay" or related terms as a joke, but all the fuc*in* time, they sort of recall it to me in evry moment, and I feel this way, like, if you even knew what I am actually in the inside you'd never probably repeat that again)

Sorry, I could put loads of reasons and things which have happened a very little time ago, but I have to go have dinner and I don't know what else to add up.Excuse me too because of the way I structured the whole text and some typos, but I typed it kind of crying, slightly, and I am so terribly sad that I think making a stop here is even better.I am one of those that tonsider things to get better but I don't know if I will be able to go through all this for a long time.I als want to say that i'm very sorry for you all to hear just the selfish and  disgusting human being's will, I feel tired .I'm fed up and I'm done.Bye.

Have a perfect day and life, I wish it for sure to you  Redditors and thanks for reading all my stuff!
