ReadyI am ready to go. I decided a week ago today would be the day. I've done what I needed to be ready. I wished it didn't have to be this way, but I always have known it did. I am not meant to be in this place. I never felt like I belonged. Always sitting in the dark, wearing a smile so no one would see. Watching everyone dance in the light but never being able to be apart of it. I tried to give what good I had. I tried to care about those who too were hurting. I could always give the things I've needed to others. Because I can navigate the dark and help the living rejoin their kind. At 9pm tonight I plan to go. I've tried to find help, but no one listens. I've never mattered to a human in this place. I am less than human, so of course they can't see me. Tonight I will be free. Tonight I will sleep. Hopefully there will be silence after all of this is over. I will write a note to them to hopefully make the passing easier. I do not hold any ill will toward anyone. This is just a fate I've been putting off for too long. I wish I could belong in this world. I wish I could matter. But I know those things aren't meant for me. So I must accept what is to come and do the world a favor by removing this despicable thing that is me. The sickness dies with me and gets swallowed up by the ground.
