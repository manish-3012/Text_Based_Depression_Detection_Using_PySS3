My experience with suicideAfter swallowing over double the estimated overdose of a medication I was on I had a while to think before I passed out. But the most vivid memory was regret, not that I was leaving others behind or anything like that, but that I was dying so soon and life wasn't complete.

You know how you hear of old people having a bucket list they want to complete before they die? It's like that. As you realize you're going to die all you can feel is the regret of not having done everything you want to do or experiencing the things you only dream of.

And the big thing that cam out of the attempt was a new state of mind, as if I'd died in the hospital and was reborn. Suddenly I have a huge motivation to do the things I want to do and my mood has increased a lot as well.

Also for anyone who is planning to OD on pills, or more specifically sleeping pills; from my experience I passed out, vomited (which i dont remember) and was found 7 hours later cold and pale but was able to be rushed to the hospital where I had extreme nightmare hallucinations for a good part of 2 days, and giving me PTSD from that experience.

Sorry this was so long but I thought it might interest some of you or at least inform more people about what it's like to commit and survive an attempt.
