FrustratedI donâ€™t mean to poke at anyone unnecessarily, but Iâ€™m sick of researching methods of suicide, trying to figure out how best to kill my broke ass, and then BAM, out pops a whole page trying to convert me to the religion that I am, by default, exposed the most to. I understand that it is seminal to the belief system to make more disciples, but tell me up front! Donâ€™t try and trick me, my life is disappointing enough. It doesnâ€™t matter where either, from websites regarding how best to kill myself, to people I met on here. Donâ€™t string me along, talking about cheap gun prices because you want to be rid of it, but then use it as a tool to tell me about Jesus, THEN NOT SELL ME THE GUN!!! I know Iâ€™m venting, but itâ€™s hard for me to find a resource to help. I live in a smaller house, and Iâ€™m too tall to hang myself conventionally. So while researching other methods of hanging, Iâ€™ve gotten tricked and scammed a few times. Iâ€™m pretty young, but have begun losing my hair, I wronged the one friend I had left cuz I owe them money, and my family might get evicted soon. So please, quit trying to scam and fool those of us who want to die, we literally just want to die lol.
