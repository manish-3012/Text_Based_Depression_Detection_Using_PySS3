Crying ConstantlyTW maybe:

I've been crying for two weeks straight every day when I come home, and I've never cried this much in my life. I actually love my job, but once I leave, life hits me really hard with a wave of emotion and I usually just cry for twenty minutes. I have no clue how to deal with this overwhelming wave of emotion honestly, and it drains me so much.

I don't want to die right this second, but the combo of my hormones making things worse right before my period and not sleeping from PTSD is making my life pretty fucking unbearable when I'm not at work.

I am seeing my doctor in a week, but I don't even know what I should say. That I'm depressed as shit again? That I can't even take birth control because of my complex migraines and most of the anti-depressants I try don't work. What even happens now? I'm just so tired of this.
