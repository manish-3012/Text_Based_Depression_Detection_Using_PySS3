Back again, and just not sure what to do...I've been unemployed since February.  I continue to fail in my attempts to get a job.  I've missed a chance to live with a good friend of mine because I'm unable to get any income..

And so, reality is just setting in more, and more.

I don't have any family to turn to.  And the only friends I have are an ex girlfriend in California, and this one guy where I currently live in Atlanta, GA.

In a few months, I might have a job.  And I'll finally move out of my ex-GF's place.  It will be another souless IT job, because it's the only job I can get that will pay me well enough to afford to live on my own in this horrible, filthy, expensive as hell city.

And I'll come home every night, completely alone to an apartment.  I have no highschool friends in my life anymore.  I have no college friends in my life anymore.  I have my one very successful friend who's way too busy handling himself.

It doesn't matter where I move.  I'm just going to live alone.  And count the days before I finally have had enough and choose to die.
