Every one else's problems seem like they're not an issue, but I know mine aren't either.I'm a senior in high school, I know knowing about the world, but I just don't get why you'd kill yourself over being single. 

Earlier  I had a panic attack and almost, *almost* tried to kill myself because I couldn't properly draw a chair. My grandmother had always called he artistic, and I couldn't draw, and I shut down. Which is not a good reason to kill myself. I'm so judgmental, it's disgusting.

I can always talk myself out of it but I don't even want to. I have no inspiration to do the things I love or even do my school work any more. I'm going to fail my senior project class, and that means I won't graduate. And if I don't graduate, I'm going to kill myself. I've had fantasies about killing myself in the principal's office, so she's the one that sees... but that's bad. That's mean, even if I don't like her, she doesn't need that. But where? I don't want my family to see my body... 

I want to be a teacher, but I don't see how I could be with thoughts like these.  I don't know what I'll do with my life if teaching doesn't work out. 

I don't know what else to say. This is a really nice community, because suicidal people help other suicidal people. If you want, you can lie to me, and break the rules, and tell me it's going to be okay. Reddit bullies people out of tumblr by threatening the sjws (which i always considered myself one...) and there aren't really sunny, happy quotes on here. I miss them. Are there subreddits for that? Because they were nice and flowery about it and subs like get motivated scare me... make me promises on behalf of the universe, it has failed me enough that I do not believe it, but the messages are nice.
