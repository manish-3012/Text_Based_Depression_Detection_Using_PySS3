I don't know what to do anymoreAll of my problems are so trivial and dumb, and I'm young compared to you all, (14), but I just wanted to get this out there.

So basically, last year was hell for me and completely destroyed my self-esteem. I've ended up liking this girl (and i know how trivial and stupid this is) but it terrifies me because I don't want to hurt other people's feelings and I might make a mistake. It makes me not want to live, or isolate myself forever.


I'm probably really stupid and selfish but im not sure how to continue. I'm trying to prevent myself from crying right now so im just gonna leave it at this.
