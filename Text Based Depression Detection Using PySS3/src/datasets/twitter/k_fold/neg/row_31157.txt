17, 2AM.Emotions are tough. I'm sitting here in my bed with my brain flooding of past events, happy and sad, positive and negative, and I don't know how to handle it. I'd call it a breakdown if I wasn't so used it and had a way to shrug it off. 
It feels different this time, though. And I don't know how to describe it, other than that it's more intense. Instead of numbness and apathy like I felt before, it feels like it's all happening here, right now, all at once. Like I'm really back in the moment, reliving it, with a somber piano track backing it all.
I love life, but I hate life. I have no reason to be depressed. I have no reason to want to commit suicide. I'm scared of not existing. And despite all this, there's always a nagging thought in the back of my mind, quoting Palpatine. Dewit.
I want to call a hotline, but I've never done it before. I talked to some friends and skirted around the issue. I'd hate to leave them, and I'd hate to upset my mother. A child is supposed to bury their parents, not the other way around. And I feel terrible every time I seriously contemplate it. I don't want to go back to the psych ward. I don't want my prozac dose to be upped even further to drown out feelings. I don't want to go back to therapy. I want to help myself, but even my meditating that worked for a while no longer does because the intrusive thoughts have become less of the minority and more of a deliberation and a plan. I'm at a loss. I'm too suicidal to live normally, but too scared to die.
I don't purely live for other people. I love life. I'd hate to hurt other people. I couldn't bear it, even though I'd be too dead to know it. I love life so much, and yet I can't stand living. I don't know what to do.
My mother is in the other room. She says I can wake her up to talk to her, but I don't want to trouble her with it. She works hard enough as it is. I love her so much. I don't know what to do.
