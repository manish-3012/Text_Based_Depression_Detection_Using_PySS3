Confused and ConcernedI hope my post is still welcome here since I'm not planning suicide, but I had a related experience a couple days ago and I'm kind of concerned.

I don't plan to kill myself, I don't want to die, and I don't think I'm at a great risk of hurting myself. But at the same time, I'm worried. I found myself very upset this weekend, and for the first time, I found myself thinking about it--not even considering doing it, but pondering how easy it might be, and just kind of wondering. Then I spent a while in bed, strangling myself with my necktie, not with the intent of ending my life, but just because doing so felt kind of calming.

I'm in a weird position, because afterward when I had a moment to reflect on what I'd been thinking I got scared and now the whole thing just sounds morbid. Just in a general sense, I'm concerned something is wrong, but I can't tell for sure--I'm worried that if I try talking to my friends about it they either won't take me seriously, or that I'll try to explain myself in a way that's too melodramatic, and they'll take me more seriously than my circumstances warrant.

I'm not depressed, and I'm not planning to hurt myself--I'm distressed and in pain, but it comes and goes, and I can't even tell if it's serious or not, but I'm afraid of both possibilities. And every time I try to say something to communicate this, I worry it'll look melodramatic in words.

But yeah...I don't know.
