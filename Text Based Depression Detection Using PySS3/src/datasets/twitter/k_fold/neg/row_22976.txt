I'm afraid.This is the first time I've ever admitted that I have an issue with this. I am absolutely terrified.

I've never attempted suicide, but I've thought about it, especially tonight. When I'm sitting in a room, one of the first things I do is look around and see what things I could use to cause harm to myself if I were trapped inside that room. 

My family's messed up pretty bad. I'm constantly feeling inadequate. I'm losing friends quickly, because no one wants to spend time with someone as damaged as me. I was driving home tonight and I just had this thought that I'm running out of reasons to stay alive.
