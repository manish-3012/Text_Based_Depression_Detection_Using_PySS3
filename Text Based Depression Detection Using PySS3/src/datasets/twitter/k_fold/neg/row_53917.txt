iâ€™m just tirediâ€™m tired. i go to work and i do everything wrong, everyone is always mad at me for something, i go to college and i have no friends, i barely understand the material and i have no time to ask for help bc iâ€™m always at work. i go home and i fuck up everything there too. i donâ€™t help clean, i make a mess. she expects too much from me, she wants me to get home from class at 9pm and still wants me to clean everything. i work 6am to 2pm and go to school 3pm to 9pm i get home and go to bed and do it all over again. i just feel alone, itâ€™s like no one is on my side ever, all my friends from high school hate me and donâ€™t talk to me, my best friend since 1st grade just decides one day that she doesnâ€™t want to be my friend anymore, my mom gets mad at me bc i donâ€™t want a relationship with my emotionally abusive brother, itâ€™s always him and my mom against me, everything i do, i do wrong, i canâ€™t take it anymore, i tired, iâ€™m ready to just take all of those pills in the medicine cabinet, no one would care anyways, i guess this is goodbye, maybe.
