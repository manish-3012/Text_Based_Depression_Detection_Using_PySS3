I have just found this sub, I have been searching for text hotlines but none are open in my timezone at the momentI can't make a call, it will wake my baby and partner. I have been spiralling, can't sleep. Not even with 10mg temazepam, 15mg diazepam and 2 drowsy allergy tablets. I feel nothing but self disgust and hollowness. I need out. I am a burden on my partner, he is only here with me  because I got pregnant. I can't look after myself pdoperly. My PTSD is coming back. I'm ashamed, I'm guilty. I'm a bad mother, and I want to leave this world before she is old enough to know that. Before she is old enough to remember me and how pathetic I am. She can build false memories of me as a perfect mother. Her father loves her so much, he will do a great job. I need to go I just can't feel this way again
