I'm lost, I don't think I fit in anywhere in this lifeI (32/f) have been self harming and thoughts of suicide come and go but this morning on the way to work, so persistent that I'm not sure what to do. I have a very loving and supportive partner, but I frequently go to them for help and fear that by leaning on them heavily I am emotionally abusing them. They have their own life to attend to and can't 'treat' me - I see a therapist too, once a week but it's not been enough.

3 years ago I finished grad school and have not been able to find full time work in my field. I left a full time job I hated, which paid well and had fantastic benefits, in order to pursue that degree. I performed well (so I thought?) but despite applying to jobs like crazy, I have had interviews and sometimes second interviews, but never a hire. The pummeling of rejection have led me to believe that there is something inherently wrong with me, that I am unacceptable, and that informs my poor performance in future job interviews, which causes me to continue to not receive offers. I'm paralyzed as to what to do next, because I feel every decision I have made in the past has led me to my current failure and that I can't trust myself to make a good decision, so I'm just stuck in this cycle.

I do work, but I'm miserable in my job. It's in my field, but part time and for most of the day I just sit here, which leads me to dwell on my failures.

I also don't want to have children and have never planned on a family. I've always planned to be this highly creative and independent career woman. Which is not happening. The only other path I ever see is women pouring their time and energy into a family - which I don't want. So I'm left with...just being a failure at my career, and I have nothing else. If I'm not a career woman or a mom, what the hell am I doing? Where do I even fit in?

The fact that I have two degrees but still no desirable skills which means no job offers forces me to believe that the problem is me, I am inherently wrong, unacceptable, unfixable. So my choice is to continue living this apologetic, pathetic existence, or I just let go and end it. I don't know what to do.
