if 1 thing doesn't happen I will end itI sent a joke for my only friend, she got mad and blocked me in WhatsApp, I said sorry to her in Instagram and she blocked me there too

She is my only friend and the main reason I'm still here, if she blocked and me because of a joke she was just looking for an excuse to do so, I feel guilty, trash and if she doesn't unblock me in, idk, a week, I'll end it
