I don't know what to doOk so I ( a 20yo guy) am going throught...nothing really serious, but when I think about future,I don't know if I'll ever be happy , and if I'll ever find a gf, and maybe having a family. I'm not even sure to want a gf, or if it's because it's considered as "weird" to stay alone forever. 
Sometimes,I wisjh I could simply die , why can't I just die? why can't I OD, why medication need an ordonance? 
Or maybe should I keep living, but what does life really worth? does it really worth to wake up everyday to work, but have nothing to do with money? (no one to share it with).
I really don't know where I really want to go with this post to be honnest, ig nowhere , maybe it's just pointless, idk
