How do I help my sister get better?
few days ago my sister got back from a trip with her friends. the moment i saw her i knew something was wrong and so I tried to talk to her; apparently she took marijuana and got into a bad trip that triggered a lot of the thoughts she was trying to suppress for years. Including how abusive my father was (there was this incident where he touched her down there when she was a kid at the pool) and when i tried to get her to get these things off her chest she told me that when she was a kid there was this girl who used to sexually assault her in the schools bathroom. 
All of this is deeply heavy and I booked an appointment with a therapist for her yesterday and the therapist recommended a psychiatrist because she told me she might end up needing an anti-psychotics.

my sister is cannot confront herself and so she creates this image in her head about herself. She also suffers from these delusions and beliefs that people are conspiring against her and often times she might say mean things and the next second she would completely forget about. Her therapist told me to keep away any sharp objects and keep a close eye on her; since she is suicidal.

My point is; what do I do? Iâ€™m trying my best to be there for her. Iâ€™m currently a senior and working on getting my bachelor. But I do not know what do I do? how do we survive this?
