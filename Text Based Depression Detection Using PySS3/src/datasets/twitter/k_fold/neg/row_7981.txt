Come What MayI am not sure why I feel moments of sadness anymore. Even had a good day today, but I can't keep the voices out in my head. I'm not in a suicidal phase, just have been having the feeling that whether I am alive or dead, nothing else matters.

I trust almost no one anymore, even those that I do, I cannot open up to them, knowing that the thoughts of ending my life had come up again would worry and upset them. I know if I do open up, they will lock me away again.

Perhaps I am just looking to find a way. I guess most of us here are just lost. I do wonder if I made the wrong choice of not jumping out the window and letting the police get to me. I miss the peace in my head. The silence. Sleep comes really little and I hate my dreams. I really do. Because I am living my life the way it was before everything crashed. I am fucking jealous of my dream self.

I'm sorry for rambling. I do pray that everyone here does get better. Prayers is all I can do now.
