Thought about suicide, but don't know if I should tell friends or family?So a little backstory first. Growing up I never had a lot of friends, but a good amount of people I would consider aquantices. I have a little close group of friends and my social life besides that wasn't much. Never had a girlfriend or any friends who were girls unless a friend of mine got a girlfriend who would be nice and talk to me. Next thing I know I'm going to college basically because my parents want me to, and a college hours from home. I know my problems aren't special or even anything big , but this first semester had been very tough on me. I have been very lonely most of this year not seeing the friends I did last year , if they are even still my friends and on top of that I've been stressed out with classes this semester. I honestly don't even know what I want to be or do with my life which has been making finding motivation for everything even harder. Well into the main topic about three weeks ago after I found out about I we gonna fail a class I started to cut my myself a little on the fingers and crying to myself. Having been awhile since I drank, I stupidly think that its make me feel better, but by the end of it I found my self holding the knife to my throat for what seemed like forever just thinking about how its be easier this way. I ended up calling my friend that I've known for years to help call me down, from so the context and crying he could probably tell I was cutting myself and maybe has an idea I was thinking about killing myself. Called him the day after and told him I'd be alright and since then haven't mentioned a word of it to anybody.since then though it's been weighing on me every time I talk to my family. I don't know if I should tell anybody because I know after I do I'll probably be looked at differntly, have to take meds, or something like that. I just don't know if I should let it out or just keep on keeping this to myself.
