Reasons why I'm seriously considering suicide:* Have a constant headache due to a bad lsd trip

* Owe 2k in court debts 

* while making 150 a week 

* Most jobs wont hire me because of a 2011 shoplifting charge. And if they do I have little chance to move up.

* Because of said court debts i cant get a license
 
* I have Hep C and although its mild it scares me that it'll get bad

* I have parents that have put me in rehab for weed for 20months of my life.

* Because of this im a social misfit and even around misfits i dont fit in. In short I have no friends.

* Everyone I know has surpassed me in things i cant imagine doing.
 
* My parents put my 3 siblings throgh college say all my college money was blown on rehab. 

* No one takes me seriously to the point that I have lost self respect.

* My parents way of helping me is reminding me that they financially support me and making a big deal out of everything and calling it help.

* If Im depressed my parents remind me of [insert person we know] battles [insert medical condition] every day and she isnt suicidal.

* Im relapsed on weed to numb out my existence till i kill myself (im sober atm)

I cant take this anymore the stress and insults and lack of help.

But what gets to me the most is my dad had all the help in the world growing up coming from ecuador he studied in Tulane got good jobs and inhereted at least $1 million and a building he sold for 700,000 at a young age because he was born when my grandma was 50.

I ask to be able to get some help going to college he says he already wasted money twice. The first time I got the LSD headache and dropped out the second i was enrolled and my parents pulled me out because i was smoking (which i could understand if my brother wasnt a drug dealer.)

I wont go into details of my suicidal state because i have been baker acted for posting here before. Am I just whining? does any of this seem like small stuff?
