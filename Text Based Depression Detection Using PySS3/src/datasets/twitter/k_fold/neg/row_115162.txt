Im concerned about my girlfriend and I'm really anxious.Hiya guys, I hope you can help. 

Long story short, my girlfriend has lost a childhood friend and an uncle, both to suicide. 
She is still massivley hung up about these and it's something she really struggles to talk about. She's not really a talker where as I am. I talk about how I feel and can almost be overbearing but that's just me.. she's the polar opposite. 

When drunk a couple of weeks ago she broke down and made comments like what's the point in living, it's worthless, there are no reasons to be here she then said the only reason she's still here is because of her dad. This really upset me and we briefly discussed it a day or two after, despite me wanting to discuss it quite deeply. She did open up bless her, she finds it so hard and I  understand that, so I was grateful when she did, she however briefly touched on it and said that it's how she feels only sometimes, but shes fine now, it was just a brief thing... Back to closed and not discussing it. 

Last night I explained that I have been in contact with her dad and I wanted to get her a photograph of her uncle, frame it and have it in her house, so we could remember him and hopefully help her process it, even slightly just by seeing a picture of him. I honestly just wanted to do a good thing, a nice thing and it triggered her so fucking hard, I feel like such a fool, .beating myself up so fucking much.

When I told her it brought it alllll back and she broke down. She's been posting some suicide awareness things to her Instagram story, so suicide is obviously on her mind, I hope because of her uncle just being brought back into the forefront of her mind, not because it's something she's considering.

She's extremely quiet about this topic and says I'll never understand, she loves me deeply and we do discuss literally everything. Suicide is just something we can't talk about. It's absolutely off limits. It triggers her SO badly.

She's quiet, not answering calls and not answering texts. I'm at work and she lives an hour drive away from me. I'm not seeing her untill friday night (at the time of posting it's Thursday afternoon) 

This is the most quiet she's been and most introverted I've ever known her.  How can I create positive dioluges about suicide? How can I respect her desires to not engage in conversation with me but not be anxious? I feel so so so so scared, am I being selfish by worrying about myself? (How will I cope if she does hurt herself) I feel selfish as fuck... But I know she's suffering and grieving so much harder than I am. 

I'm sorry for the vocal splerge, I just really need someone to talk to. 

It might also be worth mentioning that she has tried councilling and it did not work for her. It truly made her situation worse and brought up some demons that she has dealt with and put to sleep. She felt that councilling made her far worse and I know she would never consider that again as an option.
