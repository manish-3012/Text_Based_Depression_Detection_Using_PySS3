this is something i wrote when i felt darkness was surrounding me..and backing me into corners i couldnâ€™t get out of...In case you miss me


When the earth and the moon collide 
And the dark clouds suffocate those who rise
When the hills come crashing down
On our small, broken town
And the whole sky falls
If my memory fails
And doesnâ€™t remember the tribulations we prevailed
Just know
In my writing you will have a piece of me
it writes on the awful things i see
And the fate i'm sure to hold
Through fire and ice 
Though i may disappear 
Look up at the stars and see me there
Smile at the thought
Remember the way we ebbed and flowed
Recall our memories and hold them close
I'm leaving on a nice note
LOOK UP and remember where id go

im still not entirely sure what i meant by this...but it oddly gave me...hope i think..
