Iâ€™m scared to die but I want to.So for the past year or so Iâ€™ve been wanting to die more then usual but Iâ€™m too scared to do it. I have nobody in my life and suicide is a huge option rn. Iâ€™m only 16 but I feel like Iâ€™ve lived a past life. Last night I sat on my bed and just stared at my blade. Iâ€™d do it but Iâ€™m to scared that Iâ€™m going to hesitate and not cut deep enough. So now Iâ€™m in collage alone. I just need some friends.
