I just finished a test run of my suicide plan.I'll buy the things I need next week.

I don't want to get better or be better anymore. And I feel so guilty for that. I just want it to be over.

knowing my life is perfect and that i could choose to try and be okay or be functioning and do things doesn't matter to me. and choosing to die or want to die in spite of that, when i feel fine for the moment, makes me feel really guilty.

i wish i could drop dead. but even thinking and wanting that makes me feel even more guilt.


honestly though, the last few months have been bearable, and the only thing that changed to make me feel better is that I finished planning my suicide back then. that's the only thing that's made the pain go away,, is planning to die.

EDIT: my normal accsount is /u/icantdoitpleasekill but it's not working for some reason. so i made this account.  so if this post sounds familiar it's because it's still me.
