I feel very lonely and I have been getting anxiety attacks lately.The title is the basic summary.  


I am a gay (closeted) teen that came out to my mother a couple years ago, but she thinks she "prayed the gay away". I feel like I failed her as her son and that's why she screams at me every day for every little thing. And I just can't take it anymore.  


This year, during the quarantine, after being a couple months stuck in one house with her, I got my first ever anxiety attack. I didn't know what it was. I felt like i was going to die. It made me happy, but also scared. Lately, the attacks have got much more common.   


I also have a disorder that makes me have constant pain in my stomach, but it gets worse with stress. And being with my mom in one house has made me so stressed. I haven't been able to eat much lately. I just eat as much during lunch as possible, because it physically hurts to fill my stomach. I lost 3 kg in the past two days.  


I am writing this here because i have no one to talk to, so I am just writing my thoughts into the void.
