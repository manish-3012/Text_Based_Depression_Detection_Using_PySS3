$150k+ in student loan debt. Uncertain about my future, with exception of the level of difficulty.As a college student I made terrible decisions regarding my financial future, and now I'm paying for it. Sure, I have a fun, decently paying job now, and things would certainly be worse if were still working retail (or not at all), but somehow it doesn't give me enough hope to continue living. I don't like the idea of living for the sole purpose of paying for 4 years of mediocre learning. 

My family cosigned on part of the loan amount, and my failure/default would mean almost certain financial ruin for them. I have a girlfriend who wants a family in her future, but I have no way to guarantee that my situation won't make things worse for her and our potential children. 

The mistakes of my past, in this case, are CONSTANTLY there to remind me that I'm stupid. My financial failure is a nagging insistance for me to remove myself from the gene pool.

Perhaps I am lazy. Then again, perhaps even being 10x as productive as I am wouldn't provide a way out of this. Is anyone else going through this? Has anyone overcome a situation this severe? Any advice is welcome.

EDIT: I may not have mentioned that my roommate committed suicide a little more than a year ago, and was one of the most rational, insightful and upbeat people I've ever known. Needless to say, it's shaken me a bit.
