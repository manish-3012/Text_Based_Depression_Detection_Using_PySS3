I want to kill myself 20I had a lonely and depressing childhood and was an only child. Was raised by my mom who has borderline personality disorder and is very manipulating and neglectful. Never met my dad either. I felt so alone in my life, desperately wanting to be in someone else's shoes but instead, watching my life pass by as others lived theirs. 

Since dropping out of college and moving in with my uncle, I've been thinking about suicide more each day. I have no support system and am extremely empty and emotionless. Think I might have aspergers too, not sure. Basically I'm almost ready to give up. To be done with trying to fix my broken self.
