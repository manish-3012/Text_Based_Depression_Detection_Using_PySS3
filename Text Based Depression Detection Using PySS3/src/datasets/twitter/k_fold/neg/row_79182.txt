I don't know what to doI've been having really bad thoughts lately. My SO has been threatening to leave me if I don't get help, but I've asked and asked but none of my family will take me seriously. I've lost my scholarship and had to drop out of college, can't hold down a job, lost every last one of my friends and over the past year have started to develop delusions and hallucinations (schizophrenic symptoms, don't know if I actually have it). I have been having suicidal thoughts on and off for months, it's never been as bad as it is now. I don't even want to get up for the day anymore. I just want some advice on how to get through this.
