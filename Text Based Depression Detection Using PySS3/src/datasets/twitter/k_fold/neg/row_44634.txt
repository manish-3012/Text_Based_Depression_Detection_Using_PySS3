Alone and ready to quitI started the night with an [AMA post](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/e699p/iama_severely_bipolar_computer_programmer_ama/) about my bipolar disorder, hoping for some catharsis and release.

It hasn't helped.


The night has dragged on and become progressively worse. I've tried talking to a couple of people but they just can't begin to understand the depths of what I'm dealing with; to them, I'm just defeatist, just being difficult, just choosing to remain unhappy when I could so easily find some way to "get better."

My family is deeply religious; I'm an atheist. I can't talk to them anymore because all they want to do is preach to me about how if I would just turn to God all this would go away.

So here I am... I'm not ready to do anything yet, but I've been down this road far too many times over the past decade, and I know the warning signs. It won't take long before I'm making serious preparations for being gone.


I feel abandoned and alone, like nobody would ever *want* to care. Like all I do is frustrate everyone around me until they give up on me in disgust... or maybe just keep banging their heads against the brick wall of the disease out of some twisted sense of biological obligation.

I just want to feel like someone gives a shit.

It should say plenty about my state of mind that I'm turning to a community of anonymous strangers for support.

I don't know what to do anymore, so here it is. Anything you've got is deeply appreciated.
