I have no idea what I'm doingI don't know why I'm writing this but here it is so if your bored please do reread it if not don't waste your time

I don't know what to say 

I've lived with depression for 5 years about but recently after my 18th birthday it seemed to go away and not just for the average two days or so when I noticed it it had been at least week since I'd felt like nothing was worth doing and that I wanted to die
and I missed it maybe it wasn't even gone I just didn't feel much of anything


anyway I'm probably rambling but this morning I didn't really feel depressed but as I was putting out hay sitting in the tractor it gave me plenty of time to think and I decided  and started planning to end it this evening I've never felt so detached about it

being a christian although I'm not even sure of that anymore I'm not sure of really anything if I just had a purpose 
but if I do I dont know 
if I have a purpose but don't know what it is then I really am a waste right

I dont know what to do
