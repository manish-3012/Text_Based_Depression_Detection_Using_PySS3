Fuck this.I've talked multiple people through their suicidal thoughts, dropping what I was doing to focus all of my attention on them to help them out. They end up feeling better, I tell them "If you ever need help, you can talk to me whenever alright?", and they nod and thank me for that. They'll tell me the same thing, how I can always come to them if I need to.

But thats just a nice thing to say, nobody means that. You see what they actually meant was "I'm feeling shitty now, but when I'm out and partying and feeling good after my little bitchfit, fuck you."

I've been so fucking good to so many people who needed help, I made it so easy for them to talk and say whatever they wanted, fuck I've had people tell me that the only reason they're still alive is because of me. But can I get one fucking person to help me out when I need it? That would be too much to ask really.

I'm not sure why I'm posting here. I mean I've been a lurker here for over a year, talking to people who need it occasionally (Bit of a savior complex, talking actual friends through this stuff and random people online, not the healthiest thing I'd imagine). Its all the same stereotypical feel good shit, about how "Oh I totally care!". And I'm sure a lot of you do. But that doesn't mean anything, I mean I'd care about the most worthless fucking scumbag addict on the streets, doesn't mean anything past a stranger's general benevolence towards others.
