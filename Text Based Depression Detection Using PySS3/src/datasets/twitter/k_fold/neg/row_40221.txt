I can't take being screamed at and hit any moreI just got in a really big fight with my mom after she hit me and I yelled at her about how she doesn't care about me or make time for me and cares more about her canning 

She brushed me off because her beets she's canning are so fucking important and I'm gonna fuck them up like I fuck up everything and then she said her councillor told her to ignore me and I'm so mad because she's never let me have a councillor and she expects me to do everything myself and I'm putting myself through college and working full time and it's the first time I've been home in days and I was kinda excited to see her and i can hear her in the kitchen fucking canning beets

 she doesn't realize how much our fights affect me and how I cry for hours. She started crying and now I can hear her laughing upstairs and I think I'm gonna go ahead and kill myself now because why should I live with people who hate me clearly she doesn't fucking care about me enough to just take one fucking minute to talk to me or even apologize so fuck you mom.

The worst part is I actually feel bad for making her cry and not accepting her initial "apology" but there's no way I'm going to say sorry she's never genuinely apologized to me in my life 

I know I have a responsibility in this fight and I have no problem apologizing and owning up but the fact that she thinks she's faultless is making me rip my hair out 

Edit I was just looking at my last post about how much I hate her and I mention her not asking about my new job and surprise surprise one of the reasons I'm so hurt is she hasn't bothered to ask me how I'm doing at my new job or school! 

( also I realize how much of a brat I sound like but these little things are killing me and I have no one to tell them to)
