Not worth anyoneâ€™s timeI donâ€™t know how to convince myself Iâ€™m worth anyoneâ€™s time. I feel stagnant at my job, but terrified to move forward, I donâ€™t understand why my husband sees any light or goodness in me, I canâ€™t seem to see it there myself, and I donâ€™t feel right bothering my friends. Iâ€™m having so much trouble not doing something stupid tonight, because my husband and I are in a fight and so all the self worth I base around him is missing.
