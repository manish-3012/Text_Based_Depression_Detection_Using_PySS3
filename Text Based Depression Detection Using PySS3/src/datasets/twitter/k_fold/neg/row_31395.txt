Saw doctor and got more pills. I am paralyzed with this illnessHad a plan and do, but humans in the world say push. No promises with what to do. 

Not eating and chain smoking. 

Dirty ass and I am usually very clean

Been taking meds

That bitch of an ex is the sore

I wish I could say I hate her but I donâ€™t hate people, but their ways.

She put me in a place bad. Said she was leaving and the next morning did just that. 
8 hrs later a PFA and 3 cops kick me out and said they were told I had a gun. No gun!
NO abuse...that motherfucker just lied. 

I saved that bitches life 2 times and now I have paperwork saying I abuse her? WTF?
She woke up with a stroke, I took her to emergency and rehabbed her
She had pneumonia, me again

In a hotel, no sleep, not eating, sad and hurt like hell. Confused lost and very weak.
Even after seeing my doctor and getting a script, nothing changes reality. 

I am not strong nor have any fight. It is not anyoneâ€™s job to fight for me. A support system to assist me would be grand but in
The cards. 

If you have severe reoccurring major depression and social anxiety with suicidal thoughts at peak, we are kin. 
You know heavy, dark moments that to pee is a chore. That is me..

I am tired of the fight, donâ€™t wanna.  Who would know I am missing or care for more just a curiosity. Sad;...fucking pathetic..

If you read this shit. Thank you
