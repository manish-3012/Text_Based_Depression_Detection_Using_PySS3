FearI have wanted to die for weeks now. I keep trying to convince myself to get help but I'm afraid to. And I guess I'm afraid to kill myself too.  I feel so stuck.  If anything goes wrong in my life sometime soon I will snap and I don't know what bad decisions I could make.  Why am I so afraid to tell people how I feel?  This is only place I have talked about it, feels safer here, more anonymous I guess.  I hate being me. :/
