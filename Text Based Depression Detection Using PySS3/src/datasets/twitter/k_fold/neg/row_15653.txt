My closest friends are thinking of ending it all...Title pretty much explains it. I cant stop worrying, each morning thinking that I will get a message saying that one of them is dead.

One (whom I'll call j) changed her Skype status, saying "I'm sorry i ever existed." When I talked to the other (s), finally asking her if j was ok, she didn't reply and instantly went offline.

Now I am really worried. I love them so much, and I don't know if I'd be able to cope with them gone. Reddit, please help me.
