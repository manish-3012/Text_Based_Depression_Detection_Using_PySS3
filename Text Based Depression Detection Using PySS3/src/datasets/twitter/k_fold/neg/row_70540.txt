UPDATE:So today was my 21st birthday, and the day I planned to kill myself.  Unfortunately my fool proof plan wasn't as fool proof as I thought. So... yeah, I'm still here.  I feel like an idiot and a complete failure right now.  Right now I'm in my room listening to music and drawing, which is helping a bit.

I'm kind of at a loss for words right now.  This isn't my first time, but I think it will be my last given that I'm apparently really bad at this.  I'm just posting here because I thought some might be worried.
