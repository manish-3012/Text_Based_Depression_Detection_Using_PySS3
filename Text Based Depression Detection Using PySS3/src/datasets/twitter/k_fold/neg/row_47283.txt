17f - growing tiredhello reddit.

i'm not sure where to start but, lately life has been particularly hard for me. i won't go into specifics in a post, since that feels a little too risky given my situation, but i'm dealing with a lot of stuff by myself. way more than a 17-year-old should have to deal with, especially not alone. i just feel extremely physically and mentally/emotionally exhausted constantly. i don't have any friends and i don't get along with my family. i've always felt that i have a purpose, but in general, i don't see the purpose in human life, if that makes sense. humanity disgusts me, and i don't see it getting better, i just think it's gonna get worse and worse until we end up in WW3 and start killing each other. i don't get why i should keep living when i'm just miserable all the time and i'm gonna die eventually either way.

why not just get it over with now so that i don't have to deal with any more pain? i've already had more than i can take.
