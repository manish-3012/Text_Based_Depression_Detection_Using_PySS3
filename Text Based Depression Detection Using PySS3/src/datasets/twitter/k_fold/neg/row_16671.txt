I'm scared I'm going to kill myself on my birthdayI have nothing left except my family, no friends, no life, no job, no goals, etc, even my former skills and hobbies have become burdens that I can no longer preform or enjoy. Ever since graduating college my life has rapidly fallen apart and I feel like I have no other option than to kill myself. I want to do it on my birthday in about a month so that at least the few left who do care about me only have one day a year to mourn and hopefully they'll get over it in a year or two and try to just forget about me. I wish I'd done it closer to when I graduated so that at least I could end my life on a high note rather than as a complete failure. I think I'm going to call 911 and give them my address right before doing it so that they can harvest my organs and donate to those more deserving of life. I just can't live with being such a piece of shit anymore.
