Scared of killing myself.I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to live such a depressing lonely life. 

I used to kind of joke about killing myself as a way to cope with everything but honestly never really considered it. 

 Iv always said that I would kill myself if I ever hit 21 and never had a girlfriend or turned my life around. Both in getting friends and finding motivation for a job/career to pursue. But here I am at 22 and and things have only gotten worse.

Right now in the next few days is the time I decide if I will go through with it. For the first time, I looked into methods and imagined what it would be like and that shit terrified me. I literally started tearing up and shaking. 

So what are my options? To live what will always be a horrible life filled with people telling me â€œoh donâ€™t worry itâ€™ll get better you just have to keep  tryingâ€ or attempt to hang myself and going through what was described as a horrible experience and risk surviving. 

Like come on. What kind of crap it that.
