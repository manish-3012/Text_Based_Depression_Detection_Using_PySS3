Should I tell someone I have suicidal thoughts, even if I won't do anything?I've been having suicidal thoughts for about a month and I've been dealing with self harm for a few years. Even though I've been having thoughts, they're vague and not detailed. I don't have a plan or any plans on making a plan. I don't think I will actually commit suicide because dying is my biggest fear, but I've been having suicidal thoughts more than I ever did before, and I did some sh on my inner arm for the first time in my life, which I know is a warning sign. 

So, part of me thinks I should tell someone, aside from my therapist, but the rest of me thinks that I'd just be causing extra worry in my friends and or family.
