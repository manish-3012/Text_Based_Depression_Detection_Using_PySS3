Entertaining the idea of SuicideFor the past 10 years, I've always struggled in school, but I've passed, and even got an apartment and went to a college. Hell, I even have quite a bit of money, but there in lies the problem, it's all through inheritance. My dad basically helped me pass highschool, my parents payed for the apartment. I have a wonderful girlfriend who is away for a few weeks, which has given me time to think. I'm not sure I can successfully go on with life. I have very little to be proud of, I've held one or two jobs in the past, but I can't work now because I have Hepatocellular carcinoma, but I've cried wolf too many times, my parents don't believe me. I don't have any skills and I'm a pretty compulsive liar. I feel like Ive given life a great go, I just don't see a future for me, and I feel like ending it would be beneficial to her health and others in the long run. My sister and Girlfriend, dad and mom all have a ton of potential, and I'm just a roadblock. 

Sure If I wait ten years, I'll get hundreds of thousands of dollars if not more, but money means very little to me, nothing interests me, I believe im a slient burden on people. I know im the reason my parents got divorced. I'm holding the love of my life back.

I know my life has value in meaning, but at what cost to others is being being around really worth. I have no plans for suicide, but I could easily do it. I'm just not sure how to proceed with my life, because I lie to everyone, and it's so hard to stop.

I know this will greatly effect my loved ones, but my question to myself, is it worth it too them in the long run, even if they don't know it.
