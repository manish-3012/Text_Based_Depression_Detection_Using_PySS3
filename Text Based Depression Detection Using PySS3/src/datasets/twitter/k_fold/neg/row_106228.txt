I will kill myself today. I see no reason to live anymore and make everything worser for others.Today is my birthday. I'm 22 now. Never did anything right, so it's probably time to stop failing.

I'm in partnership with guy who believed in me. He was looking for customers, I was intended to do the programming job. If I will not complete project and our customer will end this, this guy will be completely broke. It will ruin his life. I'm bringing nothing but pain to people. This project is 3 weeks overdue.

I have a concentration issue. Tis monday I started taking Modafinil. It started to help. I have 4 10mg pills left. I found a solution much later than it was needed. But it really helps me to work.

I made a device to kill myself out of Soviet to European wallplug adapter.

It turns out that my life costs $2000. Everuthing has its price. It's the amount of loss I made. If only I got prepaid job starting Monday I will return these money to guy who lost them. But I don't think it's real. I don't think it can be solved. Who the hell will hire depressed guy like me and prepay. Anyway, you can PM me. Maybe my post will be blocked for that paragraph. Pathetic words, but my brain sees it as an only solution.

I have two friends working for me. They believed me too. I have nothing to pay them now. I failed it.

My English probably sucks now.

I'm starting to write code today. 7:35 AM. If it wouldn't help, I will meet my end.

I'm nothing. No hope for me. I will eat for the last time, take all my Modafinil and finally start to work. I don't think it will help, but I have nothing else to do. In previous paragraph I said that I will start 25 minutes ago. Another promise I broke. I just mindlessly hit refresh again and again waiting for something that can help.
