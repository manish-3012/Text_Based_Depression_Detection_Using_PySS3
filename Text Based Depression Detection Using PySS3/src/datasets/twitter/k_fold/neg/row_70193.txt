Closer to suicide everydayHello this is a throwaway and honestly I don't know if i'll live itll 22 im 20 as of now and have had depression since i was 16 i'm on 80 mg of prozac for severe chronic depression and ocd. i'm a dancer and our teacher told me once becasue i was crying "no one cares about your feelings no one wants to hear them" my uncle also needed open heart sugery so like anyone I was so worried about him i couldnt sleep or dance and all I was told was "stop being lazy" i've looked up to this man my whole life and ive done everything to please him like anyone would a teacher they look up to. my depression has got so bad that he started to not care about my progress he stops encourging me because some of the younger kids have more preattentional . I'm writting this crying so it's messy but honestly I don't know how longer I can live.I lose my dance skills a lot because of how depressed I get I honestly feel like my teacher wouldn't care if I was gone. to cheer myself up once I bedazzled my jacket and he called it ugly and to give it to good will even though I loved it I cried and never worse it since. I'm sorry this is so long but my suicide thoughts are getting worse i'm only living for my uncle at this point if it wasnt for him i would have killed myself last month sorry this is so long and messy i just cant take it anymore i have a fear of doctors because they put me in a ward once which caused me to almost kill myself due to trauma I feel so weaki have no friends no therapist due to fear reddit throwaway accounts are my only safe place thank you for the replys in advanced &lt;3
