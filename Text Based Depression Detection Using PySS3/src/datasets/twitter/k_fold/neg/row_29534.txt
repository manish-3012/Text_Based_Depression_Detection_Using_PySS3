I'm gonna do it tonightI've got a well-thought plan of committing suicide and I'm gonna go through with it as I've tried all the so-called ways of getting better and nothing ever helped me really. 
I know my loved ones are gonna be in so much pain but I can't keep on going any longer. I don't even know why I'm writing this here. Maybe I still have some hope that you people will give me advice as I'm hopeless, don't have anyone to talk to. I've told my parents I'm suicidal and they don't give a fuck. I just wanna stop existing
