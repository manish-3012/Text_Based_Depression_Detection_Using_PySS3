Why try when that's all you've done?I feel like I've ruined so much already and my time left on this planet won't be anything but hurt and regret. 

I thought I'd never feel this way again with someone I love in my life but the pain is just so great right now. I'm stuck working jobs I hate because I can't find a passion to go to school for. I never make enough money and have way too much debt. I'll never own a home. I feel pathetic. I'm almost 30 and I'm stuck.

Social anxiety disorder has ruined me. I have no friends, I barely know how to interact with people outside of a acquaintance level.

I miss my mom and want to see her again. She passed away unexpectedly almost 5 years ago.

I don't know if I could go through with it, because I don't want to hurt my dad or partner, but it's all I think about. I don't want to try anymore. I'm exhausted. The world around me is going to shit too. And honestly? I don't think more than five people would care if I wasn't on this planet anymore. 

This sucks.
