My family is probably the only reason why I havenâ€™t kms yetI need to vent this somewhere, I canâ€™t seem to find any other communities where this might fit into, and I sure as hell ainâ€™t gonna talk to my family about it

Iâ€™m currently an RA in university and honestly I just donâ€™t see the point anymore. I thought I would want to be a teacher maybe but Iâ€™ve found the only thing that I like to do is play video games â€” itâ€™s the only thing that gives me true enjoyment. I hate everything else- I donâ€™t like academics, I feel as if I died most of my friends wouldnâ€™t care they feel fake as fuck to me, I havenâ€™t had a single real relationship w a s/o my whole life, and I feel that ultimately everything wonâ€™t matter anyway because Iâ€™m gonna die alone anyway. Oh and because WW3 is about to start. 

The only reason I havenâ€™t done anything drastic is because the only people that will miss me probably is my family. I have two moms, grandparents, and an aunt/two uncles that will miss me. I donâ€™t have any siblings. 

If I didnâ€™t have a supportive family, I almost certainly would be dead now. Every day gets harder and harder to keep pushing through. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this. 

If u read this, thanks, I just needed to post this somewhere and let my feelings out somehow
