I feel like my path is coming to an end very soonMy physical health is a mess. I'm 23 years old and herniated a disc (apparently because of a slightly deformed spine). Since I've been diagnosed with this condition, I am plagued with severe health anxiety. Any little symptom makes me freak out. I can't handle this. I'm constantly convinced that I'll get some horrible disease very soon.

I am constantly worried about the future. I love life, I really do, and I think there's so many things to live for, but the fear of diseases is taking all of that away from me. Check my profile, I've been a wreck for years now. I have been considering suicide for so long now, I feel like a laughing stock for still being alive. I prepared for suicide, I studied many methods and death in general. I'm fascinated by death and I hope I die soon and painlessly.
