Thinking about "trying" to kill myselfSeriously I don't even know exact reason why I'm having these thoughts but I just want to hurt myself. Ever since I started having suicidal thoughts I've been thinking about attempting suicide but without the intent of dying.  
  
I have considered:  
OD'ing on pills or cutting my wrists open and then calling ambulance.  
Trying to hang myself but stop before I pass out.  
Calling cops on me and then stabbing myself (no guns available for me).  
  
I also have constant urges wanting to cut myself deep enough to need a visit to ER. And some other things to hurt myself mentally.  
It's pathetic, I know that. All of this sounds like I'm just a attention seeking loser.  
  
Right now I'm not ready to die but I feel suicide is still something that's going to happen one day. I don't see a future for myself and I think I won't live much past 30.
