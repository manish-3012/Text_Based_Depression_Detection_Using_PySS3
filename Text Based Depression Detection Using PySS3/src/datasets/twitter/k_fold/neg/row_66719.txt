The holidays fucking suckObviously there's Christmas and I hate that,but the thing I hate most is my birthday,it's right before Christmas and my birthday has never been fun for me,especially not this year because I'm all alone this year,even if there wasn't this pandemic bullshit going on I'd still be alone,nobody should be alone on their birthday,but here I am with nobody to tell me happy birthday and no one to share a treat with,nothing,I had to resort to buying myself a present this year,maybe that'll make me feel better,I doubt it though. And while we're on the topic of presents I had a great idea,I could give everyone else a present this time and just kill myself on my birthday,then maybe it would actually be a day that would bring someone joy,that would be great. Just thinking about the holiday season makes me tear up,all it is is a reminder of how alone and unlikable I am,because after all if I was likable I wouldn't have to be all alone now would I? It's pretty fucking sad when you're "friends" are musicians who don't know you exist and anime characters that'll never exist,I wish I had a real friend,someone who actually likes and cares about me instead of just pretending to out of pity,I don't want fake friends like that,I just want someone who truly does care. I doubt I'll ever get that though because I don't deserve it,I'm a terrible fucking person and I don't deserve to exist,why should I exist when all I bring is pain and anger into this world,why should I exist when I'm completely useless,I'm not good at anything and it's not like I could contribute to having a job because I have no physical strength,I'm stupid,and I have no social skills,and I couldn't contribute to a relationship because I'm bad at commitment and I'm terribly awkward,and I don't contribute anything at school,I just sit there quietly. What's the point of having life if I can't do anything with it,I'm a sorry excuse for a human being. Well this is getting long and rambley so I should probably just shut up and go back to crying and try to go to sleep because it's 5am and I haven't slept yet,my sleep schedule is fucked and I keep on trying to fix it but it never does get fixed,I don't get why I can't just be a normal fucking person,I wish I could exist in a different realm where I would fit in more,if only
