I am nothing. I have nothing.My husband has been having his "last night of drinking" for three months. After 3 years of problem drinking. This excuses maxing out my card, his card, spending every dime including change from penny jar, getting deposits back at the beer store - it's always the last night so do your worst, right?

For weeks I've worked overtime shifts from 4:30am and again from 8pm-midnight just so we can pay bills. I literally sleep 2 non-consecutive hours each night. I'm a teacher, he hasn't been to work since the 3rd because of "medical leave" AKA he was hungover two days running and then has been drinking every day since. I have to fast for the next 3 weeks which is actually ok, I've done it for weeks before, but also necessary because we don't have any food. He's skinny and can't skip meals, I'm a fucking fatass which is probably partly why the only man who wanted me is a useless, horrible drunk. 

My friends have homes, have families. He's alienated me from everyone - I no longer speak to anyone in my family after one nightmarish drunken episode after another. I have no friends. I have become a drunk, too - at first it was to cope and then it was to keep him from having every drop. I spend most evenings hiding booze from him, hiding cards, hiding keys. He drinks until his head bobs around, until he stumbles and breaks things and 100% denies he's drunk. 

I never should have gone to university. I never should have left that shithole town. I should have married the best farmer and shut my fucking mouth. I hate my life. I hate every day I wake up. 

I hate myself for not doing it already. I've cut my arms open but never deep enough. I hung myself but not privately enough. I've overdosed but barfed most of it up. 

The only thing keeping me alive is knowing he won't take proper care of my dog.
