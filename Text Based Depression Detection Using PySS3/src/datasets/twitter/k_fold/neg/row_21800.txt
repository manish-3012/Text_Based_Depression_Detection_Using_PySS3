Im ashamed and all i wanna do is end it  Got really stressed at work today, had to work kitchen alone and ended up yelling at 2 co-workers. Now they hate me. Im livong out of a motel and working my ass off to try and find a place to live before i ship out. My dad has cancer and i dont even have the time to visit him. I hate myself, i hate typing this because i dont want to be a loser who looks for attention. Idk any.ore.
