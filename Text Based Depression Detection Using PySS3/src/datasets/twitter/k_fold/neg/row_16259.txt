Just so fucking done - 14 years of miserySo I had a realization today - I'm so incredibly, hugely fucking done.

I'm young, I'm a guy at 18, and I live alone and make my own money. Some people would say this is admirable, but I just fucking hate myself. I'll tell you about it...

I've been depressed for fourteen years. I showed the first signs of depression as a literal preschooler. I was put under a microscope because I kept discussing suicide, without even knowing it was a concept. So, I've been done with life basically since my first step out of diapers. I barely knew childhood, and my teenage years were half a decade of isolation, plus one year of all the normal shit, compressed for time

I'm not even distressed. The mental hell I've endured since my childhood has basically killed any emotion in me. I can't connect with people, and the few I have, I end up treating badly, or pushing away. The only friend group I have is evaporating as we speak, and I feel no enjoyment for any of my hobbies.

I live right by the traintracks, and there's a nice big gap to sneak through, no biggie. I'm just sick of it all. I'm not angry, or sad. I'm not crying, and I don't hate anyone else. I just hate myself, and the shitty hand life gave me. I guess it wasn't a shock to find out both depression and suicide runs in the blood.
