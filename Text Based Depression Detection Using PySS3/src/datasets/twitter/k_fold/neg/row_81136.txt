How can I save myself?I've never cut my wrists but when I see a knife, it makes me wanna touch it and try it myself. I have fear of heights but whenever I'm at a top of a building, I often wonder how it feels like to fall in it. How the impact would affect my body.
I have my friends and I'm grateful to have them. My parents who I'm glad to be with but is it weird that I feel that they suffocate me? The pressure and the never ending lectures.
Sometimes I feel like maybe I'm the one who's wrong, the villain in someone's story. 
I'm all sunshines and rainbows but I can still feel this emptiness in my heart.
I somehow found this thread and I just want to vent out my feelings.
