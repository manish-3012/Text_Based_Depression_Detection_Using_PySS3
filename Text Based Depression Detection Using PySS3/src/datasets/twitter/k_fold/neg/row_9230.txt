Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m fucking done. I want to end it all. My anxiety has been a a record high, my parents have been yelling at me to the point where Iâ€™ve stayed up all night arguing with them. Mid terms are coming and Iâ€™m stressed, and to top it off, my girlfriend  called me selfish for trying to get help from her and now sheâ€™ll barely look in my direction. I canâ€™t do this anymore I just fucking canâ€™t.
