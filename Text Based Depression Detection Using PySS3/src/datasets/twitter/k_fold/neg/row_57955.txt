Life sucksThe last year I was truly happy was 2008, ten years ago. It was the year that I graduated High School, the year that I met the love of my life, a year that I saw many great concerts, etc. It was just a year full of extremely amazing things for me. I was happy before 2008 as well for the most part, despite some shitty things happening in my childhood and earlier teen years.

However, ever since 2009 came around, I have hated life. My girlfriend dumped me literally the first day of 2009 (yes New Years Day), my car died, and everything just really sucked that year. Sure, I hung out with friends and stuff and still went to events and what not, but it wasnâ€™t the same. It was weird no longer being in High School, everyone that I knew was going on to bigger and better things, etc. My family started to fall apart too in 2009, following the death of my grandfather in the summer of 2008, who was a center piece of my entire family pretty much, he died young and unexpected, saw him literally the night before he died and he was full of life and himself and the next morning he was dead. But thatâ€™s not what my post is about. 

Every year since 2009 has sucked as well. Iâ€™ve basically been living as a shell of my former self for 10 years (2018 is almost over). The only thing keeping me going is my Mom and a few other members of my family. I hate everything. The only things that make me happy are things of the past. I hate all current music and movies of this decade, and Iâ€™ve tried to get into SO much of it. I just hate life and I donâ€™t even want to do anything to better myself at this point because I just donâ€™t care. I wouldnâ€™t say I am suicidal but I honestly donâ€™t care if I live or die. At this point Iâ€™m like, if I die, I die, fuck it. I have drank more in this year combined than in my entire life for sure. I drink myself to a blackout almost nightly.
