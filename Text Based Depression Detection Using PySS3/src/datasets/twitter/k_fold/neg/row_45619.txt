The thoughts come back and they come back stronger.I am Bipolar, Type 1. I have been medicated for 10 years. I am 24 years old. Suicidal since before I was diagnosed. Just intrusive thoughts. All the time. Even writing this I feel pathetic because why would I kill myself? My family loves me and people see me as happy and care free. No one knows of the darkest thoughts, barely even my journal sees those. Just for all this to end and to never have to worry again sounds ideal. No more of these overwhelming emotions. No more of people not seeing me for who I am. None of the bullshit. The world doesn't need this many people. I know what I mean to my family. This doesn't scratch the surface of the cascade of thoughts I have. I know they're probably silly, selfish thoughts. But they come to mind in every state of mind, every mood swing. Even at my happiest. I feel like I have experienced and accomplished so much already. And I have all the pills I'd ever need to do it right on hand. Any moment I want. Every day I'm trying to convince myself why I should live.
