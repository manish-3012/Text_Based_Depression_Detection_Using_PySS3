I just can't do this shit anymoreHay 22yo male here ,first post in this sub. 

The last 3yrs been pretty fucked up for me ,even more then the rest of my life before that. I got almost beaten to death by members of a big local family clan.When I just tried to save someone else they wanted to kick to death.The lawsuit against them didnt even go before a court before it was shut  down. 

I now have a giant scar on my head and still half a tooth missing. Also I lost my job back then because of PTSD . 

Two uncles of mine died in january and my mother succumbed to her cancer after 3years of fighting.I am currently without work and hadn't much luck finding a new job.Also I am living with a friend of mine ,sleeping on his couch ,crammed between all my stuff in boxes. 

I am burned out ,I dont even wish to talk to anyone anymore ,lost many friends over the last years ,some through their drug habbits ,others through my social anxiety. 

I feel fucking burned out. Like I wont kill myself as that would make life only harder for my family. But fuck do I think about ending it alot. 

Yeah ...I just wanted to vent .. thanks for reading.
