Mum tried to kill herself again.She might be coming home today. Tried to OD for the second time.

What should I say? I really want tell her that she needs stronger meds for her bipolar disorder (type 2), but when I tried to tell her that when I saw her in the hospital, she just said that she needs to be off meds completely. She's on a ton of meds for other problems, so she's obviously very overwhelmed with problems. Some of them she can work on to get off the meds, but I do believe that she should be on stronger meds for bipolar disorder, and be on meds for it [period], as it can, and probably did, lead her to try and commit suicide. Both of the times happened very spontaneously. I think she's only taking Prozac.

I'm going to talk to her about what she wants to get off her cocktail of drugs, but I want to keep pushing her to get better meds for her disorder.

If you're wondering about why I'm thinking so realistically and seemingly emotionless, it's because I don't want to risk it happening again. I'm afraid of the success of her manic actions. I want to get her help before she has the power to process those thoughts again; then, I'll have the time to relax and gather my feelings back.

Is my plan awry? Don't be afraid to ask questions.
