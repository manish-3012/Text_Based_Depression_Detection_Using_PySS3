Psych ward fun timesI'm on a psych ward following a failed attempt. 

You know how you're supposed to feel the "oh no I regret it thank God I lived" thing? That isn't kicking in. 

I shuffle around the ward knowing that if I self harm here I just delay getting off the ward and trying again. 

I feel trapped and stupid for my survival instinct and I'm the level of bored where I may actually just die from that. I just think about what happens when I leave here. 

15 minute checks throughout the night. 

A roommate complaining that her anxiety is too high. Anyone suggests anything to her she just says she's too weak. As soon as anyone isn't looking she magically recovers enough to do it. 

Already agreed to be the assistant manager when the poor manic guy buys the ward and turns it into a hotel. He's going to make millions selling his stick figure drawings to national art galleries. The girl with psychosis is going to be manager. It's going to be brilliant. 

If this ward isn't enough to send me crazier, I'm not sure what would be.
