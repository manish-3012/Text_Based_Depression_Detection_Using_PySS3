Overwhelmed and losing interestFor the past few months Iâ€™ve been completely overwhelmed with life, moving out on my own, car accident, and now it seems my gf and I are not going to work out. Also, pretty confident thatâ€™s sheâ€™s cheating on me. This all just seems like signs that itâ€™s time to just give up. All of this along with the continued struggles of anxiety and depression, these are all battles Iâ€™m losing.
