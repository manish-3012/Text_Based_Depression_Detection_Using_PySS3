I donâ€™t want to die, I just want to understand.52711: Itâ€™s strange, isnâ€™t it? Humans have no reason to suffer, to continue this pain, yet they still do. Why? For what? Youâ€™ll just end up dying. Weâ€™re trapped in an endless cycle. We get born, we learn, we graduate, we find love, we reproduce, we work till weâ€™re old and die.

85910: I canâ€™t seem to understand the world anyways. It feels like thereâ€™s something missing. I keep seeing images that spark some kind of memory. It makes me terribly miserable to not know things. What if the world is just fake? That would make a lot of sense. So there really is no need to live at all.

40192: I always feel like Iâ€™m just another extra. My friends are close with each other, Iâ€™m just another person who they pity. Iâ€™m not interesting. Iâ€™m not confident enough to do stuff. All I can do is quietly laugh. All I do is bring people problems. I wish I didnâ€™t cry all the time. I bet my friends have a harsher life than I have. I always have to listen to them anyways. I have no choice. 

68241: I can't seem to experience true love. I donâ€™t have the ability to like someone. It stresses me out. I mentally break down. Maybe if I just laugh and have fun with them. Just pretend Iâ€™m a kind and polite person whoâ€™s really lively and fun. No one likes someone as sad as me. They only like happy me.

03679: I feel so drained. Iâ€™m wasting my time on nothing. I feel heavy yet light as I slowly lift myself from the ground, but my head pushes me down like a ton of bricks making me slowly closing my eyes. I try to maintain awake. But Iâ€™m just too tired. Tired of what exactly? I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t stay awake at night though. I do try to not sleep at night and save some time left for me to think. But itâ€™s too late. Iâ€™m already asleep. And before I knew it, I had to start the same routine again.

CC: Woah, you sound like you have some serious issues. Maybe go to a therapist?
M: I donâ€™t have access to therapy, unfortunately.
CC: Maybe rest?

M: Rest? As in like taking a day off?

CC: Yeah, you know, having a break?

M: My parents would never let me. Theyâ€™d tell me Iâ€™m being over dramatic.

CC: Okay, well uh, talk to a friend.

M: What friend? All my friends get awkward and â€œgtgâ€ so I donâ€™t feel like neither of us would be comfortable talking about this.

CC: Maybe tell your parents about how you feel?

M: I can't explain stuff. Iâ€™ll probably cry. My parents hate me crying. Theyâ€™ll hit me if I do. Theyâ€™ll also tell me off for explaining to them.

CC: Maybe process your brain?

M: I donâ€™t know when to start. Iâ€™m too tired to think.

CC: Maybe just vent? Like write things out?

M: That's actually a good idea, though my vents include emotion and I feel like that is what I donâ€™t need people to know about me.
