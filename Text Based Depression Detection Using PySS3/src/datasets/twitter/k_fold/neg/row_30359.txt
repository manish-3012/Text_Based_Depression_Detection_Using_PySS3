The holidays are so so hard.After the crap show that was last year for the holidays, I donâ€™t want to be around to deal with the pain this year. My boyfriend uninvited me to Christmas with his family, and for my birthday he decided to not send time with me, but instead spent the day playing with his truck. 
He says Iâ€™m being too rash with not wanting to be here for the holiday season. Iâ€™ve struggled with rejection my whole life, and I was rejected both those holidays. He didnâ€™t tell his family he said I couldnâ€™t go, Instead made it look like I just didnâ€™t want to be there. 
Iâ€™m struggling so hard, any advise?
