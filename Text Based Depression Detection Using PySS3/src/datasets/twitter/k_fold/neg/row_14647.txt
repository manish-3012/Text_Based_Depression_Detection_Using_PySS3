Suicide cause I'm an ugly Asian guyIt's been over a year since my first suicide attempt and I don't even regret it. Sometimes I regret not finishing through with it. I'm sick and tired of dumb asses saying it'll get better, because that's NOT how the world works. The universe doesn't give 2 shits about you.

I will slowly begin carrying out my suicide plan. Once I have everything ready, I will commit suicide. The only thing that will stop me is if I find a girlfriend.

Fuck all you ignorant hypocrite assholes for lying to my face, telling me that I'm not unattractive. Fuck you for taking away my God damn right to make an informed suicide decision. Fuck American society for not being able to accept being labeled as average.

I've never had a girlfriend or touched a girl in any sexual way before, or been approached by one either. And I'm already over 21 years old, approaching wizard-status.

You will never understand the pain of being a 5'7" Asian guy with an ugly weird face, 6" wrists, and a naturally runty bone structure. You will never understand how it's like being someone who constantly knows, day in and day out, how unfortunate it is to be an Asian guy when it comes to dating. You will never understand the depths of my self-hatred and sense of defeatism. If you were even remotely in a similar situation to the one I am in now, you'd be suicidal too. You might even go on a killing spree like Elliot Rodger.

I'm done talking to you people.

Don't you tell dare tell me that I shouldn't commit suicide, because I don't expect you to understand. I bet you've had intimate experiences or believe you have some hope left in the sexual marketplace. Yeah, just shut the fuck up
