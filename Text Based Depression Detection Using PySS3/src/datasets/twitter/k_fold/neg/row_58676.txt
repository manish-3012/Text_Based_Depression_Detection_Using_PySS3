Correct way to respond to suicide risk on reddit?Hi all, I'm looking for some guidance here.

On a subreddit I post on recently, someone made a post that indicated they wanted to commit suicide.  It was not a specific, very urgent threat, but it didn't feel trivial either.  Their reddit history indicated they've been thinking about this for some months.

The default reaction, including mine, was to say 'Please get help' and post suicide prevention hotline numbers and websites.  My own specific wording was as follows:
>your life is valuable. Please find the help you need. Others want to help you and they have helped others like you before.  {Links to hotlines in OP's country}

However, I then came on here to read advice, and am worried that I said or did the wrong thing and that that default reaction is unhelpful after reading the sidebar [info](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/).  Is what I/we said and did what is meant here when we're advised to "Avoid advice and solutions"?  What would a better response have been, in case this come up in the future?

Many thanks for any help or advice you can offer.
