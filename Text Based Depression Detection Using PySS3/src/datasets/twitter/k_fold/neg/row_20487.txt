Iâ€™m 16. Iâ€™m a failure. I canâ€™t do anything right. Everyone hates me. I am a waste of existence. My time is up. Goodbye everyone even though I am hated by many. I feel this is the only way out.Hello

I am 16, horrible grades, failed my driving permit (Iâ€™m half a year late also), failed club that didnâ€™t get approved, no weight loss, everyone in my family hates me, my friends are very few and donâ€™t contact much, I have not eaten in 3 days due to my depression, no relationship, I ran for an associated student body position and lost, I am a failure, I donâ€™t believe in God (so no â€œsuicide is a sinâ€ can help me), have started using drugs (alcohol, marijuana, etc) to cope with my mental pain, I have no father, no family at all living me, I am literally a failure, I donâ€™t think I can recover, I am too far gone, no one will take me seriously because Iâ€™m 16 so my problems donâ€™t exist.

You may say I have a whole life ahead of me, that may be true, a life full of depression and failure, one where everyone hates me.

I have nothing to offer, I am as my aunt said â€œa wasteâ€

So for those reasons, itâ€™s time for me to go. Itâ€™s been a nice experience here on this fucked up and cruel world, but my time is over. Iâ€™ve tried everything, losing weight - failure, driving - failure, grades - failure. Meanwhile, everyone around me is accomplishing what I fail to do.

Goodbye everyone, my suicide note is written; however, no one will care as I am an irrelevant failure and pest in society.
