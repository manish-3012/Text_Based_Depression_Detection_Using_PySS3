Why can't I go through with it?I honestly don't know why I am here, not just on this site making this post but alive at all. I feel like the small amount of people who see this won't make much of a difference anyway seeing how everyone's only response is don't do it. I know that suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem, I also know that I have been given all the chances at success. But life just seems so pointless, every morning i struggle just to get out of bed. thinking to myself today should be the day i finally go through with it. I have constant dreams of pulling the trigger, wishing every time i wake up that i could just feel normal. i just want this to go away, either the feelings to go away so i can try and live a happy life, or finally have the courage to actually end it. I always back out, im too afraid of failing. if i mess it up ill be forced to keep going in agonizing pain. and i feel like i already suffer enough. idk why im making this post anyway, probably cause i just want to feel validated or some bs. please just ignore me
