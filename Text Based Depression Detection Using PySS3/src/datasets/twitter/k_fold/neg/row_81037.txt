No one? I've never found a good person in a year, always bad people, really bad people. I think this is a sign I should kill myself.I'm at a point where I am just completely desperate, don't even want to check my posts cause I'm probably getting trolled or down voted. All I meet in this world now is bad people the good people are gone. This loneliness, this ignorance of mine has brought me pain. I'm gonna end up getting myself killed or killing myself.

This desperation of mine really ruined me, I've never felt so angry in my life, I'm ready to get my pills ready.
