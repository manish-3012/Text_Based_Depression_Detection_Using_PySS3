I've lived through abuse, poverty, neglect, three mental illnesses, and alcoholism. They always said it would get better, the opposite is true.I used to be afraid to die, that is, until recently. I finally figured out the perfect way to kill myself.

I think I was holding onto some hope that my boyfriend would actually start to change. I'm at the point where I think I might hate him. There's a lot of resentment from previous issues, I'll spare the long backstory. Honestly I have felt that I should have left a while ago, but he is all I have left. We've been together for 4 years, and I think we are poisonous to each other. I think we've ruined each other's lives. Often I think to myself, "What would my life have been like if I had left 3 years ago?" I'm a terrible girlfriend and person, I know. I feel guilty for thinking these things. I want to love him, but...it's gone. I can't force it anymore. 

I realized tonight that I am little more than a source of convenient comfort to him. His mom was crazy abusive and a psychopath. I am filling that hole in him that requires attention and unconditional love. Basically, I am his mom, in a really fucked up way. He talks in a childish tone, is very immature, and whines a lot. He literally acts like a child, and I am the mother that has to scold him when he doesn't pay bills on time, or forgets to do something important...

When he left tonight to play games with friends, even after he saw the state I was in, that was the final straw. I lost all hope.

So yeah, my life is a lie. My parents ruined my childhood, and only pay attention to me when they feel like it. I have no family, no friends, nothing. Even my relationship is a sham. My cat is going to die soon, so maybe it's better I die before her to avoid the pain.

Well, I've gone on and ranted for no reason. I guess I just want to see if someone will read this and care. I know that's pathetic, but, I am.
