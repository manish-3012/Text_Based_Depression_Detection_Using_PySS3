I canâ€™t anymoreItâ€™s not that I want to die is that I canâ€™t bare to live , I have a few reasons to stay but itâ€™s so painful to get up every morning without telling my family Iâ€™m cutting up my skin and feel like a steaming pile of shit . 

My friends try , theyâ€™re trying to get me to stop SH but now Iâ€™ve just had an argument with my bestie about her having time to fuck her boyfriend daily but none to phone me once every now and then . My other bestie has fallen out with her about it too , and now I feel like the promise I made to them really doesnâ€™t mean anything to them . 

I donâ€™t want to hurt my family like this , but I donâ€™t want to feel hurt like this anymore . 

Every time I think about killing myself it becomes more real , and more like an option . 
I can see myself jumping off a bridge or slitting my wrists . I can see that as a possibility, no , a probability. I mean , we all die eventually , isnâ€™t it better to know when itâ€™s coming and make the choice before time makes it for you ? 

I hate how Iâ€™m stuck , Iâ€™m more than stuck. Iâ€™m trapped . In a box full of water with no access to air . Iâ€™m drowning, and with every second Iâ€™m spiralling I can feel myself letting go of what I had and being glad I can be free from all I felt . 

I  know how to smile and laugh , I just donâ€™t have the key ingredient. Hope .
