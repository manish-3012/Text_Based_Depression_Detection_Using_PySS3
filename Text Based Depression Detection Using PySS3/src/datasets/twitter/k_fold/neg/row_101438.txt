I'm too scared to phone Samaritans. I don't know what the fuck is going on so I can't explain so no one understands how bad things are.I have to keep going because I'm about to move in with friends and if I back out they'll be left with no apartment and hate me forever. I can't stop university and take a year out because I'm already older and can't take another year out and move back in with my mum.

I am stuck with a chronic illness and my dad is dead and I can't kill myself because my mum has already lost her own mother be her husband but I can't keep going I'm so tired and trapped. I have weird tics in my left arm from stress and start spasming and make weird noises with my voice, i talk to myself and stutter and repeat every word 5 times because I have an obsession with the number 5. I want to die so much this is a worse nightmare than I ever could have imagined I didn't know levels of hell were this possible without suffering a complete mental breakdown.

I wish I would finally snap so I didn't have to make any more decisions because I don't know what the fuck to do.
