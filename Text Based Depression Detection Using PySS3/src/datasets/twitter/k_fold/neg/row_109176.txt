I am the worst person I know.My third night on the street. 
Left my room rental 3 days ago.
Never really told anyone.
Friends and family kinda realize what has happened.
Now they've started reaching out.
I don't answer.
Later this afternoon i just bought an sleeping bag and a skinning knife.
My plan was to slowly move east onfoot.
I knew it was absurd. I knew I wouldn't last.
The knife was my last resort. 
What shall I do. 
I just couln't go back.
Yet I feel a strong aura of remorse, guilt shrouding me.
I can't look at them with a staright face.

Pls be honest and tell me how horrible I am.
Why can't I just die?
It's what I want.
