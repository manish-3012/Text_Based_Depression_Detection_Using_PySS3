Having a rough night with the thoughts and ideations and pain.Just nearing a breaking point again. Making my plans. Reality doesn't feel real and all I had to look forward to is gone thanks to my crazy ex. I'm thinking of lighting myself on fire and cutting and just burning while I bleed. She made me crazy and probably crazier than her. It's ideations at this point but god I just can't handle it anymore. I wish I was dead every day I wake up. I have no purpose in life anymore and I'm even losing motivation to ask for help as I type this. Is it worth it anymore to wake up and live??
