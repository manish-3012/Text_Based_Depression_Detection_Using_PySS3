I can't visualize a scenario that doesn't end with me ending my life soon.I was picked on a lot as a kid, both at home (by everyone) and at school (where I'd fight back, get suspended then blamed at home for merely defending myself). Around 12-13 my dad beat the living shit out of me over nothing, and since then I've been reliving every bad thing that ever happened to me over and over again in my mind. When I approached my folks about my depression and desire to kill myself, they responded with amusement and arrogance. I've never stopped fantasizing about killing them and anyone else who has crossed me in my life. Despite this, I did a successful tour in the navy and thought all those feelings were behind me as I went home to start school. Now, years after my tour, I have 40-odd credits and a great GPA but this year I've dropped 99% of my classes despite repeatedly trying to get back into top gear. 2011 I was the wonderboy, and 2012 has been a living hell. In the middle of the year a roommate and I (a guy twice my age) tried moving a couple lbs. of pot across the country, but we got caught and he took the rap. I bailed him out and paid for his lawyer and he lingers in pre-trial limbo. We tried it because 1. I love weed and have no moral issue selling the world's best drug and 2. the profits would have been enough to live off of for a while. Of course after the fact I wonder how I could have been so fucking stupid.

Now my GI Bill isn't enough to live off of, I'm desperate for a job but can't find anything, and if I don't at least get some seasonal work at fedex this afternoon I'm going to get the longest knife I can and drive it into my chest and bleed into the rio grande until someone finds my body.

I've tried treating my depression and PTSD (from the iraq war and some shipboard experiences involving a fire) since I had a total mental breakdown last december (in fact pretty much every year that time since getting out) but I really hate talking to clinical types as they all say the same fucking things and the drugs they perscribe (ive tried zoloft and prozac) make me feel like I'm dying.

I'm very far from any of my old friends, I've reconciled a little with my folks who live in this part of the country but frankly it's too little too late with them. I stick by my buddy who took the rap for me because he's the only person outside the service who would ever do anything like that for me. As opposed to when I talk to my mom, hearing her voice is nails on chalkboard and hearing her opinions on my life makes me want to grab her by the neck and slam her head into a wall after remembering how she acted when I needed her to listen to me back in the day.

I'm just sick of how no matter how good I'm doing, there's still an endless spinning conflict with people who aren't even there in my head and I'll have screaming arguments and fights inside my mind for minutes to hours until I catch myself doing it and try to remember that things really aren't that bad. Even so, I have only ever pretended to make a connection with people, and as a result I feel like I can never get into a long-term relationship with a girl, which is hard because I'm VERY GOOD at being a boyfriend in general, in all aspects. I just can't keep it up for long with any one person because of course the more time you spend with someone, the novelty wears off and I become distant and strange to them so I leave before I can hurt anyone.

I've tried finding work, but I feel like an alien everywhere I go and every trip to hunt for a job uses gas money and food money that I have no way of getting back until my severely reduce GI bill comes in for the final time at the end of this month and I'll have enough to MAYBE help with rent and bills and nothing left to do anything with. I have to get this job, or I'm not going to have the strength to keep going.

I so much want to die and be free of these feelings, and of constantly struggling and doing everything I'm asked and then either getting nothing out of it or losing my head and ruining an opportunity. I dropped every single class this semester after a girl nearly ran me off the highway, flipped me off, and I chased her all the way to campus with the full intention of strangling her to death.

I try to tell myself that there are many people who have it worse, but with so many people who either never had the ability to do what I've done in the service and people who are born and die trapped in one spot, either for a moment or a lifetime, I still can't get over the feeling of wanting to kill myself. I don't want help, I just want to die and my biggest disappointment right now is that there's no nonviolent way to do it. I have no meds I could use, I don't have a gun for a quick and easy kill. I'm pretty set on either hanging myself from a tree out in the wilderness or the knife thing because if I do it far enough into the desert, no one will be able to help me before I bleed to death. I don't want to die in a house, I would rather die out in nature.

I do talk to a Vet Center therapist, who is a little different from the actual VA guys and gals, but even my vet center contact is kind of a broken record and none of this therapy fixes my problems, which as of the beginning of next month will become considerably worse. I have so much debt now after looking over the horizon and thinking "ok, I've got this and this going on and if I work hard and keep at it I will be ok soon" but that never happens, everything just gets worse either by circumstance or by my own seeming desire to fail and end up worthless.

This is a mouthful so I'll end it here, I just wanted to get it off my chest. I have glimmers or feeling not to bad sometimes, but I'm absolutely certain that sometime next year I'm going to end it, and having lived a life of at least some travel, and world experience, would that really be the worst thing in light of the pain I'm feeling? I would rather die than have a child and risk putting him/her through anything like what I went through.
