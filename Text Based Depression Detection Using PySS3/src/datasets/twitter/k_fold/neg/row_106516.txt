I really don't know what to put hereI really don't know how to start this either, I guess first off I'll just say thank you for reading this, I don't really know what to do with my life (This will be long so no worries of you don't read)

(If this is in the wrong subreddit, I'm sorry! I thought this would belong on /r/depression but I don't want any people over there to think about suicide because I know what it's like)

My whole life I've kind of had trouble, I'm stuck between being a completely socially awkward introvert, and a outgoing easy to socialise person, (I'm without a doubt definently on the introverted side, but I still sometimes crave social things and I hate it) I don't get along well with pretty much all teenagers, a rough estimate being 90%, I get along fine with children and adults but despise being with teenagers and people around the similar age as me (don't get me wrong, I'm fine with teens as long as they aren't bad people)
I still really don't know why I'm making this post, I guess to vent... A short summary of my life, I've had problems with school pretty much all of my life, not academically, I strive with academics, but because of my peers, I had years where I would only go to school once every two weeks ish, I was scared out of my mind by stuff that happened there

Once I got into highschool, I was completely fine for the first or so year, but downwards spiral, I had 'friends' who I thought I could completely trust, as my whole life I've never really had many friends, but they ended up stabbing me in the back, lots of other things but that's what comes to mind right now, after all this I became scared of school again, grades dropping, cycle of "Oh hahaha why are you barely at school, can you not handle this?" making it worse

Then about a year and a half ago, my rollercoaster ride happened... I met a girl online, we fell in love pretty quickly together (before you start thinking this is a catfish story, no it's not don't worry), she was my first ever and I was a hopeless romantic; I dreamt of a future of just us together forever basically a cliche disney plot, she was basically the same
We dated for a bit more than a year, planned future together and such, and me being me, I ruined it all

During all of that time, I've seen multiple psych's, I'm on antidepressants (fluxotine if it matters) which I had to fight tooth and nail for, the psych's were very against it because I was a teen, but the antidepressants have helped me alot, but I'm not so sure about them, they kind of just numb me down, that's how it feels... But it makes me so much less depressed which takes stress and pressure of my family, so I have no problems there, I do schooling online, so not much reason to leave the house which I'm thankful for

Now... I still get bouts of depression, even when I don't feel depressed I want to kill myself, I know it's cliche but I have nothing to live for, my family would be the only reason I haven't yet, plus I'm a coward and afraid of failing and any pain... Things are looking brighter now but I still just want to die, it's literally the easiest thing to do, and even though I know it wouldn't help people close to me emotionally, it would help them financially, and their emotional pain would ease after a while.. If I were offered a choice between living, or just erasing my existence, I'm pretty sure I'd go with the latter... It would be beneficial to pretty much everyone, I just cause pain and stress to people.
I'm curious if there's any methods that are kind of just like "erasing your existence" I've done alot of research about suicide, but all of them have their risks, and the ones that seem appealing are hard to setup or may cost lots of money

I'm sorry if I broke any rules or such, but thank you for reading. Has anyone been or is going through a similar situation?

I hope this isn't breaking any rules but, to any lurkers reading this, as cliche as it is know you're **not** alone, can't say if things get better in life, everyone has different circumstances, but you have nearly a whole community on this subreddit if you do need somebody, I wish you luck
Thank you for reading, I really appreciate you doing that for another human being (you kind human being, you *are* appreciated &lt;3) I got pretty anxious about posting this but oh well
