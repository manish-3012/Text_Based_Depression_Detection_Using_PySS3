Feels like I'm losing my mindSome time around december, I started getting depressed. I was doing super well in life, and then suddenly my progress paused and I just sort of fell into this. I started feeling sad, anxious, the whole works. Then my life started back up again, and great things happened in my life, but I'm only getting more anxious and depressed as it happens and that's affecting what's happening in my life. I got accepted into a prestigious and exclusive improv comedy group, but as I feel like I'm spiralling out of control, I can't perform anymore and I feel like I'm a burden and the group regrets accepting me. My schoolwork is getting affected and my grades are dropping because my mind is always elsewhere. Worst of all, I just can't seem to talk to people anymore and I feel like all the people/friends I have, new and old, see me as some sort of freak right now because I'm really struggling to talk and be social. My mind is just constantly racing and miserable, and I don't know how to fix it. I don't think I could ever commit suicide, but I certainly have started thinking about it a decent amount and that scares me, because I don't want to think about it, and I'm afraid I might actually consider it if my life continues in its current direction. I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks
