Looking for a reason to live...Hello! I have suffered from depression for years and it has gotten to the point where it is really starting to affect my physical health. I have been through a lot... got kidnapped, had to sell my old home and move to an apartment that I don't like to live in, caught one of the most painful illnesses in the world from a mosquito bite. I lost my ability to walk from the illness, needless to say I lost my job and was slowly losing mobility in every single joint of my body and the pain was so great that I mostly lost the ability to feel pain as a result. I had no choice but to live with my parents that I do not get along with at all... in fact I thought that in my weakness my mother might kill me because she can have random violent outbursts at times.  And my dog died from cancer.
  
Yes I know sob story blah blah. I don't really care about the past... I got over all that eventually, even my illness and recovered the ability to walk (but not the ability to feel pain) even though this particular illness might never heal but it will go in a dormant state that can strike back at any point of my life. To top it all off I suffer from a mental illness called Prosopagnosia which means I struggle with telling two people apart and therefore have difficulties with maintaining long-term relationships and tend to stay away from people because of it (it is very awkward not having a clue of who anybody is half of the time).

I have no intentions of killing myself but it seems like my body has different ideas so I want you guys to cheer me up with things like why you wake up in the morning? What are YOUR reasons to live? I want to have one, too.
