Therapists never understand who I am. All they see is a walking diagnosis, not a person. Everything I say is a symptom and not to be believed. Iâ€™m never a person who could possibly have normal reactions. Iâ€™m ill not brain damaged and with low IQ ffs.Fuck them all.
Fuck them ALL..
I have bipolar and BPD and PTSD.
What turned me off is they believe I have PTSD but not from what I claim gave it to me.
I had months long withdrawals from a drug they put me on and took me off and it was so horrendous I have flashbacks till this day and it ends in me having breakdowns.
But oh no no. It cannot be that.
It must have been my anxiety in their opinion.
Iâ€™m manifesting  symptoms from my illness.
No way those withdrawals were that bad? F
Fuck them. Iâ€™m thankful for the support from benzobuddies.org

Iâ€™m also just done with life. Tried for 30 yrs. 
Iâ€™m dead inside and just waiting for my pets to go. I could never live without them.
