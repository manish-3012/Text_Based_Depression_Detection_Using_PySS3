I want to stop hurting, but i don't want to hurt anyoneI wish people in my life could understand if i died i wouldn't be in pain. Every fucking minute of my life is spent in constant agony. I want this to end, but all i'd do is pass the hurt onto others and i can't do that. Maybe i could run away, or just continue getting high as hell to numb it. Whatever fuck it. Everyday i care less and less.
