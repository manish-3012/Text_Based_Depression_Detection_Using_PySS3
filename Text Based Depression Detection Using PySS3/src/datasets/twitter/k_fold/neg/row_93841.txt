I finally told my dad. I sent him a message to him how I felt for the past yearâ€œI just need to tell you this now to get this over with. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for the past couple of months. I have no hope for my future and I hate myself as a person

Those days where I showed up to work looking upset wasnâ€™t because I didnâ€™t want to work, itâ€™s because the night before I would stay up reading and posting suicide forums and looking for reasons to keep going. Or I would be at work and think about how I wanted to die when I got back home.

I would always have breakdowns to the point where I couldnâ€™t breathe whenever you werenâ€™t around or when you were sleeping. 

When you asked me if I was fine, I wouldnâ€™t respond because it was so hard for me to tell you that I wanted to die. 

I havenâ€™t done anything yet because itâ€™s hard when you have a family that tells you how much they love you all the time.

Iâ€™m sorry I kept this from you for so long but I hope you wonâ€™t be mad for me telling you this. Itâ€™s no oneâ€™s fault that I feel this way itâ€™s only because of the decisions I make that I feel this way. 

I love you and I promise to keep going and not hurt myselfâ€
