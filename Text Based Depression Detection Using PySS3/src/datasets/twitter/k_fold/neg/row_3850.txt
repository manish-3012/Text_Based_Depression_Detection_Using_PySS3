Everything looks bleakI've overcome suicidal thoughts before, and I guess I was stupid for thinking they'd never come back but.. here I am. The thing that scares me this time is that I can't see anything. My future is blurry, almost like I can't have one, or even like I've already killed myself. That's why this time feels so dreadful, last time I overcame suicidal thoughts it was because I looked forward to everything I could do, not all my mistakes. Now all I see is blurry images of life without me. I'm afraid.
