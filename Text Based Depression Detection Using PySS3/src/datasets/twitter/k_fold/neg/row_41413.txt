I should've killed myself when I was a teen.i'm 20 now, and perhaps it's the feeling of responsibility that scares me away from attempting to kill myself. back then when i was a teen, i felt less pressured to act in a socially acceptable way. now, there's just so much trouble i'd be in if i committed suicide.
