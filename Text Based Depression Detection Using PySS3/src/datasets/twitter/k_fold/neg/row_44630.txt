Kind of at my wits end hereWelp. Iâ€™m not really sure where to begin.
I am a 30 year old living in America. I grew up on the coast. I still have both my parents although theyâ€™ve never been together. My brother and I do not speak often or candidly. 4 years ago I left everyone and everything I knew for a job I knew I didnâ€™t want.
Running didnâ€™t help. Iâ€™m more boring now than I ever have been. I was popular in high school and made strong connections in college. I fucked up my studies thoroughly and never finished. Havenâ€™t spoken to a single person from college since.
Iâ€™ve never had sex. Iâ€™ve only looked at porn a few times and it made me anxious. I do occasionally masturbate but I have a unique fetish that is harmless but brutally embarrassing. I have no idea how I â€œgot it.â€ Been this way since puberty. Not well-endowed either so I have never even tried to get laid and try to make it work.
On top of this, I have a body Iâ€™ve ruined through extremely rapid weight gain and intense alcohol abuse. I was very handsome even just a few years ago, itâ€™s crazy how things can spiral.
Lying here in my bed, going on 6 months of therapy, and my 3rd day sober, my biggest streak in many years. All I can think about is how much Iâ€™ve wasted and how lost I am. I donâ€™t mean to spin a sob story, but Iâ€™ve said more here than I have in therapy. I donâ€™t feel like I will ever â€œcatch upâ€ to the rest of you all and I doubt I will make it to 40. I think something must have happened to me when I was young or maybe I was born with crossed wires. Either way, I am at least grateful to live with the internet, even if nobody reads this.
