Is this where I put a depressing title explaining how 
full of selfpity I am?I dont know where to start writing this, and I'm surprised I'm even writing here. So yeah.. I'm 17, I live in the middle of nowhere, I don't go to school, I'm unemployed, and I'm so fucking alone.

I have been alone all my life. No one ever invited me anywhere and if I wanted to hang out with anyone I always felt as if I pushed myself onto them. I never felt welcome anywhere and I still don't. I guess this is the main cause of why I can never trust people and I why I shy away from every single social interraction I can now. And if I have to talk to anyone I freeze and spend an eternity figuring out what to reply and I mostly end up stuttering something no one (including myself) can't understand.

I can't see how I have any future anymore either. My family is swimming in debt and I'm not sure if I can start school again as starting school would mean me having to move out and get my own appartment. Because the rent near the school is sky high, my parents would have to help me financially. And I would have to work, which I can't because of my social anxiety. I'm not sure if I can even manage being in school anymore either. I'm just so anxious around people and its become much worse recently. Its so bad that I have trouble talking to anyone online/irl at all. It was the reason I dropped out of school this year and the year before that.

I'm just sick of trying anymore. I just fail.
My childhood was shit, my life now is shit, and I have no future. I feel its all coming to an end soon. An end where I'll just disappear and no one other than my family would know I even existed. 

I just cant deal with all this alone anymore, which I guess is why I'm posting here. I hope someone can help me find a solution for my problems. I have tried so long now to see solutions instead of problems, but I'm just tired now.

note: sorry for writing a wall of text
