I am invisible.and yet, I don't want the people I care about to start noticing me again. though it seems like im a ghost, and they all forget so easily that im there, i guess that makes it easier for me to die, right? 

I've been watching triggering content for awhile cause I don't know what else to do. I wish I could just get the courage to do it. I want to empty myself of all the life force in me. the only thing keeping me here is the small amount of curiosity i have of where my life might go. if i dont do it now, though, im prolly gonna do it someday.
