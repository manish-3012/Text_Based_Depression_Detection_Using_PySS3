I just want it to be over.I just wanted a normal life. A life where I can socialize. Instead im a lazy fuck who sits on the computer all day because I have no life. I'm a lazy piece of shit and I can't get anythign done. Im homeschooled with 1 single friend that I haven't talked to in months. I dont want a life where I can't fit in. I dont care for anyone. I don't have feelings. At this point I dont care if anyone loves me or not. whether they feel pain after I'm gone or not. I just wanted a normal life. I want it to be over. I wan't to go to sleep forever. I cant even do this. I don't know if I should just run away and live a hard life in the wilderness or just to leave it all. the life I wan't to live isn't possible. I dont know what to do. I cut my wrists with a dull knife everyday and only get a couple drops of blood. i just... want it to be over... I cant get help. I cant talk to my friend because he's so young to understand. I have no one to talk to about this. im 13 and i have nothing left in life. I just want it to be over.
