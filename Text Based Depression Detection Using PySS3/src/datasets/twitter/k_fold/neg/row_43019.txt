I have to go to court tomorrow for my suicide attempt because police were called (Iâ€™m underage).And Iâ€™m just feeling so overwhelmed, not just by this but everything. But this is just sending my panic over the edge. Iâ€™m really afraid of going to juvie. I think Iâ€™m really close to attempting today.
