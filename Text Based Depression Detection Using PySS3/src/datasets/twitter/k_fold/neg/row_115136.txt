Don't want to live anymoreI'm 23 and the past 3 years of my life have been my own hell. A monumental situation happened 3 years ago and ever since then I am nothing. I bipolar, maybe. I just can't handle feeling like this the rest of my life, and I most certainly will. I am a child of 2 alcoholics, a severely depressed mother who never showed any ounce of self love for herself (that lovely trait has been given to me). It's like I'm bred to hate myself. 



I don't want to live because I know for sure that I will never be different. I will forever be depressed and unhappy and I just don't want to go on day after day doing this. People can sense something wrong with me because they always stay away. It's like who I am is toxic. And it is, because I'm not right in the mind. 


Everyday I know I am worthless and meaningless in this huge world. I know I can't make a difference. I know I'm a psychological mess that's good for nothing. No one likes to be around me. I hate being around myself, and I have to live with me 24/7/365. The thought of going on for the rest of my life makes me want to die even more. 


There's nothing I can do. I go to the gym everyday, I am social but since my life is a constant state of nothing and depression and hiding from everyone I lose any friends I make. If they manage to get past the depression I lose them with talk about how much I hate life and myself. Everyone is moving on with their lives, falling in love getting married starting families, starting careers, buying first homes, meeting new people in jobs, moving to new places. They're all so happy and everything seems right with everyone. Why am I this monumental fuck up?
