I hate this feeling of being suicidal and not suicidal at the same timeSometimes Iâ€™ll go on walks with my dog and I feel like everythingâ€™s going to be okay in that moment. Or when I do the dishes, my mind is just focused on cleaning them. But Iâ€™ll get triggered by one little thing or I get a flashback to some bad memory, and I become suicidal again. I hate being sensitive and not knowing when Iâ€™ll feel suicidal again. My mind is always on alert mode and never rests. I forget what itâ€™s like not to be suicidal, even though I wasnâ€™t 3 years ago.
