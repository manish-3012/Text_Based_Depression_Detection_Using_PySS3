There's no hope is there?I'm in a really bad place right now, I'm overwhelmed with the stress of all that's going on in the world as well as personal strife, writing this i'm having a panic attack because things have actually gotten this bad that I am here writing this. 

I screwed myself so bad with my depression, i stopped caring about anything and now I'm going to be homeless cause i don't have rent money which is due tomorrow, i just got a huge bill for the electric which they're cutting off, and my bank is in the negative, i can't breathe, none of my friends believe me anymore and I feel like I'm spinning in a tornado, i just don't know what to do and i'm so scared... i tried talking to the landlord, told him i do not have the money, i am unemployed due to COVID cuts,  i can't find other work, he knows this.. but he won't budge and says if i don't have it by tomorrow... he's going to start eviction which our state is allowing because protections for rent due to COVID, it's gone now... it's gone and i'm absolutely f'd. I'm such a failure.  

i could have died in december from the flu, i truly think that i should have, i'm such a burden on everyone.
