Is suicide ever the right answer?I know this is a suicide prevention subreddit but I want to hear takes on this 

Say someone is an awful person and hurt a lot of people and likely wonâ€™t change, not a murderer or rapist, but still a really bad person. Would suicide be right in this situation to prevent harm to more people?
