Just got out of the ERFirst time drinking and I had 12 shots of vodka. I was so far gone. I guess I was talking about killing myself so my sober friend on voice chat called 911 on me. 

Just got out. Parents started talking about college application to me. Mom only asked where I got the vodka since Iâ€™m 20. Dad gave me a short hug. No â€œI love youâ€s. No â€œWe were so worried about youâ€. Nothing.

I canâ€™t do this to my friends. Iâ€™m taking myself out of their social circle.

Next time I get my hands on alcohol Iâ€™m drinking alone like I originally planned. And maybe Iâ€™ll die. Itâ€™ll be good.
