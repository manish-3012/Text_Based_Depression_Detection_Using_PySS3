I canâ€™t stand the idea of continuing to liveThereâ€™s nothing to look forward to. Suffer through constant stress and loneliness in college until I get a degree for a job Iâ€™ll hate. If I even manage to get my worthless ass hired that is. And then live through the mundanity of a work week and come home to no one for the rest of my life. 

If I liked myself, maybe Iâ€™d be able to handle being on my own until I die. But I really fucking hate myself. I donâ€™t want to be stuck with myself for my entire life, so why the hell would someone else?

I have no motivation anymore. My only goal now is to learn how to stop being a coward for long enough to put a rope around my neck. Hopefully it comes sooner rather than later.
