Alone with my thoughts...contemplating everythingToday is not a good day. Nothing has happened. Just my brain bringing to mind all the evidence that nobody really cares about me. Just when you tell yourself it's not true, something happens that almost proves you right and wrong at the same time. 

I don't matter as much to people as they do to me. I'm not important. Only good for what people can get out of me...which is everything I could ever give. I give of myself so much...I care too much, thinking that people care about me too. 

They don't.

I had a therapist once. They told me I had to learn to accept what is. Well, 'what is' sucks. Reality is...people use me. I let myself get used and played, I guess. I'm desperate and naÃ¯ve. Whatever.

I'm an inconvenience. Nobody wants to hear my vents. Nobody wants to comfort me. I could send a text saying I'm stuck on the side of the road and I'd just be left on read. I don't matter. 

I just want to disappear....when will it all stop.
