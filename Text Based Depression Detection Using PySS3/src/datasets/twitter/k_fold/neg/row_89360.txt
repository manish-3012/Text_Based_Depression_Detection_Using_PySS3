In purgatoryAfter my breakup in May, Iâ€™ve lost most of the essential essence that makes me, me. Iâ€™m a shell of myself. I donâ€™t know how to move on.

It feels like Iâ€™ve already lived my (28m) happily ever after. Iâ€™ve already accomplished my degrees and a great job, but I have no interest in anything, let alone a future. 

Long story short, I was betrayed and stolen from by the woman I never thought would one day screw me over. 

Any advise on how to get out of this rut?

Iâ€™m in therapy and taking my SSRIâ€™s, but nothing really dulls the pain for what I perceive as s meaningless existence.
