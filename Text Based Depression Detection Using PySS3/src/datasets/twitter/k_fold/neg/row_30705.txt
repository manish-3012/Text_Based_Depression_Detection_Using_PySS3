I'm missing somethingRecently I've been forcing myself to join a few clubs at my uni to meet some people. But every time I talk to someone it doesn't go anywhere.

I just feel like there's some.....charisma or energy that everyone but me seems to have.  I just can't ever seem to find that rhythm.

They say I just haven't found my people yet, but I just don't think they exist.

I mean, I have passion for things, I can get excited about stuff. But I just don't ever talk to someone and feel like.....I'm not playing a game of chess against them.

It's hard to convince people to like me, they just have so many better options I'm sure. They could talk to literally anyone else.

I don't think suicide would be as bad as living the rest of my life like this. I just want to be at peace. I don't want to be filled with anxiety or sadness all the time, if I could just allow myself to dissolve into the void everything would be okay.

The only thing is I would hurt my family a lot. Which is the main thing that keeps me here.

I feel a lot of shame for being so old and having no friends, having no romantic experience.  It gets to me more every day that nobody who isn't biologically required to like me likes me. 

I don't like this. It's all just working and feeling bad. Where's the purpose?
