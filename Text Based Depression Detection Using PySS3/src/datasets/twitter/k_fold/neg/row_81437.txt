What am I supposed to do when I'm literally incapable of anything?Like seriously what is the point of living a shit youth suffering mental disorders, physical defects &amp; massive failures just so that I can live a happy old life? I don't see the point of all this. The only reason I'm holding on rn is for the sake of my amazing parents. They have done so much for me it'd destroy them completely if I ended my pathetic existence.
This is so fucked up. I can't live and I can't die too!
