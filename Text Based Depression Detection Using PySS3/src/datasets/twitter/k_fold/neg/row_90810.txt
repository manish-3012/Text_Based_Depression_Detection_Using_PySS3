I can't handle any of this anymore, I'm completely broken.My mum and her boyfriend are addicted to drugs, and I only found out that I was supporting their habit by paying 'rent', which was actually going towards meth. 

We had an argument, because they had no money and had run out of drugs. They locked me in my room, stole my phone, smashed my laptop, and wouldn't even let me use the bathroom by myself because they 'couldn't trust me anymore.'  When I tried to leave, my mum slammed me against a wall by my throat, and said I was 'going nowhere' and that they were only doing this because they loved me. 
When I eventually left, they both chased me down the street, calling me a slut and saying that they were going to kill me. 

I went to a family friends house, and he took me in and looked after me. My mum has taken it upon herself to call him a predator and say that I'm sleeping with him, which is definitely not the case. 
She's been messaging me, saying that she loves me and that she feels like she's lost me. She's turned my sister and grandparents against me, by saying that I've been prostituting myself for meth. 
Ive been putting up with this abuse for 23 years, and I know I have to leave and get away from her, but there's still that little part of me that is still being held by her. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I've never felt so stuck or helpless in my life. I can't see myself getting out of this, I'm at rock bottom and it feels like it would be better if I wasn't around anymore. 

Sorry for the long lost and any typo's, it's my first time posting here and I'm fucking terrified.
