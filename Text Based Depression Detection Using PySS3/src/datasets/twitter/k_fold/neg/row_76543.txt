im so tiredI canâ€™t trust anyone. So many friends have left. They hated me for reasons I canâ€™t even name. Let me fly across the country to meet them and then left me at the airport with only a text that theyâ€™d hated me for all the years weâ€™d been friends.

I do so much. Iâ€™m in so many classes. Iâ€™m the support for so many people but they canâ€™t support me back. My old therapist stopped seeing me after she figured out how crazy I was, when I called her crying. 

I have two friends. I just wanted to go to a concert with them. But Iâ€™m the only responsible one. I have to buy the tickets, book the hotel, the transport. And I just know they wonâ€™t show up, that theyâ€™ll be just like the others. Theyâ€™ll leave me at the airport crying wondering why why why why canâ€™t I have anything

What do I do that is so wrong

Why can no one help

Iâ€™m so tired
