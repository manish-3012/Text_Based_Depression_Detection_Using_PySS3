Quadruple depression?I've heard (and been diagnosed) with double depression, but there are times when I think I may have something more. For example when it rains or when it's really cloudy, I add Seasonal Affect Disorder (SAD) to my already existential depression and chronic depression/dysthymia. Then when there's a pile of challenges (like with what I'm faced with currently) an additional situational depression pretty much breaks me. 

Anyone else think/experience more than Double Depression?
