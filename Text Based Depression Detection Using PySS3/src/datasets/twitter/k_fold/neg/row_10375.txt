I'm real close to having a mental breakdown and I don't think I will be control myselfRead my last 3 posts to understand what's going on. I don't know what to do anymore I get less and less sleep because I don't want to sleep because I'm so tired of the nightmares, the depression, the PTSD, the loneliness,  the getting used by my parents because I can't say no even tho they have failed me more time than I can count. Like my father he left my life when I was 3 and when I was 6 I think  he came to c me a few times and then from there false promise after false promise and I forgave him every time then around 12 or so he moved back to my city and at this time I'm living with my aunt because my mom was in prison, every birthday and Christmas he would promise up and down for yrs that I would get that gift that I wanted and never got but I forgave him, but when I can't give him his gift for bday because I blew a tire and he throw I fit because he was drunk as normal and says some real mean shit he told me that I was a mistake "the condom ripped and we decided to keep u" and after that I don't remember. That is the Most hurtful thing he's ever said and now Most of me wants to kill my self and if I have a mental breakdown that i feel coming i don't know what will happen
