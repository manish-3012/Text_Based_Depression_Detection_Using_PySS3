DoneI've been suicidal for a good while.  Years, and I'm a perfectly healthy, normal person.  I'm at the end of the line though, not even angry about it.  I have a solid plan now that doesn't revolve around cutting.  I can be gone tonight in minutes with a trip to the store.  I love my family and friends, they've been great, but I've put them through a lot.  

I guess you could argue that writing this is one final cry for help.  I've called and spoken to suicide hotlines, even went in to a facility one night and walked out an hour later.  I even spoke with someone today who was of no help.  I'm not interested in being committed or seeing anymore shrinks, I'm interested in the pain stopping for me.  I feel finally like I made up my mind.  All that's left to do right now is buy the materials I need...
