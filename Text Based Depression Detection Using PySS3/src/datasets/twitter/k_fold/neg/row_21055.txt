My abusive ex is living his life, dating someone new so soonRecently got out of a toxic relationship with my emotionally abusive ex, wherein I was previously keen on getting back together with before he abused me again a week ago. I just moved out and found out heâ€™s already dating the girl I was so fixated and adamant on. 

Heâ€™s going to therapy, seeing and caring for this girl. Looking after her when most of our relationship he was emotionally abusive. Only now has he snapped out of it and chosen to fix it when Iâ€™ve been begging for him to do so in the time we were together.

I feel so used and discarded. I just want this pain to end already. I just want to finish it all. No more pain for me
