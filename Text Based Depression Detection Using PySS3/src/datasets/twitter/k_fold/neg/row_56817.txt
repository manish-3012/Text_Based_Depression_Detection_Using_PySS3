update to my last posti finally have a job as a dish washer and its not that bad but i still feel depressed even though the staff is super nice and they try to make my job as easy as possible. from my last post i was 210 now im 185 from not eating. i cant even sleep at this point and im so fatigued i sometimes dose off while walking.  i hate this feeling and i want it gone but i cant no matter what i do, i went to a concert last night and felt happy for the first time in a while but right after it i got in my car and started cringing at my self and felt really down. i just bought 20mg of xanax since i was told that was the most peaceful way to go since you sleep and dont feel a thing. im just too tired and past the point of no return i told all my far away friends good bye and wrote my will the other day. im tired.
