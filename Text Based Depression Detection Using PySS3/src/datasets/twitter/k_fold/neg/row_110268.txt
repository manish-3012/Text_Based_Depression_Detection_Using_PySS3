HelpI was depressed for a very long time before now but just recently I've been getting up at 6am to walk the dog I've been reading books and exercising and this has been going on for about week and it's been great but today everything came back and hit me like a truck I've been crying, hurting myself, breaking things and I dont know why and i just want it to stop

I think alot of it came because I dont have anyone I trust or am ok talking too about this stuff (hence posting this on reddit) but a few months ago I took myself to the top of a building and nearly killed myself and I'm scared I'll try again 

It's just every time I think about killing myself I realise that no one would really care if I did and it might even have a positive effect like it might cause a mental health day at my school which will prevent the suicide of someone people actually care about and the people I hang around with will be happier because they dont have to deal with me being miserable all the time

I dont know what I want to get out of posting this I guess writing this has helped calm me down a bit but I dont think I should kill myself but that will likely change if my depression continues and I dont know how to stop it

I'm probably going to go to sleep now and I'll look at comments if there are any in the morning. thanks for reading it writing it really helped calm me down
