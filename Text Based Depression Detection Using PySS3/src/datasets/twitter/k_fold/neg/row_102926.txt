I am worthlessI am worthless.

There, I have said it. I'm a 43 years old male, no job (not able to get one either), no significant other, no children, no hobbies to speak of, no friends, no communities, of no meaning to others and no achievements in my life.

Why am I still here? What am I still doing?

I wish to be of value, but every step on the way there seems to be something that brings that little bit of meaning to a halt.

Each time I take a step to something which contributes a little bit of meaning to my life, it inevitably falls apart. There are no opportunities in my existence.

I use the word existence, because I am no longer alive.

Today I received the method I will use to go. Still, survival instinct is strong. Perhaps when I get an answer to my questions I will know what to do.
