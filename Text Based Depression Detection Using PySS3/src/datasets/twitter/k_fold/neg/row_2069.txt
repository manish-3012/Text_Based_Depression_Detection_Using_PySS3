I want someone to take care of me.I wish I didnâ€™t have to face the world. I canâ€™t make it. Iâ€™m not strong enough for it. I want to curl up on a ball and have someone hold me and love me and protect me from the world. Someone whose only focus on life is me. I always think life would be much easier if I had someone like that. 

I wish someone saw me.
