Getting pretty tired.So I have and haven't been suicidal for years. A real resignation to stay until my real death, and whatever ends up taking me out. I long ago realized that taking my own life would be pretty damn shocking and horrible for all those involved, and that I most likely would end up regretting it when it was too late, as I realize I'm leaving my parents and sister behind. It's just that these days I'm struggling to hold it together. I just graduated with an engineering degree, and barely made it through the last year because of how done with everything I've been. I'm seriously abusing alcohol, and have been smoking weed for years. I'm just tired of it all. Tired of paying rent and making myself food. I'm tired of making time for things that I yearn to get enjoyment from but I just end up dragging myself through. It's been like this for so long. I really, really, really just want it to stop. Everything is supposed to be ok. I'm well off financially. I have a beautiful girl that loves me like I dream of. I just can't do it without the existential melancholy mess making me want to scream at cars and nicely manicured front yards, and people in general. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING ALL THIS? Where do you find the love and motivation to keep going and why can't I seem to hold on to it when I find it?? Why does it always go away?

Thank you for listening, and I'm sorry to bother you. I just need some help right now. I know I have value, but I can't find it in myself.
