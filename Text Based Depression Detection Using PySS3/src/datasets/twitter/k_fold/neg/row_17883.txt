I've worked hard for a new leaf and my parents just took it away.The name Issac comes from one of my 'personas'. See I change a lot. One minute I'll be telling everyone I love them, next I'll be running from superiors out of fear they'll lock me away. This is one of the many things I'm trying to bury. So I've been working to get away from where I live. And my efforts have been fruitful. Today is the last day I have to be here, and I've just been told I have to stay. I have nothing here. I walk out my door, straight ahead is the school where I was first abused. Right is the place I used to bike and walk, until I got raped there. Left is the path I took for 5 years under different names. And I can't stay home, I'm in danger there. There has been physical damage. Only thing is after all of my efforts just to keep myself alive, I'm struggling to do it.
