I'm so close to going through with it...I can't keep living in this pain anymore. The only reason why I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want to put my friends and family through that pain. But I feel like I'm still just a burden to them anyway, always fucking up and doing stupid shit that keeps them worried about me. I really want to die, I just hope they don't grieve over me too much because I'm really not shit anyway...
