I really feel like I was never meant to be aliveI really want to die. If I had a gun then I would certainly shoot myself in the head. Lone thing I learned from my 16 years of existence, there is no point to living without relationships. I am not important to anyone, except maybe my parents, and even they donâ€™t take me seriously. I feel like that one guy on office space who has to move desks a bunch of times and has that stutter. No one takes me seriously, no one cares about my feelings, and I have no friends. Even if I did have these things, it would feel wrong becauseI am just meant to be a fucking loser. Fucking Mother Nature at its finest. The strongest survive, while people like me are told to fuck off and die. Life is not worth living. Somebody please kill me
