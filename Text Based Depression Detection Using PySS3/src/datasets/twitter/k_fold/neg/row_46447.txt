How much does dying by VSED hurt?Iâ€™m on day 2 of stopping drinking and eating in an attempt to commit suicide. Currently I have a slight pain in my kidneys, dry mouth, and thatâ€™s mostly it. Death With Dignity says itâ€™s pretty painless on their website, but to people who have tried it, how bad does it get?
