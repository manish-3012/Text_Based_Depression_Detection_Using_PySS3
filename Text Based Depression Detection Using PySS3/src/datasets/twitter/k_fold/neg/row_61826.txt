I want to run away and jump of a bridge, because of my dad. Help!I talked to my neighbor about a party for my sister and for some reason I talked about her making a cake. My parents never discussed this with the neighbors and I didn't know that. I just basically gossipped behind their back.

I told my mum and she was angry, but I told her don't tell my dad. Onto my dad, in the past, he used to brutally assault me, and when I was 6, he hit me so hard I have a mark on my head for the rest of my life. I didn't think about it and moved on because I was probably concussed and don't remember much from that day.

Also, my dad is responsible for pretty much not allowing me to have friends because in school I was restricted from going out and never really communicating with them on social media, we used to use Mxit and BBM back in the day, and my dad said no otherwise he would use his baseball bat against me.

Just last month, he called me a failure because I couldn't help him properly with a simple DIY job, and it really drove me to the brink of slitting my wrist, because he basically summed up my life.

And now, this, if he found out I gossipped to my neighbor about my sister's party and cake, he would use the baseball bat on me or worse. I would jump off a bridge before he could do that.

This secret is what I keeping, if he finds out, you will never hear from me again!
