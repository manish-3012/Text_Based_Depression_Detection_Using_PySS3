I have wanted to kill myself for 6 yearsI have been dealing with chronic pain and depression for six years now, have dropped out of college, have basically no friends, and no interest in living. I haven't committed suicide yet because I feel bad for my struggling family, but I'm at that point where selflessness is losing its edge. I don't want to live, I hate this world, I hate my country, I hate just about everything including myself. When will this all end, or when will I end myself? I need help. Thanks.
