Trying to leave home, trying not to kill myself, trying not to care about the things that have happenedSo I submitted myself to the psych unit of a general hospital. They kept me 5 days. Did not help. Occasional counseling. Does not help. No in-person support groups. Don't qualify for domestic violence shelter. Homeless shelter full. Do not qualify for State psychiatric hospital. Insurance does not cover long-term care. Not eligible for group home. Medicaid may or may not make a decision whether my disability qualifies in over a month from now. Best resource for my emotional problem is telephone counseling.
