I really don't think I'll make it past 30.Hell, I barely see myself making it to my next birthday.  
  
Everyday, I wake up disappointed. Wishing I was dead just so the agony that is life would be over. So much shit has happened over the past year that I wish I had been successful when I tried. I could just be nothing instead of having to go through the trauma I've gone through.  
  
In the past year, I've had 2 people come forward, One of them being my abuser themselves, in a very public manner, about concerns about how I've been acting, and that they think something is wrong. I dismiss them, while I know it doesn't dissuade them, it at least throws them off my trail like fake throwing a ball for a dog. What concerns me the most is I've been suicidal for almost a decade now.
  
The public part is what gets me the most, I feel like I'm more of a talking piece rather than a sentient person. It makes me feel like I really don't have any reason to be here other than to be a topic that is eventually forgotten.  
  
I am to be forgotten, that is my role.
