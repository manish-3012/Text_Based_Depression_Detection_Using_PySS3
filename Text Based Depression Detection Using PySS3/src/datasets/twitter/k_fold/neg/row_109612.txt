Had a car crash, now i hate myself.This day stared so good i knew that it was too good to be true. I hate to say that i was right. I was driving my parents car, the other car stopped at the crosswalk and i missed the break with my foot. I fucked up both my parents car and the other guys car, luckily no one was hurt. I hate myself so much guys. This life is a misery, when i start getting better with depression, i immediately fuck up something. I guess today I won't sleep, nor eat. 
I don't even know why i wrote here i'm probably just attention seeking. I don't deserve any comforting
