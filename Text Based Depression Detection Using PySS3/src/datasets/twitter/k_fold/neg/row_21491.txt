Whats the pointAt the end of the day, nothing lasts. Even if your dreams come true, you get your dream job, family, or whatever, it'll be exciting for awhile until it becomes your normal routine and you get sick of it, or it doesn't satisfy you anymore. I don't even know what i want. Nothing seems to matter, and the current reality sucks. I've always had the thought that i would most likely end up killing myself, even though i never attempted to. If i could, i would do it right now, but I'm too much of a coward to try because a little bit of pain before death scares me out of doing it.
