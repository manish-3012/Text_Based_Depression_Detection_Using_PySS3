HopelessI've been registered with a few temp agencies over the years. It's been very difficult finding permanent and stable employment with benefits. Ever since I got rejected for the job I'm currently doing, my mental health has taken a turn for the worse. 

Long story short, I've been dreading getting out of bed almost everyday. I feel like I can't escape; when I take off for a day, I don't get paid. Life at home is absolutely toxic. 

I feel trapped. I'm tired of having to prove my worth with these jobs only for them to choose someone else for it. I want to give up. If good things were supposed to happen, they would've already. I'm so damn tired. I don't want to fight anymore.
