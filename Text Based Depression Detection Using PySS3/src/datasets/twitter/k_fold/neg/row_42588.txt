Goodbye.Today has been a wreck of emotions. From failure to success, it's been a rollercoaster the entire way through. I've tried my best to stay indifferent to much of it, but it's not like anyone would've noticed if I *was* gone.

It's time for me to say goodbye, even if it's just temporary in it's nature. My will to part from this world has outlives my want to stay in it.

Writing this is something I never wanted to do, but I'd rather do it now than later. Maybe people would take note of my existence more, even if it was just a fraction. Even when standing here, on this rooftop, with multiple people, nobody seems to notice me hanging off the edge. They won't notice when I'm gone, either.

Goodbye to everyone who ever knew me. Once again, even if it's just temporary. I'm sick and tired of being ignored. Of being mocked. Of being the laughing stock of everyone in this hell.

And now, maybe, I'll finally be free.
