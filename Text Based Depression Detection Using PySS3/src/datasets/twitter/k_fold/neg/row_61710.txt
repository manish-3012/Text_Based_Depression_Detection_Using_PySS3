I give up on acne nowGot cystic acne when i was 11 years old and now im 18 and a half. It has caused me to be afraid of being around people in public. Have not talked to girls in forever. Everyday I wake up to realize that im ugly and fucking trash. I always hide from people I've known in the past in public, so that they can't see how ugly I am still while they are grown up and good looking. I am shy as fuck and basicly cant make new friends because of it. I'm avoiding parties and family meetups which, which makes people lose interest in me. If they only knew that I would love to go but simply cant because im looking like a trashcan. People have called me stuff troughout my life. Even my closest friends have called me shit. Been on accutane for a year and still no results. Its not worth the fight anymore, honestly i cant stand living with this for any longer, possible years?? fuck it 
I have not heard "i love you" or that i mean something to anyone for over 10 years, only those negative comments. Not even from my family. The only person who felt like really cared about me was my grandmother and she passed in December. Im just honestly done with it
