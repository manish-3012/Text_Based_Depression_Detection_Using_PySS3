Im getting closer to completing my taskI purchased the pill crusher pulveriser on eBay today . I have almost a years worth of anti high blood pressure meds that I've been secretly saving up . Each pill is 50mg that lowers blood pressure.  I honestly don't care of the sadness this will cause my parents . My superannuation payout to them is plenty enough to take care of my debts so they can figure that shit out . Im done with life done with work done with being single and depressed and done with my body pain . I'm thinking I will do it end of July to August . Next step is to go buy a notepad or something to write out a few things for when they find me dead in my car .
