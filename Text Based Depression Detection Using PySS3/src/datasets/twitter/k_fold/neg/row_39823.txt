It was my birthday yesterday.I'm 14. And I've felt more empty than ever before. 

Insomnia and depression has circled around me for more than a year now. I've lost pounds, my grades have dropped, (4.0 to 1.5) and I just can't generally enjoy life. I have lost all interest in school, games, hobbies. I use the computer and TV 5 hours a day to keep my mind off my situation, to imagine that I was someone else. I've thought about many reasons to live, but I just can't think of one.

I don't want to drag myself out of bed everyday, lying to myself that this day would be better than yesterday. While in class, I imagine what it would be like to be a person I know. How everyday I would feel excited,energetic. Feels like walking in a path with no visible end.

I don't want to do it reddit. I don't. Talk me out of this.
