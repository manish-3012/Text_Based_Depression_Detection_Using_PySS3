Exhausted and canâ€™t do it anymore.I have tried to reach out to people in my life but to no avail. To Americans mental health is not taken seriously and menâ€™s mental health is a joke. There is no one to call or go to. If you call suicide hotline you get taken away and locked up like a prisoner because you are depressed and need a fucking hug and someone to tell you that you got this. I donâ€™t know where to go or who to ask. I tried therapy but I feel it did more harm then good. I have reached a point in my life I just want it to end. I sit in my room just thinking of ways to end it, like some way the leaves little mess so no one has to clean up after me or my death. I feel broken and alone.
