Having a hard time waiting.I can't post pictures but it's dark (before 5am) and there's a river here. Thinking about jumping into the current and hoping I either freeze or drown. I'm pretty sure my boyfriend doesn't think I'm serious. Maybe I should just forget about cleaning and packing my things and just do it(when I die I don't want to leave a mess). I feel like a note is enough anyways. At this point I don't really care. I just wanted someone, anyone to know I was here, and that I was serious. If I don't do it now (fear of early morning joggers finding me before I die) I'm probably going to do it tomorrow morning. It's funny, because the last thing I said to my boyfriend was that he wasn't entitled to cuddles just because I'm his girlfriend. I know he was trying to cheer me up but it really broke my heart that he decided to just leave and sleep downstairs. I know he hates cuddles. So at least if I die tonight that's something he will never have to worry about.
