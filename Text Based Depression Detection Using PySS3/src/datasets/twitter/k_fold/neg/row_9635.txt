Studying and suicidal thoughtsWhy should I study anything, if I am going to kill myself someday. I don't need to learn anything because I don't need to learn if I kill myself. I hate my life so much and if I don't kill myself, I will live homeless or with my parents jobbless. I don't have any motivation to do anything in my life because I deserve to live shit life. There is nothing reason to me to live. I don't give a fuck if someone get sad if I kill myself. I think they deserve that I kill myself.
