Iâ€™m tired. I just want to give up.My life has been a mess ever since I left university. I was in a very unhealthy relationship that took me years to get out from. My career didnâ€™t go as planned and now Iâ€™m unemployed. Iâ€™ve been single for 3 years. I barely have friends. 

But Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to make things change. I really have. Every time something goes wrong, I pick myself up and keep trying. But Iâ€™m exhausted right now. Iâ€™m tired of trying and things not working out. Whatâ€™s the point? I donâ€™t get it. I donâ€™t get the point of my life.
