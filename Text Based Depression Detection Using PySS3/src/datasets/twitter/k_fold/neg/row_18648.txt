I wish my heart condition was worseMy father died from a heart deformity and I've inherited the same one (dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular non compaction in case you were curious) and eventually itll kill me too. I wish it would happen sooner. I've still got decades before it gets me (currently 18) and what I wouldnt give for it just be bad enough to kill me right here and now. A guilt free suicide
