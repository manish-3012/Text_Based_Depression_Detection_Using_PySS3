Matter of timeI've forgotten how to feel good about myself. I'm an addict. I'm chronically unhappy. I'm in treatment for addiction, and mental health. I'm grossly unhappy in my relationship, but I have nowhere else to go. Some nights, if being around my SO is too much, I sleep in the basement on the building I used to manage. If I'm not riddled with crippling anxiety, I'm fantasizing about killing myself. It feels like I'm getting closer to doing it with each passing day. I'm 34, broke, medicated, unhappy, and out of hope. I don't know how to live a normal life. I don't think I even want to. I just want to sleep, and not wake up. 

It feels like healing isn't worth the process, anymore.
