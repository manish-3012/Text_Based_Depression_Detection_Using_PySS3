I have been considering checking myself into a hospital.I am having troubles dragging myself out bed in the morning. I just keep sleeping away the time. I have missed class again this morning, I have already ran out of absences I am aloud to have. I feel so stupid.

If things continue this way, I am considering checking myself into a hospital. It is just difficult because of school. I do not want to run my chances of living at student housing. I could not go back home afterwards. I need advice. Is there anyway I could talk to my teachers and talk about a way to make up the missed time? Also, what is it like getting mental help at a hospital, is it worth it?

Maybe I am just going insane with this idea. I am just running out of other options at this point. I do not know what to do.
