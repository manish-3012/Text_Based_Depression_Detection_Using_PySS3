Never thought I'd be here, but I amLife was supposed to be good. I'm 6'2" white male, my parents are wealthy... not me though. I've completely failed at life, I'm 29, not a penny to my name, haven't kissed a girl in 6 years. I've been going full days without talking to another human and I just can not resist the urge to drink alcohol. 

I begged my evil narcissist mother to send me a pizza because I'm literally hungry with nothing but peanut butter and chips. She's a multi millionaire. Won't even respond to my texts. Only 'loves' me when it's convenient to her. 

I can't take it anymore. I cry all day, every day. My uncle and grandpa have both commit suicide. I don't like this world, I don't like it.
