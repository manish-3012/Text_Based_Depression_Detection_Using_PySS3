I'm suicidal but am too scared to seek helpI have been depressive most of my life (some 40 years). Until now I have been able to get through the rough patches by myself. For the last month or so, due to life being totally shitty and coming up with all kinds of bullshit, I want to jump off the bridge near my home. Its really cold right now and I would freeze within 10 mins or so. It wouldn't be painless, but I would pass out and drown. While I could call a suicide hotline, I'm pretty sure they would just give me the usual "life is worth living speech" straight out of the handbook. It would be insincere and shallow. They are strangers after all (just like you guys too I suppose). Also, its an embarrassing situation. I feel bad for my husband who has to deal with my moods. He loves me and is worried. I can't bring myself to call for any help though. I've always been able to take care of myself before, and I don't know what the difference is this time. Sometimes the thought of jumping makes me feel calmer and more in control of things. If life gets too hard, there's a way out and I don't have to ever think about difficult things ever again.  I want to die because I'm sick of life even though I know it will hurt a few people to do so. Anyways, I needed to vent to the world. I know many of you know how I feel.
