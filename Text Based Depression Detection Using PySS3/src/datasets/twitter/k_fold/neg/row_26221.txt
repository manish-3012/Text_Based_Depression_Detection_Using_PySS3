I feel like my life is overWhat I thought was the worst thing that could happen happened. My boyfriend and I broke up after 3.5 years.

I was abused since I was a child, which made me develop PTSD, and dropped out of school at 16 because I couldn't take it. I tried going to therapists and taking meds but it didn't help, so I wasn't functional and couldn't do anything with my life.

When I was 17 I started dating my boyfriend, and since I had nothing and no one else, my whole life was about him, which of course is really unhealthy. Because of my PTSD I would constantly get triggered because of things he would say, and he wanted to break up multiple times since 1 year ago since he realized how unhealthy it was, but he gave more chances because I was starting to improve my life by studying etc., of course I was still getting triggered and he couldn't take it anymore.

Now I'm 20 and I feel like there's nothing I can do. I tried going to therapists but it takes forever and it's too expensive. And I have to live with my mother who's in denial about being abused so she's abusive herself, which makes it much harder for me to be functional.

I'm completely alone and I don't know how to get help. I live in Spain and there's so little help in my city.
