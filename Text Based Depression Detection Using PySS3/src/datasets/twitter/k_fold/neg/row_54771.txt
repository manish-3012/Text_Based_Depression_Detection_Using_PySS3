Lethal injection should be legalI really donâ€™t know why it isnâ€™t yet. It doesnâ€™t matter if the person is â€œnot in the right mindâ€. If they wish to have a doctor take their life, then they have every right to accept that and leave this world. 

I love how religious dipshits think death is somehow the worst thing that could ever happen to a person. Itâ€™s really not. Thereâ€™s far worse things than dying. They seem to think being terminally ill and being stuck in a living hell is preferable to not being alive, when they themselves have had it easy pretty much their whole lives. Itâ€™s always the ones who got lucky and drew the longest straw who gasp at you for suggesting that doctor assisted suicide should be legal. 

Oh, and just a quick reminder. Your God or religion will never be a valid argument against suicide. Not everyone believes in your pathetic world view. Since not everyone believes in your God, your argument is completely invalid. End of story. Also separation of church and state. 

â€œBut your family would be so sad!!!â€ Tough shit. Their feelings donâ€™t exceed my basic right to die.  I hate how so many people put the well being and feelings of the suicidal personâ€™s friends and family over the suicidal person themselves. The law and human rights donâ€™t give two shits about your feelings. I would have a right to walk into a doctorâ€™s office and choose death, regardless of how much my family stomps their feet and cries about it.
