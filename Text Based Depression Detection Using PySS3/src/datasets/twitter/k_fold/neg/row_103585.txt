What should I doI made a very bad mistake when i was younger. One that can easily ruin my life and possibly someone else's. If what I did gets out into the world i would probably be in jail for a long time. I don't know what to do with the regret guilt and shame i have to put up with other than commit. I don't know what to do my parents think that I'm a golden child that has never hurt anyone/anything in there life which is completely wrong. I hate myself for what I did and how f\*cked up it was. What can i do to help the situation and my mental health.
