No future, No Hope, only miseryUp untill 7 years ago, I was totally normal, but from then on, things started to go miserable really fast, My whole life started collapsing all around me, I never succeed at anything, only faliure in every thing I do in life, all of my nightmares started coming true one by one, nothing tastes good, the things I used to love doesnt give me joy any more, My financial situation started going bad.i dont know why, its not My fauly. What ever I do, no matter how hard I work for it, It fails, I am giving up, loosing Hope  and thinking about ending This streak of misery.
I really dont know if I can be helped. But please if some one can. I am at rock bottom, and the through of ending This suffering is becoming more and more compelling. Help.
