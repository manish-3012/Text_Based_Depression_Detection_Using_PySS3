Do I belong in misery?I don't necessarily want to live anymore. But I can't bring myself to suicide and what it would do to my family and friends. I've held my gun to my temple more than once but couldn't just flex my finger to end it all. There are days when I want to fight my depression hard and say things to myself like "this isnt it for u, it can't be". And " you're better than this, you'll find what u want someday". But then I get those days where I say "this isn't getting any better" "whats the end game here" "if I can't handle life now then how am I gonna make it farther". I can't remember a time when I was truly happy without a care in the world. I'm starting to think maybe drinking before I hold that piece to my temple would give me enough to end it.
