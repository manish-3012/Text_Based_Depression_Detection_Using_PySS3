im sick of thisive been dealing with depression and severe social/general anxiety for maybe 6 years. ive been trying a variety of medicines for one year, although i havent found anything that works. i still feel like shit. i'm extremely controlling and hate when my boyfriend does things i cant control like going to parties (which he knows I hate). I don't want to restrict his behavior because of how selfish I am, but i don't know if i'd be able to live without him. i'm a nuisance to my friend and they constantly tell me to stop being sad and just cheer up or whatever. i cant go out in public without have an anxiety attack, i feel fat ugly and unwanted by basically everyone. i have no interest in growing up, school sucks ass, and ive been hoping for a truck to just hit me consistently for the past four years. i have methods for killing myself, so i could do it. everything has just been falling apart for a long time and i have no interest in dealing with any stress. there's no "glorious" outcome from living life, it's all stress and shit. theres no point.
