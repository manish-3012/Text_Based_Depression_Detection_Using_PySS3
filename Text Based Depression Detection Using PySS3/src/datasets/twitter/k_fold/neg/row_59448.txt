Can I be happyThere are loads of posts here but thanks for taking the time to read mine.



I tried and failed to commit suicide 4 months ago. Ended up in hospital after taking all of my antidepressants and slashed my wrists.

After that I thought I would get some radical help, but anyway they just discharged me after some crappy "psychological assessment" and told me to go back to my doctor and get more tablets. Great...

I never went back to my doctor, I have a general mistrust for doctors now so I've just been dealing with things on my own and I've been ok for now but I think that's just because I'm ignoring everything if you know what I mean.



I feel like there's a big void. Empty. And nothing I can do and no one I know can fill it.

I know someday in the future I will want everything to stop again and I know then I won't fail in ending it. 
I know everyone says suicides are cowards and afraid of living. I'm not AFRAID of living. I just hate life. I actually hate it. It really confuses me how people can be happy to be alive. I hear about people that have died and I think they are so lucky. That's just how I feel, it's normal to me. Infact the reason it took me so long to get help with my "depression" was because I thought that was just how everyone feels. I thought that was just life.

The only think really stopping me is how my family would feel, I would try to explain best I could that there's nothing they could of done and I was just so unhappy and I just can't. I just can't. 



But apparently people can be happy and enjoy life? Is this actually true?
