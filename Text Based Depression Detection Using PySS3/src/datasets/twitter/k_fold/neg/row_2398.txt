how am i supposed to fucking live like thisitâ€™s fucking constant she wonâ€™t ever stop abusing me iâ€™m so done with this shit. how can i be expected to take this emotional and verbal abuse for even longer? i canâ€™t. i canâ€™t do it anymore. even if itâ€™s just minor trivial shit it all adds up. why does she do this to me? why donâ€™t my own parents fucking love me? how did she go from a loving sweet mother to a fucking abusive monster in just a few years? i canâ€™t go to anyone. i canâ€™t go back to court or through the police or through family members. i canâ€™t do it anymore. how can you not love your own kid? all iâ€™ve ever wanted is to feel wanted and loved and i get the exact fucking opposite everyday. iâ€™m putting a stop to this bullshit. fuck you mom, you win. iâ€™ll be fucking gone soon and i wonâ€™t have to deal with the constant manipulative gas lighting abuse you have put me through for years.
