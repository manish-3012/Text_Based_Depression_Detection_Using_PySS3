Iâ€™m not actively pursuing it, but Iâ€™m starting to think itâ€™s the likely outcome.Largely because of inappropriate sexual behaviors in my youth, I see s*icide as the likely outcome. I have more details in my post history. 

If you took my life as an adult, or even from 16 on I could probably be ok. I just canâ€™t see a way past the guilt and shame, the depression, the feeling of not belonging, and not being able to enjoy things.

For well over a decade I though I had dealt with things and now I realize I hadnâ€™t and Iâ€™ve only added more mistakes to the pile.
