Iâ€™m lonely and lostToday I was contemplating suicide yet again. I was thinking about how lonely I was and how sad and pathetic my life is. I have no real friends and I have no one to lean on. Iâ€™m always crying alone at night because I donâ€™t know what to with myself anymore. I go to therapy and I have anti depressants but noting is working. Iâ€™m tired of just being the guy that people come to talk to when they have problems. I like helping people, but I donâ€™t appreciate the fact that they treat me like shit right after. Iâ€™ve always been the annoying one and thatâ€™s probably why everyone hates me. Iâ€™m told that Iâ€™m hated and that no one wants me around everyday so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m just alone in my room. I have no one to lean on and talk to, no one I could cry on, and no one that could just hug me and tell me that everything will be alright. All Iâ€™m asking for is a friend, but it seems like no one wants to be that. Iâ€™m just a complete embarrassment and should just go through with the suicide. Please if thereâ€™s anyone out there, help me have just the slightest glimpse of hope, because hope is what Iâ€™m all out of
