I wrote this yesterday.Sometimes when I drive over  a bridge, I have to hold my breath because I can't help but feel the need to just plunge over ther side. The anxiety floods my mind, and fills my entire being. I have to mentally talk myself through it, while holding my breath. Multitasking while anxious is damn near impossible. The entire task of not killing myself takes so much work. It's as if I have slipped into quick sand and I can sink, or grab a rope that will pull me out. You have very little time to make a decision, but you must make one, fast. I am so tired of living this way. I don't want to feel like such a dissappointment constantly. I wish I didn't feel like I have fucked up so much that the only way for me to get through it is to just kill myself. It makes me nauseous, because I know it's the wrong decision, but in my mind it seems like it's the only decision. I'm trying my best to fight it. I promise, I am, it's taking everything within me to fight it. I live in fear, afraid that something will happen that will send me over the edge, and make me do it. Terrified, I won't be able to fight it anymore. It's getting harder and harder. I stay intoxicated, because while I can better vocalize the urge to kill myself, the battle is not there. I'm not fighting it, I'm just temporarily content. That's all I really have anymore, temporary moments of contentment. I don't think anyone can help, or fix this, but me. And, I don't know how to yet.
