Time is running out for me.Prev Post : http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2wm3io/i_feel_like_im_running_out_of_options/

I'm sleeping all but 4 hours a day now and received a letter today telling me I will not longer be receiving financial support for looking after my mother. Knowing ill soon struggle even more and no longer have any possibility to even save up money to get myself debt free and on the right track to trying to find a job that isn't min wage. I feel the feeling that I wont live beyond 24 is growing more apparent and ill soon run out of fight to keep myself alive.
