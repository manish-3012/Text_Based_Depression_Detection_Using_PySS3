There is nothing I can doI work 40 hours a week, my money is gone in 3 days

I waste it on juul pods and food

I cant even afford a haircut because I prioritize my nicotine addiction to how I look  
I dont have a car, I walk 30 minutes to work and back every day

I dont have sheets on my bed. Im a lazy piece of shit who cant get out of bed except for work

Im 23, my parents are dead, and my sister and I inherited their house  
My sister lives here with her boyfriend and they both hate me because Ive taken food without asking when I was starving

They are trying to make it so I dont get any money from the house when we sell it.  my sister is working with a lawyer and I havent been able to talk to him at all

I have very few friends as nobody will be friends with someone with no car and no money

I think about killing myself every  day, i walk past the train tracks on my way to work

whats the point of living.  whenever we sell this house im sure ill be homeless in less than a year
