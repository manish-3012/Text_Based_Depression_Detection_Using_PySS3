Iâ€™m tired of day in day out painIâ€™m sick of feeling like Iâ€™m dead inside, feeling alone anywhere, anytime in this world. Tired of letting my friends and family down. To anyone out there that has attempted suicide or had similar thoughts, but got through this, please respond and help me understand. Itâ€™s been years Iâ€™ve felt like Iâ€™m worthless, years Iâ€™ve felt like fucking ending it all. Iâ€™m so close to grabbing my dads gun, escaping to the mountains and blowing my brain out. I need some guidance...
