TiredI don't why I am even writing this. But I have no one else to talk to, been wanting to die for 3 years straight now, yesterday I tried killing my self and as always I'm too much of a bitch to do so. I live in south america, mental health is not really viewed as a serious matter here and care for it is very expensive, also we have no suicide hotlines. Everyday is Just a pain in the ass to endure, been spending most of my money in treatment, psychologist, psiquiatrists, antidepressants. You name it, it did nothing, feel miserable as fuck with no one to talk to about it, i hate my family always did. Everything I tried to do with my life has gone wrong, is like I was born to be a loser. Lost the job, Lost the girl, never had an ability for any of my passions, always coming short of any archievements. Always being weighted down by my ocd and my depression. So here I am, i guess. Writing in an online forum for strangers to see. You could call this my last desperate cry for help, I guess? As soon as I figure out a way to die that suits me, I guess I'll be gone. I tried, honestly. Did Everything that I could to make this better AND STILL failed, like Everything important that I attempted to do in my life. This is Just one of my failures, the one that was the final nail.
