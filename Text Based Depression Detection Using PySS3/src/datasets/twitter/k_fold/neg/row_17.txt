Iâ€™m trashLol I normally cringe at the self loathing posts here but honestly Iâ€™m such trash. Like literally everything about me.  I just wish I could muster up the courage to just follow through. This is it and Iâ€™m okay with that that:  everyday here is worst than the last.  I appreciate this community for letting me know Iâ€™m not alone.
