i can't do it anymore. i'm done.I'm 27. I have a shitty job with shitty hours that's being automated soon. I can't pay bills and rent, so I live with my parents. Applying for college is probably the most I've done for myself since leaving high school, and the process of doing that and getting what i need done for a grant or two are honestly making me question if it's worth it at all. if anything's worth it. i mean even if i do get in, what's the point? i'll probably fuck that up too, because all i ever do is fuck up. i am a colossal fuck up, and all of my problems are my own fault. i am never going to get anywhere in life because i'm too much of a chickenshit to get out of my comfort zone. i can't do it. i can't. there's no point in me staying alive at this point, so i'm just going to give up and end it. that's one thing i know i can actually follow the fuck through with.
