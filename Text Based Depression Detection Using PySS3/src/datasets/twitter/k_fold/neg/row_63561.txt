I don't care what anyone says....There's only one winner in Russian roulette. I'm so tired of fighting my demons from day to day. I wanna be that winner for once.

But after my last massive suicide attempt in 2016, I made a stupid fucking promise to my family that I wouldn't attempt to take my life again because I watched my family shatter. Now I regret that promise and all I think about is ending this joke I call a life. I'm so done. What do I do about this stupid promise? I don't know how much longer I can keep it!!! ðŸ˜­
