I don't remember what happiness feels likeFor the last few years I've been battling with depression, and subsequently been self harming. It used to be once a week I cut myself, now it's more like every other day. And lo and behold here I am again with a razor blade in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other. I've just come back from my second driving test, (which I failed) and I'm ready to end it all. The driving test fail is the last straw. I've always felt like an embarassment and a disappointment to everyone I've ever met. I'm turning 20 soon, none of my "friends" from school talk to me, never had a girlfriend and the only people I talk to are those at work who are paid to pretend to like me. I'm fed up with being here doing the same routine day in day out. I don't deserve to be alive, give someone else my place on this Earth but give them a much better outcome please.
