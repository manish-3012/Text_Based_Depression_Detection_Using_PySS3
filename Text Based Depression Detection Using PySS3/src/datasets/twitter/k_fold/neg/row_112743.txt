I don't think I'm depressed, but suicide can't leave my mind.I'm not depressed, I can enjoy life and hapiness. But I have a very big problem with my professional side. I'm 28 y/o without any hope for my future. I cant stand my actual job/work area anymore as I hate it more than my life. Every hour I spend on it makes me think on suicide for two hours. I could just seek another area but I just can't do it! I'm too weak of a pussy to deal with the dificulties of doing so and I just can't find any motivation to deal with a work that I hate and just can't find something I enjoy work with. From my point of view it's easyer to end with my life before I become a hobo on the streets. Maybe I just hate having to work to survive on the world today, because if I don't work, I will not be happy with the lack of money, and if I work, I will spend great part of my time doing something that makes me unhappy. And if I don't work, I will eventually die slowly and painfully, therefore is better end it with a quicker and painless way.

I may be a whiny little pussy, but I just can't find a way or a motivation to step out and be a man the world expects me to be. Now all I think and do is research of suicide methods as it becomes each day more clear that it is the easyest way out.
