help?i think my friends are toxic. they dump everything on me but when i need someone to talk to they say they are busy or donâ€™t respond. it really hit me when my friend was mad at me and i was crying and i heard her go to everyone asking and say something like â€œsheâ€™s just doing it for attention. sheâ€™s a horrible fucking person.â€ and stuff like that. it was at school so who knows whoâ€™s making rumors about me now. she says she didnâ€™t do it. but i heard her. it hit my mental health like a fucking freight train. i have hardly talked to anyone since the whole online school thing, which is a whole other topic, but whatever. i feel like no one cares. i want to die. this is only one of the things that make me in this depressed sort of state. iâ€™m scared that people will just tell me, oh youâ€™re just a teenager! you donâ€™t know anything about mental health hahahah! but i do know. and i know i want to find a way to kill myself.
