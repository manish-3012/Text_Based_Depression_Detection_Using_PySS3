My boyfriend is suicidal and I donâ€™t know what to tell him.Heâ€™s got major depression, and things have been getting worse for him lately. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where Iâ€™m just begging him to stay alive for me. 

Heâ€™s got no money to get professional help, and absolutely refuses to ask his parents anyway. Heâ€™s only 17, so thatâ€™s huge. His meds donâ€™t work. 

Iâ€™m at a loss. I donâ€™t know what he can do at this point. Iâ€™m scared for him. Iâ€™m scared of losing him.
