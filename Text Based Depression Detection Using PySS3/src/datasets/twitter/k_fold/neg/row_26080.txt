Why do people you're supposed to love do cruel things all the damn time?I've been verbally abused by my parents as long as I can remember. They even used to beat the shit out of me until I was 12. I'm 17 now and I live with my family, I'm not allowed to have a job because I'm forced to help on the farm my father owns and I'm being paid in insults. My father has to give me money every month for my school lunches and he spent the whole morning complaining about it to my mother. So an hour ago, I finally decided to have a talk with my mother and tell her that I do not appreciate being treated like a literal piece of garbage. I told her that I want to get a job so that I can pay for my school lunches myself. She got mad because apparently 'I want to pay for my food' means 'I'm not satisfied with the amount of money my father gives me'. So I told her that father mocks me anyways and that he always says that I don't do shit on the farm because I'm completely useless and that he doesn't need me (even though sometimes I work my ass off for 14 hours straight). She fucking laughed in my face after that and said 'Why do you make this household sound like it's worse than hell?'. She laughed at me exactly the same way as she did 3 years ago when I told her my psychologist thought it would be best for me to go to a mental ward for some time. I honestly can't take living like this anymore. I just want to end everything. I'm trapped
