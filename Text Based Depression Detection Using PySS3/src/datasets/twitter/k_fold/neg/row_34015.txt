I can't kill myself, but really it'd be far easier to be dead.I know there are 2 very significant things who have pushed me to where I am now. The first is that I have chosen to study to get into a career of filmmaking. I live in Australia, and I am so extremely scared of what my career is going to look like when I finish university in a few months. I feel I have made a huge mistake, even before I give it a try. I just can't see the positive in my future. 3 years down the drain. I don't know what else to do with my life.

The second is, well, my girlfriend of 4 years left for a 6 month exchange in Europe. Two weeks in, I find out she has cheated on me with 2 guys (on her first night out mind you), and pretty much fallen in love with the second. What is important here is that she hasn't told me yet, and continues to hide it. I am not supposed to know. Really in my head this is first, but I have to force myself to put it on point no. 2 because I know people tell me I can't put my happiness onto others. Much easier said than done.

The two things I held on to, have sort of crumbled at the same time. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I am soon turning 22 and I feel like I have wasted my entire life. I can't turn that into 'positive energy' or some bullshit which gives me the 'ultimate drive' and motivation to fucking do shit. I just don't want to be here.

I'm forcing myself to submit this, because I just think I sound extremely stupid. People have got bigger issues than I do, but knowing that doesn't help.
