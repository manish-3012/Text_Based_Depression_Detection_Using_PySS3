Iâ€™m scaredWhatâ€™s the point of living if all youâ€™re expected to do is to go to school, attend college, get a good career , be financially stable and then eventually die?
Well for a really long time Iâ€™ve felt socially anxious and I abused weed to the point where idk myself anymore. I started a great job after college then had to resign because I was too anxious and now Iâ€™m stuck at home feeling like a fucking parasite to my parents. If Iâ€™m a parasite to society then whatâ€™s the point of living. Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™d survive on the streets. Iâ€™d rather just die.... I attempted two months ago but next time I do it Iâ€™m going to succeed no matter what. Also enough ppl know already that i have mental health issues so whatâ€™s the point if I donâ€™t even have a community or capability to hold a job. I canâ€™t even work a minimum wage job. Fuck fuckfuckcudkcufkck
