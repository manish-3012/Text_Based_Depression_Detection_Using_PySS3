Debt is that real.I hate when people say, â€œitâ€™s just money.â€ Itâ€™s everything when youâ€™re in debt up to your eyeballs and have a spouse living with you but keeping a secretly leased house across town and helping himself to whatever he wants from his paycheck leaving you to use your own credit to make up the groceries, clothing, etc., needed for your family.

My kids donâ€™t deserve this. He wonâ€™t tell me anything but also wonâ€™t let me put our house on the market (neither of us can refi it under only one name, after only 2.5 years here, and especially not now with all the debt thatâ€™s been racked up trying to save this marriage and home). Iâ€™ve posted here before that I think the world might be much better without me in it, but this feels like the last straw. The lion share of non-mortgage debt is in my name only, so he wouldnâ€™t be on the hook for it if I died. My life insurance isnâ€™t greatâ€”would basically bury me in a pine box and thatâ€™s itâ€”but that is probably what heâ€™d do anyway. I have tried. I continue to try. I canâ€™t make him not hate me. He always has, from the start. 

It has reached levels of game-playing where I honestly think he wants to see how badly he can devastate me before I off myself. And I think Iâ€™m finally game. I just donâ€™t see a way out of this. So many people have committed suicide over massive debt and the feeling of failing their kids, but I never see much of that written on here. 

So I am putting it out there. Literally everything has fallen apart and I just donâ€™t even have it in me to be a very good mom anymore, which has always been my hesitation.

Thinking of driving my car into a local lake because there are several on my work commute and I canâ€™t swim anyway. Then the kids wouldnâ€™t know and the insurance wouldnâ€™t be able to know, either, if I can engineer some effective skid marks. There are deer EVERYWHERE on the roads right now, so itâ€™s exactly what everyone would think happened.

If I told him I was suicidal he would simultaneously accuse me of being dramatic but also have me hospitalized long-term, not to heal me but to create a more sympathetic narrative for him in the divorce, and to make sure the remainder of my motherhood years are marred by stigma and court rulings and stranger well-being checks to destroy me.

I love my kids, but I just see so much more success and opportunity in their future if a community comes together to help them following their momâ€™s fatal car accident.

Anyway, thatâ€™s the working plan. That way strangers will find me and not a loved one. And please donâ€™t tell me to buy a lottery ticket. 

Going to work on clearing out clutter, belongings they wouldnâ€™t want, and fixing things I can around the house so he can put it on the market when my shabby income disappears and he has to finally look at all the bills and admit weâ€™re so overextended that his sabotage worked much more quickly than he intended.
