Please, help me.I am a sophomore in high-school, and there is so much work I am forced into doing that I am constantly miserable and sleep deprived. I haven't slept in five days.


I never asked for all this stress. I don't want any of it.


Recently, I've started imagining killing myself multiple times a day, with increasing frequency. I think I might do it just so I wouldn't have to deal with this work or any of my shitbag teachers ever again.


I do realise that others have it worse than me, and have tried telling myself this, but it doesn't make my pain any less real.


I just want to live a life without stress.

I just want to sleep forever.

Help me.
