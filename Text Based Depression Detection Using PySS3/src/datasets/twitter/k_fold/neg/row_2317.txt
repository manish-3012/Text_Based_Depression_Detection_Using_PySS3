I'm in a negative cycle of hopelessnessI've always been kind of vulnerable to "doomsayers" saying the end is nigh and all that but the last few days have been really bad. So the stock market went down on Monday, (which is no big deal for me) and I was reading some threads on reddit about it. I found someone doing a very "we are all going to die" post that was downvoted so I viewed their past comments seeing if they had said anything crazy on some other boards or were part of any weird communities, which people who post like often are, and that lead me to the apocalyptic side of the site with things like r/collapse, r/preppers and other such things. Now these subs are a bit infamous for the "kill yourself to spare the pain type thing" while trying to say they don't encourage it in the side bars but this has lead me to a "negative news" binge on places like r/worldnews which is a constant struggle between the optimists and pessimists.

Since then I don't really sleep or eat and can't really concentrate on things. My family noticed and tried to help but I can't really get any comfort because I have experts telling me to be afraid and that to ignore it is a weakness. I don't know what to do and I'm afraid all the time 

The thing is I am completely aware of the "negative information" trap where negative information is spread more often because "nothing happened" is not really news and I understand that many scientific reports are somewhat "over-dramatic" as a method to get the issues they feel are important addressed. Even with that I still can't "cut myself off" because I feel I should always stay informed but I can't accept the subs advice of "just relax and die horribly"  

I don't know if this sub will be any good and I'm afraid that this will be just telling people what they want to here in spite of reality but i know that I need something.
