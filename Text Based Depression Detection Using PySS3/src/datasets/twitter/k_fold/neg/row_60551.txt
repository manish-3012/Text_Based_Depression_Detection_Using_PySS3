Telling your loved ones about itI decided that it's my time to go, i'm not asking for support or anything, i am sure about this decision but i'm asking you how can i tell my family that it's my final decision and nothing will change my mind? I'm going to starve myself to death because i'm dealing with lots of issues that can't really be solved. I'm 20 years old and my parents are pushing me to live more and don't really understand the situation. They will probably keep telling me to eat which is only natural to say if you care about someone but i've made up my mind. So another question, can they force me to eat if i end up in hospital or drug me? Thanks.
