I've never felt this alone in my entire life and I don't know what to do.I have no one to turn to. I'm so lonely. I'm pretty much at the edge and don't really care anymore. My mind won't turn off, I'm just trapped inside and can't relax. I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm so scared, I don't want to die, but I don't know if I can keep doing this to myself. The anxiety and depression alone are driving me insane and making me sick to my stomach. I just feel fucked up and there's nothing that can help me. I've tried everything from exercising to eating right but nothing will change how I feel on the inside. I'm fucked. I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. If you are still reading this thank you, I love you.
