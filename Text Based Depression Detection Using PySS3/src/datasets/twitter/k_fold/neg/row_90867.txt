17F - i donâ€™t think i can go on any longeri feel so alone, i recently got more help for myself and started working towards being better and taking better care of myself and everything has fallen apart. the person i love broke up with me today, i have no friends and no relationship with my family. i just feel so alone and so tired, i donâ€™t want to be alive any longer.
