I'm just so sadI'm 15 years old and I dont want to live anymore. Both my parents have voiced me being an inconvenience, I'm losing my friends because I've just become so distant. My family barely even knows me anymore. I have a boyfriend who I love dearly but I just feel like he's losing interest in me and doesnt know how to tell me he wants to end things. I tried calling a suicide hotline just before but I was left on hold for a long time and I just gave up. I'm stuck at my dad's house until January and my dads new wife just makes me so miserable. I feel so bad for being sad because I know people have it way worse than i do but oh gid i just hurt so bad
