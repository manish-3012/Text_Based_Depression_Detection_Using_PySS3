A letter to myselfThis hurts so bad. You need to make changes. You miss the people you've lost recently and that's really distracting you from everything else. There's a bigger world out there just an arms length away. 

You have never been LESS alone. There are people on here who care. There are people who know you irl and love you anyway. 

You are young. You are beautiful. You would be missed. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.
