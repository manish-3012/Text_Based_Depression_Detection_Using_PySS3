I don't know what to feel.My antidepressants don't make me feel good, they stop me from wanting to kill myself constantly. I have friends, but they're all closer with eachother than they are with me, and I feel like I'm just kinda observing, which has been the case as far as I remember in friend groups.  


 I enjoy some parts of life still. I love playing with my dog, and watching movies and chess with my dad. But lately my depression has been fucking horrible. My ex left me 2 months ago after she and I were distant for a few months, which was the worst possible time, because October-December is the hardest part of the year, because my mom before she passed, and I would always do a lot of shit around the time. The worst part is that objectively, my life is good. I have family who loves me, and I do things I enjoy. I have no reason to feel this way. Compared to what I've seen here, my life is perfect, which makes me feel guilty about feeling how I feel.

 I don't even know if I wanna kill myself, I just wish I wasn't ever born, or could cease existence with no memory of me, or at least have things get better, and not be on this shitty cycle. I just wanna be happy, without the gnawing thought in the back of my mind of how everything is. Our existence is meaningless, we're less than a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of the universe. Nothing we do will matter in the long run, and we all wash away. I hate knowing that nothing matters. I wanna give in and say fuck it and just not worry about things, but I feel like that'll cause me to feel worse, and be bad for the people I care about. Sorry for the rant, I'm not even sure if this is the place to post this. I just don't know, and need help.
