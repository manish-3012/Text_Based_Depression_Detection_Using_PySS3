my mind is on the brink of collapsing in on it's self.I'm fighting for my sanity, but lately it's as evasive as water in the Sahara. My parents are useless, my mother is an entirely loving well intentioned alcoholic moron, my father is an ingenious narcissistic sociopath who's never wanted much to do with me. My minds of a high caliber, but I've failed out of college twice, going on a third time. No one understands the words I speak, the causes I fight for, or the passion in my heart. I've been taking care of my alcoholic mother since I was fourteen. Every step I've taken forward in life was a long fought battle. I've been my own safety net, my own motivation, and my own stability for as long as I can remember. I've had every excuse in the world to be a product of my environment, but I've always risen above it. Reality has bent my mind into an unfeasible shape. My empirical observations of the world around me contradict my logical derivatives, and my mind is imploding. I have little hope left for this bleak future. I don't really even want to wake up tomorrow. I really just need some inspiration. I really just need something to get me over this bend. I'd really appreciate anything.
