I wishI wish I had the strength to do it, to just finally do it and kill myself. But I live in Canada and I donâ€™t have any access to guns or anything like that. And any other way would be too painful to go through with.

Iâ€™ve cut myself a lot to see how painful it would be to cut my wrist, but that hurts too much. I donâ€™t want to go out in agony from taking a bunch of pills.


Everything hurts so much and I feel so fuckinf trapped. I think about suicide every day, I feel no joy in anything I do anymore, even hobbies such as art that I loved. I miss my ex so much, and I think about her everyday and how happy I was.

I want to give my life to someone who wants to live, i want to die painlessly, quickly and in a way that doesnâ€™t affect the human race.

Iâ€™m so absolutely depressed and hollow, Iâ€™m mad at the universe. I just want to be happy but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been to therapy and Iâ€™ve taken pills for depression. But nothing helps.

Please universe.
