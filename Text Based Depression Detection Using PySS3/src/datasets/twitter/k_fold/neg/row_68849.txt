I have the stuff, I could be dead within an hour if all went well. I'm just so tired..I have the chemicals to produce H2S in a hurry, I just don't want to hurt anyone that I don't have to. I'm licensed as a paramedic in my province, I really don't want to hurt any first responders, but I am so.. hurt. I worked so hard to even pass the class, the academic portion came easily and I passed with the second highest marks in my class, but my "personality just wasn't suited" and I "should be an aide instead". What a thing to hear from your teacher. I work as an aide now, swallow my pride every day, and have had to call 911 exponentially more than any other employee. I know my assessments and have to get bosses approval before I call, and it kills me every time.

I'm just.. tired. It's not that I have pain I want to end, I just feel like its all a bloody joke, and I'm tired of being part of it. I don't want  to get out of bed, when I do all I want is to go back to bed, and then I can't even sleep. I'm 24, and I remember wanting to kill myself at age 4, in kindergarten. I cannot express how tired I am. I've fought through two decades, so many life changes and it's always there.

Edit: I just wanted to add;

 I've been on antidepressants.. effexor, wellbutrin, pristic, imipramine, prozac

For the most part, they've worked for a couple months and then the dose goes up. I was on 450mg a day of effexor, and would get withdrawal before my next dose. It took over a year of 0.01g decreases by weight and withdrawal side effects for me to get off of it. It was great at first!
