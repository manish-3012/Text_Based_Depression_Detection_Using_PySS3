I feel completely worthless.Hi all, itâ€™s my first time positing here. 

I feel so hopeless and worthless. Iâ€™m 23, donâ€™t have a job, failed the LSAT, donâ€™t have a car, and really just donâ€™t have a plan right now. There is immense pressure for me to go to law school and be some kind of high powered attorney. I want to go into law, but Iâ€™m afraid that I wonâ€™t do well. Iâ€™ve done moderately well in school, but I feel like I just donâ€™t measure up. I feel like Iâ€™ll never be smart enough, or good enough, so why bother? All I want to do is overdose on pills, or jump in front of a car. I hate myself so much. Iâ€™m a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, and have CPTSD from it. Iâ€™m exhausted, Iâ€™m tired. I feel like the mental health community doesnâ€™t really care, or maybe they do and theyâ€™re just tired. My fiancÃ©e loves me a lot, and I love him, and I donâ€™t want to traumatize him with my death, which is the only reason Iâ€™m staying alive right now. I feel like the world would be a better place without me, and that I have nothing to offer the world. Iâ€™m sorry for the long post, but I just donâ€™t know what to do right now. 

TLDR; I feel like a massive failure at live, I have severe chronic CPTSD, and Iâ€™m just tired of living.
