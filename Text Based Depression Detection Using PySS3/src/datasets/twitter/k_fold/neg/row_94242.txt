19 &amp; Iâ€™m scared that I will always be miserableiâ€™ve been sad since i was about 11. Iâ€™ve been on antidepressants since then but i still feel so sad. the world makes me sad, and how cruel it is, how mean people are. I feel so alone and scared. I never want to be by myself because i just feel so terrified. when i have to leave my friends house i feel like iâ€™m going to vomit over the fact of being alone. i get especially scared at night. I feel ridiculous because all i want is for my parents to hold me. all i want is to be held and told everythingâ€™s going to be okay. but no one knows how to help me. itâ€™s such a terrible fucking feeling to reach out for help &amp; have them look at you so confused and not know what to say. sometimes i feel great and feel like i can beat this bitch. but then i get low again. I had a lot of childhood trauma so i think that has a lot to do with it, along with chemicals in my brain. the idea that no one will probably reply to this makes me sick. i donâ€™t know what to do. i canâ€™t feel so alone like this anymore. iâ€™m starting to not see a point. i hate being the downer, and so needy. i just want to be successful in life and get amazing grades and be happy. i really do try to think positive and do things that make me happy like hike or watch my favorite movies. but iâ€™m so tired of being the only one that helps myself. my mom used to help a lot, but sheâ€™s been MIA for almost 3 years now. I miss her a lot, and wish i had her through this hard time. I debate ending my life every day. but God would be so mad and i would just give my pain to everyone i love. i would miss my friends and family too. but the idea of feeling like this any longer is gut wrenching. i donâ€™t want to be a scared little kid anymore. i want to function and not take medicine and not be so fucking alone. my friends and family deserve better. I sometimes imagine that itâ€™s my last day on earth, and i try to take everything in and tell everyone how much they matter. i often feel like i take care of everyone but no one does for me. i get that iâ€™m an adult, but i need people. to have someone understand my pain would be awesome because then i wouldnâ€™t feel like the only person in the world. i canâ€™t even write my feelings down probably because i canâ€™t describe feelings. i write notes saying goodbye but i canâ€™t even offer a logical explanation. my problems seem so ridiculous when said outloud. i know i donâ€™t want to die, i just canâ€™t hurt anymore and feel like such a burden.
