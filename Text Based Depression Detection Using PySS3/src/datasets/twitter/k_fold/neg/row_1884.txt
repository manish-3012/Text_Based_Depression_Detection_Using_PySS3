i'm only 15 and i'm about to give up.there's so many things wrong. my abusive step father, my absent father, my mother who loves me but won't accept me for being myself, the fact that i can barely stand to look at myself in a mirror, the general stress of school. i'm breaking down. i don't know who to talk to. last time i tried to get help i was sent to some christian counseling thing that didn't help at all. i don't know what to do. this has been going on for almost 4 years and i'm barely holding on
