Tired of waiting for the hurt to stop.I don't have the will to do anything anymore and my head just constantly feels numb. Nothing I do musters up the motivation it once did. Honestly, I'm bored as hell and tired of being beaten and battered by life. I don't even feel anything from pain anymore. Plus, this depression is ignored whenever I try to talk to someone about it. I feel like I have seen all there is to see in life and I don't care about the things I haven't seen yet. Everything, in time, will return to dust. Everyday I wake up and wonder if some freak accident will let me feel the release of oblivion. It takes everything I've got to not open the window next to me and jump out head first. My mind is a maelstrom of sadistic hate conflicting with hopeful benevolence. Being alive is such a chore but hate keeps me from ending it all. I never fucking asked to be born, and why is it such a crime to exist? If me existing ticks off the universe so much that it must kick my ass at every corner then good, I'm staying the fuck alive. I'm tired and broken, but ill be damned if I let those shits gossip and forget about me even if it means waking up and feeding this worthless bag of meat I call a body. Brothers and sisters, if you are reading this before submitting your own post let me congratulate you for keeping the good fight for this long. We are the discarded masses lost in the darkness, nobody will weep for us. My friend, if the pain is to great and you must leave tonight I will weep for you, and I hope you will do the same for me. However, the fight I wish to make is hard, and it would be great to have an ally by my side.
