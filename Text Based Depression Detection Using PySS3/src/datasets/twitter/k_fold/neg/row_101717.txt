I don't know what to say. There is no title.I know I may be asking for an unbiased, rational opinion from a subReddit like this, but... it's... what it is.

I'm autistic (*Asperger's*) and have ADHD, as well as various minor physical abnormalities like a gluten intolerance, glaucoma in one eye, and one eye that's farsighted while the other is nearsighted. These don't serve the basis of my complaints about myself and the lack of hope that I feel, because these are all things I was born with and cannot control.

Through my early life, I was either moving from home-to-home so quickly that I had never got to finish any kind of primary (Canadian term, I know) schooling before we had moved to a new home. By the time me and my siblings, whom I'm now separated from, settled down anytime it was around 8'th grade for me. I skipped through 9'th, and I wasn't there for 10'th through college. I came to a small town in Arkansas, and within two days I had my G.E.D because my early life was taken up by me spending every waking hour on a screen playing games, socializing with people, developing my identity, and developing my curiosity that led to knowledge. That's why, despite my lack of any kind of formal schooling before I got into PCCUA, I still had the capacity to finish the entire G.E.D course within the first two days I came here.

My mother, whom I love but otherwise can't stand being around for the most part (she's somewhat narcissistic in a bad way due to a mixture of PTSD and training in the S.S) has always had a mixture of control and self-security issues, and she often would gaslight someone if they were to say anything she disagreed with. When I became old enough to bring her behavior up and ask her exactly why she would do something as she did, I would be punished. That mixed with the abuse both she and her ex-husband (and the other seven on top of that, throughout my entire life) leveled at us all drove me to accept my grandfather's offer to have me live down here.

This place is, for the most part, nice. I hate the mosquitoes, but it's... nice. My issue is just with the realizations I've come to about myself. 

It's not that I'm really *ignorant,* it's that I don't put any judgement into anything anyone does because I know very little. I would stop a robbery, but if your friend comes on over and takes a few pills from your bottle of pills then I am at least in that present moment assuming that they have permission, ESPECIALLY if they do it so brazenly in front of me.

It's not that I'm dumb, it's that generally I refuse to come to conclusions about things because I don't know the facts. I don't mind what you think, but I will correct you if you're telling me that meat has no health benefits. I will allow for the possibility that people eat too much of it, but trying to tell me that meat has no purpose when it's been used by the human body for thousands of years *because* it's so useful from an energy standpoint? No. I will say "That isn't exactly true..."

It's not that I'm clumsy, it's just that I don't really care for petty things like not grazing my shoulder against a door. It just isn't really worth all the energy it'd take to sway my body like I'm dodging Matrix bullets.

It's not that I'm lazy, it's just that I need to spend less than half the day on the G.E.D test so it'll take two days and not one, what's the problem?

Then, I try to explain to someone why I couldn't come to their precious fucking concert. I had things to do. Sudden things, like having a piece of homework/paperwork arrive that day, DUE that day, and I have to spend five whole hours filling it out so if I came to your 9 to 5 concert I'd be too late for the deadline.

I don't want this to be an indictment of that person. I love them... but in the end, is it even worth it? The righteous die in droves, even when they are truly in the 'right'. The Enlightened people in the world are ignored only because they may be esoteric or unique. Love is forsaken in favor of people stuck eternally in cycles of working, coming home, falling asleep, getting up, and working again without any time for themselves.

Should I do it? This world just... doesn't feel worth living in. No matter what I say, I'm wrong. No matter what I do, I'm wrong. I see HOW I could be wrong, too, but I'm not... because I was there. Yet no-one believes me. And that would be fine, if their opinions didn't get in the way of their emotions and vice-versa... but that isn't how it is, it's the opposite for most people and I... I just... don't see it as worthwhile to be here, even if while I'm here I only want to help and only DO help.

TL; DR: No-one blames you for not wanting to read it all. It's a long post, meant for a specific type of person who is truly able to grant me aid with the mind that I have and the thoughts that I have. It isn't an indictment on you as a person if you don't want to read any of it, or only skimmed it... but I don't know if you'll be able to answer me at all.
