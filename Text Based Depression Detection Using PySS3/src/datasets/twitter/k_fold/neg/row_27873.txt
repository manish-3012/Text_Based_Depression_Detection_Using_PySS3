I hope you have a wonderful day.Spent 4 1/2 years at university turning down parties and drugs to study only to be dissmissed from too low gpa. Parents decide not worth paying for anymore. Enlisted in the navy for six years. Got out as E-6. Utilized GI bill for year only to fail everything and be dismissed again. No degree. No viable skills. Ive wanted to leave since i was 12. I would have turned thirty in aug. I guess its never too late to follow your dreams.
