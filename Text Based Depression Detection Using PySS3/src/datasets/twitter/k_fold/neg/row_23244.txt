Why donâ€™t I want to get better?Why donâ€™t I want my depression to get better? I hate feeling this way. But I turn my head away from anything that could help me. I do want to get help but at the same time I donâ€™t want to get better. Itâ€™s like everyone who has ignored my depression wins if I get better. Or maybe I like having depression because it defines my personality. Or maybe Iâ€™m too lazy or too scared to get better. I donâ€™t even know what the issue is. I always say that my death will be caused my suicide whenever it may be but I donâ€™t really care to want to live.
