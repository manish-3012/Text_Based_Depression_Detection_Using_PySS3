What will happen if i tell a doctor or a professional im considering committing suicide?I don't have money for ambulance fees or really any expenses at all.

Im not making my mom pay for that shit.

Can anyone tell me what will happen if i tell someone im seriously considering taking my own life? How much will it cost?
