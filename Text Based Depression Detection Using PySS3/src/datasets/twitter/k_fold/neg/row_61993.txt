Crazy high anxiety. Trouble with reality. I don't know what to do.[If you're easily disturbed by stuff like reality/matrix and stuff, then you might not like to read it.]

So that being said, I recently learned about [Many Worlds Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation). Basically the theory states that anytime something that could result in death happens, you branch out into a universe where you survive. You keep doing that so you always survive. That's the idea of it. An example would be like getting shot by gun. From your perspective you never die, because the gun will always jam. From everyone's perspective you die. So as you can imagine, anytime I encounter an event where I could have died, I go into panic attack thinking I actually died in another universe and my parents are really sad and stuff. It really screws me up so bad. I even start to feel guilty when I'm happy because i think back on how my parents in the other universe are sad and I'm here being all happy.

I have never taken drugs or anything like that incase anyone's wondering.

One event that happened yesterday was that while I was driving, I saw another van pass by me and I swear that guy was holding a gun pointing outside the window. Could have been something else too but it really looked like one. I have no idea why would any have that. Now I'm thinking 'shit, maybe that guy shot me and I'm in another universe".

Sorry if this isn't the right place to post but I feel like if I keep thinking this way, one day I'd definitely give up. It's so much work to keep thinking like this. My brain is tired. I'm tired. Can't even walk outside without extreme fear. And after that incident yesterday, I'm like 100 convinced I've died, and am in another universe. What am I suppose to do now? :'(
