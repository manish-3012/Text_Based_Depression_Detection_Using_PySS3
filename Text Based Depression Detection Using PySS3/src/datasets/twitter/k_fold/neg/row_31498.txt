I've been waiting nine years for it to get better.And in those nine years my best friend died, everyone I've thought I loved just fucked me over and over, my mental state is in rapid decline, and if I'm not worried that someone is going to die because I open up to them I'm worried they're just going to fuck me over. I'm delusional and have problems with depersonalization I feel like I'm living in a dream I have to be life can't actually be this fucked why do I have to feel this way land the only thing I can think is that if you die in a dream you wake up but even if I'm wrong it still has to be better than this
