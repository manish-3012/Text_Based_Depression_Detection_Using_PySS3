I just find suicide comforting to think aboutIf something beyond stressful is happening and everyone is yelling at everyone sometimes I go to my room and block my ears from the sound and just repeat itâ€™s okay itâ€™s okay because im going to kill myself I wonâ€™t have to go through this for much longer. Or when I get worried about how awful my future will be I think itâ€™s okay because Iâ€™m going to kill myself
