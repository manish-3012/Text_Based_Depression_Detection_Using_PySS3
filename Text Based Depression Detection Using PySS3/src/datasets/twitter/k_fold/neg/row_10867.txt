i really need someone to talk to.i know this sounds stupid but i told a friend about my suicidal thoughts and she said that i can message/call her anytime i want to talk but i have anxiety and i kind of feel like i am putting a burden on her by messaging her. i have come to reddit to find someone to talk to. i feel completely and utterly alone at the moment and when ever im in a group i always feel like im just the one who is always in the background and no one would notice if i were to disappear. i also have some other problems that i don't feel comfortable posting publicly.
