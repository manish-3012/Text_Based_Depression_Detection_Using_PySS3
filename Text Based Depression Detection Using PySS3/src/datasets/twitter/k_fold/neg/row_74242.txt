I Just Failed A Police InterviewI don't have a criminal background and I opened up to them about my past of domestic violence and other dirt that I've done before and was basically told that they wouldn't be able to process me as a police officer with all that stuff. My intentions were to have a positive impact on the world and helping society by doing the right things and now it looks like my dream of being a police officer is over too.

But... Instead of crying and deciding to kill myself, I'm going to keep my head up high and continue to look for employment elsewhere... because I don't have to be a cop in order to put a smile on other people's faces and I don't need to be a cop in order to have positive impact on this world. I came here and decided to post this here in order to serve as a positive example to those here who are suicidal. 

What looks like a failure is just another step to success
