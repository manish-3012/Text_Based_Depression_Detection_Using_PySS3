DAE feel good about eventually killing themselves?As for me, I have set a date, somewhat decided on methods and am in the progress of getting personal stuff out of the way. Now that I have a few months to go, with absolute zero responsibility for the far future and nothing to lose, I feel so free and happy, that I wouldn't know what to do if I wasn't planning on commiting suicide. Some weeks ago, I also began working on my bucket list and have already finished some activities, so I am more or less in the progress of having the time of my life ( a bit ironic ).


This isn't a call for help, but rather curiosity if other people are so content with death, sure about the act and so on that they are not really bothered by anything anymore, and pretty much free. How are you spending your last time? Does it make you happy, too?
