Nearing the endMy wife hates me, hates my job, my family, and everything that I've worked so hard for. When she leaves me, she will take my son, along with everything else. I am on the verge of blowing my own head off just to beat her before she can get one up on me, but it will leave my son without a father. Talk me down. Please.
