Ideation--I'm curious to know what your plan is to commit suicide? Or do you have multiple ideas? Have you attempted and were unsuccessful? Do you regret it..as in feel like a failure?
I'm planning on committing suicide soon. I've attempted several times but failed. I guess because I rushed or lost courage. I want some ideas aside from my own. My mind is clear and more calm now. I'm ready to die but I want a back up plan. Let me know your answers. If this post gets some feedback..or doesn't get flagged.
