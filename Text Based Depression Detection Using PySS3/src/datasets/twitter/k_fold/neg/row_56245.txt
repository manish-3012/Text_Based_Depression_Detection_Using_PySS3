I just want out. I've had enoughI feel so suffocated just leave me alone. Give me some space. If I had a gun I would shoot myself with no hesitation. I just want it to be quick and painless.

My mum then told me she was weak. 

She thinks those who choose to get out of here quickly are weak.

I'm weak.
