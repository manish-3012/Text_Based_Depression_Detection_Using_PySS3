It has been a while since Iâ€™ve been this close (18m)So I am a teen boy who got mixed up in the wrong things and ended up hurting a lot of people. Ever since my ex broke up with me itâ€™s been my mission to be a better person and get out of the dark hole of drugs, suicide, and laziness. Iâ€™ve come a long way, it has been about 9 months since Iâ€™ve seriously considered killing myself. I made the mistake of texting my ex who blocked me on everything save my phone number despite having a new great girlfriend. She basically told me what she said before and demonstrated how she loves her life without me. I asked her to unblock me, she said why, I told her because I had grown so much and have become a much better person. She told me that she wants me to never speak to her again and repeatedly told me how worthless I was as a person to her (not in those words probably me over analyzing) I now hate myself doubly for texting her despite my current gf and because sheâ€™s found someone better than me and it just makes me think about all the horrible things I did to her. I really, genuinely believe if I kill myself than the world would be better off. (Even if I know logically it wonâ€™t) I just, I canâ€™t cope with my own mistakes and all I can think about is hanging myself from my bedroom window and now Iâ€™m crying and I just hate my entire existence.
