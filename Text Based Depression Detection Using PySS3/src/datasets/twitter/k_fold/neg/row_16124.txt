wow. cant believe were back.hi. m/16 here. long history of mental illness. specifically bpd ( cant get the diagnose finalized till im 18 , but ive had multiple psychiatrists tell me they would diagnose me given the possibility. ) 

im absolutely emotionally dependant on my boyfriend. he , sadly , can be rather toxic. hes cheated on me , neglects me and currently its as if.. his best friend is trying to tear him away from me. i know they kissed not too long ago. 

i am currently at a point where all of this is getting too much for me. ive relapsed tonight , i already took a rather small overdose ( nothing that'll cause much harm , actually ) and i'm. god. im at my wits end. 

my life has been horrible. always. 
i was bullied from day one , abused and raped at 14 , and ive had a long string of terrible relationships. my parents dont care much , my dad thinks i dont have the guts to kill myself.

ive had quite a few attempts in the past. 

i just calmed down after 3 hours of sobbing , but god. i need this to stop.
