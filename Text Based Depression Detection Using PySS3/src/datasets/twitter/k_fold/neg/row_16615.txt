I need helpCan someone please help me? I can't keep going anymore. My fiancÃ© just broke my heart and is now laughing at me while I'm sitting here crying. He made fun of me and is laughing at me while i am having a panic attav.lj. And now he's threatening to call the police to have me evicted. I am 3500 miles from home. I don't have any $ or friends or family here. I have a history of suicide attempts. I don't know what to do. I can't deal with this.
