I wish I'd drop deadno one seems to care about me anymore, not even the people that I call my friends.  I have no one except for someone who I really like and they like me too but there's always someone better for them.  I did plan my suicide pretty much right after someone broke up with me (he seemed like he wanted me to anyways) but I never did it and I really wish I did.  No one cares about my emotional well being so I'm thinking about planning it again.  To everyone it just seems like I'm something sexual anyways.  Touch me here. Touch me there.  Ask for nudes.  

Kiss me then say you have no feelings for me.  

I know where the bleach is and I just need a time when I'm home alone and maybe I should make a note.  But then again, who would care?
