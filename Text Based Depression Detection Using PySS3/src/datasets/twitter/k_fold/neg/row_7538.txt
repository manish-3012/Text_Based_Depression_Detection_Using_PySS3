Afraid my friend is going to fall through the cracksI fear for her life multiple times a week. Almost every night she tells me wants to die, to let her go. She's in a borderline abusive relationship because he is there to pull her back from the edge. Her eating is disordered, she drinks to blackout, she has insomnia and gave herself second-degree burns during one recent bout.

She's seeing a therapist, and she sometimes goes to the hospital when it's especially bad. The last time they had her wait there until morning until the resident psychiatrist came in only to tell her there was nothing he could do for her.

She acquired a bag of pills from her parents' house over the holidays. We had reason to chase after her last night and finally reached her boyfriend's phone to hysterical crying and puking. This is not a one-time-off event anymore.

I believe she is currently a constant danger to herself. I believe she needs a long-term, residential option at this point. Frankly, she is in danger if she is not being watched. But I don't know how it works, if it's even viable, and she won't be willing. What else can be done for her? Please help. I will do anything to prevent loss of life, but I am out of ideas.
