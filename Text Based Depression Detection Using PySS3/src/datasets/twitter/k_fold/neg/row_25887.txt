My girlfriend left me because I am sexually incompetentBasically what the title says. I'm 24 years old, I can't keep doing this. It's been like this since I was 17 and abused by a girl I was dating. It has scarred me for life. Therapy didn't fix it, drugs helped but I can't pop a pill every single time. But it's not just performance, it's the intimacy, and lack of craving. I had as much sex as I could with her, but it wasn't enough, I have a defect.

She has every right to leave, why stay with some broken person? She loved everything about me, but the one thing I cannot fix pushed her away. It hurts so much to sit here alone in my cold apartment knowing all of this. I almost wish she made up some other reason, but I know the truth. Why continue?
