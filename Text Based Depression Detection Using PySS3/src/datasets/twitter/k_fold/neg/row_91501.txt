My life sucksThis might be a little long but idk.. no tldr because this is a lot of my problems and its already summarized. Deal with it.

Let me start out saying that I grew up with my mother until I was 10 years old. I never knew my dad at all because apparently he was "violent". My mom married when I was 10, and immediately had a child with my step dad. I really liked him at first but after him treating me really mean as a child I ended up not liking him really quickly. He was mean, one time I remember looking in the mirror in my room as a teenager, minding my own business and he comes in and basically says "why are you looking in the mirror? is there something in your eye? pretty sure there's nothing behind your eye, you dumb bitch". I went and told my mom what he said and she ignored me. 

My grandmother said that my mom is married to him to help support her and her new child and she wouldn't stick up for me because she didn't want to loose that support. There was a lot of fighting in our house, most of it consisted of my step dad picking on me for NO reason at all (I would be minding my own business in my room and he would come pick on me and laugh at me) and I would go tell my mom and end up crying to her and having both of them yell at me. He would also come by my door every morning like an hour before I had to get up for school and kick the door in and then slam it, waking me up. He would also wake me up by dripping water on my face and farting on me.


Besides all my step dad and house issues, I had problems with people bullying me all through school, especially high school. I had people spit on me and call me names and other things. I was also raped when I was 16 by my boyfriend at the time. I said no but he kept going. People make fun of me and say its my fault for that because they say "well you could of stopped him by kicking him or something" but I didn't want to hurt him because I cared about him. At 17 I was taken out of my house after multiple suicide attempts and being admitted to the hospital, the police put me at a friends house to live with her and her grandma for a few weeks. They then put me back in with my parents because they couldn't find any proof of physical abuse (even though my parents made threats). 

At 18, I had 2 jobs (I had 1 job since I was 15 actually) and my parents started charging me rent. I was trying to go to tech school to get a degree. I ended up getting to stressed out because I had to pay for all my food, rent, books, school, phone, car, insurance ect while I was working 45 hours a week. All while my parents were still being mean to me and verbally abusing me. One time my mom threw a vase at me because I told her I couldnt do chores because I had to work. They would usually make me clean the house and do outside work such as mow our lawn. I also started getting really sick a lot during this time. I couldn't take it and my grades were bad so I dropped out.

I ended up moving out with my boyfriend last summer. I moved in with him and his parents. He was with his parents because he was going to college and didnt want to live in the dorms cause it was cheaper at home. I had a few problems such as his older brother being really mean to me and picking on me and trying to get their parents to hate me. Like for example he messed up the whole house while the parents were away and blamed it on me, even though I was at work. They ended up being really mad at me and almost kicked me out. He would also randomly call me a bitch and just say mean things to me. I never did anything wrong to him so idk why he was acting like that... Anyway during that time last summer I finally had something good happen. I started talking to my real father. I ended up looking up some old police records and called his parents, and ended up finding out his home address and phone number. He lived across the country though, so I only talked to him on skype, we planned to go out and visit him though this spring. It turns out though only a few months of talking to him and actually having a parent, he ends up dying from an accidental overdose on his pain meds. He died over thanksgiving. I am really upset. I just wanted to hug him and meet him and tell him how much I appreciate having a parent in my life. I finally had a parent who wasnt mean to me and he ends up dying. I wish I could talk to him one more time. 

I live with my boyfriend now in an apartment 4 hours away from my hometown. He is in college right now. Things were going ok for a while. Recently my boyfriend lost his job after his car broke down and he couldn't get to work. Now I am supporting both of us. This last month we have been going to food pantries because we are poor.

I have been really depressed lately. I have been really sick and dizzy and nauseous and feel like throwing up. I had the flu for 2 weeks with a high fever. I went to the doctor and they gave me a note but my work won't accept it. I made a post about it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s97gn/walmart_dday_letter_and_about_to_be_fired/

I didn't have any health insurance until recently, so I was afraid to go to the doctor, especially since we don't really have money the way it is. My health insurance now only covers 1 visit. I went into the doctors right when I started feeling sick and the doctor said they didn't know my medical history so they didn't write me a note. I was really nervous to go in again because I would have to pay everything out of pocket. I went in anyway. Though when I went in I was on pain reliever which also made my fever drop so they said I wasn't sick enough for them to fill out my FMLA paperwork even though I had a hard time even getting out of bed to go to the local hospital. The thing is the night before I went in with a high fever and the walk in was closed so I would have to be admitted to the hospital. The receptionist told me it would cost me a lot of money so I decided to go home. I had already missed a week of work at this point. I forgot to call the 1800 number a few times but I was really confused and could barely sit up in bed. I called in during the day when I was up and I guess the manager then forgot to tell them I called in because I got a write up for no call no show and dday for my absences. 

Idk what to do. I was doing my hour drive home tonight after getting dday/write up and I cried all the way home. The only person I have to talk to is my boyfriend, and he isnt the chatty type, so he didn't know what to say except "everything will be ok". But nothing ever goes right for me and my life just sucks. I have been struggling my whole life. I see people and friends who have nice lives, their parents are nice and they get to go to college and have their parents support them and I get really upset. Why cant I have nice parents that would help me go to college? Why cant I have parents that would help me out when I am in need? My mom wont even give me money for food. It makes me mad though because they treat my step sister really nice. She is only 8 but they bought her a laptop and a 3ds recently. She doesn't even like video games and doesn't even NEED a laptop. SHES 8!! I asked for a computer when I was in high school and they wouldn't get me one, I ended up biking all the way to a library daily to do my homework and sometimes didn't get my papers done because the library closed at 9, and most nights after school i worked until 9 because my parents wouldn't pay for my lunches. 

My parents wouldn't  even sign the papers to get a drivers licences. I never got one until I was 18 and my grandma drove me to the dmv. I had a hard time buying my first car too. My neighbor was selling her car, and I was trying to save up for it, right when I got enough and was about to go over there my step dad went over and told her I don't have money and he tried to buy it instead so he could "sell it to a dealership to get some money for a newer car" Also my parents put my sister in any clubs or anything she wants. I played violin through out my schooling, and I begged them for a tutor like the other kids had so I could get better at it. I wanted to learn a solo to enter into a college. But they refused. But then they go and buy my little sister a tutor for her violin at age 6. I wanted one in high school so I could get into college.

I sometimes cosplay to make me happy. I know its a weird hobby but whatever. I recently entered a contest though. I didn't win anything, but I found out that the people who won, won unfairly because they were friends with the judges..  I brought this up to the con facebook page and a bunch of people got mad at me saying I was just jealous but I had physical proof (blog pages and pictures) showing the girl who won working on the costume with the judges. They were part of a sewing group together. I just stated that its unfair because staff members cant win contests neither should the same group members. I got a lot of backlash because of it and people even started to threaten me and post my personal information such as my address and phone number on 4chan. I am upset because all these people are mad at me for just bringing up an issue I thought was unfair and now idk if people will judge against me because of it at contests. Im afraid I will never be able to win anything again because of just bringing up an issue... It was my only hobby and thing that made me happy and now its ruined.

I am sick of things never working out. Right now my car has problems I cant fix, and I have doctors bills coming, my work is about to fire me, people are mad at me, I don't have decent parents and I am poor and can't afford my rent this month because of being sick... I am just really depressed.
