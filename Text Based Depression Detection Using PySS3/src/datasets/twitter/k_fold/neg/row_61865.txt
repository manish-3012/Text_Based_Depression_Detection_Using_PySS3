I just feel so emptyI peaked in high school. I did nothing in college. I mean I graduated but I skipped tons of class and just got by doing the homework. I layed around on my phone all the time. I didnt really make friends. Theres nobody that comes to me when they need something. Even my parents barely like me!

All I ever ever ever want to do is lie down and scroll and zone out. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I need a fucking intervention. I want to fucking go to a hospital and have them fix me. I want a lobotomy! I want to drown myself!
