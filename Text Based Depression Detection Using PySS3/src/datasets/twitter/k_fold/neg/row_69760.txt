Iâ€™m so lonely &amp; my loneliness is driving me to suicideIâ€™m a 25 year old woman. Iâ€™m not ugly but Iâ€™m not attractive either. I had a great boyfriend 2 years ago who I had to break up with because my mental health declined and I had to leave school/ go back home. I blame myself and hate myself for that every day. I wish I wasnâ€™t so mentally ill that I couldâ€™ve stayed with him. 

Iâ€™ve been going on dates. But everything falls through. No one wants anything serious. Maybe I donâ€™t look like my pictures. Maybe Iâ€™m too fat or ugly. Maybe they can sense how pathetic of a person I am. I canâ€™t go on one more bad date or ill actually do something impulsive. 

My friends say Iâ€™ll find someone. No one takes it seriously how single I am and how much pain I am in. Iâ€™m scared I let the love of my life go and I just have to deal with this for the rest of my life. 

Iâ€™m just so lonely it hurts. I donâ€™t know what to do.
