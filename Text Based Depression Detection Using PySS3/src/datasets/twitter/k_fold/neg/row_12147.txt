Reached the end of my rope. Alcoholism worse than ever.Hey, my name is Ben Iâ€™ve struggled with depression and self imagine issues for years. I lost 80 pounds and consider myself a good looking kid. But for months Iâ€™ve been just seen as a option by all these girls or Iâ€™m used and tossed aside. Recently I told a girl that Iâ€™ve had a crushed on since we were kids that I had feeling for her and she said she wanted to grab a bite to eat and that she was happy I told her. Sounds great right? No. I then asked if that was a date or something and she left me on read and ignored me ever since. My last relationship was abusive and toxic and after that Iâ€™ve just wanted to find a decent person that fits me perfectly but everyone Iâ€™ve met has been cold or inconsiderate. I took to drinking to dull the pain because I now constantly ask myself if anything is wrong with me and Iâ€™m starting to believe there is. Itâ€™s the worst feeling in the world looking in the mirror and wanting to spit in your own reflection.
