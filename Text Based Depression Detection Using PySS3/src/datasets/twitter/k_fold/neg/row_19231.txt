Existential crisis, failing my own rules. (x-post from r/depression)Ever since my sophomore year in high school I've struggled with recurring existential crises. I educated myself in a bit of existentialism and absurdism, and came to the conclusion that I should try to live my life to the fullest and be as free as I can. To put it simply, a large portion of my (atypical) depression is that I almost always choose the path of least resistance and I let myself be ruled by petty, incompetent, or oppressive authority figures. I would dismiss my concerns as unreasonable if it weren't for many people living these dreams (most notably in my opinion, Hunter S. Thompson).

Fight Club and Thus Spoke Zarathustra delivered important messages to me: that it is up to me, and me alone to take my life into my own hands and live in spite of absurdity and social control. And, perhaps most importantly, to make my time spent here worth the effort. But I almost always choose the safer, more passive routes in life, and I don't, can't, and won't forgive myself for my weakness.

A couple lines from Fight Club help explain where I'm coming from: "This is your life, good to the last drop. Nothing gets any better than this. This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time." (I may have messed the lines up, but oh well.) My time spent here is precious, I should be living it up to Dionysian extremes.

But, to get back to the point, I want some advise r/depression. What should I do?

(I'm posting this here because I find myself thinking about suicide with some regularity. I doubt I'll ever do it, but it is a concern nonetheless, and the people at r/depression aren't responding.)
