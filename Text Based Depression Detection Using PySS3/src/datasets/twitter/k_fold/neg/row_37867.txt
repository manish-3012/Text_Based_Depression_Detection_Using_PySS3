I Need Somebody to Love on MeIt has been a hard few months. I was going through a traumatic event before the lockdowns and quarantines began in my country, and the shutdown has made it very difficult for me to manage the repercussions of the accident I went through.

I just want to cry and have a hug from someone who won't yell at me or get angry at me or be impatient with me like all the people around me are. I just want someone to understand my sensitive heart, but it hurts reaching out over and over again and meeting people who just won't get it.

I wish I had someone who could protect me, or at least say they would and mean it. I don't have a family; I have people I'm related to, but they don't get me and I'm over them. I know if I make it through th we times, I'll be happier than I've ever been, but with very little support, I'm struggling to make it through each day. Suicide crosses my mind daily, but I'm always too scared to do anything. Truthfully, I don't want to die, I just want to escape this prison and this isolation. I want to be with people like me, some call it a "soul family". 

I'm glad I can vent here.
