Sometimes i genuinely feel like the world would be better without me.I do realize that such a sentiment is stupid when i'm in a better mood, but alas, such moments seemingly come rarer and rarer.

I often feel like i'm useless and that i cant be depended upon.

Im unlikely to actually commit suicide, but it feels like people would be better off without me. It almost feels... Liberating. 

This is the first time i've told anyone about these feelings, and even as of writing this i just feel like i'm bothering you more than anything...
