HopelessEvery time I talk to this one person about my feelings, she always says, " well, you just gotta get better" or "just stop feeling bad." It just makes me feel worse hearing these obvious statements. Of course I need to get better and stop feeling bad, but I can't suddenly stop my brain from giving me these negative thoughts. Yesterday she told me that no one wants to hear my problems, and she's willing to listen only because she's a part of my family. She told me that she doesn't know how a therapist will help me, so what if she's right? I have depression and panic disorder, and I keep on finding pros considering suicide rather than any cons. I don't think a therapist will help me. Recently, I went through a hospitalization program, and while I did feel better there, when I came home, I would start thinking of suicide. The best I could do right now is: swallow a bunch of xanax, but that will only knock me out for a little bit.
