I feel like dying but it wouldnâ€™t be fairIâ€™m inching closer and closer to suicide right now. I can barely get up and I feel so empty and sad. I want to kill myself, but I would feel bad doing it so close to the holidays. I donâ€™t want anyone thinking I just hate Christmas that much. None of my friends have seen me over the holidays, and I canâ€™t text them to vent because Iâ€™m so terrified that Iâ€™ve talked about feeling sad too much and theyâ€™re gonna abandon me and then Iâ€™ll have nobody. I feel so selfish to admit this, but I just want them to check on me and make sure Iâ€™m okay, because even knowing that they care enough to ask would help.

I donâ€™t know how long I can keep going.
