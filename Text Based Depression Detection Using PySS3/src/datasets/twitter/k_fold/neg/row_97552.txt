i can't take this anymoreI went through a bad breakup a few months ago and she slept with someone after only a week, and has been through many more ever since. we were together for almost three years but we were long distance, so i guess it was doomed eventually. i keep having flashbacks to good times and can't stop thinking about her having sex with other guys. my self-esteem, confidence, and everything i liked about myself is gone. she made my life interesting and fun, and without her i feel like i'm not even alive.

 i had self-harmed a couple times before the breakup but in the past two months i've taken it to another level. i sleep with a knife in my hand and have cut myself so deep that i know it'll leave scars. right after the breakup happened i tried to jump off my apartment's roof but couldn't work up the courage because i wasn't confident the fall would kill me. i think about ending my life every day, and want to make use of my peanut allergy to that end. 

i could get in my car and ride to somewhere remote with a bag of reese's cups or something. the allergy is definitely severe enough to kill me, and almost has once or twice by accidental exposure. it's not the most comfortable experience, but it's definitely the most practical and accessible method with the highest probability of success. i'm not sure what kind of feedback i want from this post, but i've been following this subreddit for some time now and figured it couldn't hurt to post.
