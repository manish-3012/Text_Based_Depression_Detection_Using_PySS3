I really think it's time.Iâ€™m so tired. I think Iâ€™m gonna call it quits. I honestly donâ€™t think I was meant to be in this world long. I feel like maybe I've served my purpose and my constant sadness is my bodyâ€™s way of telling me Iâ€™ve been here long enough. I donâ€™t know. Thatâ€™s stupid. Iâ€™m stupid. It sucks that knowing no matter what pills I take, no matter the amount, and no matter the combination Iâ€™m always going to struggle. It doesn't matter who I talk to or what I talk about I always end up in a horrible low. Not much brings me joy anymoreâ€¦.I justâ€¦Iâ€™m going to end it. There is no point anymore.
