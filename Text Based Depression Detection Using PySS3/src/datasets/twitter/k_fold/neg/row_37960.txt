I feel like an assholeIâ€™m an asshole to my parents and to my younger brother. I get mad at my parents whenever they try to help me whenever I mess up, I constantly lie, and I shut out the people closest to me whenever Iâ€™m in a bad mood. Half the time I feel that Iâ€™m going to hell no matter what and I think that committing suicide is not a way out for me, but away to take pressure off of my parents and sibling who are trying to help me.
