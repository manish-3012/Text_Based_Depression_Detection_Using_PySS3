The eternal oblivion.I'm done. I have given away and sold almost all my possessions these past few months. It will be by hanging. I have gauged the height at which I shall tie my ligature at and have made sure that I will drop at a sufficient height to ensure my spine is snapped for a quick and painless death.

I suffer from a multitude of mental illnesses, I have seen more psychiatrists and taken more medication than I could possibly account, and frankly I've attempted suicide twice before.

The medication only provides temporary relief and I'm sick and fucking tired of needing an artificial mean in order to achieve happiness.

We are told that suicide is an impulsive act, make no mistake this is far from the case. I have deliberated and thought about this for years, now it is the time. We are told that suicide is a selfish act, but you know what's even more fucking selfish? Forcing somebody else to live and continue suffering for the expense of others.

Fuck society for dictating what people can or can not do with their own lives. I'm in charge of my own fucking life. I am in control of my own life, and I'll be goddamned if anybody infringes on that. I will not be locked up in an mental institution and be force fed medication, because the only thing worse than suicide is *not being able to commit suicide*.

I'm fucking done. Fuck this agonizing existence that has brought me no joy. I desperately seek the eternal oblivion as to which I'll finally be able to rest and be in peace. I have made my choice and there is no going back. This post is essentially one final rant and not one asking for advice or begging to be swayed. I will not be posting anymore after this.


I am in charge of my fate, I am in charge of my own life. Fuck anybody that says otherwise.

Goodbye.
