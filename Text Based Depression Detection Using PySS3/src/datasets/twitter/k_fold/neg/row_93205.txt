Just tell me I am good enough to be here.I'm just going to run through some of the facts, or otherwise this would be entirely too long.
I've been chronically ill since the age of four and am now almost twenty. 
I've almost died twice due to these medical issues. 
I've never attempted suicide or been institutionalized.
I will be sick with these incurable conditions every waking moment for the rest of my life.
I'm the only child of a single mom who is busting her ass to care for me (and doing a great job).
My dad doesn't care about me.
I feel like the biggest burden on earth and I am so beyond miserable in this broken, sickly body. I am not my body. My body has failed me and in return, I feel like I am now failing my mom and the other few people that care about me.
Honestly, I just need to be told I'm worthy of living by someone other than my mom. Help a girl out?
