I might have fucked up.I have been feeling better these past few months and I talked with my therapist about adopting a cat as an emotional support animal. Sheâ€™s the sweetest thing in the world and I love her to death.

But now I realize that I donâ€™t know who she would go to if I died. I feel like Iâ€™m tied to this shitty fucking world now because I have her. Iâ€™m not actively suicidal right now but itâ€™s only a matter of time before I am again, and then everything will be so much harder. I love her, sheâ€™s so sweet, but what if things get so bad I need to escape?
