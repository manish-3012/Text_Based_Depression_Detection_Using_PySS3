I think of suicide every morning when I wake upAnybody else here?
I'm sick of my life.
I don't want to live anymore despite the fact that everything is fine.
I'm going to study soon at an University but I can't handle with my past. It happened so many things.
I just can't. 
It's been 2 years now when I first thought of suicide. 
I even tried to kill my self once by hanging up myself but it didn't work. The fucking rope just ruptured. Stupid rope.
Anyways, Every morning I stand up and wish I was dead.
No need to worry guys. Probably I will continue to life because of my family and friends. Otherwise it would be a huge disaster and shame.
Just want to express and share my feelings.
Hope that someone is out there who understands me....
