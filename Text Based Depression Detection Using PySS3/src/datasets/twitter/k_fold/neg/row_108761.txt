I dont know where to begin with lifeSo I'm 19 and I'm having suicidal thoughts constantly but there's something always making me want to keep on living, I can never think of myself doing that. But I just don't know where to begin

I've always hated myself, I've been overweight from the age of 7 to now and I was picked on and bullied for it and I just kinda felt intimated by certain people so I always kept to myself and to this day I find speaking to folk awkward, as I just don't know what to say and I freak out and just make a fool out of myself. I finally found a group of friends that appreciated me and it brought me joy in life. Like I always accepted that I would be this lonely but this group of friends were great. I finally left school and got into university and started taking medication for my acne which I thought I wouldn't get depressed, so I decided to go ahead with the medication.

Slowly over time, things got to me, being alone, not having a relationship with anyone or getting intimate with anyone in my whole life, the stress of uni, friends being dicks to each other, my flatmates getting into trouble and us nearly getting kicked out the flat, no one speaking to me.

Like a problem I noticed with me is that no one in my group of friends wants to speak to me over social media, no one ever messages me about anything but when I see them in person they speak to me fine. Like everytime we are out, all my friends would be on their phones messaging someone but like no one messages me and it made me depressed.

I kept it too myself but I told I really close friend of mine, like I told her because i was close with her and because I like her but obviously she won't like me as I'm over weight, but I told her stuff that's happened and I finally told her that I was suicidal. She helped a lot at times but then I started getting into arguments with her and it's been on off.

Like it's gotten to the point where I think she hates my guts but she doesn't want to tell me but she says that she's still here for me even if we are arguing, she would help no matter what.

But I've now got to the point where I'm now ignoring all my friends, as I'm trying to focus on myself and get my own problems solved, but i just don't know what to do. Im socially awkward when it comes to speaking to anyone, I'm overweight, I have to resit my year at uni because of everything that's happening to me, my friends don't speak to me, I'm depressed and have symptoms of anxiety. I just don't know where to start. I can't look myself in the mirror without hating myself.
