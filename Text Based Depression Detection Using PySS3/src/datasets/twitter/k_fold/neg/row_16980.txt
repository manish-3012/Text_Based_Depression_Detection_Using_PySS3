passively suicidal - past failed attemptsI guess I'm just searching for some support here... I went through a period of active suicidal behaviour for 1-2 years which exhausted me to the point where I felt like I couldn't face attempting it again. Unfortunately the thoughts still haven't left, and I only feel regret that I wasn't successful. I feel very detatched and numb all the time, and unable to get the motivation to actually act on these feelings (for now) but I really wish I wasn't here. My mental health team barely see me anymore because I'm not on medication (it just made me worse) and I guess they see me as less of a threat to myself. The trouble is, every day is a struggle and I just want it to end. I don't know where to go for support because the hospital won't care unless I'm psychotic or have overdosed and I'm still resentful for them forcing treatment on me to reverse my last overdose. I feel like I wasn't given a choice and then after a few days they sent me home and made me feel like everything was supposed to be ok now. I feel like I might as well be dead.
