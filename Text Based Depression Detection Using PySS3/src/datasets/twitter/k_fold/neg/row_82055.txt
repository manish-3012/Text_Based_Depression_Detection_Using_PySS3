I just want to dieI don't want to be here. I feel worthless. I feel like i do not matter to anyone. No one need or want me in their life. I've been neglected and avoided ever since i was 12. Im 15 now. I feel numb. So numb I dont feel the pain when i cut myself. I just wish i was born with some kind of condition that kills me. I'd be happy to have a heart condtion, or cancer or anything that kills me because my body is shit. People will only show up at my funeral because a girl killed herself.
