Iâ€™m tiredThis is it, one last cherry on top, one last failure.
Iâ€™m tired, and I cannot do this anymore. Iâ€™ve failed every single dream and goal I have set and Iâ€™ve worked so hard and given so much of my life for those goals. I worked so hard, for nothing and I canâ€™t do this anymore. This life fucking sucks and Iâ€™m sorry for the rest of yâ€™all that will have to suffer for however much longer yâ€™all are here. Iâ€™m a disappointment alive or not, to my self and everyone around me, but life goes on, good bye
