Please HelpI have a suicidal friend after her parents divorced. I am extremely worried as she has easy access to guns and has already attempted multiple times. Iâ€™m the only person who knows about this and she doesnâ€™t want anyone else to know so they donâ€™t carry the burden. Sheâ€™s already tried to get help from a therapist but it didnâ€™t work. How do I show that I care about her life and what do I say?
