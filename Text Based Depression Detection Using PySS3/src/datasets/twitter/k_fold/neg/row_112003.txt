I don't know what to put hereI'm really struggling. I'm in a really dark place. I've been here before but I don't know what to do to be me again.

I'm 36. I have atypical ASD, depression, and anxiety. I'm on disability. Work is too much stress for me. I don't get enough to live on with public assistance. My city has been in a housing crisis and it's pretty much impossible to find anywhere I can afford the rent. My dad has been helping me with my rent for 3 years now. A couple hundred every month. It was really hard when I moved to this apartment. I was not functioning almost at all during the move. It was very sudden and unexpected. We pretty much had a 1 week notice to move then.

Anyway, I never would have got through that move without my parents and I wouldn't have a home without them. It's worth mentioning that I moved into the city, away from the area I've lived in for most of my adult life. I've been really uprooted. I don't have any close IRL friends anymore. There's a church I sometimes attend, but haven't this year. They're not close like my previous parish was. I've been a lot more socially isolated this last 3 years. I do have some online friends though.

Last month they told me they were selling their house and moving to a neighboring state, next door to my younger brother's new home. I was really upset about them selling the house. I grew up there. I know anyone would be sentimental, but with my sensory issues, that place is the most familiar place I could ever be.

The house sold in literally 1 day and the short end of it is they're leaving on Saturday. My dad told me he will continue to help me. That nothing is going to change about that. They were very specific in making sure I knew they were not abandoning me. It's a long story, but we have a rough history and from some of that I have abandonment issues. Things are really different now, but I still have PTSD.

This month my upstairs neighbors moved out of the house. The new neighbor has been quite a bit noisier. When I'm functioning, I usually can cope with that okay, but with the stress of quarantine, politics, this move, and the noise, I just broke last week. Each day seems worse and worse.

Even though they're really busy packing, I talk to my mom on the phone when I'm having a hard time. She's very supportive, but I know it takes a toll on her and there will be a point where I'll have to give her more space.

Anyway, every morning I wake up with anxiety. It isn't long before I start crying. There's tension in every cell in my body. I shake and I sob until I'm so worn out I can't anymore. I'm in so much pain.

My nerves are completely shot. Even the smallest unexpected noises can set me off. I'm so hyperreactive to everything right now.

I don't want them to leave. I'm scared of not having them here. The only family I have left here is my older brother and his family and they don't really understand me when I'm this bad. They don't know how or what to do. They're just not really supportive in that way.

I'm scared of being alone and I feel really really alone right now. I don't feel any hope anymore. I don't know how to be me anymore. Normally I'm just kinda funny, charming, smart, caring, and strong. But being broken like this... I feel incredibly vulnerable.

I've attempted suicide twice in my life. I'm not going for a round 3. But I struggle with those thoughts all day when I'm like this. I often don't feel like it will get better, even if I know it has before. It's really hard. Like really really really hard to be like this each day. At least with the move, the solution was getting the apartment and settling in. With my parents leaving, I don't know how to get better. I'm just really scared. Terrified. Traumatized.

I'm a smart person. I'm on medication to help with the depression and anxiety. I'm a pretty good problem solver. I'm not looking much for solutions to the technical problems of my situation, though suggestions are welcome. I'm just not really in a place where I can make rational decisions and even thinking about that stuff causes me to get overwhelmed.

I guess, I dunno, all I want is support right now.
