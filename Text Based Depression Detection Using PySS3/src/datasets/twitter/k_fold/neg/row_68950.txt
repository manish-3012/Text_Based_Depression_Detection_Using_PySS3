It doesn't matter anymoreThrowaway because people know my real account. 

Every time I try, things just keep getting worse. Applied for a better job, got to work two weeks before a temp layoff until busy season. That led to my car being repo'd. Which led to missed appointments and a denial of claims for failure to show.

I'm disabled, I hurt all the time. I don't get to see my kids anymore because no car... My ex won't change visitation for me, just told the kids I didn't love them...

It just doesn't matter anymore.
