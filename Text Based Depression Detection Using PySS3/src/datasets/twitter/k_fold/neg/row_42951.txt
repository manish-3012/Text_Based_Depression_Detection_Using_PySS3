Soul crushing loneliness --- for no damn reason.I'm really lonely. I'm so lonely I want to just hurt myself to escape the feeling. The thing is, I shouldn't be lonely. I have a loving Girlfriend. I have a best friend who would do anything for me. I have a family and friends and coworkers, but I still feel so *alone.*

I don't know who to turn to. My girlfriend and best friend are both sleeping, and nowhere near me (both are &gt;3000km away right now).

Please help me. I am close to just cutting.
