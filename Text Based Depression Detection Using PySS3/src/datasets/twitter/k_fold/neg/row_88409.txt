I feel emptyA couple months ago a very close friend of mine committed suicide, I have struggled with suicidal thoughts myself for a long time but after that day I felt emptier than before, I dread the feeling that i'll never be able to talk to him again. I cry multiple times a week thinking about him. Recently I find no interest in going on in life anymore. I am young and people always say "oh you have so much to look forward too" and to be honest I don't see the point of it all. I may sound selfish but i don't want to deal with any of that I just simply want to disappear. I feel helpless and I feel like there's no point in going on anymore.
