Tomorrow....im gonna try to do itIm pretty scared. Idk if itll work. And idk whatll happen if it doesnt. Lots of excedrin should do the trick i guess.

Im failing my classes but need a serious reason to withdraw. Im thinking if i can survive, i can maybe be allowed to withdraw from some classes. 

I dont even know. I feel so alone. Is anyone in the same spot as me? I feel like this is the only way out.
