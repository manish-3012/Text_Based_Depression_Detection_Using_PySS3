Am I really suicidal?I don't truly consider myself suicidal, so I'm not sure if I should even be posting here.

But, well...the last few months, usually at least once every couple days, I think to myself "I want to die." I'm just so exhausted by life and sometimes it doesn't seem worth it, especially when it's going to end ultimately anyway.

The thing is, I have a lot of dreams and ambitions for the future. And I have no intention of ever killing myself because it is a very scary thought to me. But these thoughts are still disturbing to me, and never seem to completely go away.
