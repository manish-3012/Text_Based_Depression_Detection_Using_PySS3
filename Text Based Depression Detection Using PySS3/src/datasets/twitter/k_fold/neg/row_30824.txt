I feel as if I'm going through a downward spiral.I've been diagnosed with all manor of illnesses - Depression, OCD, Schizoaffective, etc. - and put on all manner of pills, changing my regimen almost every time I visit the doctor - and I feel as if I'm not making any progress with my mental state.  If anything, it feels as if I am inching closer and closer towards suicide.  Every day feels slightly harder than the one before.  It's a fight to just make it through existing every day.  I have a bottle of pills in my room and I am having thoughts about taking them if things don't get better soon.  It just doesn't seem worth it anymore.
