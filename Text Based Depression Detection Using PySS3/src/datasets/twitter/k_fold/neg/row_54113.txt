I know this is a stupid post, but I need someone, anyone.I don't know why, but my depression has been getting worse, I slept in until 3pm for the past 4 days, missing the time I was supposed to take my antidepressant, my abusive parents are getting worse and more cold, I had to hide in my room Saturday because my hateful aunt came to visit, I haven't had any weed to smoke in 4 months to help my PTSD, my younger brother is 800+ miles away getting back into his opioid habits and not talking to me, my parents both said they don't care what he's doing anymore so he's basically killing himself, I'm broke and stuck at home with my abusers, I can't get out of my headspace, my PTSD has been getting worse, my family has all but disowned me, my friends aren't there for me, I don't see my therapist for a while from now, my college prospects aren't working, I'm unemployed because of anxiety and being on the spectrum doesn't help, my life is falling apart and at a dead end and I have no booze to drink even if I wanted to.

Please help me.
