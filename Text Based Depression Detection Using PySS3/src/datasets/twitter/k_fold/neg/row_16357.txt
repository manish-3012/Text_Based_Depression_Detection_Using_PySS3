I don't want to want to die anymore.I've been trying so hard to reach out to my friends because I feel so close to suicide, and when they keep posting this shit about "Oh call this number, call me" bull shit, but they won't respond to me. I just don't know what to do. I'm trying so hard to hold onto the hope that this will get better, that I won't be like this forever but I'm so sad and scared that it won't get any better. I'm so close to walking infront of a subway or opening my razors and just trying to die. 

My depression has done such a good job of isolating me that the people I'd normally talk to are mad at me because i've blown up at them because of how desperate and lonely I feel. It's been a month of wanting to kill myself and trying so hard not to. I see that they're on line and i know they don't want to hear from me because of the monster I become when I'm like this. 

All of them have at somepoint come to me when they've been at their lowest and I've helped them. But I can't call them now because they're so mad at me. One even said something basically being like 'you're alone because you expect people to put up with your shit" But I don't want to die. 

But there's nothing worth living for.
