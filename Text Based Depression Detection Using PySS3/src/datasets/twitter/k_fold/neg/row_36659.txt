39M at the end of myself - am I worth anything to anyoneYes I am crying out to anyone that can hear me.  Does anyone exist out there??  I've been at the end of my rope before, but this is new.   I'm married, kids, etc...  And externally many think I have a great marriage.  But what people don't see is the nonstop fighting.  Just got through an 18hr fight.  Nothing new here.  I am nothing but a shell of a person that is dead on the inside.  I want to love and be loved, but bc I do not live up to expectation and screw up all the time.  I am nothing.   Tried to leave and my goodness I the heavens rained down upon me.  Got the kids involved, the screaming the yelling.  I almost drove my car off the road on the way to work this morning.  Canr stop thinking about it.  I hate who and what I am with such a passion it is the driving force of who I am, but if course that is weakness right? And that just makes more problems.  The fighting hurts her, hurts me, hurts the kids.  She will not control herself around them.  I can't leave.  There is only 1 option.  The best option, accidental death.  The source of ALL problems will be gone. And peace will reign.  Insurance $$ will cover for a bit, and everyone will move on with support of friends and church.  They all will be so much better off without me there.  You may say kids need their dad.  You are right.  But in this scenario, being there means contention fights and BIG problems.  Without me. Peace.  Some time to morn maybe, but life goes on and it will be peaceful without me.  That I am sure of.  Anyway if there is anyone who cares or is willing to chat. I need somethibg, no idea what, just lost myself and wandering around.  Does anyone care that 1 person takes their life, just an insignificant no one that only brings pain.  That is not ok....  Sort for the rambling, not thinking too straight.  My phone is on and curious if anyone will talk to me .  text me at. 321-248-4644
