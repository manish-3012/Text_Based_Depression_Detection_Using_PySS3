how can I stop this way of thinking?what does it mean when you think about killing yourself over the smallest stuff ? I've had depression for years now, and after my breakup I was a complete mess. but recently I don't need to feel sad or depressed or anything extreme to think about it. I'll just think of something completely stupid, like "I don't like my frizzy hair, I could go get a chemical straightening treatment. oooor I should just kill myself because this is just another shitty thing about myself I can't stand and I can just fucking be dead and happy" like, wtf? this is new to me, I've never thought so carefree about it like it's just another preferable option, every day it's something but idk how to cope with it because it stems from literal small inconveniences now.
