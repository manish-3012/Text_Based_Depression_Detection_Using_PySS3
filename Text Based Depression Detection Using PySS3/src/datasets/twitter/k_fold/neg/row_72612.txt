If no one cares about me enough to help me get help, should I not bother and just kill myself?People always say "you should get help" but not because they care about me and want me to be bette ror anything, jsut because that's what you're "supposed" to say if someone seems like they're having a bad time. If no one cares about me why would I bother getting help?
