The misery just never goes awayI've tried everything to help my chronic clinical depression. Therapy, meds, exercise, vitamins. Nothing helps. It's always the same. Life has no luster to me and I see no way of it getting any better. It's clear that the sadness will last forever. I need to die to make it go away at last.

I wish I could be convinced otherwise but I just don't see any other way out.
