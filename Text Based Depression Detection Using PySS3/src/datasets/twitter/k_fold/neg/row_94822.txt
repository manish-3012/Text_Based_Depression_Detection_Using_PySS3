Itâ€™s messed up hospitalizations are used against youIf youâ€™re 5150â€™d five times (where iâ€™m from) you are issued a conservatorship. Being 5150â€™d even once bars you from certain careers, it bars your from owning guns. 

Even voluntary hospitalizations can be used against you from getting jobs. Itâ€™s fucked up. It causes hospitalizations (which are usually awful) to be avoided. Even if someone really needs to be hospitalized or thinks they might need to to be safe, all of the above are deterrents. 

Why be punished when itâ€™s allegedly trying to help? Fuck the mental health system.
