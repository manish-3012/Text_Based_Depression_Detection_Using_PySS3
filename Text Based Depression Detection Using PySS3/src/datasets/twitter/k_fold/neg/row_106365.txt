If you can't find a reason to live for, yourself is enough.You don't have to live for anything or anyone right now.
 
Just live for yourself. 

I don't know what your situation is but I believe you can enjoy life someday.

Your life might not be filled with grandeur but believe me, it's the little things that will matter to you the most someday.
