I think I'm just too damn lazyI already gave up, but I don't even care enough anymore to pull through with that last step. And it's a good thing. And I think it means something - probably that I shouldn't be done yet. But I feel like I am. 

Looking back at the last few months... things only got worse. Looking back at the last few years.... things only got worse, with lots and lots of dissapointment. I've reached a point where there's just nothing left to do. It's not in my control. Nothing ever was. Even if I fight for something as much as you can, even if I am entitled to and earned whatever I fought for (according to other people) - something always fucks it up and there's nothing I can do.

It's really lame and sad, isn't it?
