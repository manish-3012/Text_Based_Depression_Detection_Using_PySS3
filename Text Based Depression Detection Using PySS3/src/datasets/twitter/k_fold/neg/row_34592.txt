I'm really not sure why I'm bothering with life anymore.I hate myself, I don't even exist. 
I'm just a veneer of happiness over a body of depression.
never been diagnosed, don't think I need to be. I'm doing terrible at school and cant pass an exam for shit, I never used to fail exams. My friends are peeling off, I had a huge a argument with my parents tonight about what seems like nothing. There isn't a single aspect of my life I'm enjoying right now and I just want it to end.
I can't imagine how nice it would be not having to worry about all the shit in my life.
