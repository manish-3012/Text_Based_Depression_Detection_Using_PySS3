Again. I'm tired. I just want to stop feeling anything.I've had a wonderful period of peace. Like 1-2 months. And everything went downhill again.

Why? I'm an anxious shit. I just want to cry in front of everyone right now, but all I can do is unstoppably laugh. It is fun, but I know isn't normal.

I just wanted things to work for me. I'm definitely searching some easy way to end this shitty thing. 

I'm tired. It may feel like nothing, what caused it, but I'm feeling. I am feeling and I am so fucking tired of feeling like this.
