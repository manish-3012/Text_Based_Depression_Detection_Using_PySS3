Think Iâ€™m fading awayIâ€™m ending my career, saying goodbye to all of my clients, selling and donating all of my stuff, and getting rid of social media. Iâ€™m thinking about rehoming my dog also to someone whoâ€™s not always depressed, and breaking it off with my fiancÃ©. 

I feel like Iâ€™m getting ready to either end it, or start fresh. I kind of just want to disappear and become a different person, or just not be here anymore. 

The only thing keeping me going is the new band Iâ€™ve joined, and my family.
