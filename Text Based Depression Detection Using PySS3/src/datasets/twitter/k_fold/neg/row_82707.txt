no drive, no will to keep going, what to do?I sleep all day, donÂ´t have energy for nothing, had to get a time out from college because i canÂ´t study whatsoever, even playing video games is a chore i just play 10 minutes or so and i am done, canÂ´t do anything really, always on low energy.

i am freaking out, and all of my exits are being shut, feeling suicidal because itÂ´s going to be my last resort sooner or later.

what can be done? I feel suicidal but not feeling like doing something incredibly stupid.
