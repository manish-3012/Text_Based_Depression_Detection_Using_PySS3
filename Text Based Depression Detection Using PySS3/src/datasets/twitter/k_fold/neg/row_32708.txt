Ever think just...why me?Why me? Just why? I've been bullied my whole life, in school and online, I make friends, they leave me eventually (when I did nothing wrong) or they just fucking ghost me whenever we hangout. Then when I'm sad they're suddenly my best friend. Guys have cheated on me, I've been sexually assaulted by my recent ex and they just make me feel like it's all my fault and leave me traumatized. The one guy who I finally think is the one, barely pays attention to me. Ugh just why. I'm literally just a slave to fucking work and school. I have nothing else to look forward to. My parents don't understand. They just don't get how sad and suicidal I am. They think it's "just a phase" and I'm just tired of it. Nobody in my life bothers to help me or fucking understand at least. I have to pay fucking $250 to talk to someone that cares and wants to help...what the fuck. I hope I die of COVID somehow.
