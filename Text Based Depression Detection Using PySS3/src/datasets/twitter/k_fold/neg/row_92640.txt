End of the lineMy soul is destroyed.  I hate this planet and all who inhabit it.  I'll never be able to exist in this superficial shithole where every thing is fake and everyone is just pretending.  Suicide sounds like a true vacation.  There's absolutely no reason to keep going.  I've been here a million times and all roads lead here.  I'm an alien stranded here and I'm tired of hurting and longing for whoever left me behind.  I'm only fading and things only get worse.  I really want to die right now.  I'm so unworthy of love and friendship this life is totally unbearable.  Not only do I want to be put out of my misery I want to be desecrated.  If only for a second I want people to see the true dark abyss of intimate pain I feel.  I want to be disrespected and spit on.  My only dying wish is everyone stops to piss on my grave.  This world could be beautiful but most of the time it's so fucking ugly.  I guess I'll have some coffee and get over it.  But I hope one day I muster up the confidence to kill myself in public.  I want everyone to see how much this hurts and how destroyed I truly am.  That's my only legacy.  Fuck the world and fuck you too.  Sitting in a dark room with dark thoughts about a dark World.  Happiness is a lie and no one in the world will ever truly give a shit about you unless you provide something they need.  It all sounds like self loathing but I just don't see it any other way.  This place is the opposite of kind.  The high cost of living just isn't worth it.
