I think I'm a virus and should kill myselfSo I am at work... Putting some fruit and veg out on shelves and it's a busy time of the day. Wait... It's only 10:00 on a Friday morning. 20 years ago this time of day would be dead. Now it's heaving with people everywhere. I get blocked by customers and their trolleys so I am having to wait for them to move or find another way around them to continue working.

I then think... Wow... All this food.. so much of it all over the place. Not just this store. Every store everywhere on the planet. Where the hell does all this food come from? We don't even sell it all. So much of it goes wasted anyway. How does this world we live in manage to provide that much food for every single supermarket in every single location of the whole world? How? It's so hard to believe that there somehow is enough to go around for every human alive.

Oh wait... There actually isn't. Third world countries in Africa are dying of starvation and despite this.. they keep producing babies. Despite our wealth and prosperity and charities and donations to these countries... Their people are still dying. We still see those ads on TV to give to charity to help the dying kids and so on.

I cannot see a purpose for mankind anymore. In fact I never did. All the things we do... All the things we think about... All that we have achieved is entirely down to being able to do ONE THING... which is spread.

We don't survive. We don't keep in touch with our environment. All we do is destroy and consume it. We want more... More money... More kids... More cars... More TV shows... More video games... More everything we can think of.. and when we get more... We want guess what? Yep.. even more.

It's never enough for us. All we do is want more... Spread more.... Want more... Spread more. Even space exploration and all the education we have learned from space and our universe directly translates to finding ways to spread the human race as much as possible.

Think about it... Why do we want to learn about Mars? Why do we care there is another solar system so far away that is just like our one? Spreading...That's why. That's the end goal of humanity. Spread. We are literally having sex to the point that this world is going to dictate to us how much is enough.

And when we realise we cannot spread on earth anymore... We will be finding ways to spread elsewhere. Spread spread spread. Everything humanity has ever done or strived to achieve in the past present and future all boils down to how far we can spread ourselves and how many of us can we produce.

We are fucking viruses. The most noble thing any human could ever do at this point in life is to commit suicide and rid themselves of being part of this plague.

But as viruses... Even that's difficult to achieve. We have built in defenses to stop ourselves commiting suicide. Things like religion.. fear... The unknown... Punishment... Which stop the vast majority of people killing themselves.

So thus... The virus of humanity spreads... Some of us choose to die and are able to muster through the torment and fear and actually commit the act. Most of us are weak and cannot do it despite numerous attempts.

I for one hope that one day I can be strong and do what I should do. Die.
