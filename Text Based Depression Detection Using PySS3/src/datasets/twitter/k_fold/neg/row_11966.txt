Do people with lived experience of suicide attempts make a difference for people who are suicidal?As a person with ideation and previous attempts, I know that people who could relate to my pain helped me to feel less alone and more connected.  Sometimes they came off as self serving and not really caring about anyone but themselves.  Sometimes a bit condescending as well.
What's your experience with this?  Have you ever talked to someone who was not part of the system that has lived experience?  Was it helpful?  Did it help with self-stigma? did anyone like this talk to the family to help them understand and be supportive?
