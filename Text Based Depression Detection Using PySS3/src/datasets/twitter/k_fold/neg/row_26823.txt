I want to fucking dieI have never felt so suicidal in my entire life. My girlfriend left my right before Christmas, i have no plans for 2018. Im alone, my friends don't like me. It's 3:50 am and im crying for one hour. I'm thinking about suicide right now. I'm like 30m (~98ft) above ground and I'm thinking about to jump.
