i want to kill myself to give myself a second chancehonestly i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing anymore. iâ€™m torn between wanting to die and living my life. i canâ€™t just be reborn or move somewhere, neither do i want to wait until uni. because no matter where i am the past will haunt me. i donâ€™t want to deal with the possibility of future pain. i just want to be dead. but in the case a suicide attempt fails, maybe it shows i have a reason to live.

i donâ€™t know. 

everythingâ€™s too stressful. thereâ€™s so much work and i hate ibdp and i canâ€™t even be bothered to do anything anymore cause i have no motivation. iâ€™m on 100mg of zoloft but itâ€™s not helping anymore. i just want to self harm all over. and if my parents find out i self harmed, iâ€™m not gonna have any more freedom anymore, i wonâ€™t even be able to go to uni. i just really want to be free and i want to cope with my pain in my own (destructive) way. i wish i could just be out all the time, keeping myself distracted. my anorexia is mostly gone and itâ€™s pissing me off cause iâ€™m always hungry now. 

god i just want to get myself into a psych ward. please help.
