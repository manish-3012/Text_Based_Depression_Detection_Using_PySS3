Suicide is like leaving a casino and cutting your losses.My life has been very hellish From what I've experienced it feels like it is a rigged game to juice as much pain as possible out while using the possibility of things getting better as bait to   keep you playing the game. If you know the games are rigged at a casino, is it not ok to simply walk out and cut your losses?
