Why should I live for other peopleIâ€™m sick and tired of living in going to do it because I donâ€™t want to live for others anymore. People always say how will the people you care for react? Iâ€™m sorry but I canâ€™t keep living anymore it hurts way to much than I can handle Iâ€™m not going through this anymore for others Iâ€™m tired of being considerate and Iâ€™m done with this
