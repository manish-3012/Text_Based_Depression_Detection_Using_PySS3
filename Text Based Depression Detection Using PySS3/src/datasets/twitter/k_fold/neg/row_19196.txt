By detergentI bought the supplies and mixed them in my car.  I realized that they weren't strong enough.  I read stories about suicide by detergent and I thought this could work.  Last Sunday I attempted hanging but gave up when I realized I wasn't fainting.  The Sunday before I had to calm myself down to not attempt.  After Sunday it goes to a cycle of emotions.  Dark thoughts, flashbacks, rage, melancholy, anxiety,  suicidal.  Then on Sundays I'm thinking its my last day to live.  I'm out of words to say.  I'm frightened to die but terrified to continue living.  The whole week I felt like a danger to other people.  Something deep inside me feels like its going to snap.  Every where its a issue.  At the job,  I mentally checked out. At home I avoid the person who I live with,  on my days off I go to the same park and stay there until ten.  I eat much junk food.  I was planning to die today and give my savings to my landlord so she'd have two months till to find a new roommate.  The job would had found another guard. My mom would have lost her mind. But she knows about my three other attempts last year.  I'm not looking for words of encouragement nor advice of any kind.  Right now I'm just going to look at the soul sleep doctrine and then sleep then tomorrow maybe force myself to read the bible. Goodnight.
