I just want the pain to be gone.I'm 19.  I recently got a job and enrolled again in college. I'm already turning my life back again. 

Now my gf left because of something horrible I  said. Before I met her, I'm at the verge of depression but now I've fallen off the cliff and hard. I know that she's not the only significant part of my life but because of it, I've lost focus in everything.  I've lost interest in everything. When it continues to be like this, I'll lose my job and I'll flunk college and this time, it will be final. I'll be a real piece of shit and great big disappointment to people who have big expectations  from me.

The feeling that I hate the most is regret. Now it's overwhelming me. The only thing that's keeping me from doing it is the thought of my friend seeing me dead; my parents crying and all their efforts on me wasted. I'll die a disppointment. There's still a tiny amount of  hope that she'll forgive me, but if that hope vanishes, and the pain becomes unendurable, I know I'll be able to do it.

I'm afraid of pain and the finality of death. But I'm nearing my limit. I'm a coward. I already found a way to die painlessly and when the great pain comes, I'll end it.
