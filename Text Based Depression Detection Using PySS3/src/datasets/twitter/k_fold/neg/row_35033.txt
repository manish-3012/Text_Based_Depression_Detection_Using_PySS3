Why tryI'm worthless and alone. I typed up a while other post and thought I had copied it and now it's lost. It's just another hit today. I'm gonna die alone and miserable. Why prolong it. How much longer do I have to endure? 

I try to fix my situation time and time again. It never works. It's hopeless. I'm hopeless. I'm going back to school in the fall and if I don't fail out, my savings will eventually run out and that'll be the end of that. 

I just want to sleep forever. 

Goodnight good people of Reddit. I hope your days go better than mine.
