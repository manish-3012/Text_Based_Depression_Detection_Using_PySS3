I want to end it allI got beaten up by the biggest pussy in our class non of my friends like me I was acting like I was going to obviously win. Iâ€™m a laughing stock and gonna kill myself I canâ€™t take it no more. Iâ€™m 15 with no friends and am crying while writing. Goodbye I think I have no other reason to live.  I hate myself and how week I am. I do Army cadets yet still a weak shit.
