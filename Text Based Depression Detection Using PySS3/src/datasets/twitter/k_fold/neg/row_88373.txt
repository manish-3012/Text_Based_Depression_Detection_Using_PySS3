I'm fall apart everyday.Without distractions I feel like im gonna go nuts. Today I got up at 11  and never slept because I kept thinking about problems, problems, panic attacks over the past. I got up and did my work easily finishing around 5 and just sat because I did everything but I kept feeling like I was going break down again. Before I used drink vodka to stop the thoughts but they keep coming back. I kept feeling like I wanted to grab my knife and cut my throat. I just let press there. I mentally fall apart when I don't have anything to stress about. The depression gets worst, I just want to kill myself with the little confidence I have of actually doing it. I can't think properly.
