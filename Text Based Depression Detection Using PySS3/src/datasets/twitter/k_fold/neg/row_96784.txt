Hey SW...Just want y'all to know I made it through another night. I have the mother of all hangovers and my hands and body won't stop shaking/trembling, but I am here. I am doing OK, I suppose. Still feeling like I want to die, but not going to put a noose around my neck or anything like that.

I want to offer a {{{HUG}}} to everyone here. I know how you guys are feeling...I really do.

Love y'all and stay safe today!!!
