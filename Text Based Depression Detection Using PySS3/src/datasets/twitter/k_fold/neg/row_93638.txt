Goodbye16 years of pain and suffering gone down the toilet. No one will miss me except for my best friend and my parents. If there is one thing I have learned in my brief yet miserable existance is that I accomplished nothing in the course of my time being alive. I will never have the legacy of Shi Huangdi or Obama or Albert Einstein, but who's really counting anyways. Goodbye world. Tonight I end it all.
