I hate livingIâ€™m 20 y/o male. 
Used to have lots of friends and potential.
Graduated honour roll and prom king in a class of 350.
I now havenâ€™t been able to do anything full time since senior year of high school.
Suicidal more or less everyday for 3 years. 
When I first developed mental health issues I was told countless times that it hasnâ€™t been like this forever and Iâ€™m bound to go back to normal. 
I have a family that loves me too much so Iâ€™m aware that if I kill myself Iâ€™ll pass on unbearable pain to innocent sweet people. 
I havenâ€™t touched a female in over a year 
Nothing brings me joy 
Iâ€™m a failure 
I just want it all to end 
I have constant overwhelming anxiety and depression 
Iâ€™ve been to 3 different in-patient programs 
Iâ€™ve tried 10 ish different medications 
Iâ€™ve been to 4 diiferent therapists, my latest one being the best of the best, still no improvement. 
My future looks like living with my parents as a leach and playing video games and being a loner loser 
The thought of socializing makes me wanna puke
I will never have meaning or purpose in my life.
I just want to die 
I pray to god every night out loud for him to take me out of this world even though Iâ€™m atheist. Iâ€™m desperate 
I want the pain to end. 
I want the thoughts to stop.
I want no emotions. 
Iâ€™m selfish 
Iâ€™m weird 
Iâ€™m distant 
How could I ever be self sufficient when Iâ€™ve been constantly struggling while doing nothing 
Iâ€™ll never be stable 
Iâ€™ll never be loved by somebody who doesnâ€™t share my DNA
I want to disappear 
I want it all to end :(
