My past mistakes and present flaws will most likely prevent me from achieving my goals. I do not wish to continue if I cannot reach those goals.TLDR: I fucked up my prospects in the one profession I could be successful at. I don't have any other realistic prospects to meet my goals.

So my past mistakes, namely my grades in a competitive first year of my course of study (And no, they can't be retaken), have permanently dimmed my future career prospects, and the only jobs I can hope for are ones that don't lead to where my goal is. 

On top of it, I feel other flaws of mine (I am terrible at math, for instance), make it impossible for me to succeed in any other high powered profession besides the one I am studying for now, which thankfully doesn't require a lot of math. Medicine, business, engineering, and many other careers that would otherwise interest me are simply out of reach.

My career counselor laid out what jobs are reasonably available to me with my grades, and none of them are paths to either the salary or respectability I want, so it's pretty much a dead end. 

I've decided that I am going to have the integrity to end it now, rather than settling in for a mediocre life at best because of fear of death.
