I don't want to die all alone.Hello. My name's Ursula, I'm 18 y.o. and I'm about to take 1200mg of tramadol, half a bottle of whiskey, and a number of different painkillers (something about 8-10 pills).    
It doesn't matter how hard I try to stay on track - I always end up in a situation like this.    
I don't have a family anymore, if that's important. I don't have a job, and soon I'll not have a place to live.    
There's a reasonable chance, that I will not die or will not die *peacefully*. That's okay. Even if I end up in hospital - I deserve it.    
Do you want to ask something before I start?    
EDIT: Pills are bitter. I'm surprised, that I'm surprised about that.    
EDIT2: My vision is very blurry now and my fingers aren't that fast anymore. Sorry, if answer takes too long to type.    
EDIT3: Thank you, everyone. I love as much as suicidal girl can love people, who try to help her. I'll try one more time. And, maybe, I'll get my job in IT.
