What is the point?Working for corporations/people who make more money in a day than you will in a year, being able to only afford things that you don't enjoy yet on TV and social media everyone has whatever they want. Not looking super attractive so you always feel depressed. Everyone tells you that its a part of life, but seriously, just paying bills and getting no return is really fucking old and honestly if I lived in the U.S I probably would have bought a gun and killed myself already, but where I live its harder to get one. I don't care about anyone really, even my parents and I just want it to be over, no more pressure to do things I don't want to do, the force that keeps me going is getting smaller every day. Someday I think I'll just go to the us, buy a gun and end it all. Fuck this sadistic life where nothing was like it seemed when we were kids.
