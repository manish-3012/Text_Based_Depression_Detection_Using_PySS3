(20F) My debt makes me want to dieI really want to die because of the insane amount of debt Iâ€™m currently in and will be in in the near future. Not only that makes me want to kill myself, I also have nobody in my life who loves or cares about me. My â€œfamilyâ€ is full of physically, verbally, emotionally, sexually abusive pieces of shit. I have no true friends. Iâ€™m currently in an on-off romantic relationship with someone who doesnâ€™t truly love or care about me, but at least itâ€™s better than having no one, right?

I donâ€™t think anyone better will want to date me anyways when they find out I will have over $100k in debt just for undergrad. No, I didnâ€™t go to a private or fancy school. I went to a public university in my state and just fucked up. All for a stupid and useless degree that wonâ€™t even guarantee me good jobs because now you need a masters degree for successful jobs, and I canâ€™t handle any more school. Getting bachelorâ€™s degree makes me want to kill myself. I already got my associateâ€™s degree before going to a public university, so no, I canâ€™t go to a community college and take classes for cheaper. I just have to take the rest of the requirements for my degree.

Iâ€™ve fucked up a lot in school because of poor mental health. And today I just got an email saying that I wonâ€™t be eligible for federal financial aid anymore because of my GPA. So now I have to apply for private loans and will be getting into even MORE debt. 

Oh, and I also have credit card debt. And canâ€™t even keep a job because I get stressed with school and working at the same time. And I canâ€™t take time off of school to just work, not at least for next school year. I canâ€™t get out of my lease for my apartment for next school year so I might as well take classes if Iâ€™m living at the school, right?

I already know I fucked up by taking out student loans. My estranged dad who is an abusive POS (but has money) told me my whole life he would pay for my college. Thatâ€™s the only nice thing heâ€™s ever said to me. I thought he was going to pay me back for all the abuse he put me through. Then when I got accepted to college and was ready to go a month before, he says he wonâ€™t pay my tuition anymore because he thought I told family members he abused me, I denied it, and said he didnâ€™t believe me. I literally never told anyone he abused me because I was afraid of him and wanted him to pay for my college like he said. He was just trying to get me tell him if I did tell anyone or not, because he cares about his appearances and didnâ€™t want anyone to find out about what an abusive POS he is. And my mom has enabled it and never spoken up about it and let me become a victim since I was born because she was afraid of him too. The great kicker of this too is that now my dad is fully paying for my younger brotherâ€™s college tuition and he goes to the same college I do. 

I just wanted to get out of my abusive momâ€™s house as soon as I turned 18 so I took out loans stupidly and went to college. I changed my major lots of times, took a year off, did poorly when I went back and fucked up in college. I just seriously want to die. I donâ€™t want to live in poverty and be a slave and work forever just to pay back all of this money for a stupid mistake I made when I was young. I donâ€™t even want to finish school. I have no support system or people to help me financially or emotionally. 

Iâ€™ve been researching a lot more lately about a relatively easy, not too painful, quick way to kill myself. I just want life to be over. I seriously donâ€™t see ANY reason to stay alive. I truly have nobody to stay alive for or who would truly care if I died tomorrow, except for maybe my old dog who will probably die herself within a couple years. 

I really canâ€™t go on anymore. I donâ€™t want to stick around to see if anyone will love me. I doubt it will happen. Iâ€™m almost 21 years old and still nobody has ever truly loved me in my life. Why would I stick around and wait to see if anyone does while I work tirelessly the rest of my life and stress about debt? My life is so worthless and pointless. 

I feel happy thinking about me being gone and not dealing with the bullshit of life. But Iâ€™m also kinda nervous about killing myself because I donâ€™t want to survive. If I do it, I want to do it once and do it right. I donâ€™t want to live or be saved. I donâ€™t want to have to pay back the ridiculous hospital bill. And even if I did get help, what would change? Nothing. My life will always be shitty, because it always has been. And itâ€™s just going downhill.
