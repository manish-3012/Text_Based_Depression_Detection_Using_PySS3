I can'tI can't muster the energy to write out my problems, but I want to be comforted. Pathetic, I know. 
I can't muster the energy to talk to people like you're supposed to when you're suicidal. The thought of the effort required to fill someone in pains me.
I can't muster the energy to get better, and I don't even remember a better time.
I can't muster the energy to kill myself, or I'd have done it by now. I don't want failed attempts, I want successes.
I can't muster the energy to care that things are collapsing around me.
I can't muster the energy to do much of ANYTHING.
