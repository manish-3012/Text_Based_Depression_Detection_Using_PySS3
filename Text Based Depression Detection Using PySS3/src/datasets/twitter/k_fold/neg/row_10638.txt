Conflicting thoughts, scattered mindSuicideWatch,

I need help.  Honestly, just posting this, whatever I have to say, will most likely help me quite a bit on its own, but I'm pretty sure in the process I'll come up with some questions or something that maybe you guys can answer to help me further.... (btw, I'll trow them at the bottom so you can just skip to them if you want because I don't want to force you to read my long winded rambling as I get my thoughts together if you just want to answer my question things)

Anyway, I'm not posting this from some throwaway account because I'm honestly tired of giving a crap what people think of me.  I've lived most of my life afraid of what people will think about the way I dress, the way I act, the way I talk (I have a speech impediment my whole life).  Honestly, I'm bloody tired of hiding the real me behind so many walls.  Back to what I wanted to say in this paragraph (was supposed to be about 2 sentences), this is not a throwaway, but I did actually just post on here a few days ago after me and my girlfriend had a rather large fight and I got drunk.  (For those couple people that are most likely wondering but don't really actually care, I have talked stuff through with her and we have again become as happy of a couple as college life and 2 cases of severe depression will allow.)  I think that's all the random side rambling for now, so on to the meat and potatoes of the post....

**The part that makes this relevant to this subreddit.**  Right now, as the title says, I have rather conflicting feelings.  On one hand, I just want to tie a rope around my neck and die, but on the other hand, I really don't.  I haven't told anyone this, not even my girlfriend, but for about the past month, I've spent at least a bit of time most days fighting my body to not strangle myself or swallow a bunch of pills.  

What I can't figure out is, why I have these feelings.  I've had a rather bad depression for 8-9 years (for part of that time I was in treatment because of past suicide attempts), but in all that time, my life has never been good as it is now.  Sure, my life isn't perfect, but it's become a lot better than it has been in the past.  This leaves me wondering, why have these feeling now, have I just finally started to snap under the years of depressive stress?

Honestly, my brain has shut down for the moment, but I would like to leave you guys with some questions to maybe help me sort stuff out and get on my way to getting these harmful thoughts out of my head.
-(see end of 4th paragraph in post)
-Is there somewhere online where I can search for mental health people? (I am in the central NJ (Trenton-ish) region if that helps)
-To anyone who read my post and has managed (at least in the smallest bit) to overcome depression, what did you do to help yourself and where did you get the inspiration?

Maybe more to come later.
