Contagious suicide?Two weeks ago my little cousin brought a gun to school and shot and killed herself in her high school auditorium. She had a history of self harm and her boyfriend recently dumped her and I guess that set her over the edge. This happened in Florida and recently it was surfaced that two Parkland survivors have killed themselves recently. 


Iâ€™ve always had the thought of suicide in the back of my head but have always been to prideful to ever get help. Iâ€™m afraid of getting locked away in a psych asylum or being tranquilized with mood elevators. 


My life sucks but so does everyoneâ€™s. Each day Iâ€™m understanding more and more how the real world works. That you can get away with literally anything if you have enough money. Innocent people are suffering at the hands of the wealthy every single day and nothing is being done about it. I doubt society will ever see a change in my lifetime so Iâ€™m slowly giving up. Whatâ€™s the point of suffering through this if itâ€™s not gonna get any better? 


I envy my late cousin and the Parkland survivors.
