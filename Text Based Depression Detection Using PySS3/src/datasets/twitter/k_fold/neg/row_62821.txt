Help...I don't know why I am posting here.  I don't really think it would help but i really want someone to talk to.  My sister is asleep..I texted everyone I know..no one is responding. Not like they would be able to help much if they did..I just hate this crushing feeling of wanting to die.  I don't know what to do.  It's like every time my life starts looking better, it ALWAYS has to take a turn for shit (usually my fault) and I can't deal with it anymore. I don't see the point in living like this.  I don't like this feeling.  I feel like all I want right now is a gun to end all of this.  I have friends who care about me, and I know this..but I still feel so hollow.  I was doing so well, too.  I don't deserve happiness

sorry for the rant. i am not really thinking too well.  i doubt this will get me any help, though.
