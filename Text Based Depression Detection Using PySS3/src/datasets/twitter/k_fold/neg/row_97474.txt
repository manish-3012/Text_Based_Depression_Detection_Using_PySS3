My catI guess this might be a unique situation I'm not really sure but my cat it's looking like he may have an incurable heart disease and he'll only have at most if I'm lucky 150 days to live. 

I've always been depressed and I suppose I have considered suicide before but I've always found a reason to look forward to living but if my cat dies I think it'll really break me and I won't be able to stop myself. I'm not sure what I can do to lessen the pain or deal with inevitable but I've been crying every day because I know it's gonna happen. I really wouldn't mind if he died 10 years from now or whatever I'd say at least then he's lived a full life but he's like my son in a weird way and I care about him more than anything. 

I know I probably screwed up a lot of sentence structure and other things while typing this up but I guess I have other things on my mind. Idk if I should consider getting medicated to lessen the pain or taking something to fix this or what but I really do think I might not be able to stop myself from doing something I would regret and the people who love me would regret but it's just an awfully strong feeling.
