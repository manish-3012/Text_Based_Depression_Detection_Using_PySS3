the smell of tears.a couple months ago i posted a song lyric on this subreddit of lana del rey. i listened to her music when I was sad or depressed, but also when I was happy. in fact, i listen to a lot of sad music when i'm "happy". happy isn't me. i'm never truly happy. i was too used to the feeling of being sad. depressed and suicidal. after that post, someone messaged me, "Hi Was ist nicht ok? Hast du Liebeskummer?" and i didn't see it until earlier this week. it completely broke me. initially, being an ignorant rat, i didn't know what it was saying, but google translate shattered the world that I thought was okay. the smell of tears is all too familiar. you can message me if you want, but i can't promise i'll be here. i'm probably dead tbh. i'm so heart broken. i'm terrible too. i have so much xanax from my anxiety issues it's truly incredible. i never took it. maybe I will tonight. i don't know what to say.
