Feeling hopeless and uselessLately I have been putting a lot of thought into my life. Entertaining that thought has lead to a rather hopeless disposition type mentality. I am 25 and has been unable to find steady employment for a little over 2 years now. I have limited insurances and haven't been able to see my previous therapist because of a change in insurance.I am attempting to reach a new psychiatrist, however,he failed to remain in contact. I am skeptical of even seeing him because I will only have insurance until my birthday in a 6 months. I will then be off my parents plan. 
 I have been stuck in the mentality that if I am unable to get past my crippling depression and able to further my life as I should. I have given myself a dead line. After that I feel like I shouldn't bother any more. I have been putting a lot of thought into where and how unfortunately I will go about doing it. I wouldn't normally post this detailed of my personal thoughts and struggles under a pseudonym on reddit. However I lack emotional support from my family, friends and even significant other. I'm beginning to feel like I would be less of a burden not exist over continuously being dependent on family and significant other. I'm to a point where I am rationalizing it nearly on a daily bases and i'm not sure what to do anymore.
