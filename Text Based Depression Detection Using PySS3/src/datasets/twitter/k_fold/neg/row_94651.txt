The urge to go down stairs and slit my wrists is almost unbearable. I don't want this.I can't stand living anymore. I feel like the only reason I'm alive is to make my parents proud, and I can't even do that. The only time I ever feel happy is the brief periods of time I'm with my girlfriend, or when I'm on so many drugs I can't even walk. The urge to just finally put an end to all of my pain is so tempting. I don't understand it. I have life good, I love everything in it, but I can't accept happiness. I fucking envy my friends with actual reasons to feel their depression, but I have life so well off. Everyone tells me to "find what makes me happy" but it's always what makes them unhappy. My parents want me to find what makes me happy, you know what that is? sitting around and drugging myself up so I can feel good. Nothing else seems to work. Fuck life, fuck everything, nothing matters. My family is lucky I love them or I'd already be gone.
