The Only Choice (Vent)(19F) In recent weeks, I have experienced the unrelenting desire to disappear. Although I have felt this in the past, the intensity of these feelings has changed drastically. The thought of fleeing my current circumstance has always been with me. It provided comfort in my darkest moments, whilst gifting me with the will to continue. However, my solace is no longer contingent on a mere change in circumstance - I feel I have no other option but to change my entire identity. 

After exhausting various talking therapies, Iâ€™ve come to realise that with every word I say and every experience I divulge, I am attending to a version of myself I can no longer reconcile with; not out of disillusion, but disgust. I possess ambitions of being independent, creative and successful - but none of that seems to be synonymous with being mentally ill. At times, it almost feels like Iâ€™m a mosaic of maladaption. On the surface I may look pleasing, but upon closer inspection youâ€™ll see that Iâ€™m fragmented and unable to be pieced back together. I therefore want to abandon such irreparable building blocks and forge a new identity - one where I am whole and ultimately, happy.  

(Note: I am not saying that individuals with mental illness are incapable of success - Iâ€™m speaking purely on a personal level. Perhaps some of you may be able to relate to this, but I can assure you all that youâ€™re capable of so much more than you realise. Your strength is often admirable, something which I could only hope to emulate).
