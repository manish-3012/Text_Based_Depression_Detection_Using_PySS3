It comes in waves...Some days I feel great and really look forward to whatâ€™s next for me. And then most days I feel like I get hit by a wave or something of just pure depression and suicidal thoughts. It started around 5 years ago and I havenâ€™t gone a day where I didnâ€™t think about killing myself. I usually deal with it but some days I just think â€œfuck it just do it. What do you have to lose?â€ Since I had the suicidal thoughts come I also have something that prevents me from doing it: death anxiety. I donâ€™t know what happens when we die and it freaks me out. Why do we have such a limited time on here? Whatâ€™s next? I would say Iâ€™m spiritual but what really happens? Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m getting off topic. I tried drowning myself twice and I just couldnâ€™t do it. I drive along a cliff and consider just yanking the wheel and taking myself down. But then those thoughts come: whatâ€™s gonna happen when you die Andy? And then I curl up into a ball and let the thoughts take over my brain. I hate that I have these thoughts that prevent me to kill myself. Some days I call it a blessing and some days itâ€™s a curse. Maybe itâ€™s the only primal thing thatâ€™s keeping me alive. Maybe my brain just sends these thoughts to make sure I donâ€™t kill myself. I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t take about with anyone. I just want to know if someone is out there who has these same thoughts and how you deal with it? I usually work out or play video games or read or watch a movie. But they only keep my mind off it for some time. I googled anything about people dealing with death anxiety and they werenâ€™t as helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I really appreciate it.
