BrokenIâ€™m tired of feeling worthless. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like a terrible mom and wife. My mom makes it clear Iâ€™m a terrible daughter. I honestly donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ve actually allowed myself to live this long. 
My mom has always told me how I feel is weakness. That only weak people want to kill themselves. That only weak people suffer from depression and anxiety instead of sucking it up and moving on. 

Sometimes Iâ€™m mad at teenager me for thinking anything would get better and not going through with suicide. 
Iâ€™m so sick of being broken. 
What am I bringing to this world?! Nothing.
