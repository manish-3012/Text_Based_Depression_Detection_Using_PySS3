I wonder if there's another wayBeing in a state of wanting to kill myself is pretty much normal for me now. It doesn't bother me but other people just think I'm crazy. I could explain why but I don't feel I should have to justify myself anymore. What do I have to live for? Everything just seems absurd to me. It appears that I'm the only one that realizes the absurdity and everyone else is delusional. I really hate this subreddit's guidelines too "this is a place of support" Fuck that. How can words on a computer screen help someone? If they are posting on an internet forum, it's already done. Pro-suicide and discussion of suicide methods are what the people on here need.
