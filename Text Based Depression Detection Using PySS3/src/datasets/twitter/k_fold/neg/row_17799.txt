I'm 16 but I feel I've already ruined everything in my life.I was groomed online at a young age, but never told anyone.=It still feels like my fault because I knew it was happening but I didn't stop it. This might be one of the reasons my depression started. I'm fat, ugly, worthless, talentless, lazy, stupid, and the list goes on. I've been on meds, been to hospitals, been to therapy and nothing eases the pain. Years dedicated to getting better to only find myself sinking deeper and deeper. My parents know but don't care. They tell me to shut up so they don't have to deal with it. My therapist tells me to inform my mom when I'm suicidal but when I do she tells me to "Stop this shit" or "I'm not doing this today". It hurts because no one cares. She'll even guilt me by saying "Why do you hate me?" as a response to my suicidal thoughts. I want to talk to someone I know, but I have no one. I lost all of my friends due to multiple breakdowns I've had. I got to the point where I was on suicide watch at school. I eventually became homeschooled with an online program. While that has helped some, it has made me extremely stressed because I am managing everything on my own with no help. I feel I lost any chance at a successful future because I decided to prioritize mental health over public school. I feel I'll have no chance at college because I'm poor, plus I have zero interests. I don't know how I'll take the ACT and SAT. I'm just so fucking lost and it's making me so suicidal.
