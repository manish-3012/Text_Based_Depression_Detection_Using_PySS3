am I depressed?ok so this is dumb. using the internet to "solve" my problems.

im 14, and gay. my parents are against it. I cut myself but not daily, and mainly to relieve stress and anger. 

im usually tired, and wake up tired. im either hungry or not hungry ever. if im not with friends for too long I  get depressed and my motivation and just everything goes downhill. I get suicidal thoughts pretty much daily. 

I would tell my parents this, but I think they are convinced that im doing it for attention. my self esteem is scary low.

I don't know what to do.
