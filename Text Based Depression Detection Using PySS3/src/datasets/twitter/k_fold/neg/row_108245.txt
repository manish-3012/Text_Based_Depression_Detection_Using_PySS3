I'm happy, but in constant pain. I don't know if I'm strong enough anymore.For context, I'm 18, and I've been sick at least 90% of my life. I'm always in excruciating pain, my kidneys ache as I type this. 

Per week, I have at least 2-3 doctors appointment, and I've had around 14 surgeries. I just graduated high school and, even though I'm in pain, I'm being forced to work at a diner as a chef and cashier, but since I'm the strongest I have to lift everything too, and it hurts so bad when I get home, but I have to work because my mom is poor. I'm also being forced to go to college because my brother dropped out and I can't be another disappointing child, even though he just lays in bed all day and works for a pizza shop that requires him to do almost nothing. I have various mental disorders too and I'm medically insane, and have very severe depression and terrible anxiety but I can't go to therapy cause I have neither the time or money for it. 
I have a lovely girlfriend whom I've been dating for 2 years, and she's so nice to me, and I feel happy enough, just it's hard to go on with all this stress, and working is literally killing me, but do I really want to quit everything and just be a hemorrhage on my family and girlfriend, what can I even do? I need some advice. 

I don't know why I typed all this maybe, I just wanted to vent, I know that none of this will mean or do anything.. sorry if it was a boring story, just a sickly little person, with so much to live for, but no energy left.
