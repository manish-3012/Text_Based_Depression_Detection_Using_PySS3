I don't know if I'll be able to keep living for a few months from here.I'm always exhausted, in inercy or empty. I can't focus, studying, God, I can't even read books anymore. I really need to go back to live like a regular human being again. However, I can't. I can't even take my meds anymore.

Friends or other kinds of relationships don't matter to me anymore. Nothing is worth of keeping suffering. I'm done.
