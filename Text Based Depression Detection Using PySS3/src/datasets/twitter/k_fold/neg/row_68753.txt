If I wasn't worthless, she wouldn't have left for someone betterI'm a piece of shit. I don't even have a social life anymore. If I died, I'd be lucky if anyone noticed. What's the point of living if you have nothing to live for. Sure, I have myself, but I hate him. It's almost been 6 months, but I think of her every day. She loved me, but then she left when she found a better deal. Guess I can't blame her for not wanting a sack of shit like me.
