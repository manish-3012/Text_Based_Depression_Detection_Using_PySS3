My father can't pay for university and I don't qualify for financial aid. If I can't pay for college, then I have to go live with my father again... I would rather die.Title says everything pretty much. My father said he'd pay for my schooling and he isn't following up on it. He paid a couple thousand dollars of my tuition and now he says he doesn't have enough money to pay the whole thing, even though he owns a nice house and literally 10 cars. I guess he just doesn't care about my education. Cool.

My mom isn't an option because she's fucking crazy and estranged my father and I. Dad reached out to her but she didn't respond. I'm scared to reach out to her for help because I have no idea what to say. She's traumatized me.

My father also won't give me any of his information for financial aid, and I got rejected for financial independence. So my only option to pay for this quarter is to take out an alternative loan. I won't be able to pay that back for a while so it'll probably drive my credit into the ground. And I can't just borrow for every quarter, so I'll have to drop out after this one.

I live on campus too, and I've made so many friends since I got here. But I won't see them again if I leave, because I'll have to go move back in with my father, who lives across the country. I picked this school to get away from him, and I'm getting sent right back. I really thought I could make it here. I was so happy, I thought I was free and independent and could start something new. I started enjoying life again.

How wrong was I? I'm sitting in the waiting room at my uni's counseling center and they can't get me in for a crisis appointment. I'm taking this as a sign. I'm going to do it tonight.

TL;DR: Dad can't pay for college, Mom isn't an option and I can't get financial aid. I'm already at college living on campus and if I get kicked out I have to move back in with my toxic father. I'm going to kill myself tonight
