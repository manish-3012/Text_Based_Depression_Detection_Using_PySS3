Iâ€™m spirallingBefore when I spiralled my mind used to go straight to suicide. I couldnâ€™t tolerate the pain, the pain of living, breathing, and being hurt everytime I let a little light into my heart. I havenâ€™t been doing so well today; and like clockwork my mind sent me down the dark path to self harm and suicide. I so want to not feel anything anymore but I am not going to give in. Itâ€™s so tempting to fall into the void, but Iâ€™m not ready for such a permanent decision. So Iâ€™m not going to cut today. And Iâ€™m not going to die today. Iâ€™m hurting, but maybe it will get better someday. I donâ€™t know if I can post this here but I just wanted someone to know that I might be spiralling but I know Iâ€™m in control of at least my actions and Iâ€™m not going to die tonight.
