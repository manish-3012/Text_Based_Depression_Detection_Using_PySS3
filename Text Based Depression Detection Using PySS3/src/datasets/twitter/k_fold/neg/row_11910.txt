I'm scared because of the painHi , i'm 25 years old , and i belive weed and my ex gf cheating on me has fucked me up pretty bad , i've been under so much strees , and smoked so much weed i've fucked up my mind i could say . So last year, or two years ago i started having suicidal thoughts , and i stareted to think what would people say at my funeral , and how it would be with me dead . Sometimes i have psychosis episoded where i belive i'm dead and this is just a transit period , so my doctor prescrived OLANZAPINE TEVA 5MG a day , and that sucks , i want to do more with my life i told him , ive asked for antidepressants and got this shite in exchange , andi wont see him for another month , fucking idiot. 
Anyway , a few weeks ago , i said it's enougf , and i went on top of a building and decided it's going to be over now , but i stopped , first because i have an irrational fear of hights and second , i thought it's not going to be high enough to assure my death instead of being paralized in absurd pain , you know what i'm saying ? i don't know , i'm being strong here , and i send love and light to anyone who needs it , i'm trying to be strong so i can come out victorious with this crazy life at my back ,i'm being strong so that one day , i may laugh back and smile at these days , i'm being strong for all of US.
