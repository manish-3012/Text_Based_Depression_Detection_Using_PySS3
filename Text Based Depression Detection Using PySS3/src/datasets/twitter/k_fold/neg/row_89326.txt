On the spot suicidal thoughtsWhile on a hike in the mountains to lessen the severity of my depression I encountered a cliff, hemlock, and several instances where I could have acted on the suicidal thoughts and killed my self like Iâ€™ve been wanting for years, and looking back I am mixed on not doing it. I was wondering if you ever had a time where you had that invasive thought telling you to kill yourself. (Also, hiking and backpacking in the wilderness are GREAT ways to lessen your depression, trust me)
