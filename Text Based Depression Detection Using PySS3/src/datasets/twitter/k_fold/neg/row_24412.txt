My "mother" publicly humiliated me and it is the last straw. I'm sick and tired.My mother loves to beat me up and scream at me for small things (eg asking her "hey what're you doing?" out of curiosity would spark off a "IM NOT DOING NOTHING YOU DISGUSTING BITCH DONT YOU DARE INSINUATE IM BEING LAZY COS IM DOING STUFF JUST NOT RIGHT NOW STOP SCREAMING AT ME YOU FUCKING IDIOT" etc, and would escalate one-sidedly on her part and result in her throwing whatever was near her at me. Once she threw an IKEA stool at my face and missed by inches. 

Just now we were at the mall and apparently something I said must have triggered her because she started SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS at me in front of the crowded mall full of people AND EVERYONE STARED AT US AND WHISPERED AMONG THEMSELVES AND I ASKED MY MOTHER TO STOP SCREAMING AT ME BECAUSE ITS A PUBLIC PLACE AND SHE JUST KEPT SCREAMING AND SHOUTING AND THEN SHE SLAPPED ME. 

This is the last straw. 

She has been abusing me physically and verbally for the most part of my life and now the entire small town has witnessed her scream at me and hit me. 

I am sick of my life. Sick. I can't get out. I dont have any relatives or close friends and my dad refuses to interfere. I am stuck. I cant go anywhere because I'm technically still a child. I'm sick of this. Sick. Sick. SICK. 

I DIDNT ASK TO BE BORN INTO THIS WORLD SO STOP PUNISHING ME FOR SOMETHING I HAD NO CHOICE OVER. HUMILIATING ME IN PUBLIC WITHOUT GIVING A HEED TO MY FEELINGS WAS THE LAST STRAW. IM SICK OF MY LIFE AND HAVE NO MORE REASON TO STAY WHEREAS WHEN IM DEAD I CAN BE FREE. 

For now I have to think of the method and pretend everything is fine but I will do it either tonight or tomorrow morning. I have decided and am certain this is the best plan.
