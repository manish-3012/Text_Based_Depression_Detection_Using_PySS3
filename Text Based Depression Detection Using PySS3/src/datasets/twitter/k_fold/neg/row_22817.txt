InactionNot sure if it count's as being explicit about methods, but the mods will figure out, I guess.

Something that was becoming more and more appealing to me as of late. If I'm so mentally fucked I can't do anything productive to sustain life, then I don't really need to kill myself - biological and economical principles will do it for me. No mess, and rarely do people shame or mourn those who die of poverty - those just wither away both from reality and from memory. The problem is, though, I don't have *any* money... I didn't ever have any money that were mine, as I've always been supported by my mother. And here is the thing: I'd rather die of starvation in the comfort of my home now than on the streets some uncertain amount of time later (when my mom won't be able to support me anymore). But if I just tell my mother straight away that I'm not going to eat today, she won't understand. After enough skipped meals she will probably send me to a psych ward. Yet I can't afford a place to stay alone for any lenght of time really. What do, what do.
