What should I do for my friend in California that wants to kill himself?I have tried everything I know but it just is not enough. He keeps on saying he isn't worth it and how he may just "disappear" one day. He also says that he will be homeless at some point. He said that no one loves him, not even his family just because he is disgusting. I want to help him but I don't know how to.
