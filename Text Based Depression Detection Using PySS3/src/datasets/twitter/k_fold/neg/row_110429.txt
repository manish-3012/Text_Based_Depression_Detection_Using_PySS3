â€œYouâ€™re so strong for having gone through all of thisâ€Thank you but I would like to tell you I DONT WANT TO BE STRONG! I want nothing more than to give up. I hate thinking everyday about slicing my neck open and how I can only get 3 hours of sleep because ever time I close my eyes I have to fight the urge to grab a bottle of pills . So thanks for the compliment but I donâ€™t want to be strong anymore. Iâ€™d rather give up and cut my head off.
