My birthdayI think Iâ€™m gonna go on my birthday. It seems convenient although it isnâ€™t until fall and I donâ€™t know if I can wait that long. The only thing I have to look forward to is a trip to a place I love in July but it honestly is not nearly as appealing as it used to be. I used to be happy there but now my depression/anxiety/trauma and suicidal thoughts follow me. Thereâ€™s only one way left I can finally escape from myself. 

Iâ€™ve fucked up too much and thereâ€™s no going back. Iâ€™m a horrible toxic person and the world will be better off without me. I am way more excited for my birthday (exit) than anything. I have a solid plan and a note already written. Sorry if this isnâ€™t the place for this but I have nowhere else to speak my mind.
