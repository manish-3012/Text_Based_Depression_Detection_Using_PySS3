I hate being scaredIf I wasn't so afraid of the thought of nothing after death then I'd do it. Maybe I'm just not at that point yet. Maybe if I hurt more I'll finally have the guts to do it. I can't do life. Drop out of college, it's fine, they say. Yeah, get reminded by the hundreds of thousands of dollars I wasted every day of my fucking life. You failed. You can't do it. Why can't I just get a fucking suicide bag and do it and then not have to worry about it anymore? I fucking hate myself and wish I wasn't such a fucking coward. STOP STALLING AND GET IT OVER WITH
