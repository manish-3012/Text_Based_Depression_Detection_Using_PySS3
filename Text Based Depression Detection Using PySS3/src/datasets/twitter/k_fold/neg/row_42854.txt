im so sorryfirst post kinda weird but uhhhh anyway
in the beginning, reading everyoneâ€™s posts were so comforting to me which seems sick in a way but after a while i just feel so much pain for them and i just want all of their pain to go away. it obviously is so much easier said than done but i truly hope it does go away (and i say this even though iâ€™m a dumbass pessimist who doesnâ€™t believe that it will go away)
iâ€™m contradicting myself but i hate how much people are suffering and i canâ€™t do shit except cry for them and honestly this is making me seem like a pussy ass bitch LMFAO um iâ€™m just writing whatever the fuck is going thru my mind rn
iâ€™m literally suicidal myself and believe firmly that nobody would miss me but seeing other people say that others wouldnâ€™t miss them makes me so sad because even if i donâ€™t know them i would miss them 

this is kind of a mess to read my mindâ€™s kinda all scrambled and shit sorry lol
