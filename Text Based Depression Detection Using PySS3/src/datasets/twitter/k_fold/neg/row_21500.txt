I quit, I really can't see how I'm supposed to stay hereI just wanna die, I have honestly wanted this for almost 2 and a half years now. I mean every day a voice that screams at you every time the wind blows to kill yourself, your worthless, your parents are worthless and no one cares. All I want to do is love, but every time I try it blows right back in my face in the worse way possible, this world needs more love in it for sure but I'm not strong enough to be passing out love when no one is sending it my way. 

I spent at least 5 hours out of today attempting to hang myself but as my dad always said, "you half ass everything you do" so I guess that hasn't changed. This year has been the worst by far of my life. Idk why I even typed this, but I had to say it. Because for at least 2 minutes my phone listens to me, when nobody else does.
