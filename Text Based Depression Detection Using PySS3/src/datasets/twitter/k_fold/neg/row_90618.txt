TerrifiedSo, um, I'm at breaking point. Nothing is cheering me up and although I feel as if im screaming for help... its not working, and no one can hear me. 
The person I thought loved me left because he didn't care. 
My therapist only has visits available for every other week for about a month, then I see her every week
My case worker practically gave up on my case and is no longer helping me find residential treatment that I need
im ready to give up.
