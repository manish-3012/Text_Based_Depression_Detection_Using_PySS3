I don't know who to turn to.This may be long and I'm on mobile, sorry ahead of time.

I've been depressed off and on for more than half my life. My depression gets severe enough that I contemplate ending my life. Lately it has been all i can do to keep that demon at bay.

My best friend is in the hospital right now, and I don't know which one. She took too many sleeping pills but she called the hotline. I wanted to help her but sometimes it's not enough. 

I live with my SO and he has trust issues. Recently he caught me in the only lie I've ever told him, which had been small to me and it was a knee jerk reaction due to being damaged by an ex. I had forgotten about it. And I feel awful and I thought we had cleared the air. But since we've been dating he has always shown his trust issues. Saying things like he expected me to be dating his best friend and not him. I don't know how to make him believe that I want him only. I've had eyes only for him since we met. I hope to talk to him this evening but its hard because he smokes pot- it doesn't bother me but in this case it is because it doesnt seem like he's fully "there". He knows I'm suicidal. I feel like I'm getting past that demon but I need his support and it just doesn't feel like he's there. I love him so much, and more every day even when things are tough like this.

I'm 30 now and working a dead end job and feel like I've done nothing with my life. I just want to stay in bed. But I can't miss work because I got written up for calling out sick 6 times in as many months (granted it wasn't once each month. Back in February I was sick for like a week). I also can't afford to miss any work. I just wish I could focus on my wellbeing for a bit. 

I feel sick. I cannot afford to see a therapist, and I've tried so many in the past that I dont have the mental and emotional energy to try more. I am so drained. I just want it to end.

Thank you for letting me release some of this.
