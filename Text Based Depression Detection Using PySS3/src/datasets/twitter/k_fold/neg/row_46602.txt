My wife and family are going to be so much happier.Every hospitalization my family and wife tell me they would be so sad if I died and my wife always says she couldnâ€™t survive without me but thatâ€™s not true she does just fine on her own now 

I am my mothers least favourite child 
I moved away from a city I loved to be close to her because she said how much she missed me I lived less then a 5 minute walk I could physically see her house but In the 12 months I lived there I got to see her twice she only wanted to see me twice both time equaled a grand total of around 9 minutes. I left and moved away when my lease was up but my sister moved their in early spring my mom stops by a few times a week and even has dinner there weekly. I asked her why she did this and all she said was it was a really busy time for her so I understand but it doesnâ€™t make it hurt any less.

My wife does love me I know that but Iâ€™m clearly not what she wants I will never make her the kind of happy she is looking for
