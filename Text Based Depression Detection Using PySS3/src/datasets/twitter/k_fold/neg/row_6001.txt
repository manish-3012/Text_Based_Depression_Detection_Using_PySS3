Being a social rejectWhat is the point of living that life? I'm 30 and never had any friends or anyone romantically interested in me. It's just straight never going to be different now, it is what it is. I find it very upsetting, particularly the hopelessness that goes with it. I know I'm right about being a reject, society has rejected me entirely. People can talk shit about "all lives matter" or whatever but the reality is that if you don't meet certain standards you're a shunned subhuman.

Only reason I can think of is that I hate to upset my family, but they would eventually get over it and it's selfish of them to expect me to live when every day is a living hell.
