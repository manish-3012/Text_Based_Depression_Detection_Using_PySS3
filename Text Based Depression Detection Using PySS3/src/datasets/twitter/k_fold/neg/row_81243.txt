What is r/sw's policy about suicidals advising suicidals on r/suicidwatch?I suspect a large chunk of the commenters on r/sw are suicidals. (I am too suicidal - but this is not about me, per se). I am just wondering what the policy is here about people like me. Should we stfu, or if not, how should we exercise self-censorship? How should we be expected to upvote/downvote comments amongst ourselves, so as not to facilitate suicides in threads started by people on the brink?
