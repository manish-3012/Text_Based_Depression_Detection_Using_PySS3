I don't have the strength to go onI have a stupid condition and like 5 mental illnesses that's probably going to make it impossible for me to have a normal life. I'm going to end up a worthless bum like my mom. That's the last thing I want and I can't escape it. Nothing makes me happy anymore. All my reasons to keep going don't work anymore. The last thing that was keeping me was fear but even that has gone away. There's really nothing at all stopping me. I can't think of any reason at all not to just kill myself right here and now and that doesn't even scare me anymore. I don't even know why I'm posting this. Clinging to my last strands of hope I guess.
