Teenage boy needs helpIn 14 a freshmen. Middle school wasn't the best for me everyone seems to had a group of friends but me. I hade some but none I could actully trust or talk too, just there. During these times I was depressed but convinced myself it was getting better. Entering high school I thought meeting new friends having a diffrent environment would be good for me. It wasnt I'm even more depressed and lost from where I was I am very jaded and feel like there's no reason to go on. Any suggestions?
