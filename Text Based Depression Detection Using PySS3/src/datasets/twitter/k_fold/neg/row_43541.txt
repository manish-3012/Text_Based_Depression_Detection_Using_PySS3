AnyoneThis feeling has grown to feel far too familiar. It gradually became a normalcy. Iâ€™ve grown tired of everything and everyone, nothing feels the way it should. It feels like my skin doesnâ€™t fit. The daily autopilot mode is becoming tiring. An empty source of joy. Ive become someone I deeply despise. I feel like my inner hatred screams louder then normal sounds. Iâ€™m so fucking tired. I feel thereâ€™s no proper place for me. Why continuously do something every fucking day if you have this overwhelming feeling of darkness; invading, controlling your thoughts from the minute you open your eyes. Sleeping is a temporary fix until you get woken up by the same shit alarm, dealing with the same shit family members surrounded by shady  snake friends. Iâ€™ve grown far too tired; itâ€™s exhausting, unfulfilling  to continue this constantly.
