Really struggling today.Most days I'm alright and my mental state is okay. Some days like today I feel crazy and overwhelmed by the mental mess that I am. I'm struggling real bad today, especially with the thoughts. Life just won't give me a break, it continuously beats my ass. I've posted on here before a few times while having mental break downs and I feel as if I'm about to break down at any moment. I'm about to get kicked out of my house today because I'm late on rent, only $200 balance left but my uncle is being unreasonable even though he knows I get paid next week and can pay him then. It's okay though, my whole family is like this so I'm used to it. I just have a lot going on mentally and the thought of having to live on the streets again or a homeless shelter is giving me anxiety. I want to die but I don't want to die. I'm overwhelmed. Thanks for listening.
