The earth is doomed, why even live and leave any legacy behind when no one will be around to see it?The last few months were one of the hardest I've experienced but recently I've been feeling well with bits of depression here and there but tonight, I just felt the need to come back on here because I'm just overwhelmed with a feeling of impending doom, not just on myself but also for every living thing on this planet and that we will all also go extinct. I know that life is meaningless in existential terms but now it's become even more meaningless because we have well and truly doomed ourselves to perdition before even making any true progress for the future. We're all slaves to the rich and then we die. There is no such thing as free will. We 'live' every moment waiting until death. I just wish I could be a child forever, A state of nostalgic fever that you can't wake up from. I just despise everything now, from things I enjoy, I've just become an extremely bitter person. I've really changed my attitude and views on a lot of things to better myself but to no avail...I still feel hopeless.
