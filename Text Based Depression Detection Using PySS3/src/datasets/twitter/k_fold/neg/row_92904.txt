My friend wants to die, but I'm conflicted about interveningMy friend (ex-girlfriend, if that is important) keeps saying that she is planning to commit suicide. She hates this world; she despises humanity and she feels that every day is a waste. I've tried talking to her about it, and trying to convince her that life is worth living, but I'm honestly out of arguments. She acknowledges that she is depressed in some way, and I suggested she at least try medication, but she feels like her cynical worldview is accurate, and trying to sugar-coat life would be lying (not her words, but pretty close). I want to intervene, but the only venue that I feel is left available would be some sort of police intervention, and that would not help the underlying issue. She comes from a rough background (former Soviet-bloc immigrant, abuse and trauma, etc.) so I'm sure that plays some factor, but I still don't know how to make her happy, or offer solutions, or really do anything. She always says how I just can't understand what she's been through, and that's true, but even when I try to point her towards places where she can make like-minded friends she shoots me down. 

Maybe I'm not trying hard enough. Maybe I just don't want to try and let this drama end. I really don't even know what to say when she texts me ":( *sigh*". I have no encouragement left.

The anniversary of her last attempt is coming up, and the bitter taste of acetaminophen vomit hasn't deterred her.
