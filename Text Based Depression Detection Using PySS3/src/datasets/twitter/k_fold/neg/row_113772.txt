i wish it felt like someone knew who i wasi feel so invisible in my everyday life, my "friends" don't check up on me or acknowledge me at all unless they need something from me, my boyfriend is always too busy for me and I only see him once every two weeks, and it feels like my family doesn't want me around at all. All i want is to feel like someone wants me around and i'm miserable, but i'm also too much of a pussy to attempt. I just wish i could cease to exist
