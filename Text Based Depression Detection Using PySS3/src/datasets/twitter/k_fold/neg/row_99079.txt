Iâ€™m going to kill myself soon and I will finally be happyI should be able to FINALLY kill myself soon. I cannot wait until I finally gain the courage to do it. Things are shaping up for me: my dads health is bad and my one, true friend is moving away from me. These are good for multiple reasons: one, once my dad is at peace, I can finally kill myself with no regrets. Two, with my friend, she will find other people to lean on and develop friendships with, so she finally wonâ€™t need me around anymore.

I will probably die a virgin (idk, unless I pay some type of male escort to have sex with me), and while that makes me a bit sad Iâ€™m happy that I will no longer be suffering. I just need to hold on to the point where this plan will finally work, and then I will be at peace. No more sadness, or debilitating anxiety.

My dad has tons of guns so it should be easy, but in case I canâ€™t go through with it that way, Iâ€™ll buy myself a one-way ticket to San Fran. Iâ€™ve thought about poison, pills, etc but the fail rate seems so high, and Iâ€™m probably only going to attempt once so I need to make it count.
