Not even suicidal...I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, but many nights I stay up late, thinking about bad things happening in my life at the moment. I know that I could never bring myself to suicide, but sometimes wish someone would just pull the trigger for me. I just don't know what to do because these depressive states keep occurring, and i see no way of making them stop...
