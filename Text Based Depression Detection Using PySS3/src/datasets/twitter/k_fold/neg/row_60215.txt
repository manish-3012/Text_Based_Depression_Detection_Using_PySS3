I'm killing myself soonI don't want to rant, I know nobody cares and the entirety of this sub is just a pity party. I'm too damn tired. I guess I just want someone else to know and take me seriosly, since my friends take all I say as a joke and I have no family. Maybe I just want to leave a note, so someone knows I existed. Maybe

Damn, autumn afternoons are nice. I wish I could enjoy them. I wonder where all my books will end up. Or if my pet will be treated well. 

Now, if I think more about it, I regret recently buying clothes. Those money would have been handy at the funeral. At least I hope I'll have one, but it's very improbable. I always loved quiet places. The suicide alley in the hometown cemetery is never visited by human steps. Maybe just when someone else decides to end it all, and someone has to dig a new hole in the ground. Then peace again. 

I wonder if all those stories about ghosts are real. Haunting a professor would be fun, I'd learn things even in the afterlife. I could travel. I could have all I never had in this life. At least I hope so. 

I shouldn't be this tired for my age.

I wish I had someone to watch the sunset with. Someone to tell goodbye.
