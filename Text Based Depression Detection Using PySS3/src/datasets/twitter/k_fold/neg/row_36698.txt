I donâ€™t knowI feel like if I die everything will be okay. People say itâ€™s easy to die than live but I feel like we feel pain even if thereâ€™s small wound in our body but knowing that you are gonna die and you still hurt yourself and feel pain. I donâ€™t think people can call it coward ness. I feel like someone is so tired of trying, thinking positive, listening to everyone belittling them, putting high expectant on them. I try to think that dying is better than I feel scared of dying. â€œWhat a joke?â€, I say to myself. I am scared to live and scared to die to. Itâ€™s like I want someone to save me but I know that the one who can save me is only me. I wanna die but then I am scared of feeling pain when dying. I just wish thereâ€™s a way I can die without feeling pain. Every problem repealed will be gone. I donâ€™t know what to do or what I want.
