Urge to end it allI feel like I've failed at life, its been 5 months since high school graduation, I have no job and too dumb for university, never had a girlfriend, been falsely accused of selling child porn when i was 14 forcing me to move schools and completely ruined my confidence and mental well-being, my dad nearly losing his life and getting diagnosed with depression, been quietly struggling mentally for the past 5 years and have been bottling up my emotions since 2016. I just feel like ending it all would finally give me some peace.

Made a new account to post this cause my other account has my real name on it.
