Iâ€™m so tiredI canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m exhausted. My dad fought cancer for almost two year and still died in July. My little sister is what keeps me going but when my older, college aged sibling are back in town she treats me like shit. Iâ€™m so sick of it.

My older sister ignores me entirely, calls my little sister â€œsweetie, honey, babyâ€ like all the cute names, and constantly invites her to do stuff with her and spend time with her and never asks me. Ever. She doesnâ€™t hate me but god she acts like she couldnâ€™t care less if I lived or died and honestly Iâ€™m ready to prove it. 

My mom is incredibly emotionally abusive or manipulative so sheâ€™s no help and I spend most of my time consoling her, and anything I bring up regarding my feelings she throws back at me, and shuts me down. My older brother is the typical college frat boy, so Heâ€˜s no help either.

This was my breaking point. Iâ€™m on a ski trip, my first one without my dad. He was a big skier, the best. This is such a painful trip and honestly thereâ€™s so much going on I canâ€™t do it. I want to walk into the creek and drown and fall asleep in the cold of nothingness. I want to be out of the pain so badly. The only reason Iâ€™m still here is my boyfriend, heâ€™d be crushed if I died. I canâ€™t do it but I canâ€™t deal with the pain. Please help me please
