Thousands of miles from home and alone.Just dumped by my girlfriend of a year and a half. I moved over a thousand miles from home to live with her and work and go to school here. She claims I need to grow as my own independent person, as I've become overly dependent. She claims that six months from now at minimum, if I've achieved balance and independence, we can discuss possibly becoming a couple again, if she's still interested. She states she likely will be, but can't guarantee that. This relationship meant everything to me. I'm thousands of miles from home, with no family and friends here. I lost my father just over a year ago, and had someone die in my arms in a successful suicide attempt late last year. I feel alone, cold, and miserable. I just want to end the suffering.
