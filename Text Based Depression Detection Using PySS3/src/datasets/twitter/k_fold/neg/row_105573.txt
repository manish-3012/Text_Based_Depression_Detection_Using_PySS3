If it turns out that your immediate family members (parent(s) and sibling(s)) are the only people in the world who give a shit about you at all (because of obligation), does that mean it's time for you to die?People always say stuff like "don't kill yourself, there are people who care about you and love you." Well who is it that cares about me and loves me? People who are obligated to. My parents, and my siblings if I have any. That's literally it. No significant other, no platonic friends who would really care to the point of love. In other words, no one who is not obligated cares or loves. In my opinion, for life to be worth living, a person HAS to attain that level of caring and love from someone NOT OBLIGATED to do so. That means people OTHER than immediate family members. If the only people in the world who truly care what happens to you are your immediate family members, in my opinion that's not enough. For life to be worth living one MUST attain care and love from those with no obligation to care and love. If you've got a wife and kids who love you, great, there's a reason to live. But if you've never had a SO and literally cannot envision yourself ever bringing life into the world because there's no chance of romantic relationship with someone, that means your parents and maybe a brother/sister are the only ones who give a shit about you at all. In my opinion, if that's your situation, it's time to die.

Would anyone like to challenge my opinion?
