Suicide thoughts are back in townThe thoughts are crawling back, I'm too tense to sleep, too tired to do anything, I want to cry and throw up at the same time. I feel guilty even though I haven't done anything wrong, and I feel sad and powerless.

Something good finally happens to me, and my mother decides to crush it, she starts making up things, even I am doubting of whether this thing that makes me happy is good.

And I feel so tense, my head and body hurts, once again I wish I could end it all. I wish I could not exist.
