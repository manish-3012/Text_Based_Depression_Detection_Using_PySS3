I'm at breaking point. I can't imagine I'll be here much longer.It's all too much now.  I think I was put on this earth to suffer.  I held a blade to my wrist last week but I didn't have the courage to cut deep enough.  The way my life is going though I'm sure I'll become emotionally numb enough to do it properly.

Just wanted to write this down.  It feels proper to write it down.  I think, if I get a chance today between the anxiety and the screaming that I might write some notes for people.  It might be the next step I need.
