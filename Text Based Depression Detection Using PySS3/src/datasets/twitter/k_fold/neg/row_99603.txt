Wasnâ€™t Able to Do ItI literally stayed up until 5 in the morning trying to get the nerve to shoot myself. My parents are in Williamsburg at the moment so it wouldâ€™ve been the perfect time to do so. After 5 hours of crying I couldnâ€™t bring myself to do it. Who am I like this, why canâ€™t I just be done.
