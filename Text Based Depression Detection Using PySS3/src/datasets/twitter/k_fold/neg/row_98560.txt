Why is a death by suicide considered more devastating than by natural causes?I've been thinking about doing it due to my running out of medication but don't want to cause grief to my mother, don't care much about my father. But I was just wondering, why is it in our society that suicide is considered worse than a natural death? Didn't the Greeks/Romans permit suicide? It wasn't condemned then. Most likely religion that did it.
