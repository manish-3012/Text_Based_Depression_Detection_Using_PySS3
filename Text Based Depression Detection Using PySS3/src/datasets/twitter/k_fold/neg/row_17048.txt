My girlfriend has passed...My girlfriend who I knew for 5 years prior has killed herself a few hours ago. I donâ€™t know what to do with myself, I am in so much pain. Can someone please talk to me about anything, please? 

I put so much effort to make her as good as she could possibly be, been through so much, spent so much time with. Took her out of a noose once. But.. it all fell apart. I am trying to convince myself not to do anything stupid and hurt myself, but the pain is awful..
