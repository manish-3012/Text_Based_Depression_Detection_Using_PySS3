Any good easy tips?I've been suicidal for a couple months now and it's starting to really get to me. I used to think about it only like a couple times a in a month but now its every day. I'm afraid to tell anyone cause they'll think i'm crazy. I just need some advice. Anything will do. Thanks so much to anyone who answers :)
