It never gets betterI donâ€™t understand why people always say â€œonce you get to â€œxâ€ point in life everything will be better.  Itâ€™s never better.  I keep reaching each â€œxâ€ point and Iâ€™m still alone, unlovable, untalented, and without promise or hope.  Iâ€™m tired of being told itâ€™ll get better.  A) itâ€™s a lie.  B) why should I settle for a life of waiting.  Thatâ€™s not a life.  I donâ€™t have a life, so I wouldnâ€™t be missing out on anything if I was really gone.
