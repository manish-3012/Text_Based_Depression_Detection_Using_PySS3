Everything keeps getting worstI've been depressed for maybe about 2 years now, I never really considered it that and please dont take offense to this, but I thought people would think i was weak If i said i was depressed and also americans tend to give medical names to every feeling in life. I only really thought about it as being depressed this year because I can tell i'm not happy with any aspect in my life. I'm adopted, yes i have a loving family, i know my adoptive family and my biological family but the only person i'm close to is my adoptive dad. other than that, I feel like i barley know my relatives, it's very lonely. My dad is not married so i'm all he has and i'm always scared because I know he will leave me one day, possibly soon. (he's getting older and might get sick and i've only turned 20), he's all i have, and without him i'd be more alone than ever. The worst part is that i'm failing college, my boyfriend hates me and being in my mind is like a prison. I constantly repeat all the bad things i've said or done towards people and I can't forgive myself. I'm sorry this is so long. It's a lot more complicated than this but I just had to get some of it out. I don't know what to do anymore, I hate my toxic self. Someone give me some advice
