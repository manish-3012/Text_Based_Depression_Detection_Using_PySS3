Is anyone sticking around until their parents die?I really want to. I'm 30 and my parents are 59 and 61. They'll probably go early due to the stress of raising and supporting such a fuckup. They already have myriad maladies and work full time, and very hard. They're the type who've completely devoted their life to their kids and family. It would destroy them. But I just can't stick around for another 10 or 20 years. 5 maybe. Tops.
