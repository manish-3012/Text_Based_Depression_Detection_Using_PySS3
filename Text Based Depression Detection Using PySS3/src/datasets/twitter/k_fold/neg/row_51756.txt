i dont get whats so wrong with my death.i free myself of all of the suffering i've been through and going through, and i stop bothering with my existence.

I come from a broken house and a broken parent's marriage, so i dont really have anywhere else to go anyways. I've learned english self taught but have no idea what to do with it.


Everytime i talk about ending it here online or anywhere i always get people anxious and uncomfortable. I dont get why my death is something so tragic to them.
