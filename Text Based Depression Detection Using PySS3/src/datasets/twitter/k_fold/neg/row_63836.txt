Tonight is a test run of my death.I will take two 5-325 hydrocodone as well as some other pain killers every 30 minutes while sipping on this vodka.    Iâ€™ll be studying for the Bar exam at the same time.  I could end up with some organ failure or I could die.  Iâ€™m at peace either way.  If Iâ€™m going to go Iâ€™m not going to be sobbing. Iâ€™m going to continue to live as if nothing is happening.
