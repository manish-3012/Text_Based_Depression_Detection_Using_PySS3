16 year old in relationship with 29 year oldHi, I'm a 16 year old girl. I've been depressed since I was 12, always wanted to kill myself but never did it because of my parents, I can't do that to them. Last year I met a man, a 28 year old man, on Tinder. I came to his house and we saw each other a few more times. After that we got in to a relationship, I didn't know what I was doing but he was nice and it seemed okay, so yeah my insucure me thought it was good to begin a relationship with a 28 year old. After a few months he wanted to have sex with me. I  wasn't ready for that, so I said I didn't want it.  He said that he would break up if I didn't do it, so I did it. I didn't have any friend's so I didn't want to be alone again. A few months later we did go on vacation together (yeah my parents thought it was okay because they thought he is 21, not 28). On vacation we got into a fight, you would think that every couple would have a fight sometimes, but this was not normal. I woke up with a blue eye and wounds on my body. Since that moment I knew this is not a good relationship, and I know that because we still have fights every weekend and he is always screaming to me and swearing. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't break up with him because I'm scared of him. Every night I can't sleep and think of ways to kill myself and its driving me crazy, I don't know what to do anymore, I'm in such a dark place.
