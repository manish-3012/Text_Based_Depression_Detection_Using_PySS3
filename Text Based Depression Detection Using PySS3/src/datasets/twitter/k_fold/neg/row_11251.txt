Crying EverydayIt was suppose to be my first year in University. I went into a science program which I thought would be a good fit for me as in high school I was very good in science (especially Chemistry and Biology, which I finished at the top of my class). When University started I got overwhelmed and lost all self confidence. I would wake up every morning in a shit mood and not motivated to learn. I then started to reconsider if I really wanted to stay in the program. I eventually decided to take a year off and go into a different program next year. However now being out of University, I feel like a failure. I'm thinking that I'm going to be a year behind my peers and feel ashamed that I ended up in this situation. I'm now starting to think that I'm not smart. I feel afraid of what University will look like next year because of what I recently went through. I'm in a really dark place right now and I am always stressed. It's even getting hard to hold back my tears everyday.
