What A Selfless Act, That Goes Unnoticed.Many of us here suffer in silence, and have yet  to do the ONE thing. That never leaves our mind, to end our own pain. Just so other's we leave behind won't be in pain. 

Many people are quick to call those who commit suicide selfish and inconsiderate. 

But never considered how long that person tried to hold on. Simply for the people around them. 

And for those who want to end it all. Yet, are still here whether it be for your pet, your partner, your parents, your friends, or your peer. 

Whatever the case may be. I just want to say I am proud of you. For pushing through shitty times. Even if it meant sleeping in bed all day, not doing a thing. 

Not everyone understands the amount of strength that takes.
