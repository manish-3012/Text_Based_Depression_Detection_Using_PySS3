Staying AliveI have a beautiful family. Two kids and a loving wife. I know that they will be screwed if I leave, but I don't want to stay.

I am sick. 8 treatments of ECT did nothing. Meds are not helping. Therapy is not helping. If I could, I'd be lobotomized.. Last night I had a dream about finding a gun to kill myself.

I want to write a suicide note, but I don't know where to start. I'm literally trapped for years in this life. I won't allow myself to be hospitalized again. It's just a feeling of being even more trapped.

My kids and wife will be better without me. They deserve better. I've told my wife that I want her to find someone better. Someone who she doesn't have to ask constantly what is wrong.
