Some Reasons Not To DieIt's time for that season again. I dunno I feel empty and numb. I can't sleep. I can't even enjoy the things I use to enjoy. My friends want to talk with me but I just don't want too. I don't know what I want. I don't know really. I don't know what to feel anymore. I am so tired of thinking. I am so tired of everything. I'm now sitting alone in my dark room, while "Reasons Not to Die" by Ryn Weaver plays on repeat.  I'm so tired of this neverending downward spiral. I just can't anymore.
