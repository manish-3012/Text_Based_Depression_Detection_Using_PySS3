Please Help, Im In Big Trouble, What Do I Do?ok, so i was wondering about inter-family relationships. SWIM has a relationship with his sister, his sister feels likewise and they have been having sex on a regular basis because swim did not think that brother/sister relationships could result in children. swim has also just found out that his sister is pregnant, and the child is probably his.

Now swim is in a tricky situation, he is in a relationship with a secretary, and is engaged to be married, but swim feels he has been irrisponsible in having a secret affair. swim dosnt feel like this is cheating however, as we have the same dna, we are from the same parents, so swim cant see what the issue is. however swim feels like he now has an obligation to take care of this child now.

if swims sister does not get an abortion, will the doctors know that the child is a prouct of incest? swim knows medical technology has come along way, and wonders if the doctors know swim is the father, could they prosocute swim for anything? swim is freaking out over this and needs to come up with a plan
