How do you not want to kill yourselfSo Iâ€™m in a dark place. Been here for years. Tried to kill myself many times (obviously not successfully). And it hasnâ€™t gotten any better. Sometimes I donâ€™t want to die cause Iâ€™m sad, I just feel so unsatisfied with life and I feel like I never will be. I feel like I donâ€™t like people but I hate being alone. Iâ€™ve moved away from all my friends and Iâ€™m lonely af. I cannot kill myself cause I donâ€™t wanna cause pain to people but I also donâ€™t really wanna live. I feel like Iâ€™m just waiting until everyone I love dies so I can kill myself or for something other than myself to just kill me. How do people find satisfaction in life?
