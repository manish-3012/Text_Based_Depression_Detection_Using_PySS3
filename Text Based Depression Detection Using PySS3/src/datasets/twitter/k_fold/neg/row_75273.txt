That's it.I've reached a dead end.  There's nowhere to go from here.  I've done my best.  I worked my ass off at my job, putting in 60 hour weeks for years on end and it's come to nothing. I tried really hard for a meaningful fulfilling relationship for many years and I'm now single with no prospects.

I'm old now, and too tired and worn to do it all again.  I'm sick of life.  It holds no mystery or excitement for me any more.  It's just a dull grind as I get older, physically and mentally weaker, and less relevant to society and even those I've called loved ones.

In chess when you see that you've lost, you resign--there's no need to play out every tedious move of an inevitable conclusion. 

Bye, guys.
