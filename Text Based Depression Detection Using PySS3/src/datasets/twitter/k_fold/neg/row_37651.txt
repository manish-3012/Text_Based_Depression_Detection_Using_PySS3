should i just go?i'm 14, in a house where i have a loving family: although, our ethnicity is asian, and most of my family scold me due to my grades currently, A+, A-, B+, C+, A-, and A+. my mom tells me she won't love me until my grades go up, and until she knows i can be a success. on some online steam game named cs:go, i got scammed 700$ out. i've taken one of my dad's sleeping pills; should i risk it? i don't want any negative comments right now.
