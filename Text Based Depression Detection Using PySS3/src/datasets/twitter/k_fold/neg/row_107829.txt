I'm going through one of the most painful nights in my lifeI don't think I'm going to be alive by 10th May. This is it, I've lost my battle. It's over for me and I can't do this anymore.

I decided to end it tomorrow when I will find an opportunity early in the morning. Then go to the train track and jump. I don't care about physical pain anymore. This mental torture is worse.

I feel guilty for breaking my promise to someone, but this won't last since dead people can't feel guilt.

It's been shit 28 years. It'll finally come to an end.
