Does anybody else feel extremely suicidal because of school?Seriously, fuck school. I try my absolute hardest and I can barely make my grades. 

I mention my struggles to the people who apparently care about me, and I get yelled at for it, as if it's easy? As if this is even a good environment for me to pass? It isn't.

It feels impossible, this life. I don't know why I'm trying anymore. I really don't. I want it to be over already. I can't wait to be old and dying so I can just know that it will be over soon.

I wait and wait, nothing gets better, when I try, I end up making things worse.
