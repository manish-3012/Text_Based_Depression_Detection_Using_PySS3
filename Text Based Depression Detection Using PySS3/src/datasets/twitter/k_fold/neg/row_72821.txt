Best way to kill myself?Recently i gave up on everything. I am becoming successful and I feel like i can do anything in the world if i try hard enough, but I don't think that would make me any happier. I stopped caring for almost everyone, i love my family just because i have to. I am religious but my whole short life has been just suffering. I am a realist and i don't see any reason to suffer anymore. I am becoming envy of my friend and i want to be handsome like he is i want to have good looking face and be more confident. I am not ugly but i am over ambitious and wont stop until i get something and beauty is something i cant get so i am asking what is the least painful way of suicide? This may sound like i am stupid and some people have it worse but i hadn't been happy for years and then there is no point.
