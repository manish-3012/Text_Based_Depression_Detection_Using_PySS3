Started writing my suicide note...I know Iâ€™m going to die from suicide, and the way things are going probably within the next month. I have nothing left to live for, I havenâ€™t felt happy in ages. The only thing stopping my is my peers. I donâ€™t want to hurt them, but I donâ€™t know if I can take it much longer.
