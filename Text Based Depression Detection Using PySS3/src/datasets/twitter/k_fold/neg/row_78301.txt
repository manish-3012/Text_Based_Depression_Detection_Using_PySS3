My job makes me want to die as well as my weightPlease help me understand why I get terrible anxiety before going into work. First I would like to explain that I am a fat 22 year old female who works in a grocery chain in the bakery department.  Everyday I work I hate myself more and more. Customers can be really mean over small things like Donuts or how things are packaged.  They hurt my feelings constantly I want to cry at work. I'm stuck taking the counter and cleaning.  I can only open or close there are no other options for time.  It's either I work  6am to 3 or 3pm to 11. 

My coworkers get angry quickly and the atmosphere gets Tense and I just want to crawl in a hole.  They get passive aggressive and mad of I can't take every customer. 

My weight. I try to lose weight but it's impossible living with my dad who buys pizza and junk food all the time.  I shop for myself but it's too hard to ignore the temptations. I have gained  fifty pounds in six months or so.  I am so sad I hate working in my tight uniform.  No matter what I do it gets tighter.  This is even a newer uniform I replaced my old one with which was tight before now I'm sure it will never. 

Please I think about suicide at work a lot how I just want to end it but when I'm home I tend to feel better, I just hate being in public places.  What do I do I am scared and don't want to work anymore is hard to even get dressed in the morning at all.

Should I quit my job?  I have to pay car insurance that's basically all I'm working for and I'm going to college but that's already prepaid thanks to my parents I just have to worry about books but I could maybe take out loans. I have no idea what to do my job has made me hate myself so much I want to die everyday I work
