Hospitals are cancer for mentally ill people I just overdosed on 100mg and ended up in the hospital yesterday. I'm finally done with etiz, so done got out now but that was the craziest shit of my life. I ended up on my roof contemplating suicide, called 911 and had officers trying to get me to come down. Scary, I had zero control, lucky I didn't kill myself I'm in tears right now and I'm just so thankful to be alive I really felt like I could have ended it in that moment of inhibition this is why I try to stick with opioids never once have I thought about suicide on an opioid.

I was forced to go voluntarily, if I said no they threatened to have a doctor force me to go in involuntarily. Later on, as the etizolam began to wear off I felt a strong urge to leave. There were guards monitoring the door leading out so I had no chance until another patient was acting up and had to be restrained. While the guards were distracted I made a run for it, made it pretty far until I misjudged a jump I fell, and scraped up my fingers pretty badly. 

After this a doctor was quick to come to see me and let me leave, I told him I just wanted to leave and I wasn't suicidal. Overall a shitty way to have to get out of a situation like that, I have to injure myself to get discharged even after I was forced to sign a voluntary admission paper.
