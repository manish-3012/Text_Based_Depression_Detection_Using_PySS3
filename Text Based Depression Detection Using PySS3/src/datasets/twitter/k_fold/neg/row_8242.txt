My parents make me want to fucking dieSorry if this doesnt fit here, but i just have to get it off my chest. Im not depressed and i love my life including all my friends and shit but whenever im with my parents it makes me want to fucking kill myself cause of their insufferable being. Dunno if this is some sort of mental disorder or what but all i can think of is pure fucking hatred, its like im a totally different person with or without their presence. Im not even fucking sad or anything i just want to kill myself out of pure fucking spite just so they feel despair from knowing its all their fault. Because of how fucking impactful the cunts are my fucking grades are falling and im perpetually angry and i burned all my fucking bridges so i cant even reach out and god fucking damn i know im using that as an excuse but my life is fucking ruined one way or another because those teo cunts just had to exist in my life. Counselors say i should wait until 18 to just fuck off and move out but honestly i dont think i can hold on that long, all i want to do is to get the fuck out of this house and away from them but under legal confines i cant run away or convince them to disown me or do jack fucking shit so wtf am i suppose to do other than killing myself??
