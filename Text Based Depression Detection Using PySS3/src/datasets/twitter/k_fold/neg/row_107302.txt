No one gets out of life alive and I've got the rope around my neckI really did try to get help - as per my previous post here I called for help on wednesday and got refused by my private hospital as I was too big of a safety risk. 7 hours later in ER I was discharged to walk home by myself to nothing as I was not sick enough for public. My only option now is death as I cannot get help and I cannot live like this anymore. 16 years is far too long to live in hell.


I've already taken a lot of codeine and valium and am sitting here with a slip knot around my neck drinking vodka. Could anyone talk to me until I pass out please? I'm too much of a coward to straight hang myself but I can't take the risk that my overdose is not enough. Survival is no longer an option.


I'm scared to go out alone but I can't call anyone, please just chat with me?

Update- I was found and taken to ER, I've just been admitted to a psych ward, who know what will happen. Also I'm 26 not 16, have been suffering for 16 years lol
