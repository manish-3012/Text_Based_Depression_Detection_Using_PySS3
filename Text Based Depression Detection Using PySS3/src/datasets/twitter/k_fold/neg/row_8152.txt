I wish I wouldn't wake up tomorrow.I can't keep waking up to the hell that is in my head everyday. I wake up and it's constant fighting. I keep saying that I need to keep on going, but it's so exhausting. If I could just give up everything would go away. I wouldn't be telling myself I'm not good enough anymore. I wouldn't be pretending I'm happy or putting on a fake smile. I would finally feel like I did something right if I could somehow make myself sleep forever. Everything would change for my family and the people around me. They wouldn't have to financially support me through college anymore. No more worrying about me or asking how I feel. Eventually I would just disappear. I think that would be best for everyone. It's not like I appeal to anyone anyways. I always fuck everything up. People think I'm okay and I'm happy, but I'm not. It's fucking exhausting pretending everything is okay. I'm so tired I feel like I could just sleep forever, but every time I go to sleep I always wake up. I am trapped and I am losing the battles in my head. Everyday the self criticism gets worse. I just want to be nothing and drift from everyone's mind. I dream that one day I wouldn't wake up. Why do I keep waking up?
