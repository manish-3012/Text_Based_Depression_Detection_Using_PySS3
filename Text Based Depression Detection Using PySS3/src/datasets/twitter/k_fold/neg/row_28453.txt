whats left.....reallyso im 22 at 16 i droped out of school and ended up living on the streets and locked up admitidly only a few time over the years no more then a week each time but at 19 i quit meth and herion still drank still do altho only once in awhile and not to get plastered last year i had a job for about 6 weeks that ended by a walk out becouse i could not sleep out side in a thunderstorm and when boss found where i was sleeping was not explisitly permitted started bitching at me telling me to roll out in the rain and get sick if i must to stay working or he would fire me exact words about the firing me were "you know i could fire you when ever i felt like it and you would be back on the streets broke hungry and cold so you had best do as i say" i told him to fuck off and walked away after that i got housed up with family took about 8 moths to get a ged then another 1 for the only possible job that would take me idk what it says on my employment record about the carnival work and dont care i had a job for 2 days doing construction and was fired becouse i was not conditioned to that much physical work in 95 degree weather and ended up with signs of heat stroke both days and then had to walk 10 miles to the office a few days later sence a friend i made was fighting to help me keep the job got there was told not going to happen by the boss and regional manager over the last few months iv sent out dozens of applications but sence i have a crimnal history next to no work experiance and the walk off/quit/job abandoment from 1 and fired on the other no one seems willing to 'risk' hireing me iv looked into college so i could at least do somthing that would help me open doors and such but i cant get a loan sence my credit score is just over 500 (so it is a few points above bad credit) i cant seem to get a loan for college sence i dont have a few grand in my pocket i cant start into a college so thats a no go now to top it off im basicly nothing more then a burden to those around me about to go leave to the streets again so i could trade the few possessions that are worth somthing to people (monatary value) for enough herion to OD with a chance to survive from it that is less then 1% that way it will look like an accadent as for the very few people that would be hurt that this happened time will heal all wounds and they would be just fine no one would kill them self over my death and it would hurt even less if this is the first news they have on/about me in a few months its ether that or i just dont drink any water for a few more days at 3 in an hour or 2 and i induce kidney failure i belive at 7 days with no fluids going into body only righting this as a form of my last thoughts before the endless migrains set in and i can no longer think
