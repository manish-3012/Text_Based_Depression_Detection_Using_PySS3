No one cares about meI'm done being ignored. All I want friends or any form of any attention, but no one's ever cared about me. No ones cares that I have leukemia and no one's said anything to me, called me on the phone, or come to visit me. No one would notice if I died except for the hospital, and no one would care. I won't even get a funeral.
