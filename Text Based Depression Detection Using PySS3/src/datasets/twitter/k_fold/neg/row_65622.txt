I love my son but I'm a bad mother for himI hit my son... He is still one year old. 
He can walk but not talk yet. I hit his hand very light but in fact I hit him.. 
Because he bit my arm so hard. 
I'm the person who can't control my anger feelings.. 
I have hurt myself often when I get stressed and depressed. Also I have tried to kill myself so many times. 
Every day I think i should not have had a child.. I'm a terrible person. I'm really sorry. I will be gone soon. I'm just a bad mother and my son needs a better mother...
