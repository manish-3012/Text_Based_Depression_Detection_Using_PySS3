I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what else to do. I feel so lonely.I'm so stressed out it's unbearable. I keep panicking and I don't know why. I don't know what to do. I feel like my days are numbered at this point. It's just too much. I can't stop crying. I've cried all day. I can only think about ending it all. I haven't done it yet because of my family, otherwise I wouldn't be here.  I don't want to be here. I don't want to live. I don't know how to live. I can't function. I'm not normal. I'm broken. I feel so hopeless. I don't know what to do.
