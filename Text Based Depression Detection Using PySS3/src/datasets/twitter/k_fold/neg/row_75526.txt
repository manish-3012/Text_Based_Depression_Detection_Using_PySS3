Easier to burn than to anticipate the fireFirst time poster. Sorry for the mistakes in advance. I canâ€™t breathe. I canâ€™t sleep and I canâ€™t eat or even think straight: I have IBS and almost no appetite, i throw up all my meals, the maybe one meal a day that i eat, if that. anxiety is making it crippling. one year. i am a former opiate addict, i have my med card for nausea and i canâ€™t function without constant dabs of my 97.5% thc concentrate and cbd. i have close to my three panic attacks a day now. my mind canâ€™t unwind and i canâ€™t REST. my whole family would disown me if they know i even touched weed, iâ€™m living a lie and i know i havenâ€™t made a single person proud. iâ€™m tired of dealing with my mental health issues. happiness is always short lived and iâ€™ve figured out the bad is inevitable. iâ€™m in a constant high state of panic and i canâ€™t change my mindset or not be high or my anxiety and nausea get even worse. i just want peace
