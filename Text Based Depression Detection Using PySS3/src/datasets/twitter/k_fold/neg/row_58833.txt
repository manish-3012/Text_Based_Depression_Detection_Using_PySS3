I want to drink until it all goes away.I feel so stupid. I had a good night tonight. but i hate it. i want to want suicide. i want it to be over. but i'm too weak and that hurts even more...i can't even bring myself to commit suicide.
i just want it to be over. but i'm too weak to make it end. i'm too lazy and spoiled and stubborn to even fix it or use what i've been given to actually have a life. i waste it all.
i want to give up. i want to just drink until it goes away.
