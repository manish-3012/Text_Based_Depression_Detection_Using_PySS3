Do the suicidal thoughts go away?I first started having them earlier this summer in the aftermath of an extremely painful break up. I constantly wanted to swerve into oncoming traffic or just fall from a high place. It was an outlet, some way for me to feel something, anything when all that was left was emptiness. Towards the end of the summer things took a change. I lost all sense of hope, and now I'm distancing myself from everyone. It's no longer about the break up, more my failure as a person. (Although though I still can't get her out of my head.) I don't know if I will be able to make it to December so that I won't have to face my family as the disappointment I've become. 

For me what's scary is that none of this feels new. It's the same feeling I've always had, it's just never given itself form. I don't know if it will ever go away, since it has always been there. Do they go away?
