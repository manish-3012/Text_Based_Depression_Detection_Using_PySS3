...The only reason I haven't killed myself is my mother. She loves me and if I killed myself she would be devastated. Recently I started having thoughts that I should just kill her and then kill myself. Of course I'm not going to do it, but just having those thoughts, how horrible is that. I don't know what to do, I just want to die and I don't want to hurt her. I spent last few hours looking for a way to kill myself so that it looks like an accident, or how I could give myself cancer or some other disease so that I can just die.
