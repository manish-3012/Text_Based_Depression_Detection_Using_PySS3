Staying alive just to not hurt someone who probably wouldnt care anywaysCasual depression thowaway account post.  Tonight i havent slept and came the closent ive come to going trough as i did when i attempted a couple years ago, i even thought out what i would write in a note completely in my head. the only thing that is keeping me is this idea that this one person i knew and was friends with but secretly liked would be hurt by it I go back and forth on it would hurt him and its just me over romanticizing it and once he heard it would be a, "damn" , and then back to being forgotten forever
