i know one day im dying of suicidehello im goat,  


warning im drunk and not a native english so sorry for grammar and weird sentences. my brain is al over the place so forgive me.

i just recently (10 minutes ago) found this subreddit. im sitting with these feelings for a while. as a 9 year old till my 14th im sexually abused by then a 15 year old till she was 20-ish. im a dude.   
i have a lot of problems, dealing with depression since 13. and been suicidal since i was 20 (26 now)   
grew up isolated and told my self dudes dont ccry

so yeah around january i had a lot of flashbacks/memories coming back from my youth that i pushed into a room far far away in my head and it made me drink a lot of alcohol. especially because i cant handle sadness. i used to cut my self a lot to convert mental pain in physical pain  


so i tried to talk with friends about my  suicidal thoughts and that i know that i would end it one day and what happened in my life when i was younger. and they kinda laughed about it cuz how can a dude be sexually abused, and how can it be hard on someone as a dude. even tho on dudes it might be a little easier than on girls it shouldnt matter. but it drives me crazy.   


the only reason im still with them is because i dont have any one else, i just try to keep my shit together in the hope someone understands me.. but when i tell people im really concerned about myself because i know for a fact that i will end my life before i have a natural death just scares me. and no one gets me. im talking to a psychiatrist but just dont know what to do with these fgeelings..  


i just needed to get this off my chest.   


if someone feels the same im here for you. i know what you go through. and i can listen to your story. but i cant promise for a solution,   


again sorry for the terrible grammar and sentence structure. and also thanks for reading.   


keep your heads up champions.
