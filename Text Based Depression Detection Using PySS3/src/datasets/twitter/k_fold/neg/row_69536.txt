Thanks for all the experience life I don't want to live anymore.Fuck you life, you suck. How can nothing work for me. Being rejected buy the girls you liked. Constant fails, sometimes being hungry to spare some money because you are to poor. Constant pressure from family and outside. I  have became totally numb. I can't see my self on the other side of the life. Its stupid to hope that something good or someone special with appear and change your life. Its somehow crazy to hope anything good will happen. Look at me, I can't even do shit to improve my life, that's how miserable I am. Why not to end it? I will spare some misery for my family. I hope I will die in peace and forget anything.

TLDR: I am a joke don't even bother.
