My Depression Is Winning*TW: sexual assault*

Iâ€™ve battled with depression since I was around 11 after I was assaulted by a family member. Iâ€™m 19 now, but I havenâ€™t really gotten better. In middle school I started self harming, attempted suicide, and ended up in 8 mental hospitals (one long term). I kind of overcame my issues and was doing good until my senior year of hs. My school allows honors students to take college classes in place of most non-state required classes so I did that. I did fairly well, but I had moved my junior year so hs wasnâ€™t really fun doing senior class stuff with people I didnâ€™t know. I realized how I was retracting so I forced myself to get a job., itâ€™s a shitty job but I have good coworkers.

Flash forward to now: Iâ€™m a sophomore in college (one semester from an associates) but Iâ€™ve goiter worse. Iâ€™m no longer able to study or focus on work. I canâ€™t stop dissociating and feeling numb.  I started back self harming and I know if the person Iâ€™m â€œtalkingâ€ to sees it he would be mad. 

Itâ€™s gotten worse and I really have contemplated ending my life but Iâ€™m scared 

I donâ€™t know how to tell my parents
