Eternity is a long time but this life is RIDICULOUSI miss being a freshmen I miss being liked i miss my ex I miss before he dumped me because I have dysphoria surrounding my periods. ALSO period is supposed to happen tomorrow i took a birth control pill but I donâ€™t think Thays gonna stop it. I was on testosterone for a year but I didnâ€™t wanna be a guy. I donâ€™t think so. I just wanted to stop periods. Why did God make it this way? What a cruel existence? Just why? Anyway...I can never leave this body. Iâ€™ll never get my ex back or old life back so why donâ€™t I destroy this body? Someone please talk to me!
