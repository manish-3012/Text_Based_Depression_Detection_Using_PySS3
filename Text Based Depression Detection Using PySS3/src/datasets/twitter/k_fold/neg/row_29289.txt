I want to fucking die.If I am not constantly pumping fucking drugs into me, I just feel so fucking shit about everything and how life is right now, even when on drugs I feel it, but then it is only a matter of ignoring and escaping my problems, temporarily. If I kill myself then I will permanently be saved from this mind of mine, I need respite, I NEED OUT!
