The last eight years of my life has been a lie and I want to end it allIâ€™ve been in love with this girl for the last eight years but she stopped talking to me and Iâ€™ve been hoping sheâ€™d come back to be my friend again but it turns out she was never my friend she just felt bad for me which means now I have no friends and I never will Iâ€™m a useless piece of shit and I deserve to die
