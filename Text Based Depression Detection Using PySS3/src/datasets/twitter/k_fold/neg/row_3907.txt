Telling my friends mom sheâ€™s extremely suicidalSo I have a text planned

 Hi miss (friend mom) I really didnâ€™t want to be the one to tell you this but (child) refuses so here it goes.

(C) is in a lot of trouble right now and she needs a lot of help and Iâ€™m sure you know that to some extent but not all of it, with the situation with her dad and everything right now sheâ€™s basically under a lot more stress and her depression was ready getting really bad before that but what (C) has never really told you too much is that she is really badly suicidal and itâ€™s not her fault itâ€™s just her brain right now and she needs some real help or sheâ€™s going to leave us sooner than she deserves too. Sheâ€™s scared to tell you because sheâ€™s scared sheâ€™ll get yelled at and in trouble for the ways that sheâ€™s feeling but I promise you itâ€™s not (C) fault she canâ€™t control it but something needs to change like maybe her medication or something because I donâ€™t want her to die and Iâ€™m so sorry to have to be the one to tell you but itâ€™s better now than never 

Any ways I should word it differently or should I add something please help quick itâ€™s gotten to the point where Iâ€™m up at night wondering if I still have my best friend or not having panic attacks
