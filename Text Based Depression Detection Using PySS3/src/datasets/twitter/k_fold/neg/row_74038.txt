Donâ€™t know what to doI really feel like Iâ€™m going to try to kill myself if I do have Herpes .. this is too much. First off Iâ€™m 19 years old and just got out of a relationship... my period was late so I called my ex and told him Iâ€™m gonna take a pregnancy test.. he then says that he has been itching and seeing bumps on his penis for a month now.. I freak out and schedule a gynecologist appointment the next day .. not only was he cold and rude but he DR said I have bump that looks like it may be herpes .. I now feel a little itching and heat from my vagina .. I was gonna go to the navy .. I wanted to do shit like travel the world. I feel so broken
