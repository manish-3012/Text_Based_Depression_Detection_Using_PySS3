I hate everyone and this world in generalEveryone I know and have trusted has let me down in some way. This world isn't worth it and everyone who says that is a liar. This world is just a giant piece of shit. I don't hate myself or anything, I know I'm a good person and I tried my best. What I hate is everyone else. Even if I get good things in life it won't make me happy. The thought of living to even 50 years in a world like this is incomprehensible to me. Every time I try to do the right thing the liars, morally bakrupt people try to turn in around and I get in even more trouble. Every time I tried to turn my garbage life around I get dragged right back down. If I could order a hitman to kill me I would do it. No one needs to reply to this and in fact I'm not expecting anyone to. It would be typical for me and for my life.
