Dealt a horrendous hand of cards by the universeI was born to a mother and father that had not a single clue how to raise a child, nor the resources to do so. I can't quite remember how life was before they split, perhaps it was too traumatic and my mind has blocked it out, which seems to be the most likely case based on some of the stories my mother has told me about those years. Due to my parents being on the very bottom of the middle class and working long hours, it was rare that a meal did not come from McDonalds or Burger King, leading me to become overweight when I was only 5, and quickly building up to the morbid obesity that I've now been trying to shed for the better part of my life. (For those who would ask why this is a challenge - a lifestyle you've been living since you were born is not an easy thing to change.)

During my middle school to high school years, life was basically hell. Unlike most kids at that age, I had not been taught proper hygiene by my parents, and my mother (Who was now the only parent in the household after the split.) did nothing to remedy this. As you can imagine, an overweight kid that smells like shit walking down the hallways leads to a lot of unpleasant stares and laughs behind your back. This pushed my already present depression and social anxiety to unbearable levels. I started skipping school every now and then when I didn't feel like being around other people, which eventually lead to me skipping at every opportunity possible, being ashamed to show my face in school after the amount of absences I had wracked up. After this went on for a certain period of time, I was thrown into a mandatory truancy group where I treated like a criminal for an hour every day I attended. This of course didn't help, since all they did in said truancy group was threaten you with punishment if you kept skipping, which had the opposite of the intended effect in my deeply depressed state. I was so hopeless at this point that suicide became a serious option in my mind, but luckily my logical side always prevented me from attempting it.

Skipping past night school, which my mother decided to switch me into to try and put less social stress on me, but failed due to the same reason as before, I was eventually put into therapy. For the 10 minutes that the therapist wasn't filing paperwork or talking about himself during our sessions, he only asked questions that I had already gone over a million times in my head and already came to the same conclusions he provided, along with the same old "You can do it!" BS.

Once night school failed, I sat at home for the better part of a year before I got a job opportunity from a family member. They pulled some strings and I was hired at a local grocery store in the produce section without even needing an interview. I was dead set on making this work, to make something out of myself. That is, until it actually came time for my first shift. I could power through the pain and fatigue that came from being overweight and suddenly being on my feet for hours at a time, but my body wasn't quite so ready. I got off from my first shift early, with bruises all over my legs and feet that caused excruciating pain whenever I took a step. I tried again the next day, but ended up quitting after the bruising only got worse. That was my first job, two days and I quit.

During this time, I was helping maintain a website for one of my online friends with the knowledge I had garnered over the years from my interest in programming and computers in general. The service he was selling on said website was bringing in a good heap of cash, but I never bothered to ask for any, feeling I didn't deserve any part of it for my small contribution. With the sting of my recent failure in the back of my mind, I asked if I could be brought on full-time for a pay check, and he gladly obliged. It started out decent for the first few months, before I eventually started making more per month than either of my parents. The overwhelming success of it all really brought me out of my depression for a while, and that went on for the better part of 2018. It did a lot of good for me, got me my first car (albeit one that needs part replacements fairly often), and put me on the path to moving out by 2019. It only came to a premature end when a technicality in copyright law allowed a company much bigger than my friend's to sue him over his service, forcing it to shut down.

So here I am, a high school dropout (albeit I did end up getting a high school equivalency diploma) that had a taste of success and is now back to wondering if the future holds anything worth living for. Still morbidly obese, still inflicted with debilitating depression and social anxiety. My mother has suggested multiple times that I try medication to treat my depression, but I would much rather be sad and cognizant than happy and drugged out of my mind.

Sorry for going through my whole life story, I just really had to get it off my chest. People are quick to judge someone like myself without knowing the circumstances that lead up to the way I am now. Suicide has always been at the back of my mind, but never became prominent enough to make me take action on it. I pray to god that nothing worse will happen in the coming months and years that will push me over the edge.
