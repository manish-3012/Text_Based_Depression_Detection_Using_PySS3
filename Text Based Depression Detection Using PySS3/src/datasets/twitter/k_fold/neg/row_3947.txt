I'm here againI just keep coming back here. Every time it's worse and worse and I'm closer to ending it all. I don't know how many times I can survive it.

In a week I've had a mental breakdown, a fit of massive paranoia, and today I almost panicked because of something stupid.

I have no family. I can't seem to trust my friends. Ex friends are constantly around, making me feel guilty for every wrong I've ever done and no sorry, no act, nothing is ever enough. 

No professional takes me seriously. I'm a high functioning, intelligent, social enough college student. I can't seem to express how the breaking point has long since come and gone. How I feel like I've been on borrowed time.

I can't help to wonder how it a life so consistently full of pain will be worth living.
