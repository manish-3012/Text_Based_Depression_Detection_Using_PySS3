Goodbye-- so soon? My O.C.D has been outta control-- it seems even a single touch or tap will contaminate everything with the words in my head--- "hey wanna enjoy that cereal? BLAM0 INFECTED WITH THE WORDS THAT A REPETITIVe? HAH"

im tired of being king midas in this world--its like the golden touch-- its horrible-- i recently lost a friend in a fight-- im really lonely so-- i sit alone at lunch sometimes-- but sometimes with another friend if they aren't sick and missing school playin' fortnight or overwatch (overwatch rules) but, i just got yelled at in a discord server-- i can never relax and in mi home one of the most safest place-- im constantly made fun of and pushed around by my dad and sometimes mum, my aid is hard on mii and makes life really hard-- i feel like life wouldnt be a pain for others to help with this, if i just went away. no more pain, my brother will not have to remember mii suffering--im so lonely i need someone-- i just wanna go away-- and thats what i might do tonight--
