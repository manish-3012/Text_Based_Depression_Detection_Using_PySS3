Killing myself soon (small post)My method is almost ready, I just need to finish the living will and kill myself. I will have everything done before this month ends.

I haven't done anything with my life and I am not planning to, but I am tired of being a burden to my family. I can't enjoy anything in life, may it be food, sexual pleasure, or entertaintment. I am useless and I would never get a job anyways due to schizophrenia, I have problems with my concentration, memory, and ability to understand concepts (80% of people with schizophrenia don't have a job). My brain is like the one of a 80 year old person even though I am 28.

I could spend a few more years wasting my time on the Internet but I am tired of doing that, I want to die AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I am not suffering in any way (emotionally or physically), it's just that I have decided I am going to kill myself no matter what, it's a matter of when. And now it's a good time.

I want to be released of this life and never exist again, I was born against my will. I am not sure why I post this because nothing will ever change my mind, I wish I could to my doctor and ask for a drug to die with instead of doing things this way but it's the only way I have.
