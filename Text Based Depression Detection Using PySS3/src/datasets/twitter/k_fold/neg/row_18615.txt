hearing how much i cost makes me hurt deeply.I'm coming to terms with the fact that my medical costs exceed my family's budget. I feel like such a burden. On everyone. Hearing that it'd be cheaper to cremate me than for me to get the dental procedures I need to be healthy hurt deeply. I've been suicidal for about 4 years now, but this is only fueling it. I feel as if I bring nothing to the table. Whenever I bring up medical problems I have, I get told off. I cant talk to my friends about it. I feel lost and hopeless. I just wish I didn't wake up this morning, or ever again. I want to just take a nap and never feel the pain of the real world again. In my dreams, I dont cost a dime. my friends are right beside me, and I get into the college I want without worrying about price. i want to cuddle with my pets and never feel fear or pain again.

im sorry if this is rambly, im in a lot of physical pain rn and im emotionally exhausted.
