Urgent Help My girlfriend is feeling suicidalI am going to make this short. I have been talking to my girlfriend since the last few hours, and this isn't the first time she has told that she is going to kill herself. Her family is going through a lot, since her mom is suffering from post Covid-19 mental breakdown issues and both her parents are in the hospital for the same. I live in India, and both my parents are totally disinterested in sending me to her house, and my dad recently had an war of words with hers, blaming her family and accusing them of spoiling me. 

At present, I tried to call her down via text, she doesn't want me to come to her house. She is alone with her grandmother, she tells she is going to kill herself lock all doors, and kill herself at the first moment she realises that I have come to her house. I don't know what to do. Please help me! I am begging you all
