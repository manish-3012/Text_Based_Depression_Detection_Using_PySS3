I want to, but my kid says he'll "go Columbine"Dealing with depression since age 21 and I'm 44 now. I'm just exhausted from it all. 

I am also the parent of a 15-year-old kid with depression struggles of his own. His father died several years ago, so it's just me.

One time my kid said, "If anything ever happened to you, I'd go Columbine."

So I guess nothing can happen to me. 

The brain weasels of my depression now feel even worse. I certainly can't cause a school massacre. So I'm stuck and I have to just get up and struggle through day after day after day with no relief.
