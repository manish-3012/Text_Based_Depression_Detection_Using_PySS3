Fucked by myselfHi I'm sorry for any language mistakes.

So let's start from the beginning.Im actually 18years old and I had my first girl at age 15,I was with her for 2.5year and then she cheated on me with friend from school,few days later she was with her best friend in relationship.It made me trust less to any other persons.I met a girl month after breakdown it was September last year,I don't know how but from start I knew that's she's decent for me even if all guys said shit about her I didn't trust them and figured out they lying about her for no reason.The thing is she has depression and borderline but I didn't give up.She was completely unemotional for whole time.We had argue at March and we didn't talk for 4month.For the whole time I was thinking about her but also I was mad so I talked shit about her with my friends,it pissed me that she's emotionless to me when i was trying my best to show how much she mean to me.But okay now our contact was so great for 2 months,she came to me for week and we talked 24/7 we didn't even sleep cuz we had so much to say to each other.I let her my Facebook account because she wanted to check few groups which I'm in and I trusted her that's all about,but he went to my messages with friends and found out about that flame from 4months break and everytime before when I was pissed about her emotionless.She said that I'm sick person and I'm honorless to her for writing that about her,I feel bad with what I did and I stopped writing shit like this for last 2 months but she doesnt trust me that I changed and closed our relationship forever.I feel like I'm personally ill or I have smth like border because I loved her and she was my biggest enemy in the same time,I'm scared to talk to anyone or meet any new people because I feel like I'm even more trust less than I was.Im also scared that I can hurt other people not in purpose.The worst part is that I feel like my life lost sense because I need someone to live for and she was best soulmate for me that I can ever met.I tried to leave my emotions on 4months breakdown but it didn't get out of me.Im really tired of life,I wouldn't be there at the moment If not family which i don't want to be sad for my death.Im thinking to drug myself to death very seriously but I can't get family out of head.Im losing my mind,the thing that she flamed me after all that I treated her only as a toy hurted more than everything else in my life.I didn't want anything wrong for persons I love but I did the biggest shit to her.Sorrry for that guys but I don't know what to do,I'm pointless,friendless and with suicide thoughts.I really want to be finally happy,I can't afford to paid for therapy and I'm also too afraid to talk to anyone about it,I mean I have only my parents because I don't have friends in school even.My mom is deeply depressed I can't make her feel worse because of me.God bless you guys,hope we meet on other side as fast as possible.
