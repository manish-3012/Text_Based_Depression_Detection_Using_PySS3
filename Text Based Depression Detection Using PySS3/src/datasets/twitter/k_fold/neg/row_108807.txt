DepressedSo lately Iâ€™ve been thinking about my past (I was abused) and everything and itâ€™s making me extremely depressed and of course suicidal and I canâ€™t get rid of this feeling no matter what, itâ€™s distracting me in school and I canâ€™t get the grades I need.

Iâ€™m also in a long distance relationship (before I get completely annihilated, I know itâ€™s not the best choice) and Iâ€™m really really clingy which I canâ€™t help because of where Iâ€™ve been abused Iâ€™m clingy to people who actually care and take the time out of their day to speak to me.

I sound so stupid oml
