Laying in bed right now, fighting insomnia, and honestly, I want to drink myself to sleep, but the gun I keep in my bedside table is closer..I really just don't even know where to start. Everything just seems so fucked up and hopeless right now.

I'm too much of a pussy to actually do it, but I feel that I've heard when people start thinking that, that's when they're most serious about doing it. Just...idk...putting it out there..
