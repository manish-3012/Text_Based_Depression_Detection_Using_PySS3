It's just hard....So I'm not going to write a 12 page essay or anything. To sum it up I found out two years ago now that I wasn't the biological father of my 6 year old daughter. Through everything in court I lost all my rights and haven't seen her in almost two years now. I've done antidepressants, therapy and any other to thing you can think of. Medication doesn't work for me. Being type 1 diabetic it messes to much with my eating, Xanax and weed keep me relatively sane. I have no doubts about how lucky I am, good family and friends who have supported me through it all. Still, I can't shake this feeling of complete and utter emptiness inside me. Everyone says it gets easier with time but honestly it's just gotten harder. I don't want to leave my house or make new friends or experience. I'm stuck on auto pilot and at this point I wouldn't mind just not waking up in the morning and being done with. Maybe this rant will help me, thanks for anyone who bothered to read it.
