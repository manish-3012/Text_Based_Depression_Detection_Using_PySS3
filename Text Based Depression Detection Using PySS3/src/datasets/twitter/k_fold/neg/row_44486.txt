I'm selfish, I'm useless, and I'm ruining their lives.I feel like I'm doing nothing but harming everyone I love just by existing. They have to spend all of their time taking care of me during my depressive phases, and I just don't want to inconvenience them anymore.

My dad's slowly gone through his whole life's savings to pay for my college. He gave me $17,000 for a graduation gift, and I was an idiot and spent it on frivolous shit (apartment, xbox, clothes) instead of saving it. I have one year left and he's out of money. I already took out a federal loan for last year ($7,500) and I've already had multiple anxiety attacks over repaying it. If I was a good person I'd just take out another loan, but I'm not a good person, so I didn't.

My fiance has offered to take a loan out in his name to pay for my college and build up his own credit. It's an incredibly selfless thing to do but it just makes me feel guilty. Every time somebody does something to help me, it just makes me feel guilty. The guilt's caused me physical pain, it's just too much.

Dad wasted all of his money so I could get a shitty psychology degree. I'll never get into grad school anyway, not with a 2.9 GPA. I wanted to be an addictions counselor one day, or to be a therapist, but it's not gonna happen, I can't even handle my own problems, I'm gonna be stuck in retail the rest of my life.

I don't contribute anything to society. I'm not a good person. I'm selfish and weak and sensitive and I'm not smart. I lost all my scholarships after the first semester. I don't have any friends. No one ever talks to me in class, no matter how hard I try, I've been trying for 21 years to make friends and I'm just not likeable.

I've cried every day this past month. All I do is make things worse for the people who, for whatever reason, like me. I can't handle it any more.
