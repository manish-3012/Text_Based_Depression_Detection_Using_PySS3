My friends are looking down on me and telling me to kill myselfOkay, so the title is probably making you wonder what kind of asshole "friends" I have.

Well, I should probably mention that I used to make jokes about depression and my suicidal tendencies in an attempt to deal with my problems, just the way /r/2meirl4meirl does it, for example. Turns out that that kind of humor works better on the internet than in real life though.

I'm not actually sure if my classmates were worried about me in the beginning but I know that they're just annoyed that I'm always down at this point.

The other day two of my classmates told me that I should just finally go and kill myself, if I'm really as unhappy as I am but that I probably won't do it anyways because I'm "too big of a pussy after all".

I get that they probably don't mean it. I don't want to make it sound like I'm being bullied. People like me and they were just goofing around but they honestly don't know what they're saying. I was legit considering it. I always am.

I stopped joking about depression. I stopped talking about not feeling too well or being down. I'll never talk about how I'm doing anymore. I'll always be "fine", because as soon as you tell someone that you're not really doing well, they just tell you that you should suck it up and stop being a wuss.

I hate this. I wish I never showed them that I'm not happy. I should have never tried to reach out by making stupid jokes about depression. Real life is not like the internet. You can't say the shit that you're able to say online. I'm such a fucking idiot.
