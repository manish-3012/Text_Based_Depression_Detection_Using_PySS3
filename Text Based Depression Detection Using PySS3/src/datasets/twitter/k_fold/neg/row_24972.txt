Iâ€™m not thinking about suicide in an impulsive way now. Its seems like the only logical option now.The last two months at uni have been living hell. Iâ€™ve grown to despise this place more and more every fucking day. Thereâ€™s not a single moment here that I donâ€™t think about home or just being somewhere else. Although this place has given me a great start in my field, I think that this wonâ€™t be of any use if Iâ€™m not alive anymore. I havenâ€™t slept well for the past 2 months whenever I was at uni, the moment I got home I would sleep like a baby.

Iâ€™ve tried to make my parents understand this problem and that I want to drop out, but they just donâ€™t understand and tell me weather the storm. I think thatâ€™s only possible if I can sleep at night. Iâ€™m desperate. I donâ€™t know what I will do if I drop out as the only option left would be to study abroad, and for that dad would have to sell some real estate. I really donâ€™t know what to do. Jumping off the fourt floor seems like the option convenient for everyone.
