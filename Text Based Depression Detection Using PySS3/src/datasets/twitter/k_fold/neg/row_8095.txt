â€œSome of you cared. None of you cared enough. . . and neither did I. Iâ€™m sorry.â€ - Hannah BakerI am going to kill myself tonight. 

Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll succeed, but if everything goes according to plan, Iâ€™ll be deprived of life and forever gone from this world come morning. Iâ€™m about to take the last shower Iâ€™ll ever probably take. After Iâ€™m dried and ready, Iâ€™ll start playing my [suicide playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/62tfrsSAGb91Gds2JL9sV1?si=M_9IkeV2TzCJSOZ6DW9EfQ) and begin the final step towards my long-awaited death. When pills are taken and razor blades used, Iâ€™ll lie back, under my covers, listening to the last words and songs Iâ€™ll ever hear until I fall asleep from the pills or bleed out. I wonâ€™t be waking up tomorrow. 

No oneâ€™s going to read this, but I itâ€™s more of closure for me rather than reaching out to others. (Ha, this is a great representation of my life. The way people will ignore this post is the same way I was received when I was alive: alone and never given a second thought). I gave up a long time ago. My life for the past four years has been nothing but a continuous descent into depression, self-loathing, and a bunch of other stuff thatâ€™s made me suicidal. I kept delaying my suicide, but I just gave up today thanks to an argument with my mom that made me realize pushing the date isnâ€™t doing sh-t. Nothings going to get better and if it does, well. . . maybe things shouldâ€™ve gotten better sooner. **If anyone is reading this, I hope you get better because lord knows I sure didnâ€™t.**
