Lost for yearsHow am I supposed to do this. I stumbled across my ex profile and went through her pictures. I miss her and it's been about 4 years ish since we broke up. Shes living life right now. She's doing all kinds of shit. I know people say well you only show what you want to show, but it looks like there's so much more out there . I feel like shit. I don't do anything. Im a fat neet who sits home all day. No school or anything. I've been contemplating suicide for years now. But I don't know how to convince myself that my family will be okay. They put up with my neet shit and to off myself would be a giant fuck you. I don't know anymore . I have no friends or anything. Just music and Vidya. Even then they are degrading as time goes.
