tonight. they leave in an hour and then iâ€™m jumping off the bridge into the rocks and water.iâ€™m going to kill myself. what else is left to say. 
they wonâ€™t be back until 7 am tomorrow. 
itâ€™s that simple. 
iâ€™ll be dead. 
theyâ€™d rather see a dead child than who their child truly is.
their love is unconditional. 
really, iâ€™m sparing them.
they donâ€™t have to feel ashamed and disgusted at the fact that their kid is trans and bi. 
they never have to find out now. 
no note needed. that way they never have to know. 

they hate people like me. so... itâ€™s not like theyâ€™d care if i was dead if they knew. might as well preserve the memory of me they have even if that is their ugly, depressed, piece of shit daughter. 

theyâ€™d prefer the empty me to the real
me. 

theyâ€™d never want a freak. 

just another burden for them. another story theyâ€™d neglect to tell.
