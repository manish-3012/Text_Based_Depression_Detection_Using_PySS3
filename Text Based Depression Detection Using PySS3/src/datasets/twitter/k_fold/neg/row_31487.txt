Why should I keep going?I'm 17. I have been having these thoughts for years now.

A little back story: I had to move 100's of miles when I was 12, Essentially ruining all of my friendships. I stayed at this new place for a few years, ended up making a couple of aquentences, but no real friends untill my sophomore year in HS. I made two great friends. The best friends I've had. End of the year, I have to move again. Lose touch with one of them. The other I occasionally skype and play video games with but I could never tell him what I'm feeling. I'm the guy who was the crutch to everyone else. I can't have these kind of feelings. I have absolutely no friends at my new school. I sit alone at lunch and then go to the library for the remaining time. My grades are absolute shit. There's no way I could get into any respectable college. Maybe community if I'm lucky. 

And on top of all of this, I have a brain tumor that is sucking my parents dry trying to keep me alive. I have to have a surgery every few months and everytime they shoot me up with anesthesia I find myself praying that something goes wrong and I don't wake up. At least that way I go through with it. I keep reading about these assisted suicides but you have to be in pain for them to do anything. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I keep telling myself that there is no way that I'll live through HS. I only have my senior year left now. I get closer and closer every night. 

I can't think of anyone who wouldn't be better off with out me. My parents wouldn't have to keep going into debt to keep me alive, or fight with me over everything (grades, responsibility, etc.) I have no friends, my teachers would be glad not to have to put up with me anymore. 

I have some rope and some DIY skills to make sure the sucker stays in the ceiling. Or maybe I'll just take a bus 100 miles to the middle of nowhere and kill myself there. I just needed to let this out. Thanks for reading.
