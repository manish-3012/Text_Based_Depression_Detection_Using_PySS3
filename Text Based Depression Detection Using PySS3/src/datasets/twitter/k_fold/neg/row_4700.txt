Tried to call a crisis hotline for the first timeThere was no text option available in my country and the international ones that did couldnâ€™t answer because yknow I wasnâ€™t from there... I almost laughed when I noticed I had spent more than an hour looking for an available service

I had written a long angry rant here but it just wasnâ€™t worth it... it was just me spewing my bile

Basically, Iâ€™ve been feeling really suicidal after recovering from that for a while, I used to think about everyday then I stopped and Iâ€™m back again 

Every fear I had about what would become of me is coming to fruition... I said I would end things when that was the case as I thought everyone would have given up on me by that point, I think Iâ€™m getting there

My untreated depression (which Iâ€™m probably faking) has been getting worse (I have mind fog everyday, canâ€™t feel much, reconsider self harm, canâ€™t keep up with anything, negative self talk daily, barely take care of myself, etc.). My gender dysphoria is also getting worse, Iâ€™m afraid that it will impair me at some point. 

Basically, Iâ€™m becoming a burden, a lazy fuck that canâ€™t do anything right and a waste of resources such as time, money and space. I canâ€™t keep up with school anymore even if I donâ€™t have any reason for that to be the case as I have every tool to succeed. I donâ€™t deserve anything I have, not the roof over my head, the food, the school, family or love I have... the world would better without me or at least my family, I hope someday they understand that

I feel no control over my life or body which is just something that crushes me sometimes. I donâ€™t think shit will ever better I see no future for myself where Iâ€™m not barely getting by. I have no hope in anything 

I wonâ€™t kill or hurt myself only because I understand that my existence and body arenâ€™t only mine, I feel too much guilt even just feeling like this

I think everything went to shit when my parents found out I relapsed again... I thought shit would be better and I was gonna get help but opening up in general has only brought so much trouble and it has hurt so many already. It wasnâ€™t good for anyone, and has only made me feel more and more guilty over existing

I hope I had killed myself when I still was perceived as good, when I still had the grades, when I was still their little girl and not the monster who consumed her even if I wasnâ€™t feeling my greates eithe because me and my reality donâ€™t matter, it only matters what others perceive only that

Iâ€™ve been rotting and things ave only gotten worse once theyâ€™ve noticed

Iâ€™m a burden, Iâ€™m garbage, I shouldnâ€™t exist, I waste everyoneâ€™s time and money, I hurt everyone who loves me, bad kids donâ€™t deserve love, I donâ€™t deserve anyoneâ€™s love, I donâ€™t have a place in this world, Iâ€™m ungrateful, nothing can be fixed

Iâ€™ll stop now or this will become word salad...
