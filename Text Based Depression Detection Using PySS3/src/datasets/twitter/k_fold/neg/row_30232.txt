i tried to commit suicide today 3 yrs agowell its the 6th now bc its past midnight but it was on the 5th. and i had my stomach pumped, while my dad and 2 nurses held me down on an uncomfortable hospital cot. 

afterwards i had vomit everywhere, my hair my shirt my face and my mom was trying to change my shirt bc i was still super out of it.
while my shirt was being changed this raggedy old guy just stood by my bed and watched me (there were no rooms, just one large room w lots n lots of beds - so no privacy).
i felt so disgusting through and through.

so now it feels weird to be here and not there. since those 3 years my mom died and im not over it. i feel stifled and hindered and i see all my high school friends flourish and grow and love and be loved by their parents whereas i remember my last interaction w my mom was hostile. 

when i was 14/15 i thought god was going to kill me himself bc i wasnt meant to be here. like by the time id be 25 id be gone. i still have a few years to go but i feel ive hit my midlife (crisis. several crises. ) mark. i know ill do it i just dont know when.
 
i do sound somber and all that garbage but rly i just want to sleep.
