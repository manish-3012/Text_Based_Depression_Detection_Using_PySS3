i wish i knew.i wish i knew how to explain myself. but that's just mental illness summed up isn't it, it changes, so just as you tackle it, it's suddenly something else. another problem. another issue. and maybe i'm tired of tackling them. 

i just got home from a night out, with 2 friends of mine. i watched my favourite poet. i laughed. i was happy. i was unhappy. i watched my 2 friends make out. i watched them leave me. i watched them come back. i was happy. then unhappy. why am i like this?

i watched as my old friendship group, the one that abandoned me plaster picture after picture of their night out just to torture me. im on a night out myself. why do i feel so fucking dead inside? why should it matter? shouldn't i be grateful these 2 are here to support me, that people actually want to go out with me places?

i want to fucking die. i want to fucking end this fucking pain. because depression can't live without you, it is smaller than you, and you can live without it. but depression is my constant. and i don't think i could live without it. but nor can i with it. 

goodbye.
