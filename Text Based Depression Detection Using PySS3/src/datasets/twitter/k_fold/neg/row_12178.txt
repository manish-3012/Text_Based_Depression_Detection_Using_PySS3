i cant do it anymoreim 19, hyper-sensitive 
and i've been trying to get out of this madness but i cant
i had a shitty childhood and i left the girl of my love and she seems like she's over me. i thought i'll be fine but i am not, its been 3 weeks of upside-downs....in this 3 weeks i never thought of suidide, but i cant keep it ... im gonna jump under the train, but will it hurt? i doesnt really care, im just too fucking sensitive for the 99% of people and i am sorry but it hurts me so much...i cant even cry, in fact i coudlnt cry in the past 5 years...if there would be an other choice ...but there's not...
i dont want to sound miserable...but i am ... i cant sleep for months, im never happy im like  a walking shit waiting for death...
would jumping under a train cause instant death? 
this world is so fucking unreal i just want it to end
