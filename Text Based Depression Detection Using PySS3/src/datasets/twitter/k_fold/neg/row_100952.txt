I am so tired. So very, VERY tired.I will probably be dead by my next birthday. Which is in November. I'm sick of stealing oxygen from people who would use it much better than I do. 

I am about to move the vertical length of the country, to a state I despise, to do a job I hate, for a company that treats me like garbage, because it's my least horrible option in a long list of horrible options. 

My birthday seems like a suitable and appropos time. I will be hundreds of miles away from everyone I know, so the cleanup won't be a problem the landlord will just hose my brain matter off the walls of the tub and sell the apartment to someone else. I'll go down the drain. There's a metaphor there.
