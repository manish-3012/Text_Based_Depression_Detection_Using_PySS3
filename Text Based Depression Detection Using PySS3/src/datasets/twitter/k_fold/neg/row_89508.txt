If someone doesnâ€™t have friends or family should they go or stay?Iâ€™m just thinking out loud here about 

Since I am bankrupt of friends, absent of family and free from offspring does one serve any warranted purpose in continuing to face every forthcoming sunrise or should the appropriate course of action in such circumstance be to face up to and be released by the darkness on the other side?

I guess the older I get the more I see it as a bit of a repetitive, pointless exercise in boredom to see out each fresh battle between the sun and the moon when it, as it pertains to my observation, is really a bit of a waste of time. 

I guess what I mean is that in a way I have no strings attached to my soul and no commitments to another being so thereâ€™s a freedom of choice unavailable to those who fall in to the category of the aforementioned human social interactions.
