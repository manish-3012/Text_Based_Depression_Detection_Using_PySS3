don't really know what to do anymoreFor most of my life I've experienced some form of anxiety, depression, or mood instability. Bipolar is prevalent on both sides of my family as well as psychotic, occasionally violent, tendencies. I've lost hope for myself. I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I can't imagine my dad at my funeral. I couldn't betray him like that. Often I feel like I'm only alive so I don't further disappoint or dishonor my family. The past few years have been fairly difficult. Lost several close friends in sudden tragedies. I've lost some of the most illuminating and beautiful people in my short life. I suffer from unsightly skin conditions and have frequent heart pain from valve defects which have already hospitalized me twice and severely reduced my energy to live. The past six or seven years have just felt like one long roller coaster where the peaks get shorter and the hills get taller. In short, I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. It feels like I've finally lost the battle and I will succumb to my depression and anxieties. Help.
