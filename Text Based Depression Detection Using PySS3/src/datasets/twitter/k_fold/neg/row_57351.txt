My friend says he wants to kill himself.So, I have this friend who I have never really met. But we live only about 2 hours away from each other. 

I'm scared. He will often talk to me about how he wants to end his own life. I always try my best to comfort him, but I'm scared I'll say the wrong thing, and he'll end up actually killing himself.

He will often tell me how I'm his only friend. He can sometimes be a little rude, and say offensive things without even realizing it. He's a nice friend, but can sometimes be a jerk. I often feel like I only talk to him now because he needs me. When he's not being a jerk, he is a really nice friend who has some common interests.



What I'm trying to say here, is I'm scared that one day he'll actually end up commiting suicide. I don't know how I would feel if he ever did. Especially if I wasn't able to prevent it. Or if I was one of the reasons myself because I said the wrong thing. Its not easy for me to talk yo him all the time since I have some problems of my own.
