Does it ever truly "get better" I have been dealing with thoughts of suicide for a long time now. And i know it's standard to tell someone like me that "it's gonna get better" or that "everything has a way of working itself out in the end" but i just don't see it anymore. So i just wanna hear it from another person dealing with what im dealing with. Does it actually get better or am i just holding on to nothing. Any advise helps.
