I'm going to kill myself, I just don't know how or when, but I'm going to do it.Last September I tried to kill myself because I couldn't handle my PTSD which at the time I didn't know I had.  I was hospitalized five times in four months, and then stuff seemed to be getting better.  The thoughts never really went away though.  The beginning of this month was the anniversary of the trauma, and I've been spiralling since.  I blame myself that I didn't stop it, and I feel like I deserved it because bad things don't happen to good people.  I genuinely feel like I don't deserve to live and I'm in too much psychological pain to function.  When I tell my therapist, I'll probably get sent back to the hospital.  I used to hate the idea but now I just don't care.  I told my boyfriend this and he wants me to remember that I have at least one reason not to do it but I don't care how many reasons I have not to, the pain and the fact that I deserve it is enough reason to do it.
