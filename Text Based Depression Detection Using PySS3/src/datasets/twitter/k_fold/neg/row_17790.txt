I need to do it todayI have tried treatments for so long and nothing can get through. Only have a couple of hours of appointments left. Medication does nothing. Can't find life changes because everything has prerequisites to do and I'm stymied by my condition. Trapped in a hell like routine every day. Have absolutely nothing to contribute or nothing to do. My resources here are limited owing to how trapped I am, but I think there's some electrocution or suffocation methods I can try. Cannot do this anymore, tried so much and it will be a complete net benefit when I'm gone
