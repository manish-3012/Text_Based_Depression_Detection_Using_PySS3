I cut my self for the first time todayEvery problem that happens to me, makes me want to cut myself. I had bought a pack of razors a while ago to cut myself but never really did a deep cut before. I hadn't touched them for a while, but today again stuff happened and made me try the razors. I did my first deep cut today. It was deep enough to bleed for a while. I am weirdly happy that I am closer to being able to cut really hard so I can end my life.

I wish it was just the things that happened that made me want to cut myself. But the new stuff that happen are small... But remind me of all the shit stuff that is happening to me. Normally I just try not to think about them but it's just hard sometimes.

I feel like I have no family or friends who I can trust. Almost everyone has done some damaging stuff to me or back stabbed me. I literally have 1 real friend that I completely trust but he doesn't even know I'm going through such a terrible path. Sorry, I know no one cares. These just help me get some stuff "out" without actually doing it.
