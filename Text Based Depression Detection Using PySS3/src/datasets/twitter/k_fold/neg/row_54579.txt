.I cried myself to sleep for the first time in a while and alot of people would say that's bad but it honestly felt good I havent been able to have a good cry in a while so it felt nice to kinda let it out BUT it did follow in a quite disturbing dream I was standing in the living room eating poptarts and for some reason there were blended body parts everywhere it wasn't human body parts it was some kind of animal and then I got a stomach ache and walked to the bathroom and while I was in the bathroom I heard this scream coming from somewhere I couldn't tell what the noise was coming from but I just stood there standing in the bathroom in somewhat of a panic trying to stay quiet and then I woke up and what i thought was strange was i woke up with a stomach ache idk the dream didnt scare me it was just disturbing and this is the first dream I've had in a while
