Iâ€™m just tiredI donâ€™t think I can keep up with anything anymore. I just donâ€™t see any benefits for living. I thought if I found love it would fulfill one missing aspect in my life but it didnâ€™t and now I still want to die but now I know thereâ€™s one more person Iâ€™m hurting. I just feel so behind in my education and career. I donâ€™t even want to make it Christmas.
