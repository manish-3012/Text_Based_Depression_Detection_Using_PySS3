I'm not in any immediate dangerBut on a scale of how likely I am to kill myself in the near future I've moved from a 5 to a 7. Background: I am bipolar 1, medicated, married, kids, good job. On paper nothing to complain about. But I have had strong suicidal urges for at least the last decade.

A year ago I decided on a method and got the things I need. In the last month I have a) sorted some logistics and b) started to clear admin. I have also been having incredibly violent fantasies (like stabbing myself, jumping etc), which is a departure from my relatively tranquil initial plan.

I see a therapist and a psychiatrist but I am scared to fully fess up for fear of getting sectioned. I'll die before being hospitalised.
