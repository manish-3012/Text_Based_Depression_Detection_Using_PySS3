pretty sure someone i follow online is within hours of killing herself.A trans lady I follow on the west coast posted a very sad thing on Instagram saying she'd never been so hurt or set aside. Not sure what happened. Later the post was deleted and replaced by a note saying "I'm removing myself from all media." Subsequent comments talked about death. Obvious post on Tumblr referencing overdosing on Rx medication.

I don't know this person at all. What should I do??
