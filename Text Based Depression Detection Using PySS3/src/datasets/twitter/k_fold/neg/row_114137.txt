this is so stupidI don;t enjoy myself, I'm depressed, I;'m lonely, I'm full of regret, I'm a hopeless romantic, I hate who I am, I don't know how to talk tp people, I don't know how to funciton like a normal human being, I'm scared to try new things, I'm afraid to put myself out there, I just stay in this invisible cycle of being drunk / at ease.

what's the point anymore if it'll just be this forever? i might as well just put a bullet through my skull and paint the wall a beautiful red mural
