putting a date on it has really made me feel betterNYE of 2016 I decied that i would end my life on jan1 2019 if my life and depression has not gotten any better. I dont know why but the closer i get to the date the less down i feel. Knowing that there is and out for me from my depression really helps me get thru my days.
