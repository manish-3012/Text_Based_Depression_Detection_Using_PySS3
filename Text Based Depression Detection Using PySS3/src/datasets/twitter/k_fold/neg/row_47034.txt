the reason why I'm still livingSorry if this text is not very grammatically correct because I don't speak really good English. But I want to tell my story. So I live in a family full with issues. I think each family has their own issues but not that big like mine. So my parents are divorced. My stepmother hates me (long story)but she thinks I stole something from here but actually it was my brother. But that's not the reason why I'm kinda depressed. When I was 11 my brother started hitting me. He thought that was funny. It only came worse. He started hitting me really hard and I could not do something about it because he was 16 and much stronger than me. I also told my mom about it but she just said that he needs to stop but he never did. When I was 14 he started doing drugs. Cannabis and pills. That's the reason why my parents always argue and sometimes really bad. My stepdad drinks then a lot of alcohol and comes drunk home. The police has been a few times in my house. I don't know if I want to continue talking about this. Sorry. I have already cut myself many times in my arm. I only talk about all this with one friend. She is maybe the only reason why I haven't killed myself. I think a lot about suicide. That seems to be the only escape from this situation.
