Help?My best friend is getting really worried about me and wants me to see a dr. They'll probably try to send me to therapy again (which didn't work the first two times and the only person I can open up to is said friend or her sister) or get me on pills (which I don't trust myself with because I know I'll just use them to overdose along with some other pills sitting in my medicine cabinet) so I don't know of any other options there. I could go in and see the dr and try to figure something out but I don't want to go and have them say I need to be put in the hospital because of my self harm and suicidal thoughts. 
Tldr: best friend worried and wants me to get help but scared of being put in hospital
