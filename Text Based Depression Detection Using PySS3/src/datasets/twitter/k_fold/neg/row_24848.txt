A cry for helpWill this ever end 
I canâ€™t get all my memories out of my head 
My thoughts come and take over my body 
I feel frozen and my brain convinces me that following an urge will bring me closer to my â€œgoalâ€ even though logically I know itâ€™s not in that moment the urge tricks my logic and that becomes the new truth 

I did my urge 2 days in a row 
2 years almost later Iâ€™m still so hurt over an ex.
I hate myself I hate myself 
I wanna just jump off a building and finish everything 
Iâ€™m in pain because Iâ€™m a broken person 
I wanna be numb 
Iâ€™m so alone right now I hate myself I hate seeing myself I hate everything about me all I ever wanted was to be accepted feel normal not be alone
