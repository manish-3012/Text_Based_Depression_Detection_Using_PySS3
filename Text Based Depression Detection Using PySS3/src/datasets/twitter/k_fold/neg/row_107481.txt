I can't effing take it anymore!!! 22 year old schizophrenic with panic disorder, please help me.Ive posted here before and its helped but im not sure i can get through it this time. I cant work, i know ill never BE able to work, so what the hell do i do? I'm just waiting til something gets better but every day it gets worse and WORSE! The only thing i can do is write (not trying to write properly now, having a breakdown). Unfortunately, there are thousands of writers who never sell a single book, so whats the point of spending hundreds of hours pouring my heart out and never selling more than 10 copy's.
