Help me pleasei can't stop crying, i feel so worthless and stupid and hopeless, i don't know what the fuck to do. i HATE myself so fucking much because it's always about me me me and i lie to myself and everyone and i have conflicting thoughts about everything and i screw everything up (i'm not exaggerating). i don't want to screw up anymore, i just want to die, i don't think there's anything wrong with suicide, why can't i just fucking die. i'm scared as fuck to screw things up again. i'm in a really bad place right now. i've tried committing suicide before, once on this new year and my classmate saved me (wish he hadn't i was drunk anyways) and second on 16th march, left a suicide note to someone who i'm sure read it but ignored it. i don't have enough energy to continue on, i don't see the purpose, why did i even have to be born. fuck this. i'm atheist btw so no offence but all that - "you're here for a reason" and "let jesus in you" stuff won't make a difference. i'm 15 yo boy.
