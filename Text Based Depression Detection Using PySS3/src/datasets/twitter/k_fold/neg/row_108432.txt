I've worn my support system thin.Family was never something that much soothed me to begin with, but my friends, hobbies, leisure both active and passive, and even my pets have done nothing but wear me down for the past few weeks. I imagine the feeling is becoming mutual at this point.

I sorta saw this coming in advance. It was a slow descent over the past two years, and I clued in on it half-way through. I've never been *sunny,* per se, considering I have a few attempts under my belt already, but I haven't fallen this hard in my life. Since I'm short all of the tools I'd normally fall back on, I've degraded to my old, autistic and frenzied childhood self; reclusive, cruel, fit-throwing and self-mutilating. Turns out the little retard who stimmed by beating his head against objects, who sabotaged himself at every corner, who *starved* himself in disgust at the person he was, would end up being pretty fucked up. And he's alive and well at the helm of my brain.

Acting like this, as a grown adult is disgusting in shameful. I used to feel that I was better than this, but knowing that I never really got over the obstacle that is myself is just downright *crushing.* My childhood nightmare- myself- came true, and I'm helpless to stop it. Helpless, abandoned and, secretly, hopeful that will be the one that finally does me in.

And at the very least, if I never find the courage to put myself down on my own terms, my 40-year life expectancy will rear its sweet, rotting head soon enough.
