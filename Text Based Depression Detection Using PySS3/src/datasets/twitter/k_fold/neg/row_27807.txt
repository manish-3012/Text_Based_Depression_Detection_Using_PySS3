It's not worth itI'm transgender. Feels weird to say that now, but there it is. And I can do nothing about it. I can't do anything anymore. I can't go shopping, I can't go to school, on a date, or anywhere without having a panic attack and crying. I can't have a single conversation about anything because the minute anything gender-related comes up I know I'm on the wrong side of it. I'm sick of waking up to a disgusting body that isn't my own. I can't even look in the mirror or take a shower without having to take a period to breathe. The worst part is that I can't transition. My features are too exaggerated-shoulders, feet and the like- and my voice is too deep for me to ever pass for a woman. I'd always just be some gross man in a dress, probably selling myself on the street because no one would hire a fucking tranny. I can't cross-dress for the same reason. Every day I think about dying, usually at the worst of times. I keep trying to distract myself with movies, video games, and my girlfriend(who just makes it worse most of the time, though through no fault of her own), but in the end I always come back to the idea of ending it. I can't keep living as a man. This isn't a life worth living. I just want out of this prison. And maybe try my chances at the afterlife.
