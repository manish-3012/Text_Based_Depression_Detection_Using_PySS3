Hospitals aren't helpful anymoreI actually have people who care about me but that only makes this harder.

They say it's a selfish act. But I'm tired guys.  I'm recovering from a stroke and have bipolar and my emotions are often off or going to the wrong person or item.

I've been very open about how suicidal I am but a friend asked me to wait until tomorrow to go to an ER because they supposedly have the solution. So. I can humor them.

Hospitals no longer help me. They just isolate me from my friends and family which is what I need. Just keep me away from the sharp stuff and meds. But no. They take everything and isolate you. Usually in an ER first for 12 hours. 

Anyway...just need to get through tomorrow then admit myself.
