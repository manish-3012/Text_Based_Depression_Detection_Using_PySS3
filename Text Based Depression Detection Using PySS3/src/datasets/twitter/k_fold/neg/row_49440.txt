I just wrote a suicide note and tried to hang myself.My heart aches, literaly. It's so uncomfortable to feel something like this, both emotionally and physically. I just don't want to be back at that phase where I just have to live every day feeling this exact same thing, without knowing when it's gonna stop. 

I was doing fine, but the smallest situation just brought me back to a point where I just can't stand being alive. It hurts, and I don't know what to do, or where to run. 

I wrote a note to my family, because I wanted to be clear, that the only one to blame about the situation was me, and not them. I was ready to hang myself, but then, two people texted me, out of nowhere. One was a friend that decided to go MIA for like a week, without telling anyone. The other one was the reason why I'm heartbroken right now. I took it as a sign, and I decided not to do it for now. I still have that ugly sensation.
