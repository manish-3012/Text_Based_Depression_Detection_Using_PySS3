In a never-ending loop of not caring at all, and caring too much.It's very hard to make commitments and goals when I'm either very passionate about trying to improve my situation, or lacking any form of emotion, thoughts and drive. Most of my days and nights are spent as a dull blur of emptiness, except for the stab of pain every few minutes, as if my brain wont let me forget the things buried.
