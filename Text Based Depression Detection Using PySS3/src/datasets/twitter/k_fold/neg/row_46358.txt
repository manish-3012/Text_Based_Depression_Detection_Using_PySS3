First time poster; contemplated several timesHey; I figured that I'd post here before I turn to an irreversible action.


I've been on the brink of taking my life several times now; and it has all stemmed from an extended period of self-hatred and the hatred for living a life I can't find enjoy myself in; or at least for extended periods of time. The previous day I spoke to my university support group as I'm failing the year and I don't even think the work that I've submitted will be good enough to not put me back in to the first year - however I'm more afraid of being kicked out entirely. I see myself as a disappointment to those around me and the horrible traits I have myself certainly rub people the wrong way too.


For now; I have time away from 'real life' and I can play bar sports, take drugs and smoke with my close circle of friends which is the only real feeling I enjoy and I suppose, what keeps me going. I know it won't last forever; but in my eyes I'm the kid they hang around with because I barely align with the common interests of each of them. They're all better than me; smarter, well off, popular etc. I'm if anything unsure as to how - if at all - I could/should go about telling them that I may take my life (one has prevented me before now).


The next few weeks I see as my judgement day; whether I'll be grinding out a bit more of my life by restarting the university year or six feet under. Only time will tell.
