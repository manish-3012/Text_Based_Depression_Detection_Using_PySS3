Feel completely hollowHey everyone, 

I don't know if this is the right place for this post, but I don't know what else to do with it. For as long as I can remember, I've only felt extreme joy, or extreme anger or nothing at all. I've had people sobbing all around me at a friend's funeral, but I didn't feel anything, I was looking at the other tombstones wondering who they had been. 

Objectively, death is a natural state that we all visit eventually. I have no strong opinion about living or dying. I've traveled, partied, made friends, etc. I've "lived" according to society. I just see death coming and shrug. It's gonna happen, and I'm pretty tired of this world already (25), why delay the inevitable? Not even in a morbid way, just a meh way. Tired.
