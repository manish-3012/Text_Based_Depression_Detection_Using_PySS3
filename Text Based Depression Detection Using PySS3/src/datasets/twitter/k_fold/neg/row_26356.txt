I wanna help someoneIâ€™m at a point where Iâ€™m no longer constantly suicide. Itâ€™s like an old life. I want to help others but Iâ€™m scared of coming off as invalidating or pushy with suggestions. I have found that things for me didnâ€™t change until I found momentum and I truly believe that different modalities and therapies can change lives. TMS therapy, massage therapy to help the nervous system decompress and start to behave as needed to feel joy, finding hobbies I like, finding exercise I enjoy, finding my passion (massage therapy) etc etc. 

I remember what it feels like for people to give me this advise when I couldnâ€™t even shower or get out of bed. I also believe that we store our feelings in our bodies and that thereâ€™s a spiritual aspect; hence why medication and talk therapy doesnâ€™t always help. 

How can I help people and encourage little baby steps without coming off as I donâ€™t know what someone is going through?
