Can I die?Yeah this is going to be pretty long but all I want to know is, can I die yet? Really this life is a burden, no one likes me  I have no friends, and I just regret going this long. I should've done it years ago, no one will care or would've cared that I went missing and turn up dead. I honestly want to die, I've told people and they said either, get over it or too bad, your not allowed, and I'm just over it. Like I live I pretty ok life, better then many people, but I still want to die. God I cant believe I actually decided to try here, but then again seeing all the support for others here I thought I might try at least once. I dont really expect much here, at least for me.
