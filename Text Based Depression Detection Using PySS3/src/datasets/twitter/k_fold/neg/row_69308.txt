please help me calm downthe title.
I'll be doing my English oral exam tomorrow. I'll be first. I just got home today from my boyfriend. I don't have a formal skirt or bottom to wear other than my jeans. I was supposed to receive money today but it's not arriving so i can't buy it today and since it starts in the morning i can't buy it tomorrow either.
i should have bought it earlier but I'm a student so didn't have enough money. 
my english teacher (who i hate) is gonna kill me.
I'm incredibly anxious and thinking about jumping in front of a train just so i wouldn't embarrass myself tomorrow
