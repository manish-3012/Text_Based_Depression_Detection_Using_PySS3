If you have all the money in the world, would you still consider suicide?I developed a very  rare form of  neurological illness( ringing in the brain, distorted vision, headaches)  that is deemed incurable after taking  heart burn pills that was too strong for me, and this all happened to me during my studies in the UK. It is not like cancer, but it is an illness that will permanently stay with you and may even get worse as you get older.  Every single doctor that Iâ€™ve went to have no clue as to what has happened to me and told me to live with it... Iâ€™ve also been to psychologists who more or less tell me the same rubbish that i expected and prescribe me meds which I refused due to my bad experience with pills and drugs.  As such, my quality of life has been severely affected and it has led me into a deep dark hole filled with depressed thoughts every single day. It got to the point where I told myself I would die in the next two or three years.....

However, I come from a very rich background, my uncle is an owner of a listed company in Singapore and money was never an issue. I lived in big mansions, drive the latest Mercedes models  and travel whenever I like. I recently graduated and do not need to worry about getting a job as I can just slip into my uncles company , but because of my health issues Iâ€™m really finding it tough to live a normal life. 

If you are in my shoes, what is your decision? To live life to the fullest(Canâ€™t see how Iâ€™m going to enjoy life with such shitty health at the age of 21) or just Suicide?  What would you do if it were you?
