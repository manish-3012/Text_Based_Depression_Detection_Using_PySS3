It's on my mind constantlyIt's plagued me. I want to die so badly. Every moment, I think of ways to kill myself efficiently. I think of death so often. I don't know if I can do this anymore. I can't fucking do it. It plagues the way I think and feel. It takes everything away from me. Depression is eating me alive. I don't even know who or what I am anymore. I am nobody, in the guise of what I look like.
