An accidentally long ventThis is just a vent (?) because itâ€™s 3am and Iâ€™m just overthinking things. 

Iâ€™ve just realised how slightly fucked up it is that I attempted suicide at school when I was 13/14 (Iâ€™m 17 now) and how everyone, including me and my family, just brushed over it so quickly. I used to self harm for other peoples entertainment- cutting my wrists and burning my arms. I know it wasnâ€™t really a big deal compared to what other people do and go through but I find it weird how it was all dismissed so quickly, by myself too. 

Was that not a very obvious cry for help or some shit?? 

The worst part is that my friend reported me out of boredom and the sake of â€œseeing what the school would doâ€. I thought I had long forgiven her for this but maybe I havenâ€™t?? We were so young and I know we all know better now. Iâ€™d say that I and the friends involved wouldâ€™ve done shit a lot differently now but the worst part is that I still have to listen to jokes about what I did to this day. Like, you werenâ€™t there for me AT ALL when I very obviously needed it but now youâ€™re reaching to joke about it???
Obviously, I shouldnâ€™t have let them but Iâ€™ve recently cut them all out anyways (for other reasons).  

Now, I just wish I worked through whatever was wrong with me because I think the lack of closure(?) haunts me to this day. Talking about it somewhere, even online, wouldâ€™ve been better than doing nothing and just acting perfectly fine until family and whatnot stopped bugging me. The problem is that Iâ€™ve practically completely forgotten everything that happened and why I did what I did. I just know that I havenâ€™t changed much and still feel the way I did then. 

Whenever my house is really quiet and all I can hear is the clock ticking, it quite vividly takes me back to sitting on that bed- where I swayed my head and legs to the beat and my finger tapped along. I concentrated really hard on the clock to drown out the conversation about me and get through the situation I put myself in as quick as possible. 
I feel like, since then, Iâ€™ve mentally tapped out. I was so focused on making things go back to normal that I may have drowned myself and any sort of genuine emotion or thought out. In short, Iâ€™m stuck on autopilot. It feels like Iâ€™m a little ghost watching whoever my body is go through each day.

Iâ€™m not asking for anything here, I guess I just wanted to share this somewhere.
