I left my emotionally abusive boyfriend, but I realized that it isn't going to reverse the damage. Hello, reddit. I'm 21 years old and I'm a junior in college. I met Jon* our freshman year. We started out as friends and our relationship progressed from there. Fast forward to today, we live together and over the past few months he has become more and more hostile. It started out with him picking fights on purpose, over little things. He would always point out every single tiny thing that I do wrong, calling me useless, lazy, and spewing vile comments about my physical appearance, about how I never listen to him; that I don't care; that I'm weak and can't handle anything on my own. Today, he actually told me that he felt that his cheating ex girlfriend loved him more than I do. I've never felt more hurt and insulted in my whole life. I left him, and for the time being I am staying at my parents house. But I can't shake off the dark thoughts that have started plaguing me ever since. He's put these ideas in my head, that I'll never be good enough for any man. I haven't thought about ending my life in a very long time. I loved him so much, and I still do. Maybe he's right, I really can't deal with this. Please, help me.
