Off my chest.I've been depressed and suicidal since I was 8 years old. I've had to drop out of school because it's made my depression and suicidal thoughts even worse and more frequent, but I haven't told my family, who I still live with, that I just dropped out. I'm so tired of hurting others, being a compete failure my entire life, and feeling depressed every day so I've told myself that once I finish cleaning my room, it's very messy, and the areas of the house with my thing, so my family doesn't really have to worry about cleaning up a huge mess, I'm going to kill myself once and for all. I don't have any true friends past the three I met on reddit but I don't want them to know that I will be gone sooner than they expect, which is why I created this new account. I feel bad for not telling them, but I don't want them to worry about me. I will tell them just before I do take my life that they were the best friends anyone could ever have. I'm sorry I just needed to get this off my chest. Have a good night.
