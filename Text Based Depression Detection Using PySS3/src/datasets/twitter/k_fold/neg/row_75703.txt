Iâ€™m not okayMy anxiety has been bad. I was exhausted today and napped most of it. I have to be up for work at 4:30am. My infant slept while I slept, heâ€™ll be up all night. My husband and I had an argument surrounding schedules for work this weekend. 

Iâ€™m on meds. I missed a few days though. On then again now. I had to go back to work with only 8 weeks maternity leave. I did it for the money, but Iâ€™m not working enough for it to be worthwhile. I should have taken unpaid leave. My current go-to emotion is failure. I feel like I ruin everything I touch. That my existence is failure. Iâ€™m not okay. 

Iâ€™m not going to do anything, but I think I want to. It flashes through my mind. Iâ€™ll just take some pills. I canâ€™t, I wonâ€™t. I have kids. But Iâ€™m thinking about it. It just keeps flashing through my thoughts. 

â€œCall back when youâ€™ve calmed down.â€  

I canâ€™t. Thatâ€™s not possible. Iâ€™m sorry. I donâ€™t have anyone else. I canâ€™t bother him again. I donâ€™t have anyone. 

Iâ€™m hiding from my kids. Iâ€™m ruining their lives. Iâ€™m broken.
