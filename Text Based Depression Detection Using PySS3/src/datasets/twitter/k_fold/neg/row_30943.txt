I don't think I can do this anymoreI don't think I was made in a way that is functional. Everything I have done in my life has ended poorly, and I am incapable of doing things that normal people do every day. I am extremely lonely. There is some subtle context to human interaction that I am missing. People like me for a while, and then I always do or say something that seems fine to me, but whoever I'm talking to suddenly gets a weird look and they leave. It's like I'm flying through life with blinders or something. I keep shooting in the dark and missing everything.

I just don't know why I should keep trying anymore.
