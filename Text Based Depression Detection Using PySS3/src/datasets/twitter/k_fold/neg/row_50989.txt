I want to die like Kurt CobainI wish I had a shotgun. I want to splatter my brains all over the wall. Hopefully thereâ€™s no chance of me being alive.

I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. Iâ€™m so fucking tired and I just want everything to end already. 

There is absolutely no hope left for me. I want to kill myself soon so that I wonâ€™t live an entire life time of misery and being forever alone.
