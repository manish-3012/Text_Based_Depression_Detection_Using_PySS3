It would be so easyIt's been a while since I've been so free. Given the space to disappear at a whim. No one would notice if I went missing. We all assume I'll come back, but I'm so tired. Let me stop at the beginning, before I have the chance to fk anything else up. Before I can disappoint and lose everything. I have to be my own tether but I'd much rather cut the rope. I've poured everything out, but still find more to offer. I'm just tired and wish I could tell someone without the guilt of the pity and attention I'll receive. I don't want people to notice because I'm reaching out. I don't wanna keep feeling like a burden or obligation. I just wanna feel like a friend again. I wanna stop this drowning. I know I'm not unlock enough but if I didn't wake up tomorrow, I'd accept it. Everyone would move on, because that's how time works and they'd learn to be okay. Another crazy thing in a shit year. The interesting part to me is no one else saw it coming. I don't want to punish them for the freedom, I just hate the anxiety warping how to handle this. 

Sorry for my rant.
