I am inside already deadDoes anyone have the feeling too to feel empty inside? 
Can't even talk more to people normally? 
Just sitting your time up like in a prison?
I ... I don't know how to describe more my situation.
From the outside I might looking happy - but come closer and you will notice how empty I am. 
I am not living I am only existing. 
Sometimes I just wish someone would hold me when I am falling - but life likes it to punch on me.
I am sorry if I said something strange I have it hard to describe anything ... and it's just like that I don't want to live anymore.
My time is already gone.
