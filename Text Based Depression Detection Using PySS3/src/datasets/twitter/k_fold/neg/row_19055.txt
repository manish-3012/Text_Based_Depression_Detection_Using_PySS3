The American dream is a liePlease donâ€™t read this if youâ€™re in a vulnerable state and know that you are loved and worthy of life. Especially if youâ€™re young, you will not always feel this way. And you will find your happiness in life. I wish on no one the thoughts in my mind for myself. As for me, and the collapse of any future in greed driven apocalyptic America and my own choices (I have myself to blame for having such a hopeful nature. Always serves to destroy me), itâ€™s becoming easier every day as I ready myself. I bought 4 bags of charcoal briquettes on Amazon and an antiemetic. I really feel I am making progress now and itâ€™s starting to become encouraging in a weird way. I donâ€™t feel sad anymore. I am going to take from many different methods to coordinate a process for myself with high efficiency and low pain. I hope to include alcohol, benzodiazepines, opiates of some sort, an anti emetic and the charcoal briquettes, however I have to work out the timing of the process as well. Living in quiet desperation definitely has its limits and abuse, whether self imposed or otherwise will thrust any person into madness. I was such a happy, funny kid only ever wanting to make people laugh and feel good, and so I wasnâ€™t prepared for the â€œevilâ€ in the world, in fact I ignored it because I still only ever wanted to make people happy. But in my line of work Iâ€™ve been exposed, especially recently to horrifying sights, the saddest things that I must take with me to my grave. I struggle with these sights, with my own addictions and with poverty in a 2020 America of brutal Darwinism, corruption, and false narratives pulling society apart for the interest of sociopaths in the upper echelon of society. Good hearted people who care are not a commodity in this world. They are stepped on and murdered. I have no control of what happens to me in life. But I do have control over my death. And if thatâ€™s the only control I can have, I will take it.
