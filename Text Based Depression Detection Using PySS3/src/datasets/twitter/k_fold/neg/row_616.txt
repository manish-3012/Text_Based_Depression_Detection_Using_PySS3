Feeling alone and unwantedToday makes the 1 year anniversary of me [19M] moving 1000 miles away from my home to go to my dream college. I moved south because of what my brothers told me, â€œmove away from home, push yourself outside of your comfort zone and you will be amazing with how much you growâ€. Well, the only thing that grew on my was a feeling of worthlessness and insecurity. All I see around me are kids my age that are so much more mature or interesting or attractive than me. How do they already have so much more figured out. So much as talking to someone in the hall fills me with dread. Each semester starts the same, Iâ€™m so excited to meet new people; to finally get rid of being alone, except I canâ€™t leave my bed Iâ€™m so overcome with the fear of humiliating myself. Since coming to college Iâ€™ve met people who eventually ghost me and end up just adding to the long list of snapchat stories I watch that only make me sink further into my whole. Iâ€™m done here. I canâ€™t even quit and go home, my mother would be so upset. Sheâ€™s already managing a divorce and counseling of her own, I canâ€™t burden her with this. If I was to die, I donâ€™t think anyone would notice.
