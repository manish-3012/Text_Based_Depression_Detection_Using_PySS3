I fucked up my career pathI got a master's degree in acting.  I'm in $160,000 in student debt.  I didn't do it to become "a star".  I was told I could get a job full time, teaching at the college or highschool level.  They straight up lied about job growth.  Well, now I'm working minimum wage, not teaching.

I want to go back to undergrad and get a real degree.  But I'm not sure if I can get more loans or not anymore.

I'm so fucking close to the edge of my sanity and I'm fucking terrified of living.
