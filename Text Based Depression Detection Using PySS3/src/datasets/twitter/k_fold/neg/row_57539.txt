Iâ€™m a depressed alcoholic, and iâ€™m ready to die.Depression only scrapes the surface. Iâ€™m diagnosed with OCD and BPD. Every single day feels like a living hell and I donâ€™t think I can keep going on like this. I have a lot of other issues because of my main diagnosis, these include severe social anxiety (bordering on agoraphobia), and major depression. 

Iâ€™m sick of living like this. The only thing keeping me alive right now is my family because I donâ€™t want to put them through that. A part of me feels like theyâ€™d be better off for it though because my mental health has become so debilitating in the last few years that I canâ€™t even work. I just turned 24 and I have to mooch off of my grandparents and live with them because I canâ€™t function like a normal human being. 

Iâ€™ve tried therapy and medication, but nothing helps. I feel so lost and stuck and itâ€™s as if there is no getting out of my current situation. At this point, what do I do? I failed out of college because of my mental illness. I live in a small town, so as of now finding a job is almost impossible... but my social anxiety makes it even more daunting. I canâ€™t hardly even go to the grocery store at this point. 

I donâ€™t know what to do at this point because all I feel is helplessness. Itâ€™s like iâ€™m drowning and there is no way out. Iâ€™m stuck in my thoughts for all of my waking moments and the only way I can get relief is through alcohol. Itâ€™s so hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel when I feel deep down Iâ€™d be better off dead.
