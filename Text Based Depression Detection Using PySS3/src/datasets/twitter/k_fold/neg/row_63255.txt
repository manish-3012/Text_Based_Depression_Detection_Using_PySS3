Just floating alongI used to self harm, a lot.  I had some stuff happen about two years ago that was pretty rough but a good situation came out of it.  I was in a really good spot for two whole years.  No self harming.  No bad thoughts.  Until today.  I have never wished so much not to be here anymore.  I cut again.  I am so upset i was put in this position.  I cant stop thinking about the fact i did it again.  That now im in a rough spot again.  Almost the same situation as before.  I dont like it.  My mom is the only person i have in my life and she is the only thing keeping me here at this point.  I am so broken.
