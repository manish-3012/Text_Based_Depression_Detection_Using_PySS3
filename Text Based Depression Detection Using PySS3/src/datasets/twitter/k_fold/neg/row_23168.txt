nothing is right in my life currentlyLately I just feel generally bad about who I am. I currently have nothing going for me in life and am always feeling very sad. All I do is work, go to my LSAT class, and sleep. I feel like if I was better looking then maybe people would want to be my friend (and I'm trying to save up for plastic surgery so I could look more appealing to people) but all that takes time of course. I don't fit in with anyone.  All of my co-workers are girls who like to go out &amp; party (which is awesome) but it's not my scene. I don't fit in with them because I just like watching netflix at home &amp; drinking beer or whatever. I wish I was as beautiful and fun as them a lot and then feel bad that I'm not. I'm sorry to come on here and complain but I just don't know what to do anymore or how to be better.
