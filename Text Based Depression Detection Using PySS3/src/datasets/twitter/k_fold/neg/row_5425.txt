Life is disturbingI want to die almost everyday for the last 7 years

Disgusting and disturbing things have happened to me. Terrible genetics also

I almost died twice from heroin. But got revived at the hospital. Wish it was over then

Imagine everyone that feels that way not on this subreddit, hundreds of millions...

There is no god... Looking at history across the world people have gone through hell and chaos.
