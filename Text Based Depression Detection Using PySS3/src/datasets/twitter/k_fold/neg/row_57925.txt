I really want to do it and that scares me.I really want to kill myself. I've been trying to fight the thought for 3 days now and I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I don't  want to be around my friends, I don't want to eat or sleep or drink. I'm just angry and sad and frustrated and I just want cry and hit things and scream. 

I really dont to kill myself but I'm forcing myself to be around people at all times because if I'm  not I actually think I might do it.
