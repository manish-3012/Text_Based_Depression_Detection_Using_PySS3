iâ€™ve tried to kill myself so many times in the past few months and iâ€™m scared i need to be hospitalizediâ€™m a freshman in college and this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. iâ€™ve tried to kill myself several times and now iâ€™m home for break but i wonâ€™t be going back till the fall bc of the coronavirus. the suicidal thoughts never go away. iâ€™m worried i need to be hospitalized but iâ€™ve been hospitalized twice before and they really donâ€™t do anything so i might as well stay in the comfort of my own home. plus idk how to tell my parents iâ€™m actively suicidal
