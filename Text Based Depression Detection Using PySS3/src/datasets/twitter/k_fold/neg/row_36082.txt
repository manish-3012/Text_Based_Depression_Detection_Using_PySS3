Idk. Help, I guess.So Iâ€™m an 18 yr old girl/woman and Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts. I donâ€™t really like talking abt these things with family cause I donâ€™t wanna worry them. Iâ€™d rather talk to you guys cause you dont really know how shitty a person I am. I have a good support system, although my dad recently had a heart attack he survived and is back home recovering. I recently started a job as a pharmacy tech and I hate it. I canâ€™t quit though cause I need the money. It makes me feel utterly stupid and useless, as Iâ€™m an anxious slow learner. I can feel those trying to help me getting annoyed. Iâ€™ve had a few minimum wage jobs over the years but this is the first â€œcustomer serviceâ€ one Iâ€™ve had in a while and I remembered how mean people are. I canâ€™t seem to do anything right, and I feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with me. To top all tht off, I graduated hs and I never really had any real friends there, but I havenâ€™t made any college friends either, which I guess I hoped would happen. I have depression and have asked my parents if I could start getting therapy but they said itâ€™s too expensive. Iâ€™ve always been kinda quiet but Iâ€™m academically outgoing. This job is so depressing but honestly itâ€™s not like I didnâ€™t have depression before anyways. Idk. Everyone and everything just sucks. If you even read all this, thanks. Lmk if you have any thoughts cause I donâ€™t anymore.
