no other way to make this betteri can't get away from the person who caused me immense pain, my life feels completely out of my control so much that i just want to die. they work in the same building as me and i saw them today. i feel violated that they are able to see me, i had a panic attack and now i feel sick and disgusting. i have such a huge urge to hurt myself because i can't be in control of anything any other way. i left the country this summer and felt like everything would finally be ok but now that i am back the panic attacks and fear is worse than it's ever been. it's been over two years since i've spoken to them, they apparently said to a friend they were interested in apologizing but i've heard nothing and i almost wish they never said that because it's making me more obsessive about it and they have even more control over me still two years later. i can tell my best friend is tired of me talking about it. i have therapy tomorrow but i'm always too afraid to say if i've had feelings this severe. i don't have money to go to a hospital. i'm so desperate i just want to it to end right now. it's been two years and there's no other way to end this.
