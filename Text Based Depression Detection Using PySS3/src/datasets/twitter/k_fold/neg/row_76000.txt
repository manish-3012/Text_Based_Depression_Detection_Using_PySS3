My mom found out about my alcohol addiction and I just want to die really badI have some mental health issues and I am self medicating two days a week (sometimes three) with alcohol. Well today my mom found a little bottle of alcohol in my purse. She took it which means Im not getting my dose and that also means she will fuck me up next morning really bad. She is known to be emotionally abusive and I am really scared and sincerely want to do something to myself. I had a really bad week and was looking forward to getting drunk and forgetting about this but now Im just sober and suicidal. Please someone do something I was never so close to giving up
