I just want to go awayIâ€™m 20 overweight, disabled and in college, I am in an immense amount of debt I have a shitty job that barely even pays for my rent so I canâ€™t eat most days except for seeds and cheap fast food. I recently got a gym membership to help with the fact I am so overweight and used all my available money to do so and I regret it so much. I felt super embarrassed and persuaded by family members and co workers to do this and to buy expensive healthy food now I canâ€™t pay for school supplies food or my bills. I feel like a complete failure and to be in so much debt at this age. I just want to go away Iâ€™m just a burden on all my family and my partner. I canâ€™t will myself to get up and do basic shit around my house because I feel like Iâ€™m just dying slowly. Iâ€™ve already tried to OD tonight but my partner cought me and took my meds away, I canâ€™t afford counseling so that is out of the question, whenever I try to talk about whatâ€™s wrong with my parents they always disregard what I have to say by saying Iâ€™m bringing them down. And I donâ€™t blame them Iâ€™m just a burden to everyone I know and I should wait for my partner to go to sleep and try to start the process again, I donâ€™t know if I will do it for sure but I feel like I have no way out, I just want to runaway and hide . I wish I wasnâ€™t a disappointment. Iâ€™m so sorry . Please delete this if it is not allowed in really sorry Iâ€™ve just been like this for so long, Iâ€™ve wanted to die since I was seven I just want the pain to go away
