Does anyone worry about the religious aspect of suicide?I don't know what your religious beliefs are, if you have any, but I was raised Christian and I recall, when I was a child, someone said that suicide is an unforgivable sin. If you take your own life, you will be placed in hell. Now since I have grown up, I have drifted away from religion as a whole, but unfortunately not my depression and thoughts. I have attempted before and failed. And since then I have had many many thought and intentions. Right now in my life it is constantly on my mind. But the thought of always suffering in whatever afterlife there may be always is in my mind. And for some reason it always deters me from pulling the trigger. I haven't been to church or anything in years. But somehow that always is always on my mind. I just want to know someone else's thoughts if they have any. I'm not sure how much longer the though will be wit me but it is here now. And now is where I live I guess. Thanks fam
