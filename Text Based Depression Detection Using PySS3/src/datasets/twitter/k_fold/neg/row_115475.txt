Can you help?!Hi guys!
I know it's a long shot but I found this post on 'offmychest' just now. It was posted hours ago so I realise it may be too late? ( I really hope I'm wrong).
Wondering if any of you know the steps to maybe track down the poster and see if he is ok? 
I know you guys have done wonderful things for many people, you were the first sub to enter my mind when I read this poor mans post. I'm at work and reading his post made me quite upset, I don't know if anyone has come to you already, if so I hope help is already on the way to him.

Thank you for reading.
