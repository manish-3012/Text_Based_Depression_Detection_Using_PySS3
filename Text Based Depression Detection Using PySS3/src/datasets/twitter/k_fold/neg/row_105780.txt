I think I'm too mentally ill to continue living.People always tell me it could be worse or I could have something worse and yeah I suppose. 

But im tired of living with anxiety. I'm already on medications and I'm still a ball of worry most of the time. I can't make and keep friends, I drive away my lovers, I sleep like shit, I'm stressed out a lot, i can't stop the horrible what-if scenarios in my head... I'm just not liking the idea of doing this for another 60, 70, maybe even 80 years if i live that long. 

If my family didn't love me so much... I dread that they are getting older and will leave me. They are all I have. I have no friends. My boyfriend dumped me recently. I have nothing but my family and even they are going to leave me. 

I'm ready to quit. There's nothing optimistic inside me anymore. Internet words mean little from people who can't hug me or hang out with me. I need in person people. 

My therapist is so nice and bless her but she isn't my friend or my age. She's just an ear and some positive words.
