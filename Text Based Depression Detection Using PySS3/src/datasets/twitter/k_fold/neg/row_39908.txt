i don't care if its not fair to youman after two suicide attempts and 10 straight years of suicidal ideation forgive the fuck outta me for not giving a shit about what is and isnt fair to you im literally about to slurp some die cocktail and get the fuck outta here

my brain is literally rejecting everything remotely positive youre saying. its been like that for the longest time and i dont care anymore. let me be fucking selfish and let go of me, do i have to undo the however many years of repairing our relationship so you can hate me 

the only reason im still here is im afraid of you finding my body and how you'd deal with life without me 

i wish someone would kill me but im too much of a pussy to walk outside in the middle of the night and potentially get tortured before being murdered. why cant i give my life to someone who wants it either. my grandma would be absolutely lit right now if she were still here but living in a third world country while having cancer while the coronavirus is fucking shit up wouldnt be the best environment for a vibrant lady like her. shit sucks fam
