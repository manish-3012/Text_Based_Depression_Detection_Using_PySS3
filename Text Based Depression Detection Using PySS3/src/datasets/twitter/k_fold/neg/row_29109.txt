Accumulating a stash of sleeping pills to carry out my planI stopped taking my sleep medication on Friday night. The anxiety was bad, the sleep quality was bad. 

But I need to start accumulating pills to carry out my plan. I am too incompetent to lead my life. I don't have employable skills. I don't have people skills. I don't even have a hobby. 

I know death by poisoning is not a good way to go. But maybe I'll take the pills and then jump off a building while my brain is foggy.
