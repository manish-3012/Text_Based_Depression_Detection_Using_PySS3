How am I supposed to do this?Just when I back out and don't go through with it cuz everything seems to be going the way it needs to. Not perfect nor how I planned but at least positive progress towards an outcome where everyone can find a happy place with a new plan. Just when that happens it all comes crashing right back down around me. So im right back to my original solution which is for me to be gone permanently.

It truly feels like the only way to protect me and this baby is to remove me from the world and take him with me before he's ever even brought into this awful fucking nightmare of a world.

I never should have believed I'd get any kind of happy ending that wasn't shrouded in constant darkness. It's never been in the cards for me. And clearly the universe has no better plan for my baby.

So the choices are disappear and lie about who I anf he are to live in secret never being able to talk to anyone I know ever again while always looking over my shoulder wondering if they've found me...or I can end all the pain that I feel and that my baby will feel with one trigger pull.

Not sure I have the balls to pull it but I know its the only real solution to all the pain.
