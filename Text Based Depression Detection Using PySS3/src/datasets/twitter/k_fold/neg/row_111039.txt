my 18th birthdayive never made a reddit post but to be honest i dont actually have anyone who would listen so here it goes. today was my 18th birthday. in the past i have always dealt with major depression and suicide attempts but i has been doing well up until recently. i didnt do fucking anything today because i dont have anything to do or any friends to do it with. i read a lot of these posts where people share long stories and give you a glimpse into their mind (and theres nothing wrong with that, they are brave for sharing) but i dont want any pity i just simply wanted to say that i plan on killing myself tonight. ive wanted to do it for so long, and i was going to wait until my father passed away because hes the only person on this earth who would be utterly shattered by it and he doesnt deserve that. ive tried to stay strong but something about birthdays makes you realize that your life is worthless and its not going to get better no matter how long you have hope that it will. ive been waiting for one happy moment all my life, just one, and ive never gotten it. the reality of the world is that life is honestly shitty and not worth it and for a lot of people, the idea of death sounds like bliss. its a dream to never have to deal with pain or sadness or loneliness ever again. you simply get to stop existing like you were never here in the first place. people say suicide is selfish but for some people its the only thing that can provide relief. for those of you that have had a pleasant life experience , you are beyond lucky and i wish you all the best, but i on the other hand shouldnt have been here at all and i just cant take it anymore
