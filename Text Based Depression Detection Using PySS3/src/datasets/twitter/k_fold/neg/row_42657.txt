Why am I so terrible...when I drink? Drinking makes me feel better about my life, but makes other people hate me. Even when I drink alone. I hate myself. Nothing I do is right. I can't even make my boyfriend happy. I can't make myself happy. I really need someone to talk to...right now. I know I am semi drunk and just being overly dramatic, but I want to kill msyelf right now. I just want to fill up my bathtub, fall asleep and hope that i drown. Take whatever pills I can find in my apartment. I don't know...anything that could possibly get rid of this hell I feel right now.
