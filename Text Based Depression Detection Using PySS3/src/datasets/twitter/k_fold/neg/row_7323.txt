I'm lostI feel like that my wife is just trying to find ways to blame me

We recently tried to plan a trip but I wasn't able to get a visa on time and she blames me. She recently tried to start applying for a PhD and one supervisor contacted her before she finishes the requested paperwork and blames me for pushing her to write some details regarding her research interest. We have had countless fights about how her things don't seem to go to plan but I see it as she is not finishing through. She didn't go ahead and finish the paper work she didn't go actively persue a research supervisor. It's as if she just wants things to come to her.

I get so frustrated to the point where I want to lash out but I don't instead I punch myself in the head. I do have a few bruises and bumps and hope maybe I get a ruptured vessel or fracture. 

To me that seems like a good way out. But I seriously am reaching my limit. I don't want to involve her family and snitch to her parents about her lack of care and communication because that would pretty much. We have a 2 yr old daughter and she isn't putting In the effort at all. My wife's sleeps in all day.  She doesn't want to start working till after she attends her graduation which she delayed for 6 month.

I seriously don't know what to do Any More
