Last AdventureTime and time again
Begins the cycle of ideation
No mystery to what's on my mind
Once more I come up against suicide
I've made a way for it to be fun
Desire twisted toward being undone
Dagger plunged into my heart, a thrilling ride
My soul released from this body, a phoenix soaring into the sky
And so I'd fly into a new universe, a new life
Quantum Immorality would be on my side
The only thing that curbs this great appeal
Is something I chose a long time ago; an ideal
The siren song of death is allowed to be enticing
Its experience is allowed to be exciting
A thrilling adventure it's allowed to be
But it's the very last one that I'll see
Life is full of adventure, death is but one
So I will live to the fullest before I take that plunge
I love how much I grow when I overcome strife
So death must fucking earn my breath by taking me alive
Just because death offers the thrill I seek
Doesn't mean another victim I must be
Suicide is a desire that only lasts for a moment
So again I save my life using the ideal I've chosen
