I donâ€™t know anymore...Kinda a long story, but to sum it up Iâ€™m in a LDR now because my boyfriend had to move back to Europe. I love him so much. Being away from him physically hurts me, but that isnâ€™t the problem. 

I was sneaking out and when my parents found out (his neighbor saw me leaving his house early in the morning and told his stepmum who told my Mum). My parents have always been aggressive. Correction: my Mum has been abusive (mentally, physically, and emotionally) and my dad just let it happen, which in my book makes him just as bad. 

They constantly treat me like an outcast as well. Growing up I just wanted to make them proud, but I never fit in. I wasnâ€™t like them or my sister who is 7 years older than me. They have always loved my sister more as well. Sheâ€™s the miracle baby, she wasnâ€™t supposed to live being 4 months premature. I was just the accident who lived after my parents used a condom and my mum took the morning after pill. 

She smoked and did drugs throughout the pregnancy with me, and now I have a ton of medical problems. (This stresses me out a lot). I feel like Iâ€™ll never be enough for anyone. I tried so hard to make them proud but I just canâ€™t. It doesnâ€™t help that they didnâ€™t notice when something was very off when I was 10. 

They dropped me off at a family friends house, and the oldest son and the youngest daughter ended up raping me. 4 years later I entered a horrible relationship because I was scared of this person and ended up getting raped multiple times throughout the relationship but I was too scared to leave because of how abusive he was. Then about 8 months ago I was sexually abused and forced into things I didnâ€™t want to do, it just wasnâ€™t full on sex. They never noticed how my demeanor changed and when they found out what happened (not through me) they blamed me for it all. 

I donâ€™t want to be alive. I feel so alone even though I have a good boyfriend and amazing friends. I go to bed hoping I donâ€™t wake up. I want to die because of everything I have been through and because of everything I am going through right now. My parents cut off the heat to my room as well when they know I need heat because of my medical problems that make my muscles eat away at themselves. I just donâ€™t know anymore...
