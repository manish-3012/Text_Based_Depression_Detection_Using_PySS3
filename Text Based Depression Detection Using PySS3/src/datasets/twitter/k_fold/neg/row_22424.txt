People care? No they don't. Read this.I'll keep it short. I've had suicidal thoughts in the past. Even tried it once and failed. I heard a local story today that a friend is being sued by a police officer. This officer saved him from jumping off a bridge. He grabbed the jumper after he let go. Apparently, this officer hurt his back in the process, and is now suing the jumper.

Are you kidding me???

Don't listen when people say they care. Because they don't.
