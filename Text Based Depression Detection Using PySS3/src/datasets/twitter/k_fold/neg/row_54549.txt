Been having really scary thoughts the past few daysIt seems like killing myself would be a good thing to do, i would 100% do it but i know my family would be devastated... I'm 16 and i have no clue what to do in life, i never do my school work (probably because of all the weed i've smoked), and even though i know a lot of people at school (and am the class president) but i've never had close friends, let alone have anyone who's into me. I don't know why. I feel so overwhelmed with school and work, that i'm scared for when i go to college because i know it'll be worse and busier.All i wanna do is lay in bed and i can't because i have so much stuff to do. i dunno. i just wish people wanted to hang out with me more.
