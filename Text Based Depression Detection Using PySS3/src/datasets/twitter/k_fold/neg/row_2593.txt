Great night and then everything got bad.I had a great night yesterday.
Made new friends.
Had sex (which I didn't do since my virginity loss)
And then my lips started to burn and herpes show up.
I forgot how much I hate my life for one night and now I go back to remember why I need to die for the lack of happiness.
