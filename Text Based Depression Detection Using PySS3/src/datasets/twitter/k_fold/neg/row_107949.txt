I think Iâ€™m gonna do it before the year is up.Iâ€™m back again to complain about life. Thinking of doing it soon, the crippling anxiety and sadness are bringing me close the edge. Hoping a 9mm is fast and easy. The only reason I might not is the fear of hurting my family and missing out on video games (how pathetic). Honestly Iâ€™d do it tonight if the gun was accessible, the lingering anxiety of waking up just to hate tomorrow and the next day and the next and next and so on is too much for me. Maybe I run away or train hop, but it wonâ€™t fix anything, Iâ€™ll still need a job wherever I end up. I canâ€™t  do it anymore. I wish someone would kill me cuz im too pussy to do it myself
