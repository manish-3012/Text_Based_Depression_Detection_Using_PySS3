I keep getting fleeting suicidal thoughts almost on an everyday basis now, the only reason I havenâ€™t gone through with it(atleast what I tell myself) is because I can imagine the toll it would take on my parents. Its gotten a little worse off late and I honestly donâ€™t know what to do in life because for me ever since grade school my mentality has been - â€œok lets just get through this and I can kill myself after peacefully knowing I didnâ€™t do it because I became flustered and gave upâ€. After all these 23 years thinking like this I genuinely donâ€™t know what to do with my life because I didnâ€™t plan on being here
