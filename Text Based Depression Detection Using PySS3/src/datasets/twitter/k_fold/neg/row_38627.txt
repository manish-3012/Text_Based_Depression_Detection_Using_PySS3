When CDIFF makes you want to die.I have no more energy.... I've been fighting CDiff for 7 months and just relapsed again.... I feel like giving up on my life. I feel like getting struck by a train.... this is torture. I don't know if I will ever be normal... next step is a FMT procedure which I'm all for but I feel like I'll never be me again and don't want to keep fighting. ðŸ˜­
