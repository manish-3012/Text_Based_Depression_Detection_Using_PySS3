Literally just want someone to careIt's clear to see that no one does. I'd be lying if I said I haven't relapsed after 4 years of not self harming. I've thought the way I want to kill myself and literally my only problem is getting the stuff. I've texted friends, but no one is replying to me. Ignored by every one. I've cried myself to sleep just about every day this week and I just hate everything. All I fucking want is someone to care about me. I'm so hurt.
