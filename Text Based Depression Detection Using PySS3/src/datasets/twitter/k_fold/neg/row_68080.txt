My cry for help: To utter strangersI've considered uploading here what feels like a million times in the last week - the only thing stopping me being my persistent thought that others are more important, others deserve attention before myself. This is still my viewpoint but tonight I have come to the conclusion that people can ignore this if they want, attention need not be spent on me. 

I've been depressed for years, to begin with nothing all too bad, I never told anyone though, it was always bottled up. Last December, school found out. Not to go into too much detail but threats to kick me out if i don't agree to counselling in school, ultimatums here there and everywhere. Friends found out about me feeling like suicide was a genuine option, they can't sleep, eat, they feel sick , ive broken them. 

and i don't know how to carry on, like that. i went to the counsellor and they told me i had a perfect life. my family get so angry and frustrated that i have nothing to say, because i don't. i have nothing im hiding, no big secrets, no reason to be miserable. my friends found out their friend wants to die. it's ruined them. 

i just feel empty, lifeless, i lay here with nobody to talk to because how do i talk to friends who ive broken. they cant help me anyway. any conversation with my family are simply fights. im lost. im really lost.
