Attempted Suicide 2 days ago. Not considering suicide anymore but stuck in limbo.**TL;DR:** I was planning to commit suicide by binge drinking but my roommate stopped me by hiding all the liquor. Now, I don't want to kill myself, however, I still feel like shit.

**Relevant information:** I have had depression for the past 10 years, I've only seeked help in the last 4 months. I see a physiologist once every two weeks and I take Prozac. Prozac helped a lot in the beginning. I've never felt that good in my life.

Fast Forward, I met someone that I had really good connection with. I fell for her so hard. However, even though she likes hanging out with me almost daily, she doesn't see me the same way I see her. It was clear that we won't be anything more than close friends. It hurt a lot. But the worst happen is when she had to tell me that she kissed a guy (the reason she told me is because she didn't want it to happen in front of me which would hurt even more).

We have decided to take a break from each other until I feel better. But it seems like I will never move on. I have never met someone like her in my life before and I don't think I'll ever meet anyone like her. I feel like I don't want anything in life anymore. The reason I'm not going to kill myself is because I saw how much my attempt hurt my roommates, so I don't want to hurt everyone I know that much.

It feels like I've seen the best of my life, and I will not settle for less. The reason I'm here on this subreddit is because I'm out of ideas to help myself.
