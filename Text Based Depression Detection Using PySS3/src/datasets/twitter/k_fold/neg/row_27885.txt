Killing myself after Christmas.I donâ€™t wanna do it before Christmas because I donâ€™t wanna ruin my familyâ€™s good time. Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was 16. Iâ€™m 20 now. After high school things really went downhill. Lost most of my friends. Canâ€™t get a girlfriend. Iâ€™m lonely and my life has no meaning.
