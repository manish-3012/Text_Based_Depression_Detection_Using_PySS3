Iâ€™m 13 and want to die but Iâ€™m too embarrassed to tell anyone.
I Fucking hate emotions they make me uncomfortable, and I donâ€™t want my parents worried about me. I currently have a therapist but I would never tell her about me wanting to die, my mom is a therapist too and told me if a client is under 18 and say they want to die or harm themselves they have to tell there parents. Depression runs in my family, my take currently takes anti depressants and I feel guilty , like Iâ€™m the reason heâ€™s taking them. I have no Fucking friends , Iâ€™m ugly and everyone Fucking hates me.
