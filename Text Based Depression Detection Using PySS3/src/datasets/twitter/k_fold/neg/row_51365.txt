Thoughts of day to day.Note: I use the google translator.

Get up? For what? To live one more day of these damn thoughts, I want to end everything at once, stop these thoughts, stop hurting them, stop worrying them, stop waking up every day. Leave, this body and mind that I hate so much.

(Only a thought of someone ***Empty***)
