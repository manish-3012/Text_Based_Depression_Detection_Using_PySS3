Final ending it tonightI have never posted here or even on reddit before but Iâ€™m on a bus right now into town to jump off a bridge. Itâ€™s been a long time coming but right now Iv never felt better knowing I final made a decision about ending my life. Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the right place to post this I just have no one else to tell this too. As soon as I get off the bus I wonâ€™t have an internet connection so I want to say thank you to everyone on this subreddit Iv read a lot of your stories and I truly hope you find peace with yourself. Thank you
