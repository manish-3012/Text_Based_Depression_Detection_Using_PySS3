What's even the point.I'm drunk, so bear with me.   I've come to realize that my life is shit.  My bully from high school (who has a wife and very successful, and is very handsome) has gotten married, and graduate from the same private college we went to. I've failed out of the same college we went too, and done nothing with my own life except through go thought life and live thought one depressing moment after another (also spending1,000+ hours on league of legends) .  I don't have any friends expect my two roommates that I've known since high school.  My coworkers probably hate me since I'm quite and tend to bitch about everything around me.  I have nothing else to talk about!  I have no positive in life to share with them, since all I think about is the regrets in my life and the lack of sex I'm having.  I thought I was gay (even thought I KNEW I WAS AT LEAST BI) in junior high, and I regretted that decision know that I am 27 years old.  I am morbidly obese and have been since I 12 years old.  Maybe my life would of been different if I wasnt; but that isn't the case.  No gay guy wanted me because I was fat, and thought fucked with me all thought junior high and high school.  I missed the chance to date the love of my life and now I'm 27 years old, never dated anyone, lonely as fuck.  I'm constantly broke paying for rent and school with no positive outlook for the future.  I honestly don't want to live anymore.  Like, what's  the point?  I realize now that I really like women (I live in a town in MS that everyone knows that I said that I was gay growing up), and have experiene pleasuring women sexually only twice in my life.  One of which was the crush (and best friend throughout my childhood) and the other one who gave me herpes.  Tried out Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble; no matches and feeling more depressed.  I have nothing to live forward to and this is just covering what I feel everyday.
