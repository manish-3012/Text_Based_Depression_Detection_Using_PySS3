I've lost the ability to feel sadSadness was all I had, without it I'm nothing. I've already started self harming to make up for the lack of pain or emotion. I feel every second, slowly passing. once I ghost my friends again, that's it. I wont have anything. I'll spend everyday lying in bed staring at my roof as time slowly moves by. Just waiting until I've decided that I've had enough and try and end it all again (if I even have the motivation anymore).
