Life just hurtsI just constantly feel numb and if i'm not numb then my moods, emotions, and behavior are all over the place. I feel like I just don't belong. Throw on top of that cutting and other self harm habits I just wish I could die. And for some reason I can never open up to any one about anything, even positive or trivial things like foods or music I like. Even now I'm using an anonymous alt account for my normal account, also anonymous, on an anonymous social platform. My head just has so much wrong with it. Life sucks
