Itâ€™s my birthday today.Now 19M. 

Woke up, cried, brushed my teeth, showered, all of that. Heading to the gym in a few minutes.

No happy birthdays of course. Nobody to talk to. Not a single living soul to talk to. Nobody to even call or text.

Meanwhile some person who has the same birthday and is turning the same age is getting drunk with 500 people whoâ€™d die for them and and has to respond to more happy birthdayâ€™s tomorrow and Iâ€™m just sitting here typing this in my room.

I do not know how to put my pain into words that can really show just how much I want to die. Iâ€™ve tried ODâ€™ing multiple times, Iâ€™ve tried sitting in a running car in a closed garage with my windows down, even tried to slit my throat about a month ago. Nothing works, nothing ever will work, nothing ever will get better.
