Most willing to keep goingMy depression has gotten worse in the past 3 years. Ever since my child was born things have gotten more overwhelming than they use to be. 
I have dealt with bullying since very little, low self esteem because of learning disability, making me feel less than every one. 
Studied a carrier that I donâ€™t like just to please my parents, change of work every few years because I always felt I couldnâ€™t keep up and the thought of getting fired will be horrible.
Got married though things will be better, we had ups and downs like any other couples, but like I said before since the kid was born itâ€™s been a living hell. 
I felt so overwhelmed the moment I hold her for the first time, it was like a mental blockage, that I didnâ€™t know what to do, how to handle things and I didnâ€™t want to ask for help. Everything was too much to take, I decided to quit my job and focus on the hose and the kid to see if that helped with my anger and the stress. 
It did not. My husband started doing bad at work and we had the same salary for the past 3 years. My child was diagnosed with red flags for autism. I didnâ€™t have anybody to help me with her, and I kept blaming myself for this, because Iâ€™m a bad mother that did everything wrong and got her in to this. 
I diced for the first time to act and started taking her to therapy. She was going to 4 different types of therapies and the bills where high. My husband never told me that we were not doing well financially and we started traveling to see if getting me out of the house would make me feel better. 
We got in to such a big debt that some times we donâ€™t have enough for basic needs. 
I started working again to help since my child started school. Since is my own business itâ€™s not moving fast enough to see any profit. 
And I just got to a point of mental, physical and emotional exhaustion that I canâ€™t take it any more.
