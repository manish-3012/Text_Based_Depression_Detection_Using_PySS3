daily dosis of depressionThis is my first post here, I don't have much to say, it's just another day without doing anything productive and just thinking about committing suicide, it's not because quarantine, this has been happening to me for years. I tell myself that is no longer worth living and that the best option is to slowly die in my bed, apologize to my family, friends and a person who I could love, but no. I'm very weak and I don't think I can go on with this.
