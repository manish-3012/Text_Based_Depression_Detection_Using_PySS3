will hospital workers honor a do not necessitate when it comes across a suicide?i am currently lying in a hospital bed. underent back surgery and have some major complications including I cant move my feet. i also cant urinate or use my pecker. I am thinking of offing myself while I am here. I'm over 40 years old and figure I've lived a good first half. I've got a nice stout extension cord from this laptop, a plastic bag from a trash can, some surgical tape, and a several painkillers I've been stockpiling. I'm planning on writing Do Not Resuscitate on my forehead, chest and arm. I have my own hospital room with its own bathroom. The nurses seem to let me sleep uninterrupted from 1-4 am. They do come in to take blood pressure readings and ICP - to relieve my bladder.

I was thinking of wheeling to the bathroom, locking the door, leaving the DNR notes with the sharpie, taking the pills, placing the bag over my head, secure the bag with surgical tape, and then using the laptop cord as a noose and hang myself from the shower head.

My fear is that a nurse or ordely will enter my room and find that I have locked myself in the bathroom and they will find my dying body and attempt to intervene. I don't want to survive with brain damage. will my do not resecuitate request be honored?

Are my fears valid. I don't want this to be unsuccessful . Any advice reddit?
