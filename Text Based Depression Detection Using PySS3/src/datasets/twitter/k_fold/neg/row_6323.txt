Every time before falling asleep I imagine my deathI visualize my suicide like I'm in some luxury hotel, taking a handful of pills, drinking vodka and being ready to die. Or taking some golden shot (heroine overdose or any other drug) sometimes I see myself in blood. I love the feeling of being dead and non existent. 
just find it so relaxing to imagine iam dead.
that helps me fall asleep not thinking about bullshit world and its problems.
