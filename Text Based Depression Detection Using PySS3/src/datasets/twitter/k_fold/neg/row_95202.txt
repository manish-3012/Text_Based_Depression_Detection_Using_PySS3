I really think i need helpThis is my second time posting here... i first posted this on /r/depression , i really feel like i'm falling in despair.

Sorry for my bad english. I just can't take it anymore, first of all some days ago i tried to kill myself but it didn't go well, i don't have many friends, i can't always ask my mom to help me because she feels bad when i tell her how i always feel bad, she and my gf are the only one who knows about my suicide attemp, my gf got super upset and i understand her, after all, its all my fault, i have been screaming to her that i seriously need help but she says:
"Well, you are always sad anyway" and i feel way worse, i really don't know what to do, i feel so bad, everything feels worse and i have been thinking about trying to kill myself again, by hanging myself but the painless way (breaking my neck), or going to the train station and throw myself to the rails. I just want to stop feeling this horrible sensation, this loneliness, i want to stop thinking.

Just now i talked to my gf, she said she will listen me and that she said those things yesterday b/c she was angry, but now she just told me:

"are you going to continue with that"
- This is why i told you that it was bad to express myself
"i think so"

What the actual fuck, does she really even care for me?

Fucking kill me, i just want to die, please someone, anyone just kill me, i can't take this anymore, i can't take those feelings, i can't take this loneliness, everything feels bad.
