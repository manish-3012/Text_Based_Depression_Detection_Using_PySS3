Angry because it feels unfair.My feelings fluctuate between "life is horrible and I should end it" and "I just want to feel better why do I have to be suffering like this".

I don't believe there's some higher power punishing me for whatever misdeeds I'd committed. Life is a game of circumstance and my circumstances sucked. They still suck. But it still feels unfair. I'm not supposed to be considering death as a viable option. I'm not supposed to be losing sleep because every time I'm awake all I think about is my next attempt.

Earlier today I took a nap, and it was the most at peace I've felt in years. Why can't I feel that calm and good while I'm awake? Why do I have to be in pain?

I'm angry because I already bought rope for my next attempt and I was suddenly hit with "I shouldn't be doing that. I should be wanting to live."

But I don't want to live anymore and it hurts so much.
