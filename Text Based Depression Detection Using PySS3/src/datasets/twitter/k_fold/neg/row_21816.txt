People whoâ€™s best friend killed them themselves , please helpMy absolute best friend who Iâ€™d known for a decade decided the pain was too much last year , ended it all in a tent for his friends to find him in there during a festival. I loved this guy too much to even explain.
My head naturally just pushes emotions and feelings away all the time so Iâ€™ve been blocking out the hurt and the pain caused by his death along with another person whom I was close too who passed a couple months before he did. I just donâ€™t know how to cope because these feelings of absolute devastation and pain always seem to seep in at random moments, usually at night , Iâ€™ll cry for hours and scream and just get so close to ending it all so I can see him and the girl I lost aswell. 
Iâ€™m only 17 , I donâ€™t want to feel this empty and cold for the rest of my life but no matter how much counselling or self medication I do I know itâ€™s not going to go away.
Sorry for the long post , I donâ€™t even know why I posted this but Iâ€™m up late and Iâ€™m drinking and reading over stories of people who have lost friends to suicide on this amazing site has always been one of the things that can make me feel better when I get in these slumps.
