We just put my dog down and I literally feel like I want to die.My dog was 7 years old and we just put him down today. He had a tumor the size of a football on his back leg. The vet told us it would be more humane to put him down instead of keeping him alive because he would be in pain. I was already extremely sad knowing that we were going to have to put him down but now that heâ€™s gone I feel like I want to run into the street to get killed by a car. Jeezus I have never felt like this why do I feel like this.
