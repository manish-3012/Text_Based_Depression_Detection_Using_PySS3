HurtI hurt myself today. My boyfriend and I got into a really bad argument that culminated in me scratching up my arms and legs, slapping myself, screaming, and finally going to kill myself. My boyfriend saw all this happening and stopped everything to take me home and be with someone. At least he had a decent response. Not like before. Before he would've left me. Wouldn't have cared. 

It's not my fault I have this mess in my head, but I'm the one that has to clean it up. That doesn't seem fair to me...
