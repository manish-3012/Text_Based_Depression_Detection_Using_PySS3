This is probably my fourth or fifth post here.Why do I keep coming back, I know I'm never going to hurt myself, but I want to die so bad, yet, I'm constantly terrified that I have cancer or something equally fatal. I can't help but to feel like a failure, and coming here doesn't help, I'll leave the post up for a week or two, maybe a month, none of the chat will help, then I'll delete every post I have and start over later. 

I always do this, if it's not posts, it's entire accounts, one bad moment will sway me into this "delete everything" mode. I'll delete my reddit accounts, gmail accounts, everything. None of my old friends on Facebook ever acknowledge me so I'll probably be deleting that soon. 

I'm too scared to go outside alone, I'm so fat and ugly, all I can think about is what others are thinking of me. As a result of being made fun of from my second year of second grade (I was "held back", which is a nice way to say "I was too stupid to pass the school year.") up to ninth grade I quit school. Keeping to myself wouldn't work, everybody had to make fun of me, because they knew I wouldn't do anything about it. 

Last week my cousin, who I haven't seen in a long time, asked me when I was to graduate. When I told her I quit she gave me this horrid look, and she almost laughed at me when I told her it was because I didn't like the people at school. She's a doctor now, so she's allowed to look down her nose at me. 

Moments are constantly building up that all lead to the fact I'm a failure who's too scared to change anything. All I want to do is die so I can stop feeling the regret, loneliness and ridicule. 

It's happened again, this post is very similar, if not exactly the same, as my last post. All I can do is sit and whine, I'm too weak to live, I don't deserve such a luxury. 

Yesterday I got in a fight with a friend over MSN, I finally told him how I felt about his smarmy fucking attitude he has about everything someone he thinks he's better than tells or shows him. I pretended to get over it and he said he'd be over today. I think I'll just stay in bed; he can go fuck himself.

Anyway, this has been pointless, it'll be deleted soon anyway.
