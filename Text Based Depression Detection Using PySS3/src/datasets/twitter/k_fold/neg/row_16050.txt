I've got everything I need so I don't know what's holding me backI've completely lost hope in everything and in things getting better. I don't even know why I stick around anymore. Especially since everyday has become a struggle to go on. I have the means and I want to go through with it so badly. Yet I guess that fear or cowardice is holding me back. It shouldn't though since I can finally have the sweet release of death I so crave.
