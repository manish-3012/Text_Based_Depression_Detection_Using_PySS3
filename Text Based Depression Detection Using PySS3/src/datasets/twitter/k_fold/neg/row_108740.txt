I'm all alonepeople just don't like me and I don't know why, I'm perfectly nice but people don't like me. maybe they don't like me because I'm nice 
I stopped biking a while ago because every time I went people would try to get as close to me as they can without hitting me, I was in the bike lane and they had no reason to do that
this is just one example of how I am clearly cursed I bet you, whoever is reading this doesn't like me for whatever reason I'm all alone
