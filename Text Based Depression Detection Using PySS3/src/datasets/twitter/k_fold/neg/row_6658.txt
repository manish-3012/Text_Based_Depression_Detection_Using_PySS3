I'm gonna have one hell of a going away party.Saving up money and stockpiling drugs, it'll be maybe two months before I have all the ones I want.  I'm already dabbling a little in my current supply, I'm all tweaked as I write this, but I'm using in moderation so once I'm all stocked I'll still have plenty and can go out feeling like a superhuman.  It'll be a kind of surprise party too, the surprise being which drug actually kills me.  I tried overdosing 3 times in the past month and the doses were pretty large, but I just ended up puking for hours or passing out, or both.  I just used what was accessible, that wasnt enough, so I need to make larger amounts accessible.  Next time I'll have enough, more than enough, my illicit shopping list is thousands of dollars.  Some of the drugs aren't likely to kill me but will be tons of fun, and I can experiment with large doses without the fear of a stroke or heart attack because the end goal is death anyway.  Other drugs on my list will snuff me easily, no need to take all that much for them to be lethal, so if I feel finished I can end it quick.  If I survive a while I could even mix everything together for my final high, why the fuck not, if it ends up being painful or something it wont be for long because I'll make sure the doses are so big it'd be impossible to stay alive for long.  I'll die in a pile of pills, crystals, powders, an array of bottles, some syringes, hundreds of empty whipits, and probably some puke because my body is surely going to fight against me.  I'm glad to die, but I'm sad I have to abandon my cat.  I've been distraught lately and she gets up in my face, sits right on my head, let's me hug her as I cry even though she probably doesnt like it.  I think she'll be upset or confused but end up fine, she'll still have a nice happy cat life  I just wish I could've been a better cat mom.  I'll lock her out of my room when I die.  She'll never see me again, and she wont know why the person who raised her is gone, but she'll be fine.

I hope this goes unread and does not receive a response.  I've reached out and reached out over and over and I received no help.  No one cares about suicide threats, they must doubt the seriousness of it or think it's attention thing, but hat just inspires me more, makes me more determined to prove I'm not an attention whore or a liar or drama queen.  One time I confessed to a mistakenly assumed friend that my suicidal ideations were becoming more of a threat and I was told "chin up bud."  Could you think of a more indifferent response than that?  Clearly uninterested but doesn't want to be flat out rude, so chin up bud is what they went with.  Chin up bud.  When people are standing at the edge of a bridge preparing to leap, just shout "Chin up bud!"  That's just how people are.  No compassion or empathy, opposed to exerting any effort for anything at all, fake and apathetic.  I'm not one of them and I'm done living among them like I am.

Im not so high anymore and I no longer feel like typing.  No one read this and no one cares because there's an endless amount of people announcing their impending suicide on Reddit.  Doesnt matter, this is just a little journal,  I'm gonna have the best day of my life in just  a couple months, then I'll be dead, and maybe I'll write a little journal then too, maybe as I'm dying, if I can manage that.  Vomiting and sweating and blue in the lips, still managing to write some final words.  Maybe something simple.  Finally.

 Whoever finds my body will think it's such a gruesome tragedy, but for me it'll be a victory.  I did it, even though everyone says you can't kill yourself, it's wrong, it's selfish, it'll get better if you wait.  Despite the bullshit arguments I did it and I even had fun doing it.  I really can't wait.
