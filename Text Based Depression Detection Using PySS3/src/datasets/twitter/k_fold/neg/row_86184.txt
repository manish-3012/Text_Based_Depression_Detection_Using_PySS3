How do you overcome your fear of death?I've pretty much reached the end of the road, my personality has been sucked away from me and I don't know who or what I am. I've become a sociopath who doesn't even recognize who his family members are or why he should love them, when I used to be a very caring person.

I've got the method down and I know how I'm going to write notes, only thing is it is absolutely impossible currently for me to go out peacefully like I want to. Nothing in this world eases my mind, even pot makes me anxious. Alcohol might work but I don't have any. I've been scared of dying since I was a kid, I would cry to my mom about how I thought I was going to go to hell one day. So, this is a very deep rooted fear and is in fact the only thing aside from people that still scares me, and the only thing keeping me on this planet. And by only I do mean only. I've got nothing left.
