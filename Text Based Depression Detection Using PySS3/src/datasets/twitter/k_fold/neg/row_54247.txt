I wish I could be more that a secondary character...Hi! Today is the worst day of my life, I thought so much about why I should live...
I feel like I donâ€™t fit anywhere, nobody wants me,
nobody cares about me...
And honestly there isnâ€™t even a real person that I love in my life...
Tomorrow, is my fucking birthday, I donâ€™t wanna get older...
Iâ€™m just wasting my time, and I donâ€™t think I found joy in anything anymore..
Maybe the world would be a better place without me? I donâ€™t even the protagonist of my own life!
I read so much stories about depression, that is one day is gonna be okay, you gonna find a person that would make you feel complete..
But this day, never came.
Iâ€™m useless, my family wonâ€™t and donâ€™t help me at all..
My sister is a bitch, she laugh about everything, and she asks me why I canâ€™t be normal, my mother cares only about his boyfriend..
And Iâ€™m so tired of begin verbally abused...
When I cut myself, I wish my mother wonâ€™t find out because she star screaming at me and say â€œWhy canâ€™t you be normal!!!â€
I hate myself so much, my father already did the job of ruining my mind.
I always wished to have a brother, yâ€™know, brother and sister....
ThÃ¨ point..?
This life is so dull..
Why going on ? 
Thank you for listening.
