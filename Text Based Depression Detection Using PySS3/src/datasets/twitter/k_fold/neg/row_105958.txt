Youâ€™re the worst/best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me.Thereâ€™s just too much weight. If I had my gun Iâ€™d pull the trigger this time. I was too much of a pussy to do it last time. 

â€œNobody fucking cares for anyone but themselvesâ€ 
How ironic, look whoâ€™s talking. I gave my life to you. Wherever you go from here youâ€™re taking a huge piece of me with you. 

You were never worth my time or love. I gave you everything I had to offer and time and time again you left me waiting for a text or a call that would never come. Crying my eyes out at night hoping, praying that you would make it to the next morning. 

I shouldâ€™ve left a long, long time ago. I shouldâ€™ve quit the moment I realized it was hurting me more than it was helping you. But I stayed. I stayed because I love you. You donâ€™t deserve it for all you do to me. You write me off as if I am nothing. Youâ€™ve always taken me for granted. Nobody will ever love you as much as I do, yet you still canâ€™t even reserve a day for me in your â€œbusyâ€ schedule. You never have time for me. I donâ€™t know if you donâ€™t like me and you donâ€™t want to tell me. I donâ€™t know if you donâ€™t like spending time with me and you canâ€™t tell me. I have no idea what the hell your problem is. 

Yeah, I know youâ€™re depressed. I know itâ€™s hard to get up. But for ONCE. ONE TIME, I think you could drag your ass out of bed and come meet me. Do it FOR ME! Iâ€™ve done so much for you. Iâ€™ve left my friends, my family, movies, games, Iâ€™ve left it all to be at your beck and call. And Iâ€™ve never gotten so much as a thank you. You canâ€™t even take five minutes out of your day to come give me a hug. 

Everyone else is sooooo selfish, but when you donâ€™t want to meet me you just donâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s no problem for you when youâ€™re having other people over or going to other peopleâ€™s parties and getting drunk out of your head. I just wanted one day. I just wanted to say goodbye before you left. 

Thereâ€™s so much I could blame you for. So, so much. But I canâ€™t blame you, itâ€™s my fault. I stayed even when I began to fall. I knew it wasnâ€™t healthy. I stayed because I know youâ€™re a wonderful person past the depression. I stayed because I know what youâ€™re like when youâ€™re happy. I stayed because I have hope for your future. 

Youâ€™re hurting me.

I know you have your excuses. I know youâ€™ll be mad at me if you ever read this. â€œHow dare I accuse you of not caring for me.â€ Actions speak louder than words. When have you been there for me? When? Physically, not for a while. Verbally/mentally, God, not for a really long time. Everythingâ€™s always â€œtoo seriousâ€ with me. I always â€œoverthink everythingâ€. 

Well you know what?? Maybe if you STOPPED thinking for one goddamn minute, got out of your bed, and just TRIED to be happy with the people that care about you, with the people that love you, with the people that would give their left arm to see you smile, the people like me, youâ€™d realize that this world isnâ€™t such a terrible place after all.

Please, of course I donâ€™t understand you, of course I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re going through. One thing I know is that you sure as hell donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going through either. You think you know everything. Stop, you donâ€™t. You donâ€™t know how important you are to me. You donâ€™t know how much I wanted just ONE DAY with you. You donâ€™t know how much you hurt me, and youâ€™ll never, EVER, know how much I love you. There are no words that could describe it.

Iâ€™ve given everything to make you happy and you just push it away like you do with everything else that isnâ€™t your ideal friend/relationship/situation.

You may say you care about me, but as Iâ€™ve always said, actions speak louder than words. You, my friend, seem to have that backwards.

Iâ€™ll always love you unconditionally. I just wish youâ€™d try love me even a quarter as much.
