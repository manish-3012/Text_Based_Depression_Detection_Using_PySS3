Who here knows someone who went through with it?I don't plan on ending my life anytime soon, but I think eventually I will.

I don't want to hurt anyone though. I wouldn't want to cause someone else pain by killing myself. My family is mainly the reason I haven't fully considered it yet. Besides my family maybe a few people would be hurt, but I don't even know about that.

How has it impacted your life? How is daily life affected by it (if at all)?
