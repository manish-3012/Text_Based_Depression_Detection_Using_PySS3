The good advice you once gave me has become a curseI made a post here on another account about 4 years ago saying how i couldn't get a girlfriend and alot of things like that, 1 guy made a big comment about all the stuff i said, but the big advice he gave me was that i shouldn't look for a girlfriend, try to build your confidence first, get a career, get some money, go to the gym and clean myself up first, i tried to followed that advice and i did successfully, i avoided women as much as i could so that i wouldn't get tempted to ask any of them out, if i saw a girl approaching me i would try to just avoid her. Now i still use this advice even though i know i've basically 'completed' his advice and maybe now girls will like me but its like my instinct to avoid girls.

I am cursed to never have love.
