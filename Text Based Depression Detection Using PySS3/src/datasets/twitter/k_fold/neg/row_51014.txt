Me 30 minutes ago: *thinking of a suicide plan, going online thinking about buying a gun and shooting myself in the shed* - Me now: â€œI donâ€™t feel suicidal anymore.â€ Wtf brain?!This happened to me yesterday. Why does my brain do this. I now want to stay alive but I know for a fact that Iâ€™ll get the thought of wanting to kill myself
