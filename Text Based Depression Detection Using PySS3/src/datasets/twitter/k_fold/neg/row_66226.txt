Strict Parenting leads to a shitty childGrowing up my parents were strict. Strict to the point where I lived in fear of them. I didn't know that parents actually showed affection to their kids, I didn't know that parents actually bought their kids toys and didn't call them spoiled brats all the time. I didn't know that parents didn't throw heavy objects at their children when they wanted them to shut up. I didn't know that children weren't supposed to sleep in the garage and that it wasn't normal for kids to get kicked out of their house with nothing but their pajamas in the middle of winter. This fear of my parents fucked me up more than anything in my life. I grew up seeing other kids with loving families and happy homes while I grew up with abuse and the regret of being alive. I'm going to hang myself soon, as a final fuck you to my parents for stealing my happiness. For taking away the light from my eyes and for ruining me to the point where I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm done with this life and everything in it. I know anything I do will be sabotaged by my parents anyways.
