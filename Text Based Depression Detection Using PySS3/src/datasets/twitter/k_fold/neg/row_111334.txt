Being suicidal taught me that money means nothing.
I always lived knowing I would end my life at some point, I always felt that I loved too much and was too much for people. Depression, bipolar and then finally diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. 
I grew up lying to people about being okay, smiling to strangers and getting to know people, having short term friendships with people who would call themselves my friends for their whole life, surrounding myself with people who cared but at a certain distance, in a certain amount of time. At some point everybody would leave, from not talking anymore, distance or frustration. 
I have leaned how to be lonely but yet care for those still around, I tried to do my best but hurt many people in the process and Iâ€™m sorry for everyone I disappointed with my behaviour, for every time I made people cry or mad at me. 
I came to realise that life is priceless, people tried to help me economically in order to have a better life but this just makes me feel awful so.. All my life is worth is money? People offer money to help, because Iâ€™m too much to be kept in their lives or under their roof, I was too much for my family so to rehab you go, and so on with every relationship and friendship I had. 
Suicidal thoughts taught that life is priceless, you canâ€™t pay to have a good laugh staying hours on the phone with your friend who lives in another country, you canâ€™t pay - unless it is a super cheap flight - to wake up next to your favourite person, in my case Adam. you canâ€™t pay to hug your long gone dad. Loneliness taught me that being close to nature has no price, you canâ€™t pay to wake to a beautiful sunrise every day, walk barefoot on fresh and wet grass, hear the birds and see the beauty. 
You canâ€™t pay or buy love and care, you canâ€™t make someone love you back or pay them to put their life together, you can just appreciate and love the natural beauty this world gave us and for now this is enough to keep me safe and alive. 

Maybe thatâ€™s my last post, from the earth you came and to it you go.
