Torturous mind trapSo Iâ€™m (29f) in a state of mind where I canâ€™t escape my own thoughts. My friends want me to kill myself. They donâ€™t say it but the way they act towards me makes it evident that they want me to die and disappear. This haunts me and never goes away. Even when Iâ€™m away from them their voices echo in my head of all the times they made fun of me and made me feel my lowest. I donâ€™t wish to live anymore. Iâ€™m afraid of everything and Iâ€™m forcing myself to stay anonymous because I canâ€™t bear to speak up and get yelled at. This is the absolute worst Iâ€™ve ever felt in my life. I feel like something has been done to me that I donâ€™t even know about. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t have control over my own body anymore. They control me. Iâ€™m left alone with my feelings and Iâ€™m scared to die but itâ€™s the only way out. Iâ€™ve been praying that someone kills me, kidnaps me, steals me and stabs me to death. Iâ€™ve never wanted to know what itâ€™s like to have my throat cut so bad. Iâ€™d do anything to be set free and I canâ€™t ever be. I canâ€™t even feel safe outside. Inside. Or anywhere. Iâ€™m no longer a person. Iâ€™m a ghost. Or so it seems. Iâ€™m trapped in limbo. I cry more than twice a day. I just wanna sell everything and do drugs because thatâ€™s the only thing that makes it go away.
