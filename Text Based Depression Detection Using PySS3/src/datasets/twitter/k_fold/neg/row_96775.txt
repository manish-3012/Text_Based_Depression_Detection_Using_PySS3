Im doing itI'm going to get a gun from a local gun store, I'm gonna go out to the side of a lake or pond near my house, and do it.
I can't take living in this mind, I can't take sleeping, or being awake anymore. I don't want to be in this mind, I can't be in this mind, noone exists in this mind. Nobody cares that I'm doing the bitter dance of loneliness, fading into space. That I have no love, that I never have had any love, that i can't have love, that I've always been alone, I've never met anyone. I can't be in this mind, this mind can't do anything, this mind is stuck in an infinite pattern, I dont want to be in this mind. I have to get rid of this mind, this mind isnt fit for this reality. I don't exist here, nobody even knew I was here, and im gone, I was nothing. I was never anything but this mind, and I can't be in this mind.
