I want to kill myself because living everyday is a hellish nightmare.my mom was abusive and mean growing up and now â€œsheâ€™s changed and wants to be a supportive momâ€ i love her but i donâ€™t trust her. 
my dad worked out of town during my childhood and teen years so i never really got to know him and now i live with him and he always tryâ€™s to hug me and i donâ€™t know why but it freaks me out
my ex boyfriend cheated on me for 11 months, beat me when i found out, said the most disgusting disturbing awful things you can think of to me, we broke up months ago and he still harasses me to this day. phone calls, texts, posting nude photos of me that he took, constantly trying to get me back and when that doesnâ€™t work trying to get me to kill myself. 
i was sexual assaulted as a child and it is not something many people know and he is constantly threatening to â€œexpose meâ€ as he says. 
my best friend has got her self a new boyfriend and sheâ€™s completely ditched me for him and normally i wouldnâ€™t be too upset but i just needed someone and i thought maybe out of everyone the girl iâ€™ve know since i was 6 ( iâ€™m now 20) might be there for me even just a bit. but iâ€™m completely alone. 
my brother is an asshole whoâ€™s only concern is himself, heâ€™s a very mean bitter person and i donâ€™t know why. 
iâ€™ve got no one and my hearts so broken and heavy iâ€™m too exhausted to even try to open up to someone again. i either sleep for 2 hours or 14 thereâ€™s almost never an in between. i self harm because itâ€™s easier to feel the pain there than in my heart and itâ€™s pain i can control. iâ€™m so scared because everyday i have strong urges to end it all, jump out of a moving car head first, or drive off a cliff near where i live or drive into the divider on the highway, cut myself, stab myself, hang myself. i think about doing these things all the time and iâ€™m exhausted i just want the thought, feelings urges, i want the depression and anxiety towards new people to stop i just want it all to stop and iâ€™m hopeless. the medication isnâ€™t working. i still love my abusive ex iâ€™m heartbroken by all that he done to me and how he could say he loves me and then do all that he done. and there was a lot. 
iâ€™m tired and sad and numb now. i canâ€™t talk to anyone about this because no one understands and iâ€™m sick and tired of being treated like iâ€™m broken and like everyone is always pitying me. iâ€™m fed up too. i donâ€™t see a way out and i donâ€™t see the harassment stopping any time soon.
