i've had enoughi'm done. there's nothing left for me anymore. i've tried and hoped and persevered for years but none of the pills or therapists or positive vibes i've attempted have ever really made me feel better. i've been thinking about how to do it and it'll take some time and planning but i like it. i can count on one hand who would actually care if i died. they say to think of them to stop you but at what point can you just say "fuck it" and put yourself and what you need first? i've been like this as long as i can remember. i've seen too many good people, people i care about, be in pain and destroy themselves or become addicts or just sad sacks of shit or die to think that it gets better for all of us if we just do our best and talk about it and "find something you love," which is as easy to do in actuality as just growing wings to fly. the cons outweigh the pros right now. i've had some good times and now i want to clock myself out, as is every human's right. i wrote a really good note last night and i regret deleting it.
