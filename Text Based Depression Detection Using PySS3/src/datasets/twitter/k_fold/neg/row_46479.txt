Why canâ€™t I be happyI havenâ€™t felt happy in so long man. Before I never even had to think about it, I just lived my life. I have nothing now. I am nothing now. I am so lonely and yet no matter how many times I reach out or someone tries to connect with me, I just canâ€™t connect. Itâ€™s like the real me is locked up somewhere and I have no idea how to get him out. What can I do guys? Iâ€™m so lost and hopeless.
