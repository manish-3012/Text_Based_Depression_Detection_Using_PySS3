My mom is suicidal and I think I'm partly to blame.Mom has been going through a messy divorce for years now and my father has just signed the papers. Even though my farther has been mentally and emotionally abusive my mom doesn't want to live without him, she's a firm believer is "Til death do us part" and I'm sure she's planning something. I called an Ambulance for her yesterday but nothing was really done (this is the second time we've done it). I haven't spoken to my father in 3-4 years due to the way he treats and abuses the family, I was even homeless at one point because of it. My mother wants me to talk to my father and make up with him. I'm so tired and worried, I've been sitting next to her while she quietly writes a will. I just want things to be okay. I don't know what to do, I'm so tired.
