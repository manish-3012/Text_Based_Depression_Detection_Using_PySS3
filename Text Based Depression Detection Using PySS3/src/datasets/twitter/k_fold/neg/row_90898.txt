I wish my life would just endI don't even know hot to start this....I've been unemployed for a year. I've applied for more than a hundred jobs and most didn't even respond back. I've tried so many things on internet to make money. I have even written a novel and published it through Amazon  but nobody bought it so far( it's been only 2 days though so things might change). I spend hundreds of hours on it, my back aches from sitting all the time, my eyes are red and veiny and my sleep schedule is a complete mess because of writing. 
What else am I supposed to do?
I've tried so many things to turn my life around. I'm still at my parents'. We're on the poorer side and I wanted to at least make them a good Christmas by buying them something nice but I don't even have money to do that. 
I'm thinking all the time about killing myself but I don't know how or even if I would be able to do it.
My mother is angry at me for being sad and depressed... like what the hell. I have no one to turn to.
