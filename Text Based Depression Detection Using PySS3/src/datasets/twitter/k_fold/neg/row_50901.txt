IdkEverything hurts and no one knows the extent of it. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore; I canâ€™t see myself going anywhere in life, itâ€™s all too hard for me. I have no motivation to be here anymore. I donâ€™t want to get up in the morning, I donâ€™t want to go to school, I donâ€™t want to keep pretending that Iâ€™m okay while I listen to everybody elseâ€™s problems and try to help them, I donâ€™t want to keep hiding how I feel and crying and worrying and feeling like shit for feeling this way, I donâ€™t want to keep being a sad little piece of shit whoâ€™s far too dependent on the people around her, who canâ€™t even go to the supermarket sometimes without having a panic attack. Iâ€™m sick of dragging him down with me, the one person I rly care about and heâ€™s forced to deal with me and my anxious breakdowns and depressive episodes and self harm and self loathing and I hate that he has to deal with me. Sometimes I wish I didnâ€™t love him so much or that I hadnâ€™t met him at all so then I could die in peace and not feel guilty for leaving him when I know he needs me as much as I need him; when I know that if I went heâ€™d be next because the same way that heâ€™s keeping me here: Iâ€™m keeping him here. I wish he could find other happiness, in someone better than me so I could finally end my life and not have to deal with the way I am anymore. I feel like a waste of everyoneâ€™s time and money, a waste of space and oxygen, just a waste of potential. My family expects me to be someone I canâ€™t be anymore. They expect young me who used her gifts and worked hard; who was sporty and smart and creative. Instead they have me now: whoâ€™s lack of motivation to live has ruined her gifted mind and body; who barely wants to move or get out of bed. It hurts so much to disappoint them all like this. I feel so useless, so worthless, like the biggest waste of everything thatâ€™s gone into my being here. I hate me. I want to die. Thereâ€™s so much more I want to say that I just canâ€™t put into coherent words, fuck half of this isnâ€™t even coherent. Iâ€™m sorry to anyone who wastes their time reading my bullshit.
