I'm dreading my birthday this year.I'm going to be 26. I'll be off my parent's insurance. This sucks a lot, as I'm on a battery of medication that helps fight off everything wrong with my body. I have chronic migraines, bipolar disorder, and am transitioning. I'm going to have to pick which I want to keep doing this year. It makes me wish I was never born honestly. I hate that my body seems to want to torture me every time I wake up. I feel completely broken and alone. Days like this it's hard not to think about this looming thing either, as I'm in the middle of a migraine, feeling like I need to vomit everywhere, and dysphoric. I almost hope I get killed somehow later this year so I don't have to suffer anymore.
