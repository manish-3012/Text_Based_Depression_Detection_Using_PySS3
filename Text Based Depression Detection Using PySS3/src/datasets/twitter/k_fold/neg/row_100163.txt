First time feeling like thisLife gets tough but I never felt like I wanted to Kill myself until today. I stopped eating last week in hopes that malnutrition will kill me (itâ€™s stupid, I know). Right now, after a mental breakdown and lord of crying.... I am laying in my closet. Found this group and hope to hear nice things. As a young black woman, I feel like all the cards are stacked against me. The micro aggressions I deal with every day for the last couple of years come back and tell me Iâ€™m worthless. So I try hard to not become a stereotype. I do what I can by not having an attitude, regulating my weight and be more feminine but nothing fixes how much I hate the hate we get for existing. I feel worthless today. Might be better tomorrow but today is today.
