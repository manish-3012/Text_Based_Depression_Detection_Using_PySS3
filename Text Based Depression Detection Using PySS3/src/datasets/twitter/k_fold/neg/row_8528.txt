Will be there in under 30 minutesIf nothing changes I'll be out in some minutes and at that place in something under 30 minutes for sure. How long I will sit there until I am ready to jump, idk yet. But not long enough for anyone I know to wake up for sure (02:40 here)


I am not scared of killing myself or surviving any attempts. But what I am scared of is what it'd do to the people I know. I only care about others and not the slightest about myself. But I am not really able to stand that me anymore right now, not for anyone I know.
