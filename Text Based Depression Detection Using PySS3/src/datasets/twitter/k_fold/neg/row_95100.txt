"Deserve's got nothing to do with it" - Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, 1992)Of course I don't "deserve" to die.  I know I have value.  I *want* to die and finally get some goddamn peace and quiet where nobody's asking me to do banal shit for them.

The real question is whether or not I "deserve" a choice, and whether or not I need to make that choice right now.
