Sometimes I feel like I just can't go on...I'm 34 have never kissed a woman, have never been in a relationship... it's the thing I want the most but I've lost hope of it ever happening... I've tried joining social groups, I've tried to land a job abroad to try in a different country (I live in a third world country where people don't do online dating which makes things harder)... however all my efforts have been for nothing....I feel so pathetic and disgusting seeing every girl I ever had a crush on now married to someone much better than myself... seeing everybody I grew up with made progress in life except myself, ect... I feel like I'm just not good enough and should have never been born.... I don't want to die, I'm afraid of death but kinda wish I had never existed in the first place...... I see my life passing by while every day despite all my efforts all I do is feel miserable I'll never be in a relationship and think of my own dead...
