I just need somebody to talk to. I'm slipping into a depression. I don't want to kill myself. I'm too scared to kill myself. I just need a friend. Somebody to talk to. But, I have nobody. I can't talk to my boyfriend. My family won't listen. I don't have any friends. I just need somebody, anybody to talk to before it's too late. I'm sorry for wasting your time with this cry for help.
