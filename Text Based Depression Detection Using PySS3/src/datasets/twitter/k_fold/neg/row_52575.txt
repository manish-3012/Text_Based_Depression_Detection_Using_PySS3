I want to kill myself tonight. I donâ€™t know if I can or will but I definitely want toI feel terrible and am extremely anxious right now. Things that should only take me an hour to do take me a whole day. Iâ€™m running out of time for important deadlines and yet I can barely make myself to do these things. I know how important it is to apply to colleges but whatâ€™s the point if I know Iâ€™ll be rejected anyway? Iâ€™m so exhausted. I used to miss being younger when I didnâ€™t feel like this but now whenever I think back to any point in my life I get a bad feeling and feel disgusted. 
I just donâ€™t like myself and the fact I struggle to get along with others just proves this is how other people feel too. Reaching my long term goal is so unlikely and I finally got confirmation today that it wonâ€™t happen. I pretty much have one friend and I feel like Iâ€™m just a huge burden on them and will only hold them back when they go to college. They might be upset for a week or two but in the long run itâ€™ll be better
