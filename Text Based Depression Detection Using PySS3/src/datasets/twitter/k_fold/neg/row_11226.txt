I'm thinking about it......I just don't know how to do it....I'm thinking about killing myself. The girl I loved cheated on me and left me with 2 stds. Ive had to have acid poured on my dick in order to treat the bumps caused by one of them.....She's still posting on gonewild, I introduced her to this site...it was our thing. I got a flat tire, I'm about to lose my job, I have no money and the worst part about all of this? This is par for the course. My life has always been this shitty and I've tried to kill myself before. I got over depression and my life got better. But I know now it doesn't matter what the hell I do....my life is always going to suck. Even if I'm this awesome guy. Life still shits on me. I'm about to lose my job because I can't FUCKING get up in the morning when my alarms (plural) go off despite the fact that I exercise, eat right and go to bed early. I'm just a fuck up..........I always will be. What's the point in going on? What's a good way to kill myself? I'm thinking drugs but I don't have any......
