is it irresponsible of me to try and and talk to friends and family about my suicidal thoughts?I may consider making an xpost to relationshipadvice but for now it'll stay

Im going through a really rough patch in my life currently. I lost the woman I truly cared for partly because of my depression. I made her feel incredibly guilty because she blamed herself for whenever I was in a bad mood or when she treated me harshly on some occasions on how I acted. Odds are it will be better that we're no longer together in the long run but for now it's deeply tied to why I want to hurt myself and why I get so down on myself.

lately ive turned to some friends of mine and family for support and comfort, but I feel like im putting incredible pressure on them to make me feel better about myself. I really dont want to do that to them, or anyone for that matter and Im not exactly sure on how to handle things. any advice would be great.
