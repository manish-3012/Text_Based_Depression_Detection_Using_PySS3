I don't want to exist anymore.I feel like a failure at all times. I feel inadequate in my social life, in my work, in my everyday life. I cannot maintain friendships and relationships.  I cannot love anyone else because I dont love myself.  I only break their hearts and lose them. I dont have any friends. I dont have anyone to talk to. 
I am dealing with constant mobbing at my job. I cannot quit my job because it is really hard to find a new job in my country especially if you dont know someone powerful. Besides my parents will say that I am a failure if I quit my job. 
I am an adult but I don't have my own life. My parents  always control my every move. They dont even let me have my own place eventhough I earn enough money to support myself. They need to know where I am and who I am with at all times. I hide my tears from them, I hide my feelings from them because they only judge.
I feel worthless at all times. I don't have enough strenght. I dont want to exist anymore.  I used to think about my family when I try to get rid of suicidal thoughts  but this does't work for me anymore.  I just don't want to exist.
In the past I've had "professional" help but in reality they were not helpful they were only condescending. Gave me some meds and saying my problems were nothing compared to other patients. 
I feel trapped. Life does not have meaning for me. I lost all my hope. I am constantly thinking ending my life. I only postpone it because I know they will save me. I dont have the strenght to deal with the aftermath if they save me. I am counting the days to the day my life ends naturally. I am waiting.... I wish and pray for a natural disaster or an accident to happen...( It is more likely to die from a natural disaster or an accident, (or murdered on the street) than dying at old age in my country.)
I feel like I dont deserve anything. I dont expect anything from anyone anymore. 
I just want someone else to hear my voice without judging me.
