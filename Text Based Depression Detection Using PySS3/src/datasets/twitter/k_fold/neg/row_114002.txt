Please helpHello. I am 12 years old and struggling. I want everything to end as I have constantly been feeling sadness, betrayal and been rejected by multiple girls.  My parents say it's just hormones, but I genuinely want to die. Everything is just a cycle of sadness, betrayal and fatigue, and I can't do this anymore. I plan to inhale gas till I die or overdose on all the pills in my house, but I just can't do this anymore. Please help, I am alone and my parents don't care.
