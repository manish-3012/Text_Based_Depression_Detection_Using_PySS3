My life has been put on hold, and I can't seem to do anything about it.I've been searching for a software engineering job for the past two years. I've been out of college for the past year, living at home. I don't do anything. I just apply to jobs, exercise, eat, sleep, and bullshit for the remainder. I don't really have any friends or a social life. I feel like everything in my life and in my mind has been waiting for me to get a job, to get out of the house, to escape this rut where it takes so much will power to do even the simplest things, but I get rejected at every interview, even when I'm lucky enough to get a referral.

I just want to have a wife and kids someday, something that it seems like everyone has, but I'm already almost 23 and I feel so hopelessly far from anything resembling a normal path of life that it feels impossible.

I think I'm good at what I do, but at this point, even if that were true the massive gap on my resume is enough to scare away employers. I just don't know what to do to move forward, and I have no one I can go to for help or guidance. Life was awful and lonely enough when I was in school, but this is absolute hell. I just feel trapped, destined to be a NEET loser fuck up, wasted potential, a total burden to everyone who is forced to be around me. 

I just wish there was some way I could feel useful, in even the smallest way so that I wouldn't feel like such a miserable failure.

What do you do to feel useful, SW?
