What am I doing?I actually cut myself with a shaving razor yesterday. Nothing but a couple tiny cuts but it was deep enough to bleed and it hurt. I'm so disappointed in myself and I feel like such failure. I haven't showered in a month and I don't brush my teeth anymore. I can hardly talk to people and I never feel like I belong in any social situation. The only thing I enjoy doing anymore is looking at weird porn. Late at night all I can think about is hurting people I don't like. I've tried to overdose before and I don't know why I shouldn't try again. With my current medicine it would probably work this time.
