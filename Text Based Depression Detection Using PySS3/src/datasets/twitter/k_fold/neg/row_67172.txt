I don't know what to live forI'm in my third year of a college degree I hate and I'm gonna graduate with so much dept. I have no interest in working in this field. I'm only 23 and been diagnosed with a chronic intestinal illness that keeps ruining me from being able to enjoy life and be able to do things that most people my age do. I can't eat many things or drink and I feel like such a freak for it. I used to have friends but I've been ill and I stopped going out and doing things because I've been sick so often. I'm socially awkward and shy and have never dated anyone or done anything sexual and I feel like I'm going to die alone because I'm such an insecure mess. My finances, health and future are all falling apart and I'm exhausted. I don't really know what to live for. Yay I'm gonna get to graduate with a degree that is not at all what I want to do (I can't afford to do another degree and I can't do a minor with this) and then I'm gonna have a dull and sad life knowing that I fucked my own life up by choosing the wrong thing to study. My health might get better or it might not. I don't really care and I've lost the motivation to fight. I just want to sleep.
