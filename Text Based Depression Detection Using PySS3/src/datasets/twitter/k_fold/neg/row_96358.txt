THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTJust let me have my platform for two fucking minutes. 

DO NOT KILL YOURSELF. Want to know why? Any story is a tragedy. IF YOU LET IT BE. If you could find it in yourself to give a flying shit about anyone else in the world you can read below.

I don't expect any of you almost dead people to give a fuck.

I barely give a fuck about me.

I am a 32 year old female. I am engaged to a man. I have no children. I have young siblings that I raised. 

I just visited this subreddit for the first time tonight.

Most of you seem to be teenagers or young adults in high school or college. That doesn't mean to discount these feelings and experiences, but this is normal.

EVERY TEENAGER FEELS SUICIDAL. I felt that way every day. My parents were horrible. My first love didn't even break up with me. He just didn't talk to me again. So in silence I listened to Tori Amos and contemplated suicide. I was a straight A student yet took a bunch of pills and stayed home. 

WE ARE ALL THE SAME!

I used my period as an excuse. I obviously didn't succeed. My friends at the time also felt that way. WE FELT SUICIDAL AT 20-29 as well. EVERYONE FEELS THAT WAY. We all curse and do drugs and don't give a flying fuck about our terrible families. THAT IS NORMAL. BLAH BLAH BLAH.

At this age, you start to realize your parents are full of shit. Your uncles, aunts, cousins, are full of shit. Society sucks and it's all shit. OF COURSE IT IS! So get used to it. But DON'T KILL YOURSELF! Why? I thought about it many times. BUT WHY DO IT?

This is a taboo topic in the United States at least. But I want you to know that these feelings will pass. They come up now and then for me. I may be more well adjusted now as a 32 year old, but I still feel my dad raping me and still have nightmares. Those types of reasons for killing yourself don't just disappear.

I used to eat my lunch in bathroom stalls. And dream about slitting my wrists in high school and college. But now I am a successful woman in NYC.
