Hey I still see youJust wanted to pop in before bed again and remind you that even if it feels like the world doesnâ€™t acknowledge you, I still see you and I acknowledge that you are not some stupid person who doesnâ€™t deserve to be around. I know it can feel like everyone hates you so why not end it but isnâ€™t the case. Even if it is just that one little kid you gave a smile to there is someone who appreciates what you have done and would be willing to support you in whatever way they could. Same goes for feeling like you arenâ€™t special so why bother staying around (something I struggle with a good bit). You have some skill about you that makes you special in your own way, whether it be something rare like knowing how to blacksmith or something even rarer like treating people kindly, youâ€™ve got something good about you. I hope you will consider sticking around a bit longer, even if it is just a day or two, to figure out what it is that makes you special and realize even slightly itâ€™s nice to have you around. You donâ€™t need to focus on what makes you special to others, what matters more is what YOU believe is special about yourself. That is truly what makes you unique. 

Hope this helped even just a little bit, goodnight.
