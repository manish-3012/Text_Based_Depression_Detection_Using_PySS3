Hey, I need helpHi, I'm having suicidal thoughts more frequently this week, and its becoming unbearable. I tried calling the suicide hotline in my country and they don't answer either number. My therapist is on vacations right now and don't wanna bother them. I've been taking my medication as usual but something is off. I took an extra dose so I can at least sleep tonight and forget this feelings but its not working.
The temptation to just gulp down every single pill is increasing. I just wanna sleep and never wake up again. I'm tired of holding myself up for others. If all I do in my life is caring for how my actions affect others I'll never get anything done. actions. I think this may be a sign that my time has come.
