Can't stop thinking about suicide.A coworker recently killed himself and it's all I can think about. I don't think I'm depressed and I don't really want to kill myself but I keep thinking about it. All I can do is imagine suicide and write shitty poetry about it. I am wondering if I need help before it gets worse. Thanks for listening.
