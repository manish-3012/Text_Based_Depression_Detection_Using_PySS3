Debating life in my car currently.I am currently sitting in my car debating on ending my life. I know it's not a socially acceptable option and it would hurt everyone around me, but it's becoming too much to handle. I've been through worse in life, but lately, I'm not seeing a point. Why continue to push myself through this pain only to be hurt more? 


I don't know, I am really depressed and having intrusive suicidal thoughts. The worst part is no one knows how much I am breaking inside. They only see the portrait i paint myself into everyday. 


I want it all to end, I'm tired of feeling this way. I wish to be happy, but maybe death is the only way I will finally be free from all this.
