Life has become such a burdenI have divorced parents, terrible anxiety depression, and daily panic attacks. I have tried to get help but my parents donâ€™t do well with mental issues and tend to ignore them until they â€œgo away.â€ I have been contemplating suicide for a while and the only thing that keep me from doing it is my two year old sister. I want to see her grow up and be there for her but I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this for.  I might finally get the courage to do it sometime soon and maybe then I will finally be at peace with terrible person I am for making the ones I love suffer.
