Post-cutting thoughtsIve just cut up all of my leg out of frustration at myself and feeling awful. I feel worse now that I have done it. Note this isnt the first time ive cut myself. Ive cut from my thigh to just below my knee. I dont even know why i did it and now that I have i feel worse, I almost want to go back and cut more out of myself. This is the punishment I have given myself and I regret it yet I also dont. 

How do i stop myself from doing this i hate it and want to stop but i just can't.
