If I didn't have my daughter, I'd kill myself.That sounds like a positive statement, but it isn't. I want to die. I hate living. The pain my suicide would cause her is the reason why I stick around. I love her too much. So instead I have to just suffer and suffer for *decades* so that she won't be devastated.
