Seriously considering finishing it tonight.They say "it'll get better" it never has, it's only gotten worse. I can't sleep or eat much anymore, today I upset my grandmother, it made me feel like such an asshole, I hate myself. My mom told me to grow a back bone and stop letting people walk all over me, which was kind of humiliating to me. One of my own friends called me a little bitch for being this way. I'm so tired, I just don't want to do this anymore.
