I just donâ€™t know if I can make it any longerI have PTSD. For years, Iâ€™ve tried every medication, every therapy. Nothing makes it better. And now tonight, the one person who I can always talk to when Iâ€™m upset, has turned their back on me and said they donâ€™t care. And I canâ€™t describe it but having this person not care anymore is the last straw. They meant the world to me, the only true friend Iâ€™ve ever had. My life has been so painful with them, I canâ€™t see anyway without them. Iâ€™ve made it through so much. I went from failing school and having nowhere to live to immigrating to a new country alone, getting my finances together and now being very close to going to law school. My family thinks Iâ€™m some success story. The truth is all I feel is sadness and crying everyday and I donâ€™t see any hope for my future. I was better off homeless, at least then I didnâ€™t have the trauma in my life yet.
