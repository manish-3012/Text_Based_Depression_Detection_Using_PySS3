Just found outDidn't know queitapine can be used to treat for anger. I still have a bottle left. I was planning to suicide in the car tonight and drink some beer but if quietapine and rispeedal can be used to treat my volcanic demonic rage then maybe I can still stick this out for now. Besides I would've been too afraid to puncture my stomach a few times with scissors and just sit there and freak out then see something scary before I pass out and go to sleep for a 900 trillion years .
