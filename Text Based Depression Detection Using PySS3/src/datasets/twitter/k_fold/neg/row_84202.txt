I am at my last strawHi everyone,I am 23 years old male,who born and raised in Turkey until 18.Then I wanted to go to Germany for education without my parents approval.I have 2 sisters,who are 20 and 16.I came back from Germany to Turkey 2 years ago and lived in Germany for almost 3 years alone without anybody.Before I came to Turkey,I knew some stuff was wrong about me and had a check up at Hospital.I had my Thyroid hormones very high and when I was in Germany my roommate and a pharmacist checked my low blood sugar and It was 38,I should have been unconscious.I took care of those issues in Turkey,although my mental state was also very bad,I had a month without shower and going out in Germany once.I started smoking there,not much with drugs tho,I never liked being sedated.Most of my life I learned things by myself,my father wasn't teaching things that I need to know at my childhood for example proper body care of a male.After I came back from Germany,I went to many psychiatrist and since I came back,I used a lot of Anti-Depressants,Neuroleptics.I tried to break my bonds with my friends.I cut and stab myself with a knife many times,not for suicide,but for forgetting the other emotions and pains with a physical one.I don't like my friends,my family,my life,myself.Looks like coming to an end.My doctor said to my parents,that they didn't give me responsibilities,back when I was a kid.My sisters look like,they don't respect me at all.

You can ask me,whatever you want and please ask.I will try to answer all your questions

Thanks for reading.
