I just attemptedI know it sounds fucking stupid but I just tried to give my self heat stroke, itâ€™s like 90F and I went hiking for 3 hours with a hoodie and jeans barely drinking water. Donâ€™t know how I made it but my heart was getting fucked up, started to beat super fast then slowed down. Itâ€™s slowing down now but Iâ€™m just gonna go home...
