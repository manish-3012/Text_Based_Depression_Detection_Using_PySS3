so its finally time i guess. i've felt it coming a while now. i hope this is legible and coherent.First of all, its all my fault and no one else. I just don't have any motivation left to improve, or even live this life. I'm sorry.

Mummy and Papa: You're the best parents anyone could ever ask for. I'm sorry to have been such a big failure, disappointment and to have wasted so much of your money.

Sister: I love you so much. I wasn't the brother you wanted me to be. I could've been a better sibling if I tried. But I didn't. I am sorry. I wish you all the best. Please take care of mummy and papa.

My roommates: I am so fucking sorry to leave you all in such a mess. Please try to understand that I tried my best. I really did. But it wasn't enough. It's never been enough. I am sorry.

To my advisor and Professors: I am sorry to have wasted so much of your time and resources when they could have been spent on someone worthy of help. More than me. I am sorry. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

To my friends back home: I am sorry. Please take care of yourselves. You were always there for me when I needed to talk to someone. Please seek help if you feel like it. I am so sorry you couldn't help me.

Everyone else: Finally, I wish you all the best. I just wasn't cut out to live a life. I am sorry for whatever pain I caused and I know I made all your lives so much more difficult. I won't be doing that anymore hopefully.

Goodbye :)
