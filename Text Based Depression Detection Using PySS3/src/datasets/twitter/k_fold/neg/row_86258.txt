I'm feeling suicidal againI posted here a few weeks ago. I was feeling like I wanted to kill myself then and you guys kind of cheered me up. 

Basically, my best and only friend (she's a female, i'm a male) is the only reason i'm alive at this point. Other than some family that would be devastated no one would really give a shit if I was dead. Me and my friend used to do everything together, lately she's been doing stuff without me and basically not wanting anything to do with me.

It happened again today and I really can't deal with it anymore. She is switching school next semester to be with me and I can't just stop being her friend, she's all I have. But I don't even have her anymore. 

I've been depressed and suicidal for awhile and something is gonna push me over the edge. I'm so ready to die, I don't want to deal with it anymore. I could just go right now and fall into the water and drown and make it look like an accident. It would all be so simple and I wouldn't have to put up with anything anymore. 

I'm so tired of sitting here alone and wanting to cry and just be upset all day. I want it to be over.
