What's the point if you can't change the world?Someone give me a good reason. If i just can't do anything about this rotten, degenerate world, then what is the point of me existing? Why am i alive? Just to live like an average, useless person unable to do nothing about anything and then dying a useless death having accomplished nothing of importance?

No thanks, if i cannot change anything, if i don't have power over anything, then i'd rather kill myself and get it over with.
