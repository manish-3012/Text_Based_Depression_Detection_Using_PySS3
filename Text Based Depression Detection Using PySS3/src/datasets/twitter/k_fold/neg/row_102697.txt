When I kill myself no one will wonder or question whyIâ€™ve hated myself for the majority of my life and now my life is probably coming to a close. I am a loser, Iâ€™ve wasted all of my opportunities for a better life. I wish I had a gun, I wish I had drugs, I donâ€™t want to be here anymore, there is nothing left for me here.. Iâ€™ve abandoned everything good in my life, now all I have is my minimum wage job and poor self esteem.. I have no more hope for the future, I gave that up a couple months ago when I walked out on my girlfriend( the only person who truly loved me). Fuck man I want to die I just want the disappointment and failure to stop, but as long as Iâ€™m alive it wonâ€™t. I know the only way to make the pain stop
