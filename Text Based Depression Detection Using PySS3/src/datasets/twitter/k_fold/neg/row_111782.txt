NothingnessI wonder what it's like after death. Is it eternal darkness still retaining consciousness, or is it just non-existence, a feeling of ease and no pain or suffering. Just nothing. Not being able to pass the time, not being able to comprehend thought or even knowing you're dead. Just pure utter nothingness

That sounds like bliss
