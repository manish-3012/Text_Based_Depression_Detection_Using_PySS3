I feel forced to be alive.Me working all the time doesn't allow me to go to where I need to go to get what I need to kill myself. Everyone is against me killing myself even if I am the most hated person in the world. If I tell anyone I work with or someone I know that I am suicidal they will likely tell the police I am or tell someone who would and if they show up they may force me to go to the hospital to put me in a psych ward, have meds, a hospital bill that I can't pay, and would cause me to lose the energy to kill myself. I would feel more free to kill myself if I went to a town far away that I knew no one at. I wish I could use covid to kill myself but since I am young there is a low chance of covid killing me.
