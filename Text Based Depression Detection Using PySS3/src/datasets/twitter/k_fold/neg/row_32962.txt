Out of timeThe older you get the harder it is to fix your life. I'm about to turn 29 and I have no degree, no friends, no skills, no family, no training. I dropped out of high school at 16 because of social anxiety and have not progressed as a person since. I've worked dead end jobs and isolated my free time away, I haven't grown as a person or experienced anything in 12 years.  I'm done working shit jobs for $10 an hour and would rather die peaceful than fight for survival homeless
