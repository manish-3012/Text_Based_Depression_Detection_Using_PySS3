What's the cause of suicidal thoughts?What is the cause for one to have suicidal thoughts? I've been having suicidal thoughts in last few months, and in last few weeks I might have just realised it.

I'll tell you by these questions:

- Is it the need of love?
- Is it the need of full acceptance as who they really are?
- Is it to avoid such dire pain to endure in life?
- Is it only to seek attention from other people?
- Or is it anything else that is none of the above?

I am very open to any kind of answers, and I only need some reassurance on this. If there is none, then it's fine. I'll talk to my therapist. Thank you for your help. Have a great day!
