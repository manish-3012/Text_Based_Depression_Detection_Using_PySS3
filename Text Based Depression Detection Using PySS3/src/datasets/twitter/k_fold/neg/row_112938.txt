Why do I gotta do shit i don't want toI hate the way shit is, I'm met with these burdens and expectations that I never promised to uphold but if I dont do as I should then things won't go well for me right. Idk what ima do. I'm not even considering killing myself anytime soon though. I'd hate to leave my family like that. But the way I'm doing things I know I'll dissapoint them. I already have. I just wish things were easier. Wish i could have some things just handed to me. I know it dont work like that and I'm not saying it should either. And I feel like being human and being alive should be this great opportunity and I'm wasting it completely just cuz i dont wanna do the things rhe way I obviously have to.
