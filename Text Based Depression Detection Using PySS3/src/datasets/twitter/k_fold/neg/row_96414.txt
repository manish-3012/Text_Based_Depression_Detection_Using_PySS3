Advice?I need help im not going anywhere in life and I'm having daily sucidal thoughts.

I visited my GP before and got put on meds but that was a while ago and i just felt judged. I was referred to recive some kind of councelling put i didnt call the number due to anxiety and just my inbuilt shame for feeling like i did and still do.

I have looked into private but everything i found was Â£250 plus a little too pricey. 

Ive wasted 4 years if my life pretending im ok but im really not, every aspect of my life is being affected, and i need to know why i cant just man up and move on with my life.

What steps should i take, i just need to know? If anyone relates idk.
