I think I tried killing myself for the first time todayI've been having a very, very rough year. I have chronic illnesses that I've been suffering from, and they recently got worse. Let's just say I have a depressing and lonely life by anyone's standards. For the past few months I've been thinking about suicide almost on a daily basis, but I never had the courage to actually do anything about it, until today. I've been in a terrible mood since I woke up, so I decided to tie a belt around my neck. I didn't do it tight enough to feel any substantial pain, but it was hard to breathe. I was afraid I'd pass out, so I removed the belt and felt a slight rush for a few minutes afterwards... I really want to do it again, but I don't fully understand why. Strangely, I also feel very little towards this particular incident. But most of the time I feel empty anyways, so this may be extension of that. I also kind of want to tell my dad about it because we are somewhat close and he knows about my depression. I know it's bad but I don't particularly care if he gets upset about it. Can I please talk to someone (over PM) about what just happened?
