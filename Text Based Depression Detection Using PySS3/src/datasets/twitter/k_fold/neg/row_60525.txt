I want to harm myselfIt's not the virus. I don't care about little crowned bastard. It's the lockdown.

I can still go outside for groceries and a bit of physical activity, but how long will it last? It will be at least a month in my country. What if it gets extended to, two months, six months, a year? This is no way to live. My life hasn't much changed but it's the fact I know my freedom is restricted. 

It will never get better. I want to kill myself. It won't ever get better. It won't ever get better. I already start to hit my arm against my desk and I feel like purposely throwing myself into walls hoping I break my bones. This is not what I signed up for. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. It will never get better. It will never get better. 2020 will be a dead year. I won't ever be a tattoo artist. I won't ever meet a girlfriend. I won't ever lose my virginity. I will never see Sri Lanka. It will never get better. I will nevrr seakz Tmail fluently. It won't everget better. I'm gonna go into mania and kill myself or set bulginjs on fire
