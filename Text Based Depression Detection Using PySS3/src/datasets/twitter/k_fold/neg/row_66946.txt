im so sick of lifeim sick of life. the cruelty it brings with the bitchy people laughing and spreading rumors. the insane pressure to constantly look good. the anger from my family because to them my depression is being a "angry teenager". the fights, because I don't always have a smile on my face. the stupid sibling rivalries. the 'friends' who don't say a word to you, then shit talk you. the teachers who treat you like you're nothing. the stupid stigma of telling someone. but most of all, i hate me.

i hate my head, with all the sick, yet seducing thoughts of slitting my wrists. i hate my body, all the stretch marks, all the imperfections that come with being human. i hate being human. i hate my life. I want to die. I am so close. I don't see anything left in my life to care about. i really feel like a disappointment. a waste of space. a waste of organs. i really don't see the point anymore.
