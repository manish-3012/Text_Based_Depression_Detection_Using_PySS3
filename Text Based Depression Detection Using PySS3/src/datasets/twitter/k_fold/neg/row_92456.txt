Iâ€™m likely going to end it soonMy best friend for the last 10 years offered me a job making 100k a year and I was over the moon. Being cautious I made sure I deviated my schedule at work so I still had a job worst case. Well he told me instead of Monday we need to be there Wednesday he said he spoke with the boss about coming out to do my paperwork and stated the boss said come out Wednesday. Ok Iâ€™ll have to quit my job but itâ€™s worth it for the reward and I trusted him. 3 days of ghosting later and being lied to by his wife about his whereabouts and why he hasnâ€™t answered me I find out heâ€™s left to go back to the job on the originally scheduled day and told me Wednesday because he was counting on two people failing drug tests to open up a position for me. My best friend for the last 10 years had me quit my job spend the last of my money getting special clothes and boots for the job gas money to drive out there and I was prepared to sleep in my car as I had no answer about housing. Now Iâ€™m in debt have no job my bills are due and I have no idea who I can trust. That was my breaking point. My own mother who supported me when she thought Iâ€™d be making good money called me a dumbass and hung up on me when I told her. Iâ€™m just at my wits end and not sure what to do anymore
