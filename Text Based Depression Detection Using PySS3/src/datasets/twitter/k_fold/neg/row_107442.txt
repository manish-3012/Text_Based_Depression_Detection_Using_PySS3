Has someone else been through anything similar? I'm at my breaking point.I'll try to make it short. I moved to Florida thirteen and a half years ago, since then I have been lied to, stabbed in the back, cheated on, stole from and more. I have done nothing but help every friend I ever had, like moving family members, helping with yard work and pretty much being a friend to everyone. In the last few years once I noticed what was going on with an ex and old friend I just started cutting them out because I've tried to mend a friendship more than once to only have it happen over and over. Once it showed up that they were talking all this crap behind my back I just told them get out. I was basically the only one ever trying to make the plans unless they had nothing to do and I was their last choice. I broke up with my recent girlfriend and told her to get out, I had rare affection from her, I made ninety five percent of the decisions on everything and so on. About a day afterwards I got completely shitfaced and didn't remember much from the night before but I woke up in my chair with my pistol in my lap. I just picked it up and pulled only to find out that while drunk I unloaded the "ready to go shot". I completely broke down thought things out and tried going out. I talked to a couple people in a month but that's about it. I've tried going out many times before as well for months on end and nothing. I have no friends because everyone of them betrayed me and whatever bullshit story they came up with everyone else in the friend circle believed them, I have had at least four groups of friends over the years maybe a couple more and no matter what this happens and I have no clue anymore, it's been this long and I haven't been wanted as anything friend or otherwise. I'm not an asshole who plays mean jokes on people, all I ever did was bs with them and joke around. I'm 26 going on 27 soon. Any other questions I'll answer, I've been through more than this but is the last straw basically and I can't take it.
