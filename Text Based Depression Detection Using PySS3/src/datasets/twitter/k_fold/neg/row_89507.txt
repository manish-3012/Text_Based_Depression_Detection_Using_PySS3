Im going to end it allI'm being called stupid and dumb from everyone around me, even my family. I come home from school to get shouted at for trying my best to be a good student. I love my family but the no amount of affection they show to me I start to think they never wanted me. 

I've wanted to commit suicide for the last 4 months now but I have yet to find a gun to kill my self efficiently. I feel like all the odds are against me in this damned world and ending my life would bring happiness to everyone around me since I'm a useless dumb member of the society I live in.

One of these days I'm going to do it, end my misery
