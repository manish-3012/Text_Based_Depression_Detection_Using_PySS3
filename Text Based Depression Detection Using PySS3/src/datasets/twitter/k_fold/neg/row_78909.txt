Ending my misery.Hello. I'm a 19  year old Walmart employee. I'm losing my vision to Keratoconus. I have fading memory, GERD, anxiety disorder and a habit to smile through my mental pain. I had a bad childhood with a mother who didn't care for me. I almost dropped out in my sophomore year and had truancy while trying to deal with adult problems. I had what I believe was seizures in my sleep which could be a reason why I drool badly. I'm not happy anymore. I just feel like putting my body out of its misery. Any advice.
