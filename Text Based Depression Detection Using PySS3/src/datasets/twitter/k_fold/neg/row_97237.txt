Ready to move on--am I unique?I have none of the typical reasons to want to die. Im middle-aged but healthy. I'm married to a kind and attractive person. I have most excellent adult children. I have a small group of good friends. I have a great job. I have a nice house and a nice car. I have had opportunities to travel and have exotic adventures. I am smart and have many talents. I have known love and desire. I have experienced and created art. I have experienced and rejected religion. I have felt an intense fascination and appreciation for nature--so much so that I have often argued with myself about the existence of god. 

Despite and because of all of this, I want to stop existing. If I could, I would erase myself at conception. I think a lot of people in my age group start to recognize that there really is no point. It's not sad or emotional. It's just true. Have fun. Fall in love. Learn something new. But, at some point it becomes clear--there is no reason to survive. There is no goal. There is only death. Why put it off?

Truly, the only reason I am still here is because I don't want to let down my loved ones. But that excuse is getting real old. 

There will come a day that I will disappear. 

I am not asking for your reassurance--I'm wondering if anybody has come to the same realization.
