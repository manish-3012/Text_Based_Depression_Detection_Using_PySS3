what does all this meanI really want to take a swing at this whole "life" thing, but there's a lot of me that's a big ball of hurt and pain and feeling like nobody ought to sympathize with me because I don't deserve it, and then there's a part of me that wants to savagely fight all that and make something else happen

but I don't know what, I feel like the sort of person who isn't really of any use to society, and although I can't tell whether that's really true or not it still feels like living in spite of that is going to take more "fuck you, I deserve to live regardless" energy than I really have

I've been trying to make existing a bit easier on myself but the effort is just making me feel more and more like there's nothing I can do, I don't enjoy the things I enjoy, I'm not really smart enough to think through my problems, I've been brutally honest with the one person who really cares about how I feel, but now it's starting to feel like all I'm doing is hurting her just by existing, just by being here and being damaged 

so now I have to fight that as well, I have to tell myself "even if I'm of no use to society, even if I hurt people I love, I still deserve to live" and I feel like that's too narcissistic for me, I can't really prove to myself that I deserve life that much, there are good things about me but it's like I don't know how to give them to other people, and maybe even if I knew how I wouldn't care enough to, because I'm not that great of a person really

the thought of finally dying gives me some peace, takes away the pain, makes me feel like I can rest already 

but I don't normally think of things that honestly because it's not like my life has been bad enough to justify feeling like that, or more that in the end it doesn't matter what happens to me, hurting me isn't like hurting other people, it's sort of what I'm here for, hurting me isn't really a bad thing to do unless you end up hurting other people by extension, the only person it hurts is me and my feelings don't particularly matter

but I'm frustrated because it makes me wonder when I'm gonna be allowed to die 

I realize there are people who like me and root for me but I can't connect with their feelings or understand why they feel that way about me

I think I'm doing my best trying to find my way out of this
