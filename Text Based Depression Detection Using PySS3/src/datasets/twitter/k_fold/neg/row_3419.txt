What do I do?I've tried killing myself before but I failed, at this point I have an extreme fear of death, so I'm too scared to kill myself. But I hurt so much and honestly don't see myself having any sort of remotely good life. I feel stuck not wanting to live whatsoever and not wanting to die whatsoever. I've tried therapists and medication and none of it worked. What do I do??
