How do i go on knowing i one last chance for a relationship has been tarnished?After dating a wonderful guy for a few months, we exchanged passwords as a trust exercise. I then found out that, though some poorly hidden conversations, he has been cheating on me with a grand total of 19 people. Other than this massive fuckup i naively forgave him, and we went on with the relationship, as i had given up on any other relationship working.

Last night, several months after the incident, a friend of his tipped me off to the fact that heâ€™s been cheating AGAIN, even after numerous heartfelt talks of sincerely and the thought of being soulmates, as everything else in the relationship went spectacularly.

If iâ€™m not good enough for my last hope of a relationship, the only one iâ€™ve ever truly been in love with, what the fuck is the point of trying to continue in vain? I have a .357 with my name on it and i really need someone to convince me to not do this selfish shit. I am an adult, i realize this is a petty thing to be upset over- but iâ€™m at my breaking point.
