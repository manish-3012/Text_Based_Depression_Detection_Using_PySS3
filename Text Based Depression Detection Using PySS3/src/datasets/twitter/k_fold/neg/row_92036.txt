I wanted to end it right then and there and almost didI'm 17, I have a brother with cerebral palsy who's 22, my parents are 64 years old, In my country there's school degrees to high school so when I finished middle school I was thinking about going to the CNC degree, but my parents didn't allow me and instead forced me to go to the eletrical technician degree because CNC "isn't going to bring food on the table" and all went downhill from there. I was pissed off at my parents and knowing my inability to focus on something that didn't interest me, I almost failed 2nd year, at this point I'm thinking how stupid would you be to force your child to something you like instead of his own set semi-goal (i want to be a programmer), the depression begins. 3rd year, now, I've lost all my interest in grades only studying for math and physics classes because that interests me, but other classes are so bad some are almost confirmed F's tbh. I come to school after not sleeping for 2 days studying forcing myself to at least, AT LEAST get a D, I do get them i feel no emotions after that knowing I fixed a grade. Next week I get like 4 F's, I come home and as usual my parents shout at me about my grades, how I'm bad at school, and that I won't have any future. I just as usual sit there and wait for them to finish before going to my bedroom where i spend all of my time playing games with friends on discord, watching anime, etc. Fabricating myself from my own parents and my brother. In the background I can possibly still hear them talking shit about me, they somehow trigger my brother who is mentally unstable and he breaks something and starts screaming or crying or something and yesterday I decided after 2-3 weeks of planning to end my life at the river I head out with a knife and sit near the river mentally preparing myself, when I was ready I pull out a really sharp kitchen knife I was gonna stab myself with and I just couldn't, I think of what I did and feel disgusted at myself, and I was that close to stabbing myself. I was actually ready to die that day.

I just can't take it anymore and don't say, "oh it will get better". I don't think so, my parents are really in debt and i need to take care of a disabled person they'll probably die in 1 digit years considering the heart attacks in our family tree. They are getting older and I sometimes think did they really bring me to this world to take care of them as elderly people and my brother and that also angers me. Why are they so stupid, mean towards me, I help with everyday activities, around kitchen, around house, I am nice towards them yet they have audacity to shit on me everyday I come home from school. They just either are so uninterested at anything or shit on any of us. They think they have the key of unlocking a 4th dimension or something, such a high hiearchy for a dad finishing as a cook as a degree and mom as a cashier. Pathetic.
