Eighteen years since my poorly timed first attempt, it feels like time to go.I was going to tell my story, even started typing it out. Then I realised it doesnâ€™t matter and nor do I. All I have to say is fuck people and fuck the uncaring, dismissive, judgmental and cruel individuals I have met in my region of the UKâ€™s mental health service. Would love to name them but futile really. Chose a method that could leave me in agony for days, even thatâ€™s the best option. Rant over, sorry but really had to say it to make it real.
