How to help my friend?A very good friend of mine has had suicidal thoughts lately. As a matter of fact he tried ending his life very early in his childhood too. We have tripped on acid and stuff many times together and somehow I become aware of his mental status even when we haven't talked for weeks. He has confessed to me about such thoughts and I am really worried about him. 

He is a very good person and has had a good career a navy diver for 15 years. I am sure he can keep doing good at his life ahead. He seems to have lost interest in life or particularly doesn't see any point in doing anything. He seldom talks about it.

I am sure that if I can get him to talk about it or vent out his mind and heart, I can  motivate him but I don't want to start taking about it to him because he's a very self conscious person and it might make things worse.

I think I should try to get him to work towards a goal because he's more of a goal oriented person. Honestly, I believe I can be of help if he opens up a little bit. He's been opening up a bit lately but you never know about suicidal thoughts. They creep up on you silently and out of nowhere, least when you expect them.

How can I help him open up? What can I do? It will be mighty good of you folks if you can help me help him.
