I need THIS life to stop.Hi there. This is my first post here but not the first time I stop to read, thanks for the support you give, it meant a lot even without being involved in the thread. 

I am sorry if this gets a bit too long, English is not my first language and I'm not used to talk about feelings, so I might need more words than strictly necessary. 

The main point of me writing this post is that I'm sick and tired of my life routine, but complaining about it only got me very bad reactions. 

Maybe I am lazy and spoiled, maybe I was too lucky for most of my life and now I can't cope with work because I have no discipline. That's what my girlfriend seems to mean when she complains about me complaining. 

I'm almost 31, for the last 15 months I've been working day and night with a partner on our own business. Things are starting to work out, we are hiring our first employee, who is finishing an internship in a month and seems to be a good fit. 

For the first time in months, last weekend I could sleep more than 6 hours and "forget" about work, maybe some day this week I can even get home before 20:00. 

Everyone around me says it is worth it, they seem to be pretty sure about it, way more than I am. They say it's an investment and we are lucky to have clients in this economy. 

Fuck that shit. I can't afford to buy soil for my plants (soil is dirt cheap, literally), I pay the bills and the end of the month starts on the 5th for me. Can't buy clothes to wear for work, can't go out to dinner, not a single night, can't afford my cat to be sick because that means using my business credit card and being even more broke for a couple of months. And I am hungry most of the time because my stomach is way bigger than my bank account. 

I think of death as a relief. I think of killing myself every day, but I just can't. It makes me think of my loved ones having to pay for a crappy funeral where no friends are going (I've been a terrible and very distant friend) and it makes me sadder, but it takes suicide out of the picture for a while. So I light up some weed and it lightens up my mind. I've been an occasional smoker since I was 16, but with my financial history I never had a chance to abuse. Last year I grew a couple of plants and that's how I can afford it now. For the last month I've been trying not to smoke for a week and didn't even get to the first 24 hours (I've had plenty of weed available for the last 7 months, but this habit is new). 

I don't know if the drug is causing a depression or a depression is making me use, but every day I feel like killing myself until I smoke and then I look at my problems in a different way. I wake up my ass from the couch, cook some shitty shit and go to bed defeated again. I can cook like a pro, but I just don't want to any more. 

It feels like the only thing I can decide about, and taking the choice of smoking again while I listen to some music is the only moment of happiness I can afford. 

My girlfriend used to be a loving and supportive one, but no one loves a broken man and I know it's just a matter of time till she leaves. It makes me sad, but I made up my mind long time ago, it's quite understandable, no one wants to live like this. 

For the business, things have been growing quickly for the last 5 months, at the beginning of 2016 I was looking for a job, just to know what I could afford to look for, but not with the biggest expectations. I got the interest of a couple of big firms, but I ratted out because I got some clients and I hoped things would get better faster. I always had problems with authority and I am scared of having a boss and not liking him, I tend to do stupid things like pointing it out in front of everybody. 

At this pace, I might be able to take some days off this year, but I don't know if I have the strength to get to that. I feel exhausted and sad. 

My mother, the one who might have spoiled me by filling my shelves with every book I asked for, was diagnosed with cancer last December. She's gonna make it, the diagnose was on time, but I haven't been able to visit since her first chemo session, which was at the end of January. And that hurts, like it hurt when I couldn't visit my younger brother in hospital after a spine surgery. 

I just can't find a meaning for all this. I find myself crying alone at least once a week, and that has never happened to me. I don't want to take any drugs, not even marihuana, of course. I just want to get back to the gym, sleep 8 hours and have some food on the table. And I feel so weak, because I know there are people out there with bigger problems who deal with it, but I can't even find support. People look at me like my brothers do: the big guy with tons of confidence and all the answers. But I am done, behind closed doors I am just done. 

I thought this was gonna make me feel better, but I already stopped twice to cry and that's too much feelings for me. Thanks for reading this, I hope I can write something funnier soon.
