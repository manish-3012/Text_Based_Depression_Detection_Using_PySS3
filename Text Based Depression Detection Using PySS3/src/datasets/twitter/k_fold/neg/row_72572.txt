My therapist doesn't want me to quit my meds because he doesn't want me to "become suicidal". I'm pretty sure I already told him I've had suicidal ideation for over a decade.Forgot to clarify, he doesn't want me to suddenly stop my meds. Sorry.


I feel very invalidated. What he said was meant to sound caring, but it just makes me feel worse. I want to cry. I wasn't sure where to post this so I'm posting here. Maybe people here can understand. 


I don't want to bring it up in case I'm wrong and didn't tell him already. It would be hella awkward.
