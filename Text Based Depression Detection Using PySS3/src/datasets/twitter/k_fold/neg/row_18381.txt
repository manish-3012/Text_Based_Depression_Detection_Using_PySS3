TiredI don't know what to do anymore. I just feel so tired and break down too often. Everyday it is wake up and schoolwork. When I imagine my future, it feels shitty. So like what's going to happen? It's just going to be wake up and college homework. Then when I'm older it's like wake up and it's time to work and pay for your bills. I tired of this life but like oh well.
