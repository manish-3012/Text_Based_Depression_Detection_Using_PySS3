This misfit is tired of the struggleIâ€™m just so tired of struggling and being unhappy. Iâ€™m lonely and alone and see no end to this....just want it to be over. I called the suicide hotline tonight and it was pretty much useless. Tomorrow is the anniversary of my dad killing himself and would be a good day for me to leave this world too. I want to die badly but worry how my son will handle it, but he canâ€™t be having a good life knowing his mother is fucked up and miserable. I want to die. I want this misery and lonely struggle over. Iâ€™m older and know if it changes itâ€™ll only be temporary. Life is a drag for some of us of misfits. Life is sadness to varied degrees. Iâ€™m a broken misfit. I want to die.
