I wish I was never born.I hate life. Everyday it feels like Iâ€™m being picked apart down to the bone. Words sound hollow and empty and worthless. Everything feels like itâ€™s crushing down on me and I canâ€™t fucking take it anymore. 
For the longest time I didnâ€™t cut myself. I was able to resist it for 7 months. Now I canâ€™t stop. Almost everyday it feels like it gets worse and worse. I canâ€™t remember whole days of my life. Everything just passed by and I canâ€™t recall any of it. Iâ€™ve become a disappointment to my parents because I never do anything or spend time with them. 
Even my friends donâ€™t want to spend time with me. They barely talk to me and generally ignore me. The one friend I thought I would have forever is mad at me for trying to drink my pain away and not being honest with her. I wish I wasnâ€™t such a failure that I could tell her that I love her. I wish she wouldnâ€™t be disgusted with me when I said it. 
I wish I could just kill myself. I never asked to be born and no matter how much I pray for death it never comes. Iâ€™ve spent more time praying that I never awake than I wish I did. I wish I was a stillborn or just wasnâ€™t even conceived. Life isnâ€™t full of joys. Every second is pain. Every hour feels like a thousands years and yet a single second at once.
I wish I had the fucking balls to just kill myself. I wish I wasnâ€™t such a failure that I could at least do that. I just want no more pain. I just want to have peace.
