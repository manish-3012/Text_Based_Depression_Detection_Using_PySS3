i want to sleep forever sometimesmy father is a narcissist, my sister is a golden child narcissist and my mom is the perfect enabler. and iâ€™m the scapegoat. 

last year i got dumped by my boyfriend who was also a narcissist who abused my physically emotionally verbally psychologically  and sexually. every single one of my friends left me because i was a crazy liar to them apparently. he got my only real parent figure that i felt loved me and wanted me no matter what fired from our school. and i get to see him everyday at school and here kids talk about the â€œwild sexâ€ aka rape we had. 

i have two real friends but one of them is in london and the other is bipolar and thatâ€™s hard to cope with. 

i phantasize about sleeping for weeks. for doing nothing for as long as i can stand. to just. be out of everyoneâ€™s way. i already stay in my room to give everyone relief from me but itâ€™s not enough. 

i tried to kill myself a week after my breakup but failed miserably. i canâ€™t do anything right. not even kill myself. 

my ex has a huge friend group a year long girlfriend and drugs up the ass and heâ€™ll never get caught. 

i canâ€™t do this anymore. i want to run away and never have to deal with anything ever again. i just want to sleep forever for weeks and months and years and do nothing but let my vegetable brain mold away.
