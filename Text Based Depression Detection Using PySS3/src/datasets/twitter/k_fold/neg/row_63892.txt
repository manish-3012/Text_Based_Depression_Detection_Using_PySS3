cant snap out of it - no optionsi left my job abroad because at 30 i was told im menopausal so i said..fine..ill go back and freeze eggs. so i quit my job, and came here where its really cheap to freeze eggs. didnt work. my ovaries are shit.
during these times mum got diagnosed with lung cancer. 
so we said we will sell  a small house we own to her sister. we thought we would get around 20.000usd, and that would help me stay here, and be close to mum etc. because i hated the life abroad. i was already miserable there...but she said shes not giving us more than 4.000usd....and now im out of options. 4.000usd cant help me stay here, cant help mum if she needs to see someone privately. i  feel its all shuttered now. i cant take antidepressants due to hormonal therapies.
but all of these....its just too much for me to handle. im 32 and my life is a mess. im broke, my dear mums sick, i cant stay in this country because of the crisis, there are literally no jobs...i DONT want to go abroad again..i hate it there. no money. 
now what? how am i supposed to snap out of it. its been 4days now i havent gotten out of bed and i havent eaten and i see no hope. theres no hope.
