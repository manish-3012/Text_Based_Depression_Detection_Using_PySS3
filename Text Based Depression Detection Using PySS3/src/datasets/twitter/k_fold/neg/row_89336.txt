Feeling like nothing mattersI've gone all numb inside. I have no interest in anything anymore. Everything feels like an effort. Everytime I try to get into a new hobby or activity, I get bored almost instantly. I don't know if it is because I'm depressed, or nothing simply interests me in this world. Rarely anything makes me happy. The only things I do in a day is study for school, and waste time on my laptop or phone. I feel like I am just existing, not even living. What's the point?
