I need to get therapy or Iâ€™m going to hurt myself or someone elseI have been depressed for the past three years. Iâ€™m also 12. School is crushing me lately. I started secondary school this year. (which is kind of like highschool but youâ€™re there for 6 years. Itâ€™s also 7th grade for any Americans) Iâ€™ve had two anxiety attacks over the fear I wouldnâ€™t get my homework done in time. Home is not any better, Iâ€™m genuinely convinced my parents and my older sister hate me, the words they say cut deep and make me feel like trash. I need to talk to a therapist or a professional because Iâ€™m seriously considering committing suicide or murdering my parents. All I can ever think about is death. I just need to talk to someone.
