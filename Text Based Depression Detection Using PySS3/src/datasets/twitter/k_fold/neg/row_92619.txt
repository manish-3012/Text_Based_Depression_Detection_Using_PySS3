nobody wants me or cares about me (rant)the guy i love doesn't see a future with me. i offered to up and move and change my entire life for him and he didn't want to risk it. that's what love is it's risking everything for that person. he couldn't do that for me.

now i just fuck any guy who will give me the time of day, who tells me i'm cute or funny or cool. i don't even care anymore i just want to feel wanted for 10 minutes.

i talked to someone i genuinely liked and i thought maybe it could be something. something real. and he's not over his ex, he doesn't think he can jump into a relationship. i can already tell he doesn't want to talk to me anymore even though he claims he does. they always get tired of me\

why do i put in so much effort when no one gives a shit

i miss you baby please come back.
