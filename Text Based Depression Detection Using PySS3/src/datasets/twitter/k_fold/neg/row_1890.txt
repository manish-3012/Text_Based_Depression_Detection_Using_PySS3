Why won't it work? Someone give me an answer please. What am I doing wrong?Please can someone have some sort of answer for me. I have tried again and again to end my life but for some reason I'm so fucking bad at it. I don't understand why it won't work. Is it my unconscious self stopping myself because me consciously right now wants to be dead? I have genuinely tried. Genuinely. Like really genuinely. Wrote the note, cried my fucking eyes out and tried to do it. I've tried to cut my wrists but I couldn't get it deep enough or in the right place. I've tried to to strangle myself again and again. I've even tried to hang myself but it just won't work. Why? I am so tired. Both physically and mentally. Good people die every day. People who want to live life and have dreams and here I am. Who wants to die but can't seem to die. I want to end my life. So why won't it work?
