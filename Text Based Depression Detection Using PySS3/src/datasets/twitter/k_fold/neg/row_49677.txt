Im tired of being suicidal. Im tired of having no drive to live.I've been wanting to blow my brains out since I was 13. I'm so tired of the never endless sadness, I'm done. I've decided that I'm going to do the best I can to live happy or go and die. A final choice ive made, I'm going to struggle to do the best I can. If not I have a bottle of paracetomal, rope and a strong tree. My final decision to either live happy or die sad, to do it any other way is tiring.


Thank you for this comminitys support, good bye.
