Is it better to have a bad mom or a dead mom?I'm a mother to an 9 month old girl. She's perfect, and I love her more than absolutely anything else.

I am going to ruin her, I know I am. If she grows up with me for a mother, she will end up just like me and I can't. I can't perpetuate this cycle. The anxiety is overwhelming and neverending. I can't give this to her. And I know I'm being selfish, but I've been in therapy for YEARS and I'm still here, in my own hell, and it never gets better, and I'm so tired of being miserable.

This morning I yelled at her. She was crying and I was overwhelmed and trying to finish the dishes, the same dishes I've been working on for literally 3 days, and I yelled. I instantly felt sick and horrible.

Please. I don't even know what I'm asking. I just want it to stop.
