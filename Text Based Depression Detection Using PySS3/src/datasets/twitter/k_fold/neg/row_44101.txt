SoonI have had waves of a feeling much stronger than sadness of late, I feel like Iâ€™m getting closer and closer for my time to leave.

Nothing really feels worth the crippling ups and downs and thinking of a time of blissful emptiness sounds so appealing, like a calm lake 

I am looking forward to the suffering finally coming to an end
