Tonight is my last night and I'm scaredI've never true success, I've never felt the love that a significant other can offer. I am lost. I am confused and I am lonely. I'm scared for my future. I struggle with making the right decision on a daily basis. I don't know myself. No one has done anything to make me feel this way, simply put I feel it is my fate. Everyday I wake up is a nightmare. The only place I find relief is playing video games. If my parents, brother, or sisters see this, I want to tell you how sorry I am for making such cowardly and selfish choice, but the battle I fight everyday is winning and I am getting tired. I love you, I truly do love, and it breaks my heart knowing that you'll walk into my room tomorrow and my pale/blue body laying in bed. I'm so so sorry for ruining your lives, I hope you find the strength to move on without me. You have been the reason that I am still fighting, but my strength has run out. I love you all to the moon and back. I ask you and God to please forgive me for this selfish act. I can't tell you why exactly I did this besides the fact I have never felt true happiness. Happiness has evaded me my whole life. As I write this I'm looking at a picture of us all together on our porch at Halloween, hoping somehow it might change my mind. Please don't be mad at me, please continue with your lives, and please be the successful people you were all destined to be, without me. I love you so much
