I donâ€™t think it gets betterEveryone says it gets better it gets better, but they donâ€™t get it.  Some of us are born to suffer and Iâ€™ve accepted that.  I donâ€™t have a choice in what I feel.  I wish I had killed myself when I couldâ€™ve.  I was 6 feet way from ending it and I donâ€™t regret it.  I donâ€™t regret anything like that.  My arms are covered in cuts and scars I donâ€™t care anymore.  I just want to end it.  I fantasize about sliding my own throat, yet Iâ€™m too coward to do it.  I donâ€™t want to suffer for 50 more years of life.
