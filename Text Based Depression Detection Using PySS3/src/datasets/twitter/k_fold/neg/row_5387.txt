To all the people who know who I am and what my story is, thank you. But I think it's time.I'm not going to re tell my story over again. I'm sure someone else that has heard me on here could tell you. Ever since my brother killed himself I thought "hey, the first 17 years of your life has sucked, maybe your 18th will be YOUR year."

   God I'm an idiot. Just an update: I might fail out of college in my freshman year. My dream of becoming a writer for movies/television is becoming so much more unreachable every day, I've gained so much weight but I can't stip eating/have no physical drive to start working out, and my anxiety is back. I've listened to the phrase "It'll get better" so much that whoever created it is a fucking monster. Follow me around for a day and I will show you what having your spiritual will shattered looks like.
