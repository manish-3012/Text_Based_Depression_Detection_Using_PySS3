I have no motivation to live and I feel like I have nothing left.When I ask other people a lot of the answers I get are related to material things. I don't really want anything material. Sure if I'm going to be here I'll enjoy material things, but not enough to warrant life.

I want connections with people. Sometimes on reddit I'll make a post and talk to a few people but then usually they lose interest or I'll get really depressed and when I see their message I'll wait to response.

Mostly because I get anxious and over think what to say... Then I don't respond and a day passes then I just assume they never wanted to talk to me in the first place and get sad because I know me and that person will never talk again.

I do want people to talk to and all that, but I've been trying to find even a single person to maintain a relationship with and for various reasons, (Sometimes it is me). However, if I have to walk across the whole world twelve different times just to find a turtle to chat with for two minutes, well damn.

Idk, what motivates you guys? Feel like I want nothing to do with this live at all. I have attempted a few times before, don't want to die. But it feels like suicide might be the only way to feel better : /. Been dealing with it 9+ years.
