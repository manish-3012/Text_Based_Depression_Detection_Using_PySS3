I want to slowly kill myself...So I'm an autistic dude and you know how dysfunctional autism makes you right
I want to die slowly and be dead in the next 10 years when i hit my early 30s or so. I'm an autistic low IQ subhuman bag of genetic trash haha wow I can't actually believe i was even born

I want to get a needle with HIV inject it into my body and hope for the best until i kick the bucket... But that raises one question. Where can i get a needle with that damn virus..

I don't want to commit suicide and immediately terminate my life.
During my HS years i did the dumbest mistake by posting on Instagram how I'd commit suicide that day by carbon monoxide poisoning. Soon after 20 or 25 minutes after the story went live and guess what...my whole class was there and even my crush. They stopped me but I felt like a total failure and attention seeker.

I don't want to do that again so please would you tell me. A way to shorten my lifespan.
I want to die within the next 10 years please.
I'm an autistic loser with no life. Would you rather want me to become homeless?
Heck i have extreme shyness social anxiety and selective mutism.. I can't even talk to people.
I would be dying on the street and not ask for help even in case of a heart attack. Thats how bad my disease is.
