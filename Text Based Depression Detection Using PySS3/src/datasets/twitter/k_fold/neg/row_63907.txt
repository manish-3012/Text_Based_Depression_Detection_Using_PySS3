Emotional invalidation hurts peopleIt does. It's made me sad and angry and suicidal. It hurts people when you invalidate or minimize thier feelings and make them feel like thier feelings don't matter. It's a hard thing to go through when you feel like your feelings aren't being understood and don't matter.
