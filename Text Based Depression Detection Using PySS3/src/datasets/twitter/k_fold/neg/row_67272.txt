will it pass?I am so fucking sad. I know everyone says itâ€™s going to pass, I wonâ€™t feel this way forever. But I canâ€™t see that. Even if I donâ€™t feel this bad, Iâ€™m still going to feel empty. Even if I can control how sad I am, it doesnâ€™t mean that Iâ€™m not reeling alone, empty and misunderstood. Even when I am happy, or just content â€” that doesnâ€™t make these moments of sadness worthwhile. The hurt is so much greater than any feeling of value. I donâ€™t know what to do, I donâ€™t want to do this anymore.
