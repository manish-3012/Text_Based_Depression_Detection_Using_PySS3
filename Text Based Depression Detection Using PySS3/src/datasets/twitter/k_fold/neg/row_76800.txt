FailedThe last happy moment I had was the day I took her to the train station in the way to the trip where sheâ€™d destroy me. 

Tonight I failed again to let the noose take me. If I had the strength I had back then I would have been able to do it. Instead I just keep floating until maybe I can finally succeed. And have one final happy moment.
