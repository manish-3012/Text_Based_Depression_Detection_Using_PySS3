I need someone to take my mind off some stuffNot in any immediate danger, actually noticed lately how I am not thinking a lot about suicide, it's probably just the summer and abundance of sunshine.

Anyway, it doesn't matter what angle I approach this from, there is just some facts about life that make me sigh. 

Life is unfair, most people are poor and miserable. I'm not some privileged naive asshole who's envious of others happiness. The world is just plain flawed, but the sad thing is that *doesn't* have to be. When I talk about it with my friends or parents it boils down to "a lot of people have it way worse you should be thankful" like, okay, why would I feel ant better knowing that there are a lot of people living a worse life than mine, which is something really, or something along the lines of God is wise and knows what he's doing. What's the point of creating this whole universe if you're just going to force people that can't even comprehend what's outside their immediate understanding. 

I don't know what I'm getting at really, I don't actually believe in God and I hate how we even have to ponder these questions we can never answer. I tried to pray and search and had faith at some point but it always bites me in the ass and end up regretting and cringing.

Why are we so overburdened by our minds and filled with guilt when there is nothing out there it's all in our heads. The universe is so big it's incomprehensible yet we are stuck with wealth inequality, college debt, uncertain futures, broken hearts.
