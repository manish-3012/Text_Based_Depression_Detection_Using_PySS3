I think I really need helpStarted having a huge flare-up in depression symptoms around 2 weeks ago, it's bad. It's interfering with my life so much: classes, assignments, eating, bathing, seeing friends, meeting deadlines, checking in with family, getting out of bed, staying sober. 
But what is harder to manage, to me, is the fluctuations in these symptoms. To me that's so much harder to deal with. 
Literally one day I'll be extremely suicidal, don't even think about leaving the bed, feeling completely alone. Then the next day I'll wake up early, take a shower and put on make-up, mark all my deadlines on my planner, start emailing teachers apologizing for missing class, clean up my room, check in with friends, everything. Sometimes even when I'm productive like that, I'll hear a song or something small will happen to make me feel 100% suicidal again but it passes.  It's such a roller coaster every day. 
I think because I pumped myself up so much during the new year to try harder that I need to bounce back twice as hard or something. The fluctuations are so much, though. It's so hard dealing with these extremes so often.
