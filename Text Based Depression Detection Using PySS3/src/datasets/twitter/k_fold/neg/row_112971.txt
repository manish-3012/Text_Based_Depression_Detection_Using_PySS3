I wish I had more time on Earthsuicide is so inevitable now. iâ€™ve postponed it for as long as possible. iâ€™ve been suicidal for a long time, failed all my classes, quit my job, and iâ€™m in debt. my parents just found out about me not paying my loans so now theyâ€™re forcing me into a corner. but also rent is due in less than 2 days and iâ€™m doomed. thereâ€™s so much i want to stay and live for and itâ€™s so painful to imagine the shock and horror of the love of my life finding my dead body. iâ€™m even more horrified by the thought of me not dying and just becoming disabled and unable to speak on behalf of myself. iâ€™m so scared, i donâ€™t want to die. why did i push myself in this corner? why couldnâ€™t i have reliable and caring parents? iâ€™m not going to seek help from them because i know they wonâ€™t understand and also theyâ€™ll use it against me. i just want to spend more time with my puppy and boyfriend but my time has completely run out. my future is gone. thereâ€™s no possible way to pay my rent on time and iâ€™m about to flunk out of college. right when i find something worth living for, itâ€™s too late. thereâ€™s no escaping this.
