I'm still in love with himI had a really nasty breakup with a guy about 8 months ago. Last night we talked for the first time since the breakup and I'm so angry with myself. It was great to catch up but holy shit I still love him. He doesn't want to get back together, just be friends. I would give up anything to be with him. I'm religious &amp; I've tried praying. I'm done. I can't do this anymore.
