Suicide deadlines?Anyone else set dates and deadlines for yourselves? Like if I haven't accomplished this and that by a certain date I'll kill myself. I also do this with video games and TV shows, oh new game of thrones I'll kill myself after this season is over. We'll it's been like this for years and Im still doing the same thing and I'm still the same person I was 4 years ago lol anyone else do this?
