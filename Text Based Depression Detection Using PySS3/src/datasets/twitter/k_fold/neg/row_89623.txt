Feel lost in a situationHello. 

I'm just writing how I feel right now so sorry for mistakes in advanced. 

About 8 years ago I broke my arm and it didn't really heal all that straight. It's suppose to be at 180 degrees but my arm is 28 degrees off of that and it's starting to cause me discomforting pain. It's noticeable but not unbearable.  I have a few options but honestly I just want to kill myself so I don't have to go through that pain again. I don't want to get surgery done because there is a chance that my bone won't even heal so my humerus is separated but helded together by metal bars. Just the thought of that in the back scares me. The surgery also cost 25 thousand dollars so if I started saving now I wouldn't be able to get the surgery for 3-4 years if I'm lucky and by that time my arm will be killing me to point I will kill my self. I dont want to have metal bars in my arm. That's not natural at all. I wish I never wanted to try new things or else none of this would have happened. I honestly hate myself for this. If I cant save up 10 thousand dollars by next year I really don't see I point for me. Maybe I'm be dramatic but it's just shitty that I have to go through this. I want it to just disappear but I cant. I have to live with this problem for the rest of my life. That's why my life doesn't have to be that long.
