Am I a terrible person for wanting to kill myself because of university grades?Its seems like me wanting to kill myself because I can't pass college classes seems like such a stupid reason. Which makes me feel like shit, which just lowers what little faith in myself I have. I just can't go on. Here I am going to an amazing school, given such great things in life, but wanting to end my own life. I don't deserve any of it and I just don't want to wake up in the morning. Why the hell am I even posting here. I guess the worst part is I have a loving family which just makes it hurt even more.
