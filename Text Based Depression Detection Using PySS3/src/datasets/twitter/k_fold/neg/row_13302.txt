Want to reach out...I'm not sure what I should be doing, recently diagnosed with BPD 2, right now I've been a bit of a mess in a downward slope.  All I can manage to do is panic, self harm, panic, think about suicide, and panic.  It's causing stress and strain in my relationship.  Right now I'm on a safety plan with my doctors that if my current new med regimen doesn't help any I'm supposed to go inpatient.  I'm terrified of that.  I work a stressful job (24 hour shifts as a paramedic) and I'm supposed to work tomorrow and right now I'm just wanting to down all the meds I have and some of the ones I carry for work.  

I'm on a final written at work for bad behavior (probably related to all this), I only have two points left before termination, and I doubt I qualify fora leave of absence because of my current status within the company.  I'm terrified of losing my job and if that happens I just figure I'd probably end up worse than I am right now.  

I just need someone to talk to who isn't my girlfriend.
