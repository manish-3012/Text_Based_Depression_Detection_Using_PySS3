A dreamI often think of a place where I am able to feel okay. Where I am not bottling up everything I feel. Where I am able to truly be relaxed and myself. Where I don't feel like I am looking down a endless black hole that keeps getting bigger and bigger. Where I am able to tell myself without hesitation that life is good for me. That I have people I am able to connect with. That this growing loneliness I am feeling will go away. Just wanna be somewhere that I am just okay. Is it selfish to say I deserve better and this should happen to me? Is it selfish to say I want to be okay? I am being selfish with this wish of mine? I don't know anymore. I may be overreacting again. I always just overreact. I am going to sleep now. Whatever.
