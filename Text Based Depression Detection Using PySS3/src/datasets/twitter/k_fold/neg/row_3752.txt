Wow mom thanks for my life, i hate it(Keep in mind I'm pretty sarcastic) also summary at the end

For context: Earlier I didn't want to eat, so my mom asked what I ate and I didn't want her to get mad and send me to my room, so I said a ham sandwich. She checked the fridge and saw the ham was in the bottom of the fridge-drawer (its like a drawer in the fridge and it's clear)

Anyways like any rational and kind parent, she said to me "You disgust me, You're a despicable person to me! After everything I did for you this is how you repay me?"

And all I can think is "No shit! You gave me the ability to live a crappy life and hate myself thanks soooo much! I'm also just EXTREMELY grateful that I get to be yelled at and starved in my room while you do less than the minimum to get by for me"

And while I'm thinking about that, I guess she can read my mind or something because she starts rambling about how I'm "lucky" to be alive! so whoopty do I'm so happy I get to suffer!!!

Anyways she goes on about how much of a disappointment I am, but what did she expect from a kid born from a narcisistic asshole??!

For some reason this was the really nice and kind conversation that just clicked for me. About how stupid and meaningless my life is!! It's just as meaningful as Logan pauls banger appology

Ik it's bound to happen at one point but when it does my suicide note with my mom's part on it is going to say "I guess I just can't comprehend such nice words about how I'm a screw up!" Cuz I know she won't care any more if I say how shes the problem

Also if you want to why life sucks go read my other posts cuz I'm too lazy to write it down here!

Summary: I'm 11 my mom expects some medal for giving me a life I hate and I rant about how I feel when my mom calls me a dissapointment and abuses me until I want to die again!
