The list is getting shorter TW SAI was raped in june, my assaulter choked me. There was a time were I believe I was going to die.
Unfortunately I didn't.
Every day, I wish he would have finished his job.
I started trauma therapy a few weeks after the rape, and my therapist is great. But the symptoms are horrible. I'm fighting every single day to function. I work, feed and walk my dog, feed and clean myself. Besides of that I prepare my second audition with the police to get this monster arrested, make appointment with attorney offices and social workers to find a way to pay my rent (I've had no income for the past 3 months thanks to miscommunication between my health insurance and employer) while living in the same neighbourhood as my rapist (accidentally saw him twice the past 3 weeks). My friends are too busy to see me and my family lives in a different country. It doesn't make any sense if it is to live like this. I know it can get better but I tired of fighting. Right now my dog is my only reason to live. If I leave she'll go back to a shelter. I can't tell my therapist because they will send me to the hospital and I have no person to take care of my dog.
I am actively looking for the best suicide methods and plan to be gone before my upcoming birthday.
