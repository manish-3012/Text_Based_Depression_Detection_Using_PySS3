I need help finding medication that works.I've had bad experiences with side effects, like loss of appetite/increased thoughts of suicide. I think the worst was Prozac, I can't remember the other names well enough. Because of that I've avoided medication, but now I need it really bad. Does anybody have experience with an antideppresant without many side effects? I tried googling but I mostly got Prozac adds
