Gonna be kicked out of home soon. Why shouldn't I?I'm going to be kicked out of my current place pretty soon. I have nowhere to go due to lack of money and job. Why shouldn't I off myself? After all society gives up on people who lost their home. Why should I keep going? It would be far better if I were dead.
