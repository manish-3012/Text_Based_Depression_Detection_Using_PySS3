I don't understand why I feel this way.I just can't shake the notion. It's constantly on my mind all day, everyday. Even when I'm with friends or enjoying myself, there's still the looming presence of feelings of worthlessness, depression, anxiety. I just want it to stop and I can't think of any other way. I'm in constant and perpetual pain and agony and it just never seems to end. I just can't catch a break. 

I'm 21 years old and in school right now. My friends are my family, but I don't think they love or care for me as much as I do for them. That or they've gotten tired of my apathy. I try my hardest to be normal, but it's just hard. it's getting to the point where not even the thought of the people most important to me is enough to keep me from thinking about suicide. I have a plan and a timeframe. I just want relief. Please help.
