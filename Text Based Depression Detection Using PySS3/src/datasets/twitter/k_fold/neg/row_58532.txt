I think about it everyday, even if it is only briefly for one moment.I think about dying everyday. Some days the thought is unbearable. It doesnâ€™t leave my head. Other days itâ€™s just a fleeting thought. But itâ€™s there. Itâ€™s always there, lurking in my mind. Probably waiting for me to act on it. Iâ€™m very scared. Iâ€™m getting worse everyday. Iâ€™m really scared and I donâ€™t know what to do.
