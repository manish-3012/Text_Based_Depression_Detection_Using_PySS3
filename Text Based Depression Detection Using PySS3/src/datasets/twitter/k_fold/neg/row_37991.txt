VentingThrow away and on mobile.
I get that to some people I may sound like a whinny brat, but really I just need to vent, and just know that someone out there is listening to me because no one near me does.

I honestly donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I (18F) feel like my life has zero meaning to it, and I have for a long time. The oldest Iâ€™ve ever though Iâ€™ll make it to is 20-30. But Iâ€™m just going to vent because all these problems have been weighing on me for about 3 months to a year.

I feel like Iâ€™m being abandoned by my friends. I understand that everyone is busy. But I hate the fact that if I want to talk to someone, I have to engage first, and even then itâ€™s mostly me taking to myself. Or if I ask if they want to hope online to play some games â€œno not tonightâ€ â€œI donâ€™t feel like itâ€ â€œmaybe some other time.â€ The time to be together while weâ€™re apart never comes. I feel so lonely. This has been happening even before COVID. Iâ€™ve been stuck in my room since my province went into lockdown and Iâ€™ve never felt this low in my life. I just wish I could talk to my friends like we did before, but because of the way their acting now, it makes me question if we were even friends to begin with. I have these feeling I never felt before, the feeling of being used, and just annoying. I feel like they used me because I worked and had a car, and that they hated me because how annoying I can be. I though we were all happy. Maybe we werenâ€™t. Iâ€™m not good at making friends, I donâ€™t like talking and am really self-conscious, so Iâ€™m terrified to be *going* to college in the fall. 

Plus ultimate feeling of being unloved and unlovable. In grade 8, I asked out one of the guys in my group of 4 (Heâ€™s gonna be A) he declined. This isnâ€™t the first time heâ€™s declined either. Instead he asked out the only other female in my group, B. Theyâ€™ve been together since and Iâ€™m happy for them. I then developed feelings for C, and asked him out in January, and he never gave me an answer. Itâ€™s honestly tore me apart because every. Single. One. Of the people I like (bi here) day they donâ€™t think of me. My brother told me to get over it, and that Iâ€™ll find someone eventually. And while thatâ€™s most likely true, I believe that Iâ€™m just an ugly, fat person that canâ€™t be loved. No one wants to love me. Why would they. Iâ€™m a mess. Physically and emotionally. Bully in my life hasnâ€™t really helped me either. Said above, Iâ€™m at overweight. And you can guess what Iâ€™ve been bullied for. I hate it. I hate myself. To put it bluntly, Iâ€™ve considered eating disorders, but I know that isnâ€™t good so I avoided it. Iâ€™ve tried working out, but Iâ€™m to anxious to do so, I think everyone is staring, that they are laughing, talking about the fat kid in the corner of the gym struggling to lift a 20lb weight and canâ€™t even do bicep curls properly. I have attempted suicide once, but I basically stopped myself. (would rather not talk about it) With everything happening I feel like Iâ€™m going to try again. 

This is basically a very, very, very watered down version of everything happening. Thereâ€™s soooo much more that Iâ€™m not comfortable sharing publicly, and thatâ€™s more of the deeper stuff, this is pretty light hearted in my eyes. If this gets lost, thatâ€™s ok. Others on this subreddit need the support more than I do.
