Thinking of committing suicide but can't bring myself to it.Never had these thoughts a couple of years ago, but things just spiraled out of control for me, I used to occasionally have a suicidal thought and didn't think much of it, but now it happens daily / every two days, I'm sitting here getting piss drunk listening to sad music in the dark at 2am. Every time I think of it I just think of my family and who would find my body and how everyone would react.
