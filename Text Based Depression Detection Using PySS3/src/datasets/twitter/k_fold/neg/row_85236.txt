Iâ€™m highly demotivatedI have an awesome job, I have a mother, a father and a grandfather whose I love so much. I have a fiancÃ© and weâ€™ve been living together for almost 2 years. My parents are a little bit emotionally abusive, but I can handle. I have no single reason to be depressed, but I am.

I have been depressed before, or maybe it was something else, but in my home country the treat any mental problem as depression and flood you with medication without knowing what you have indeed.

Now Iâ€™m living in a very good country and they diagnosed me with autism and depression. 

Two weeks ago I â€œattemptedâ€ to kill myself. Iâ€™m Christian, if I die in the wrong way something worse might be waiting for me, but Iâ€™ve being thinking about doing it again today since few days ago. I donâ€™t know if I want to die or if I just want to get extremely numb and sleep for hours and maybe not waking up anymore.
