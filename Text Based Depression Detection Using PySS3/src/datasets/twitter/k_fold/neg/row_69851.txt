In an hour and forty two minutes the door to the roof will be unlocked.And I'm 50/50 on jumping. At best 40/60. Really. When someone is depressed and considering suicide you might think 'why don't they just go someone new and try to start again from scratch. That's kind of what I did. It didn't work out. I'm in a foreign country, have a part time job, don't speak the language, have about $200 left. Didn't find what I might have wanted. Still sick. Poor. Alone. Drunk. But mainly alone. Just a cry for attention? Probably.
