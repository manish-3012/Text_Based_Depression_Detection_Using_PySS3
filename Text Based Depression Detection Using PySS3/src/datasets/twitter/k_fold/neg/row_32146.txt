don't do it, afI know how you feel man. I'm dying inside man. I make and I create and I care about the music too. Nobody else understands, I know. I post cover after cover for people, all they do is frown and look on. It's not easy man. Nothing worth doing ever is. I know how it feels to be criticised and looked down on. I know how it feels to put on that happy face for everybody while you're crushed on the inside. I know man. And it makes me cry too. I'm crying with you bro. I know what those fake tears hide. I feel it too. I'm right there with you, my hands out for you bro. I know my words don't mean much. I know i'm nobody. I know they call you names. I know they think they know. I love you man. I know how it feels. I'm right there with you. I'm crushed on the inside man, I'm completely lost without it. Music is so much, all of it, it's the bridge. And nobody loves man. Nobody loves like they're supposed to and i'm dying man. I'm thrown out. nothing i say matters, nothing ever bridges the gap. i'm crushed man. i love you bro. keep your chin up. you're doing a good job. i can't think of anything else, i'm just crying bro. i know its nothing. i'm sorry for what they do to you. i'm sorry for how they act when you're not around. i know you know the side eye. i know you hear their whispers. you know how they are, they're children man. they're children that just don't understand, they fight with their love like

i love you bro. keep your chin up. you're going to make it. you're going to get through this. you're going to keep making art and you're going to love it bro, just like you always have. i love you so much bro you're going to do great things. i can't stop crying. you like kpop bro? kpop helps me thru the sad times. i love kpop, it's different. words aren't descriptive to our ears, so it's just music. i wish they'd make it softer. i wish i could help them make it softer.
