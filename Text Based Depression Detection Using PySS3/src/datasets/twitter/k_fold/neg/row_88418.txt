Lately Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts pop into my brainI would never describe myself as the happiest guy around. Iâ€™m an 18 year old male and I just finished up high school and am headed off to college next year. Even though I never was a really happy guy though I still would never have thought myself a person who would ever consider suicide. But lately Iâ€™ve been shown just how wrong I was about that. All my life Iâ€™ve had crippling anxiety, and itâ€™s constantly prevented me from being my genuine authentic self. In this way I feel so deeply, painfully alone. I donâ€™t know what to do with these overwhelming emotions Iâ€™m feeling and becuase of my anxiety Iâ€™ve never really gotten to a position with a friend where I feel like I could talk with them about things like that. Over the past few weeks the unwanted thoughts have become increasingly and increasingly frequent and Iâ€™m trying to tell myself that these thoughts are not the real me, but itâ€™s so hard when Iâ€™m constantly being present and confronting this idea of simply ending the struggle and emotionally painful life Iâ€™ve had so far. I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m fully and completely lost, I donâ€™t even know what to ask, Iâ€™m posting this here hoping for some guidance of any kind.
