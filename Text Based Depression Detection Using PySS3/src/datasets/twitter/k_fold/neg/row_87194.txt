Another rejection letterI don't know how many resumes I've sent out but I keep getting rejection letters.  My mortgage is past due and I have no food in my house.   I have collection agencies calling me and I can't afford my medication for depression and anxiety.   I'm so stressed that my excoriation disorder (skin picking and trichotillomania) is out of control so I look like hamburger and I'm embarrassed to go to an interview as it is.    

If I don't find a job by Friday, I have a plan to end it.
