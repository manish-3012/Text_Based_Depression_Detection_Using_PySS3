I'm tired, warn down and it's painful to fight on as things get worse, there is such a gap in what you give versus what you get back in life.I'm so tired of struggling and supporting people then when I need it there is nothing at all there just people with hope things improve... Well no they won't health wise and instead of hope perhaps repay the favour from all the times I bailed people out to stop them going hungry, homeless or anything else they needed from baby food to keeping the lights on all the way up to paying bond to get someone a a roof over there heads.

I don't even mind, I valunteered to be helpful to put a smile on and say it's ok, don't worry about me I'll survive but perhaps survival is not enough perhaps been the only one who stands by what he says and is left alone to fix everything for everyone and still shoulder my own lifes problems.

My doctors are aware and even more supportive than anyone else that I keep the right dosage to ease me off to sleep forever, I keep it ready just incase the pain is too much I give it a week and try everything I can to get back up and so far it works but death is the only time I won't be in pain, I won't be uncomfortable and I won't be tortured by my childhood memories.

This is probably not the place for this but other than doctors I can't say this anywhere else as people act like you've offended them by saying you struggle but if you ask for help there is silence but they never see the issue of them expecting me to always be there for them, happy to take despite the fact that I'm the one who has it the hardest of all my family, friends and exs yet I have to shoulder the burden alone and carry there issues, fight there battles and save them from there own stupidity. I should have left, I should have abandoned them all and made a fresh start but I care way to much and hate letting down even strangers. I'm just so tired of it, the pain the stress, the discomfort and the fact I remember it all but the medication I'm on leaves me a shell of a person but it's that or excruciating pain constantly and no sleep I'm stuck in a rock and a hard place and the floor has been pulled from under me and I for once can't cope alone anymore.
