Well, I'm not getting any better, quite the contrary. It has now being two weeks since I had to euthanize my cat, who basically was my only friend and I keep crying. The original thread is now yesterday's news. And while some people offred to help if I needed to talk (thanks), I know they have their own life and I really don't know what to say. Others suggested that I adopt another cat but, I don't think this would work. I don't see this ending well. I'm not even sure why I'm writing this.
