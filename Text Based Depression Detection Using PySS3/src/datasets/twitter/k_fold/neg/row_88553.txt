No free will makes making me seriously consider suicideIâ€™m a 18 year old senior and have never had enough will power to accomplish any goal Iâ€™ve set. My entire value system has always revolved around intellect, becoming a scientist and feeling good about possessing more mental prowess than an average person. But every single year, since 5th grade or so, Iâ€™ve had an incredible problem with procrastination. Iâ€™ve always failed to adhere consistently to self study of a particular academic subject. 
      I had a natural proclivity for philosophy but buried it in the fucking ground. The creative thinking and revelations that frequently came to me have been dulled by the incessant distraction of YouTube, games, and the like, to which I have time and time succumbed to. There is an national biology competition I promised myself as a freshman to become a top 20 finalist in; its been 4 months since I opened a biology textbook for the exam next week. My grades are shit now just in time for college applications. Always knew I had the capacity to make Harvard or another university I would feel in place at but didnâ€™t go through the simple steps that could have easily gotten me there. Itâ€™s the will power Iâ€™m convinced is completely absent in me, the procrastination. I had a list of 8 colleges to apply to. Missed the deadline by a month for 5 and just now submitted applications to 3 low choice state schools a week late. Fuck me
     I am pessimistic of free will being accessible to me. I must have been dealt a bad hand by genetics and cultural factors. It canâ€™t be a coincidence that I see similar tendencies in character in my father and in other people of my cultural identity. 
     There is a good chance Iâ€™m going to kill myself. Wether itâ€™s this year, 5 years, or even 10 years down the line. I canâ€™t live knowing no thought of mine will ever come to fruition.
