ContemplatingI am contemplating just ending it all. I canâ€™t keep dealing with the isolation. My boyfriend and I have been hot and cold. When I am able to see him, he doesnâ€™t want to have sex with me and he barely wants to touch my body. I am so sick of feeling this way. I am also in grad school and I cannot deal with the constant stress, I just want to escape everything.
