Almost killed myselfToday was really bad and I almost jumped out of the window a few hours ago. But I decided to turn on some music on youtube instead. 

I don't know how long I can keep up with this. Things never get better and I'm a loser. I don't know what to write man. I'm just really sad and lonely and boring.
