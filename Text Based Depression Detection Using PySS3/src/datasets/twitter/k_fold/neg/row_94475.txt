M14. Im considering suicide again.I have extremely severe social phobia, and im depressed.

My sozial phobia is so bad, that i am in a constant state of fear when i have to interact with people. I feel a literal pressure on my body, that is crushing me. I stutter (which i usually dont) and mispronounce or i cant spell or i forget what i was saying.

I am also depressed. It all started in primary school.
There was my girl-friend that i knew since kindergarten.
She had cancer and sadly died in 2nd grade.
When i was in 2nd-3rd grade, 4-6 kids would bully me. They pushed me to the ground and called me names, only to laugh at me.
My mother was an alcoholic and screamed at me all the time. She tried to commit suicide, but failed. She is now sober since november 2018.
I havent felt happy in over a year, but i cant do anything about it.
I have 2 friends, one doesnt care about me and the other constandly dumbs me and uses me.

I cant make new friends because of my anxiety.
I tried to tell my parents about me having sozial phobia and being depressed, but my i cant say anything because of my sozial phobia.

I tried a kind of amphetamine, to supress my problems, but when the drug whore off they came back.
Im also addicted to caffeine pills because im not motivated to do anything. Without them i would just lie in my bed 24/7. The things that used to bring me joy dont anymore. The last time i felt genuinely happy, was when i was on drugs.

I hate my body i have diabetes (born with it), my feet are at a wrong angle and i have bad eyesight. I was also overweight.

I already had suicidal thoughts 2 years ago. They came back a few weeks ago. I just want to take the drugs and then end it all. There would be less than 10 people at my funeral. Only my parents and grandparents would care if i died.

I dont know what to look up to anymore.
