I will be alone for the rest of my life.I am 20. Never had sex, never had a GF. Never flirted and don't know how. Socially awkward. Horrible with conversations and small talk.
Most people like me end up killing themselves or living alone for the rest of their lives. Most people have had GF's, have flirted, had sex before me. They get to experience this while their young, which is why as adults it comes natural to them. All I want out of life is to have my dream job as a cop, settle down with someone, have kids, live a safe happy life . But all that is slowly being dashed away the more I think and realize things. My only real problem anymore really is that I don't have access to a gun.
