Had the perfect chance but stopped myself.. and I hate that I did.Was driving back home from lunch break when a semi blew straight through a stop sign in front of me. Everything slowed down and I knew this was my chance, that random chance I've been waiting for. For some dumb fucking reason though I slammed on my breaks and the semi missed t-boning me by literally inches. You'd think I should be glad about this but no, i'm not. This was that rare chance you get where you had "no control" over it. It just happened to be wrong place, wrong time. But I didn't let it happen. Later that night I broke down screaming why the fuck did I stop and contemplated downing all my pills. Literally don't know where i'm going with this just needed to get it out. I have others in my life that I'm keeping from doing the same thing that I can't let them see me like this. I fucking hate myself.
