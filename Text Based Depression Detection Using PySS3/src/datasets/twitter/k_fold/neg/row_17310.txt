im so tiredFor the majority of my life, my entire identity was based on my grades. My grades are fucking dying right now, and it's pretty much guaranteed that I'm about to fail my second semester in a row. I feel like I'm spiraling into insanity and self-doubt. I guess I've also been reevaluating what I want to do with my life, and I realized that all of my plans were based on what other people wanted me to do. I always thought that I would go to med school, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that I have absolutely no passion for health care. I can't see myself caring for other people at all, for fucks sake I can barely talk to other people. I guess that I "wanted" to be a doctor or smth because it looks like my art career ain't happening. Granted, I don't even like doing art anymore. None of the things i used to enjoy doing make me feel anything anymore.

On top of that, I've realized how fucking lucky I am. I'm relatively healthy, I have a supportive family, and I'm alive. It hit me that there's a shit ton of people out there who aren't as fortunate as I am. Every time I hear about someone my age dying or having a terminal illness, it makes me doubt everything I'm doing. I have this chance at life that they never did, and I'm fucking wasting it. I don't know why I'm constantly thinking this, I can't even say that this is a result of someone close to me dying and I've gone through nothing traumatic in my life.

My friends and family think everything is alright, or that I'm just choosing to hurt them by failing. If I kill myself, I'll absolutely fail them. If I seek any help, I'll fail them. I think I'm depressed and i'm terrified.

I don't know where I'm going with this, I'm just so tired but i don't feel like i have a right to be.
