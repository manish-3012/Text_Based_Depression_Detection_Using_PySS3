HelpI'm at a crossroads. A quite morbid one. Sorry if I upset anyone but I just need to get this out into existence. I really really want to end my life. Every waking moment is agony. Complete torture. I don't see a point nor have I ever seen a point in my existence. Ever since I was a child I always believed I deserved to die for some reason. It's just this constant pain of living with my poisoned mind. Its toxic, come too close and it'll start to rub off on you. The only reason why I'm still here is because of my mom and my three younger siblings. I have to take care of them I cannot abandon them. They are everything to me. I'm trying so hard to fight these thoughts but lately they seem to get worse and worse. I just want it to end. I am so exhausted I barley have enough energy to get up in the morning. I asked my mom to make a therapy appointment for me so I could get help but she's so busy trying to raise four kids I really don't want to be another burden on her. I'm almost eighteen and if I can make it then... well... maybe I have a chance at getting help. I just have to hold out.
