I'm so, so tiredI've been trying to get on hormones in order to transition for 3 years. The answer is always the same: wait. I have to wait, wait until my mother understands, wait until the therapists decides it's the right time, wait until I'm stable. How am I supposed to be stable if I am the thing I hate the most because they won't allow me to transition?

Now I'm moving away. I have to start the process all over again, from the begging. Another therapist who decides I'm not schizophrenic, another endocrinologist that analyzes my blood 10000 times because they don't know how to do their job, another waiting list.

I can't do it anymore. I can't wait anymore. It's been too long like this, and every day I hate myself more and more. Every day I look more girly. Every day I feel more tired, sad and hopeless.

I will probably kill myself if they tell me on Tuesday that I have to wait. Again. 

It will be alright. It's not like someone even cared
