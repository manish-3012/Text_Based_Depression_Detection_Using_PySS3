Why can't I have a fresh start Hey guys 
Thanks already for listening, I do t think you will be able to help all that much (people have tried) but I guess it's worth a shot. 
I'm a 20 year old male and for the past year I've been quite depressed and now it's reached a point where in thinking about self harm and suicide on a daily basis. I had a lovley girlfriend of many years. I truly loved her, I was going to ask her to marry me. 

She cheated on me and is now with that guy 
All my close friends are her close friends aswell 
I never told them the circumstances behind our breakup

They have gotten over me not moving on from her, they think im being silly ( so do i )

I'm just finding moving on so difficult, I miss her every day. Sadly there is so much around me to remind me of her that i now hate making the trek to university because te train passes through so many places we used to go, it's so depressing 

I wish I could have a fresh start, I can't change uni and I need to help my parents around the farm so I can't move out 

I bought myself a motorbike, a year ago I never thought I'd be the kinda guy that liked to go fast, I think if I do ever pick a way to go it will be using the bike 

I wish u had a chance for a fresh start, everything reminds me of her and I can see no other escape
