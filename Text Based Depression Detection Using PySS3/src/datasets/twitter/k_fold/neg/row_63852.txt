I want to die, never could've known life would be like thisNo friends or acquaintances since early childhood. Sexually trafficked for multiple years as a teen due to not understanding social signals. Have tried dozens of psych meds but nothing works due to my atypical neurology, therapies haven't worked "how they're supposed to", TMS didn't work, last thing left is ECT and success rates don't look promising. Born into a world that is hateful of autistic people, in my experience. All while nothing makes me happy or sparks joy, and the few things I do want to do I'm incapable of due to poor health. Life feels like a sick joke. Dozens of involuntary psych ward stays due to being depressed and suicidal, but they just abuse you in there, milk your insurance for money, then let you back out worse off than before.
