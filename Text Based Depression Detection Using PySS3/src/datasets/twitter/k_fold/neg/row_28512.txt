I'm doing it today when my parents aren't home0 friends, 0 true happiness that I have experienced in my life, 0 days for the past 3 years where I wanted to live. I've given up all hope and today I'm gonna go up on the highest floor of my apartment and jump off. Nothing has ever happened good in my life or ever will.
