i feel stupid giving my friends hope when i know i will eventually kill myselfnothing ever changes. I can have a really good week but the next day ill be back in my bathroom with my door locked waiting for the police. Ive given it time, ive seen if things can get better but they WON'T. no one understands that about me. I know i need to do this eventually, its pointless giving my friends a false sense of security. Better then not worrying about me though i guess..
