I told my boyfriend that I nearly killed myselfThat was a few weeks ago. And today he told me that since he heard that he feels he can no longer be so emotionally invested in me because he needs to
protect himself if Iâ€™m going to die at any moment. 

This is what happens when you try to talk to people right? They leave you. Wish I could just find the courage to end it once and for all.
