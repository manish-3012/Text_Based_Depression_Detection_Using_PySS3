Why are the simple things too much to ask for?OW. My head hurts.  Why is it that even the simplest things. Like having someone there to hold you or cuddle with so damn difficult to obtain. FUCK!!!  All I want is someone to be here to hold me and cuddle with me. With no other expectations. The universe fucking hates me and thinks I deserve punishment and isolation instead of anything else.  Well time to get ready for a meeting and then who knows maybe it's time to fucking relapse like the dumb alcoholic that I am. Fuck me!!  (Anyone, no and about what I expected)
