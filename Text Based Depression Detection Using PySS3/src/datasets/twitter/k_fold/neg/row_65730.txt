I have nothing but regretWhen I was younger I was a horrible person, I did and say terrible stuff. all the friends I associated with were terrible people. I donâ€™t know why did and say all of that stuff back then. I tried getting better but I keep remembering how awful I was and doesnâ€™t help my depression. I donâ€™t know what to do about it
