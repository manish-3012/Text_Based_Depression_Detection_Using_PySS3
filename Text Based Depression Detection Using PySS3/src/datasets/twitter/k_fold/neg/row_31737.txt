holy fuckposting on my porn account instead of making a throwaway. i just told my girlfriend how i once cut my thighs deep enough to where my vision would go dark and i once almost hung myself. to the point where i was standing on a stool in the woods with a belt around my neck so close to kicking it down. shes the only person i've ever told and she told me to shut the fuck up and not say that. i dont know what to do. sometimes it feels like shes all i have. ive heard so many stories of people comforting suicidal people but now that i have firsthand experience it just seems thats bullshit. im dont even know what im gonna do with or to myself i cant deal with life rn.
