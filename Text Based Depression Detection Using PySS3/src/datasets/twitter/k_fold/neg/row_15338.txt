Feeling completely hopelessI feel so alone and hopeless I don't know what to do anymore. My boyfriend has been unemployed for six years. I couldn't afford any sort of Christmas for my daughter. I'm a horrible provider. My job had its hours cut now that the holidays are over, I can't afford to even pay my bills. I live in a 700 sq ft 1 bedroom with my daughter sleeping with us so I can't afford to down size. I don't have cable or cell phone plans, we use wifi for job applications. I use my friends Netflix so I can watch tv. I was affording basic necessities by going to school and taking out loans, but I got an email saying I no longer qualify for loans. I have no idea where our next meal is coming from or how I'll keep the electric and water on. I feel like everyone would just be better off without me.
