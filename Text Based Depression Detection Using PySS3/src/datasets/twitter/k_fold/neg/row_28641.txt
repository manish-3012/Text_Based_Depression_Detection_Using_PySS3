Im lost. Im confused. I want it all the stop.Im 23. I just graduated college. Im a good looking guy. My parents are angels and support me through anything. But the feeling of wanted to disapeer forever and just shut my brain off never goes away. I dont want to live anymore. I feel like the future doesnt have anything in store for me that is worth living for. Everything is such bullshit. Working 9-5 i cant do that shit. Ive never held a job for more than 3 months. No internships. Nothing. I feel like i have so much potential and its just going to waste. And i have no desire to get off my ass and grind for something. I literally dont want to do anything. I just want to die and sleep in eternal peace where none of my thoughts can haunt me.
