I ended all of my friendships so that I could kill myself in peace but I still don't feel readyI just burned every bridge. Nobody that used to love me wants to be around me anymore. The only person I was able to talk to hates me now, so I'm all alone, and ready to do it. I already have it all planned out. I don't know though. I just want to end the pain, but every time I think about killing myself, I see the pain in my mom's eyes. I see my brother, my role model, crying. I'm glad none of my old friends will be sad because I cut myself off from them, but I still feel bad. I just don't see the point of living. 99&amp;#37; of my life is pain, so why should I keep living for the good 1&amp;#37;? I'm sorry this is all over the place, this is the first time I'm reaching out like this.
