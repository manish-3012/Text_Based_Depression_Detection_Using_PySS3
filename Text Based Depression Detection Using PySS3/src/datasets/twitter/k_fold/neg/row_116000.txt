Here's a Dramatic Pre-Suicide NoteSex is my obsession, Iâ€™m a porn addict. I masturbate and watch pornography every day, often on multiple occasions throughout the day. Itâ€™s been this way since 7th or 8th grade. I need to masturbate or else I donâ€™t feel normal, but it doesnâ€™t cut it anymore. I need something real, I need to love something, someone. Iâ€™m never going to find it. Iâ€™m void of emotion and anything remotely human. Iâ€™m morbidly obese. I have acne and sores all over my body. My father has sores even worse than I, to the point where Iâ€™m concerned for his life and the possibility of lethal infection. Genetically, this tells me that my skin will only get worse. I donâ€™t think anybody in the last 6 or 8 years has been attracted to me. Today I laid in bed from 11am to 3pm, just curled up repeating the phrase in my head, â€œI want to die,â€ over and over and over again. Iâ€™m so alone, I spend most of my time alone, most human contact is forced and involves some sort of transaction. Iâ€™ve been lightly suicidal since the 7th or 8th grade. The idea has always been there, especially in rough times. Iâ€™ve always had the feeling that Iâ€™m not good enough, in middle school I realized that suicide was an option, it was always there as a way out. The only girl thatâ€™s ever liked me is my current obsession. She liked me in middle school and I turned her down because I thought she was ugly. This is literally the worst mistake Iâ€™ve ever made in my whole life. This person still and is currently in my life, and sheâ€™s by far the best thing in my life. I do anything I can to spend time with her, when Iâ€™m around her I feel calm and feel like I can tell her anything. I just want to do anything I can to make her feel loved and special, but she doesnâ€™t want it. Iâ€™ve told this person I liked her and found out sheâ€™ll never view me as anything more than a friend/brother figure. I would marry this person in a second, I would go to the ends of the world for this person, but she has no intention of ever loving me or being attracted to me. I love her, but not enough to let her go I guess. God or the universe or maybe even luck gave me many chance for success in my early youth and I fucked it up. I feel like my whole life has been a series of missed opportunities. I had an opportunity to get a full ride scholarship for music and I turned it down to instead study science, yet another fuck up. Now I want to go to school for music, but Iâ€™m so rusty, Iâ€™ll never be good enough. I canâ€™t look at myself in the mirror. My life is constant anxiety and lethargic wasted time. I gave up on science in my studies at college. I hated it, I only did it to maybe someday get a good paying job. Iâ€™m planning on going to school for music, but Iâ€™ll never be good enough to make a living off it. I donâ€™t have the focus or intelligence to study anything. The only reason I can go to college is because itâ€™s a business that does everything it can to make money, and my grandparents happened to be rich and willed me a lot of money for education. I have an amazing blessing that most people will never have, and Iâ€™ve already fucked away 3 years of time and money; time and money that could have educated and benefited a worthier person. I didnâ€™t plan on writing a suicide note, but I guess this is it. A few months ago, I was planning on killing myself with sleeping pills, mainly as a cry for help. I wanted to die, but also didnâ€™t. I knew that I would either die, which might be nice, or gain the attention of anybody that loves me, which also might feel nice for a moment. I didnâ€™t buy the sleeping pills because a lethal dosage cost $60. Itâ€™s funny that Iâ€™m so cheap that I would back out of a suicide attempt due to money alone. Ironically, Iâ€™m going to spend around $200 on a shotgun tomorrow to blow my brains out. I donâ€™t want to put on a show anymore, I just want to leave this world. I really want to die, Iâ€™m ready to see whatâ€™s on the other side of this physical world and find out if I can leave this cycle and prison of life. I donâ€™t want it anymore, I canâ€™t handle it anymore. To all my friends and family, Iâ€™m truly sorry if Iâ€™ve brought you any unwanted feeling or emotions, but this is my life and I didnâ€™t want to live it anymore. This is no reflection against you all, I love you all very much and enjoyed every moment, I just couldnâ€™t stand being around myself. Happy travels everybody and chin up, this world isnâ€™t that important anyway.
