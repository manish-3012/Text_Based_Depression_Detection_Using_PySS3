I genuinely resent livingThere is nothing particularly appealing about existing. I feel like Iâ€™m doing it wrong all the time. None of the many good things in my life make it any less miserable. Every day i have to convince myself to stay alive long enough to experience the happiness and satisfaction that Iâ€™m supposed to believe will come if I just try harder. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I want to give up.
