Not sure what to do anymore, and bad thoughts are coming back into my head.I am not sure what to do anymore. I am not sure if I truly want to kill myself, but I want the pain to stop. I want to stop waking up every morning and hating myself. I want to stop hurting. I didn't want to end things before, but it is starting to seem like a good way to stop the pain.

All my pain comes from getting close to people. The closer I get the more they hurt me. The worse part is they do not mean too. But, it just keeps happening. I feel like I've fucked everything up and I can't find a way out.

I don't know what to do.
