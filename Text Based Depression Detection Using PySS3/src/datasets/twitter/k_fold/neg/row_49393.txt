I made my decision.I am going to kill myself, maybe today or maybe tomorrow. I am tired of this sad and toxic house - mostly of my father. Everyday we need to walk over eggshells, everyday I fear he is going to hit me or manipulate me - he used to hit me when I was younger and tried this year. I gonna take antidepressants and high blood pressure pills, I am done. I dont know if it is going to work, but I am done of being lonely, of feeling fear and sadness. I am done. Fuck my family, fuck my abusive ex and fuck my so called friends irl that doesnt even try to call me. I am done. Fuck everything. I lost 20 years of my life - only studying, stuck at home and being depressed because of that toxic man. I dont wanna live anymore, nor wait. Gonna send my saving money to charity and kill myself.
