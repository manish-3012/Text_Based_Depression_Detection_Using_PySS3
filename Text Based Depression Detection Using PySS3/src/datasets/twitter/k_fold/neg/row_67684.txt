People don't seem to careYou know the more I think about it the more I think people don't really care about you. Society doesn't care about you. People on the internet don't really care about you and neither do people in real life. People want to help you because they think that's what they should do but people don't try to truly empathize with you and understand you and they look at things as trying to fix you and make you better instead of trying to understand you.
