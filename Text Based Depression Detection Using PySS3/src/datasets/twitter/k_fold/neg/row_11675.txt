One of my (genderqueer) online friends is about to commit suicide. I don't know where else to go for help because he's too far away for me to help...[1st tweet](https://twitter.com/roxorfoxor/status/74565574428082178) / [2nd tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/roxorfoxor/status/74565644036743169)

&gt; Fuck it all. Going to drive to the Columbia river. Always wanted to see what the INSIDE of a hydroelectric generator looked like anyway.

&gt; And may I come out the other side so pulverized they won't be able to ID my body as male.

Honestly, I have no idea what to do in this situation. I don't even know her very well, but she has been struggling with her gender identity for awhile and this suicide threat could very well be honest. Someone please help me figure out what to do...
