Five reasons.I'm really really struggling right now. I feel like a failure, like an unwanted piece of shit. I've been looking for ways to end this for a few weeks now but I look at my parents and stop. They've gone out of town for three days and now the urge is very strong to end it all. I have no one I can talk to. 

If any of you could please give me five reasons, just five reasons to carry on. Please.
