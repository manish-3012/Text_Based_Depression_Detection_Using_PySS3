I'm an awful person and I don't deserve to be here.I'm a pathological liar. I lie to everyone to get what I want. I hide things from my parents because I think it's easier than telling the truth. I lie to my psychologist to make my parents feel better. I don't want to worry them but as a result everything gets worse because I keep lying.

For 5 years I was smoking pot all the time. My grades in college were suffering. I'm in my 5th year and I still haven't graduated. I have no motivation. I started dating someone who I had a lot in common with (unfortunately smoking too) and my parents found out I was still smoking after catching me twice already. They thought I could do better than her so any time I spent with her was pure stress. I told my parents I stopped seeing her but talked to her every day.

I understood where they were coming from but I didn't want to accept it. I just told them what they wanted to hear and thought I was doing good because they weren't worried. 

I skipped school today to see her and of course my mother finds out. I feel like I've lost all respect and trust. I'm trash as a human being. I don't deserve the love and support my parents give me because I just take advantage of it and do what I want.

Not a day goes by where I don't think about ending it. I can't seem to do anything right. I'm just lazy and unmotivated. Everyone tells me what a great person I am but it's like I can't accept it. I still feel like garbage and I don't deserve anything. Every time I face my parents with the look of betrayal and disappointment in their eyes I just want to die right there. And yet I keep lying. If there's a hell I have a one way ticket already.
