I can't do anything right, the only thing I'm good at is shaking and crying.I'm such a fuck up- I fuck everything up. Every time I do something- it's fucking wrong.

The reason I feel so upset in this moment- I can't even keep a fucking secret. Here I am telling it to fucking strangers because I've just fucking given up. I'm an artist of sorts, I just draw a bit, kinda looks like Anime I guess? Anyway, a friend-lets call her Pandora- wants me to draw the staff team (I'm a moderator on a minecraft server, I'm the newest mod) and so I say alright, it will be fun I guess. As I move down the line drawing some of the staff, it gets to Pandora's friend, lets call him Loki. I don't know what he looks like, so Pandora sends me a photo she took once of him (through skype) without him knowing. I use it to draw him, and I guess at some point -that I have no remembrance of, I was drawing so it's easy to miss things right?- she told me not to tell him I have a photo if he asks, just to say Pandora described him.

I finish the drawing- I got Loki's eye color wrong- and Pandora takes it and sends it to the staff, they all love it and some use the photo as their skype photos. It's cool I feel great about that. Then, Loki asks how I drew him, and I said "Pandora had a photo of you for me to use" and we joked about it, then Pandora came on and yelled at me, saying Loki will think she's a creep now and such.

So I already have a terrible memory, but if someone tells me to keep a secret-and I actually see it- then I remember and don't let it out. Who would? Shitty friends. But I was an accident I didn't mean to- so am I still a shitty friend? I don't know anymore.

So I apologize to her and leave it at that really. I tell her not to trust me. Rather telling her to make sure I say "alright I will keep it a secret" (that means I saw it and accept) I just tell her not to trust me because it's simple that way I'm sure she wouldn't have trusted me naymroe anyway

So I go on feeling bad. She asks me to tell her if he talks about her, like bad or good, so she knows. So, next day when I'm talking to Loki, he mentions her, doesn't seem uncomfortable, so I Tell her.
I ask if they spoke, to see if they have, if he spoke to her then I know and I don't have to be involved anymore because then it's not my thing anymore right. She gets mad at me, saying that it's none of my business, but- IT IS RIGHT? She is mad at me and I am trying to see the end, that means I'm part of it rigth? It concerns me in no way that they are friends, I Don't even care- I have my own life and friends and shitty fucking feelings where I fucking hate myself- so I don't care about her life, it's just making sure she's not mad at me in the end, right? That's my business... Nothing more, nothing less.

She just- every time since that happened she seems to get mad at me and I just feel like shit like I can't do anything right I can't please her...

Then other mod stuff, I'm new and no one really explained everything to me so I have to deal with criticism while I learned all of the commands. It's fine but then as I know them now everyone hates me like "she's the stupid mod lets wait for someone else" even if I'm the only mod for that day with a bunch of players on. That part alone is making me think I should leave because it's stressed me out so far. Like it's a game, I know i'm a moderator now on it but ya know ;-; So simple solution to just stop. The thing is I'm friends with them all so I feel if I stop being a mod I am afraid they won't talk to me anymore- I mean I guess then they aren't "good friends" or "real friends"

I was asked to change the road in a town and I accidentally made a bunch of trees and ruined it because I didn't turn it off- like the plugin to make trees EVERYWHERE

I tried to help making a video and I couldn't get the words out, even writing them all out I couldn't just READ THEM OUT.

Gave me power to spawn things in I accidently spawned in 25 ender dragons and destroyed the buildings around us- we didn't kill asll the dragons so sometimes people run into them and we have to go kill them.

I just feel like everyone is always mad at me and think they might say bad things about me behind my backs and just I'm crying now thinking about it I care about them that's why ;-;

I fucking fail at everything though, washing dishes, cleaning my room, cleaning cat poop boxes, cooking- Don't even get me started on cooking. We don't have the food stamps we used to get- after 6 months they give you less money, so we don't always have rnough food, so I'm so fucking hungry and I can't even cook. I burned oat meal (which I lvoe because it's so plain it doesn't make me sick) so I cried almost all day because of it. I hate wasting food so I just felt bad...

Fucking burned oatmeal I don't understand and I'm crying again I'm so upset about it.

I have an earache again, I hate it, I hate pain, I have a high pain tolerance but I just feel so much pain all of the fucking time. I have an illness, so I'm in pain a lot, and I'm always sick.

Another fucking thing- I can't even get a fucking ultrasound because I can't hold pee in that long so I just end up crying and hyperventilating. I drank so much water one day hoping to just make it, I got sick because I drank to much water. YOU CAN GET SICK FROM DRINKING TOO MUCH WATER AND OF COURSE ME- THE FUCK UP- DID IT. I was then scared to drink water for a week. I can drink it now and I'm glad.

fucking water how do I fuck that up really. just I want to do somehting right. I want to know what it's like for people to think i'm cool or I'm good at sdomething. Anything. Please- no matter waht it is as long as a single person thinks it's cool. One fucking thing, I donb't have a single fucking thing,

I need an ultra sound to see if the cyst is growing back, I had a cyst on my ovaries that was really big. I also need a check, like a gynecologist. I'm feeling better about that, nervous of course, but not afraid. I've never been afraid of hospitals, I actually like them a lot.

My friend hates me because she found out some of my past. She said she wouldn't judge, but she did.

I feel so alone, and I'm pushing people away because of it. I got kicked ffrom my smite game with my friend because I was idle because Pandora was yelling at me becaue ya know, I'm a fuck up. and my title is stupid, I can't even cry, I don't cry like a norma person, I breath out and then just sob while trying to breath in and when I finally do it unleashes and ugly fucking sound like wht the fuck.

I fuck up everything. My friend asked me to play agame with him right now and I said no because well you knows I'M crying and I can hardly fucking see

When I have tears my eyes burn also. What the fuck. so my eyes hurt all of the fucking time becuae I'm a fucking bitch who just cries all fucking day apparently.

there are days I feel okay, been pretty happy and enjoying myself playing with friends on the minecrft server and such, and I did sme school work, 

but days I fall back into this hole of saddness. It's more recently, I think without Pandora, all of the other stresses wouldn't wear me down so much, but just Pandora making me feel like I can't do anything right just- ugh,.

My body is the biggest fuck up. Fucking illness. Fucking pain. Fucking sensitive skin. I have bandages all over my fiucking fingers. my ear hurts. my teeth hurt- fuck that stupid teeth growing in stupid wisdom teeth. Stupid ants and heat and such. I was geting beter at sleeping, but it's so hot now I can't sleep. For once my body thinks "lets stop  being so stupid as to avoid sleep, and sleep- or wait it's summer it's to hot sorry"

Fuck.

I jsut- I want to leave everything. Leave my life. Pandora wouldn't have to worry about that fuck up that gives secrets away, Loki wouldn't have to worry about fixing a mess I made, the founder of the server wouldn't have to worry about killing ender dragons or teaching a shitty person how to play smite, Rye wouldn't have to worry about someone to won't play a game with them becuase they are crying their fucking eyes out, the head mod wouldn't have to worry about fixing when I spawn in trees everywhere. My brother wouldn't have to worry about making food when he gets home from his job, he can just pick up for himself. My mom would'nt have to get out of bed to take me to the doctors every week becayse I'm sick- she's sick also. My dad wouldn't have to curse out everyone because he has to take me when my mom is too sick, wouldn't have to waste his breath when yelling at me to do schoolwork that's too hard for me.

Grandpa wouldn't have to worry about me while he's busy getting better from sickness and surgery, grandma wouldn't have to chase after our car because I'm the one she wanted to talk to, no one else, other grandma wouldn't have to worry about the grandchild that refuses to eat or have to take care of because her paretns can't.

Friends don't have to check up on me because I want to die.

No one would sit through a stupid fucking rant by a fuck up. I'm so hungry, I feel like I could just- if I could eat- I'd lay down and sleep it off, waking up and just talking and joking around and hope to feel better. It's hard to sleep in heat and hunger.

The doctors wouldn't have to save someone who doesn't want to be saved.

I wouldn't have to be alive when I just feel so dead. I'm so sad.

So sad and hungry and it makes- I'm sad. I'm sad. I'm so sad. crying again, of fucking course. I asked if I can get something to eat and my mom said no, it's early though and I didn't eat much. There has to be something around to eat, right? I'm hungry. I'm sad. I'm in pain. My ovaries hurt so I'm sure there's something wrong with them and the next ultrasound -if it ever fucking happens- will show something is wrong. Why won't they let me die, why couldn't I just be one of those heavy bleeders adn died in some surgery. I had surgery after I was bleeding out anyway. internal bleeding, it was like diarrhea but with blood. So much, I was so faint. What if I didn't tell anyone, what if when my mom came to the door I just said I was fine. I was sick, laid in bed, and fucking bled out. Why can't I be fucking dead right now.

It's all I want, I'm so fucking sad with life. Things get better only to get worse again. Why can't they be better forever? Stomach hurts, it's just hunger pain though I recognize it. if only it meant I was dying soon, rather slowly over weeks.  Could I just starve to death? Would that be possible?

I'm so sad and want to die, but I want to be better- I wish I could be the one they ask to help, the one who is happy and smiles and makes jokes that are actually funny. I wish I knew how to keep a fucking secret.

I have a headache. I'm crying. I want to talk to one of my friends, but they all know the situation with Pandora, they will think I'm trying to make them sad and side. But does that matter if this situation means I might die? They won't know though, and if they accuse me of anything it might be the end, I don't know what to do.

Also, out of pills, pain. Hungry. Ate my cats food because I thought I needed it more, but that's not right, that cats life is above mine.
How can I just go to a friend and say "I am so sad right now please help me and don't get mad because if you do I am going to kill myself on the spot"

I can't even type in the fucking "are you not a robot" thing
