The idea of Suicide is getting comforting rather than scaryI've had vivid suicidal thoughts ever since 8 years old, they have become increasingly bad over the last 10 years. These thoughts always scared the absolute shit out of me. 

These last few weeks life has gotten so painful, I have romanticised the idea of going out how I want to and not having to deal with my mess.

 A multi-day crying period of constant and emotional relief. A letter to my family where I get to share my true thoughts. Followed by the most deafening feeling of anxiety, depression and fear, drowned out by pure opiod bliss and then nothing.

The fact that this excites and comforts me feels infinitely more worrying than the vivid gory suicidal fever dream I have been living. The only thing that's put me off is the fact I feel responsible for my Dad and Dog feeling the same way, and couldn't bear to make them feel any worse. Now they're on the way out I feel like lifes coming to an end.
