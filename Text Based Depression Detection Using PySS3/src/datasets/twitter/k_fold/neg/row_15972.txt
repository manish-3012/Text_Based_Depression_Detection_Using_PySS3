Please make me want to stayI see 0 redeemable qualities in my entore fucking life. Everyone if tried to love, doesn't love me back. Everyone hates me. Don't pretend as if someone does, they don't. I have tried. 

I wonder how it'll feel to swallow a bunch of pills. Would it hurt? I hope it does. Then the pain of my actual life.
