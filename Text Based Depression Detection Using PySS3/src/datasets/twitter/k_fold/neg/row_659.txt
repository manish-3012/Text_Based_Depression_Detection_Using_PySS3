I want to hold it off for a bitI was seriously considering sticking the knife in my neck today and then all of a sudden I just broke down crying because I was afraid of dying. Foolish isn't it? There's nothing holding me back and yet I thought to myself I don't want to kill myself right now.

I want to hold it off for a while. I want to wait until I'm actually ready for this, until I'm 100% sure about my decision. 

Fuck this was embarrassing. Breaking into tears while watching the TV. Goddammit I'm a coward.
