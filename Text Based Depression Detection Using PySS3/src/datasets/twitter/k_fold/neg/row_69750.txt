My first experience here on reddit is not a positive one. My sister took her life last night. She was a great person who always has a smile on her face. She was a single mother who tried hard to provide for her daughter. Now she's gone. I feel lost and I feel hurt and angry. her life was worth more than she could ever imagine. She was my best friend. my only sister. We were supposed to grow old together and take care of our parents until their time to pass came. Now I have to take care of burying her. She has lost the battle with depression that I didn't notice she was fighting. I should have known. I didn't notice the way her smile didn't reach her eyes anymore or how she would stay away. She was always so cheerful and positive that I failed to see that something was wrong. Her daughter will never know the love her mother had for her apart from what we tell her. She won't grow up being able to have those deep conversations with her mother. I miss her. I feel lost without her. Please if you are going through something like this, talk to someone. I guarantee you that someone cares. Someone loves you and wants to have you in their life. Dying isn't the answer. I now have to struggle to raise up money for her funeral. A funeral that if I had paid more attention we wouldn't  be having. don't break your families hearts. Talk to someone. talk to me if you have no one else you trust. I care about you and your life is with living. Just please this isn't the way out. I can't stress the importance of your life. Im sorry I failed her. Im sorry I couldn't help her. And if you see someone is hurting reach out to them. check up on your happiest friend because they might have demons that they can't handle and hide behind their smiled. Hold the people you love and let them know that you love them.
