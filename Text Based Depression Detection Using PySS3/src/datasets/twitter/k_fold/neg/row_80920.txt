I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with meIâ€™m 18, been living alone and working for about a year because my family kicked me out, because we never got along since I was about 10. Over time Iâ€™ve just found myself caring less and less about everything, Iâ€™ve stopped talking to everyone that cares about me, and back in July I just couldnâ€™t be bothered to get out of bed and go to work. Iâ€™ve been just using my savings since, but theyâ€™re going to run out and Iâ€™ll have no way of paying my rent next month. Everyone whoâ€™s cares about me has tried to reach out, but Iâ€™ve just ignored them and I just canâ€™t talk to anyone about it. I have literally nobody in my life anymore. I spend most of my time just lying in bed thinking about suicide, sometimes I go days without eating, but I canâ€™t sleep either. Sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense, I just need to talk to someone here please
