Just want to sleepI've been wanting to die, but not tonight. I just want to be knocked out for the night. I have nothing going on tomorrow and I just want to sleep and not have to feel this way for a little while. I have benadryl and melatonin but idk how much of either. I know people can't actually give advice like this on here so idk why I'm even posting... Honestly just trying to feel better. I've also been on r/anxiety but no one on there seems quite as desperate. Meanwhile I feel like if I don't do something soon, my anxiety will kill me, somehow. It's worse right now than its been in a long time.
