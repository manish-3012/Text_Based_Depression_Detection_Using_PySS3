Baker ErvinMy Brother

Lost in this waking dream looking for something real,
my brother Baker faded - mind and body separated.

Oh how I miss you, I wish I was there for one last chance to talk.
Just to convince you to not fade away from us, your loved ones - we miss you Baker.

This dream, this life, these tears Baker - nothing can replace you.
You will never fade out again - I love you.
