I honestly can't wait for it to be over.I felt like shit and been struggling for 5 years. I opened myself up to those close to me few months ago and it backfired. Now I'm treated like a joke by almost everyone and who they know. I knew it would happen too. Tried therapy and drugs and that didn't work either.
