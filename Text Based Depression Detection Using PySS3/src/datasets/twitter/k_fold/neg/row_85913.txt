T-minus 5 days until my 16th birthday (and my suicide)I made a pact with my best friend in 7th grade that we would kill ourselves by our 16th birthdays. Hers has already come and pass (she's still alive) and yet I feel as though I still need to do it. I have a plan and a method. I don't want to die, but I feel like I have to. Everyone else let down 11 year old me and now I have to do the one thing that she wanted so badly. I gave myself 5 years to turn my life around, to get cute and to make friends and get good grades but the past year of my life has been absolutely shit and I think this is my only option. I don't want everyone to be hurt, and I know they will miss me, but I can't do this anymore, and I don't break promises
