Im not sure what to do anymoreHi, I'm a highschooler and I play soccer at a relatively high level, like club wise. And that's really all I have in my life to keep me sane, like I am not smart enough to go to school for just education and I am not like rich enough to afford school without a I scholarship. I've had thoughts before like in middle school and my freshman year and sophomore year. I just got told that I am basically not good enough to play at a high level in college, I work hard everyday that I can and I feel like there's no point in living anymore if I ant play soccer and can't do. anything in my life, its not meaningful if I can't do anything. Im scared to tell my two friends that I have these thoughts because I feel like they're just gonna dismiss my feelings as like a joke. And I don't wanna say that I have depression cause I haven't gotten an actual like test to know if I have it or not. Im just not sure what to do anymore and what I have to live for.
