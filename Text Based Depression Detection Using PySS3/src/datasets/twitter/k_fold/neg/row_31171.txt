I forgot this feelingFor the past five years i've been dealing with depression. It kinda just came out on its own, i remember when i first felt it, it was like being knocked to the ground unable to do a thing. Eventually i was going to attempt suicide, but before i could a thought crossed my mind. I've been living because of that. But now i've been crushed and feeling horrible, saying i would kill myself but not. Untill now when i finally let the one thing i kept living for go. I remember last time i was going to do it, the calmness, its just peaceful. I don't know when i'll do it, but it will be soon.
