Struggling todayMy next door neighbor probably heard me, a 30 year old man, wailing for his mother. I'm so lost that I forgot how harmful and toxic she's been to me. I almost made the mistake of reaching out to her for comfort she has never been able to provide. There's no one left who I can turn to for help, even if it's just to provide a distraction. I am not coping well with being an adult. I can barely care for myself on a day to day basis. I have some sort of issue with my long term and short term memory and it makes everything so difficult in addition to other physical and mental struggles I can't ever seem to get a leg up on. I don't remember the last time I wanted to get out of bed. I only ever get up because I get uncomfortable or have to go to work.

I promised myself that I would outlive my immediate family. I don't want them to bury their son and little brother. My parents are older and my sibling is in poor health. It seems like the time I have left to wait is so long. Some days, the wait feels like it will be too long. These days have been getting more frequent and more intense.
