Iâ€™m trying to change my life but is it really worth it?I fucking hate everything about myself, I canâ€™t deal with it. Iâ€™m becoming an asshole and lashing out on my family. I donâ€™t have a job, despite applying  and going to interviews. I didnâ€™t go to college because Iâ€™m a dumb fuck, I canâ€™t remember anything. I barely graduated high school. I just want to fucking give up.

I often imagine myself dying in a tragic way so my family wonâ€™t be burdened with my cause of death. Iâ€™ve always wanted to get into a fight, maybe be beaten senseless. Maybe someone can murder me or I can get hit by a car. Iâ€™ve often thought about running away and just jumping to my death.

I want to feel pain as I die.
