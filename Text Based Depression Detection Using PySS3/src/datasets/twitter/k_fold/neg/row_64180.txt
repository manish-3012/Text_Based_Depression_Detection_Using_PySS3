Sitting on the top of an appartment right now, not sure if tonight will be my last day.16,  recently kicked out of my house for my parents finding drugs in my dresser.  I'm not sure if I should jump off the roof of this hotel.  It's around 6 stories, and no balconies, but I'm not sure if It will kill me straight away.  I've struggled with depression my entire adolescence,  and now that ive been out of my house, and off my meds,  im not sure anymore.  Any comment would be helpful,  I just want someone to talk to.
