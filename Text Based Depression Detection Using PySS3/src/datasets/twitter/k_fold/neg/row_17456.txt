Please help me. I don't know what to do. I feel like dying.Hello. I am an 9th grade student. Since 8th grade I had been doing quite well in my studies. I was an A student. After that I had some major family issue. My parent and abusive father and all. I used to have a really good relation with my mother. Now I almost hate hr. After the big mishap she had became distant. She forced me to be perfect. I tried to talk to her to tell her my worries but she always scoffed and glared at me for thinking that way. She became more distant. I started to loathe her. She always criticize me. Even now. I still tried to connect with her again. Now she is a successful business women. She doesn't really helps me. My social life also became pitiful. I tried to commit suicide but wasn't able to. When my mother found out I thought she would comfort me and ask what was my problem. But she just said "Are you out of your mind? You still have to become perfect! You are good for nothing! You disappoint me! All i even did was 'love' you Grow up!" were her exact words. I cant help but hate her now. Now my grades have dropped badly. I cant seemed to find any goal. I just don't care. I hacve become tired of being perfect. help me.
