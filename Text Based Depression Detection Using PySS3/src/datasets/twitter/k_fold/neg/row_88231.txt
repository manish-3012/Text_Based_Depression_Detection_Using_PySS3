I feel so conflictedI feel horrible. Iâ€™m too scared to open up to anyone because Iâ€™m worried theyâ€™ll just go tell the office and boom, I have to run another lap through the system that has done virtually nothing for me the first two times. Same deal with my parents. You canâ€™t open up about suicide without consequences, and Iâ€™m sick of the ones. I feel guilty because I know Iâ€™d worry everyone because of course they donâ€™t want me to die, if they care about me or not they donâ€™t want somebody to kill themselves regardless. I feel so bad for feeing like this regardless of what anyone does to try and help me, even if itâ€™s gotten better since the last time I went through the system, suicide still feels most optimal even though I really donâ€™t want to die.
