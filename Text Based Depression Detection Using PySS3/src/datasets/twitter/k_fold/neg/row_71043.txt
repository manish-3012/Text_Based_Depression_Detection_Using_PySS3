I can't stop fantasizing about dyingI almost just ordered rat poison online because a) it seemed like the easiest method and b) hopefully I'd change my mind by the time it arrived 

But I did some googling and I couldn't find the perfect lethal dose to kill a human. All I found were horror stories like of a man who injested rat poison and ended up bleeding in the hospital for two months and so on. Not a single case where someone died. 

I've been wanting to kill myself ever since I was 12. I'm almost 25 now. Every single day of my existence has been exhausting. I have not one friend. Nobody. I'm forced to live with my mother and brother because I dont make enough to move out and they HATE me. 

My mother is bipolar and my brother is the most selfish person I have ever come across. The two of them care about NOTHING more than money. And all I want to do is die. 

My idea of relaxing is sitting back and imagining myself dying. Them finding my body and being relieved. My old friends wondering what happened. Me being the talk of the town for a week. Its what keeps me going, ironically.  

I hate my life and my existence so much. Every minute I'm alive is like being punished. If somebody helped me kill myself I would give them every valuable thing I own before I go, to thank them. Pleadse help me do it. 

Human beings shouldn't be made to live against their will. Its cruel.
