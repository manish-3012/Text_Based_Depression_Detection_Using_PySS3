Iâ€™m over itI donâ€™t hate myself. I actually think Iâ€™m a decent person. Life is so beautiful and filled with so many reasons to stay alive. I love my family and I actually like my co workers, and enjoy being alive in general. Going to the movies playing video games hanging out along with my hobbies are great ways to pass time. I even get invited to hang out every once in a while, itâ€™s cool! But my depression is always there creeping in my mind. Learning to deal with it took a while but itâ€™s cool. What I canâ€™t handle is the pain. Iâ€™m in pain all the time. I hate it. Doctors donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong and neither do I. I want it to be over. Iâ€™ve been dealing with it for over a decade and Iâ€™m only in my 20â€™s. I want it to be over.  Death seems to be the only logical way. Just wanted to vent. I feel I may die soon.
