I Never Told Anyone ThisIf you were to ask the people around me to describe me, they would all describe me as something I'm not. Here is who I actually am. Since about my freshman year of high school (I graduated earlier this month) I've felt off. I grew depressed and anxious really quickly, and after my first year I started to self harm. Throughout the rest of high school I got worse and worse and I thought of suicide daily (this was during and after my junior year). During high school I also found out that I was bisexual and that Iâ€™m very unsure of my own gender identity. Since my parents are very religious, I chose not to discus this with them. But Iâ€™m so shy that I kept this all a secret from everyone else I know. Keeping all of this a secret has seemed to worsen my mental state. Itâ€™s gotten so bad that four weeks ago I ran away from home so I could kill myself. It failed of course. Everyone just thinks I ran away that day because I just wanted to. No one actually knows the truth. I can hide the scars pretty well. Unfortunately, one of my many problems is social anxiety, which is the main reason why Iâ€™ve never talked to anybody about this. Everyone knows that it feels terrible not being able to talk about your problems and not even being able to be yourself around other people. Whether or not I will attempt suicide again I donâ€™t know, but Iâ€™d say the probability is pretty high. There isnâ€™t anything I can do in this world, so why stay in it.
