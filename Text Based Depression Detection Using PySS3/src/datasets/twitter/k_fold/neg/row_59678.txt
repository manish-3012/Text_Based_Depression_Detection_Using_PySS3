ContemplatingI've been sitting here for about an hour now with a bottle of pills in hand, I want to die but I know people will be sad. But I'm miserable 24/7 and have been for the last two years. I hate myself so much and I wish I was someone else. Someone with some fucking redeemable qualities. I wish I was good at something. My friend said I was a good friend but it doesn't matter because they just think I'm annoying anyway. I hate everything
