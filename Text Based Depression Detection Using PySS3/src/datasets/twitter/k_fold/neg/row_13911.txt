Need advise: Upcoming appointmentIâ€™m seeing psychiatrist/psychologist next week for the first time ever. I am going to be as honest as possible with them about my suicidal thoughts and everything. Is it bad that I kinda want for them to baker act me? I want to disappear from the world for a little while. I want to make a point to my job whoâ€™s overworking me. To my friends who donâ€™t see how I feel. To my relationship that is causing so much stress. 

I just kinda want them to see how bad it is. Maybe me getting locked up for a few days would let everyone know that Iâ€™m serious.
