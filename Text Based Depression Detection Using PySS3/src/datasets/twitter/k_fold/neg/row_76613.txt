i canâ€™t do this for another 65 years, or however long iâ€™ll naturally liveiâ€™m 16 and a junior in high school. i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder about 2 years ago, but iâ€™ve been dealing with this shit since at least first grade. 

freshman year, when i was diagnosed, i had pretty much hit rock bottom. i didnâ€™t care about anything, iâ€™d missed over a month of school, i was too depressed to shower or even get out of bed. the only thing keeping me alive was the fear of hurting my family and friends. i tried lexapro, zoloft, effexor, paxil, and vistaril to no avail. prozac miraculously worked, if only for a few months. i quit therapy and quickly fell back into old habits, stupidly keeping it from my parents.

my mom noticed me slipping recently, but she doesnâ€™t know how bad itâ€™s gotten. my psychiatrist maxed out my prozac dosage and put me on wellbutrin and concerta, but i havenâ€™t noticed a difference in the last few weeks. i want to end everything, but iâ€™m still too scared of hurting people. lately iâ€™ve been thinking about faking a kidnapping and just killing myself in the middle of the woods. i donâ€™t know. 

i guess i came here looking for some support from people who actually understand this feeling. my parents are so supportive, but they donâ€™t get it. so, yeah. thanks.

i donâ€™t think iâ€™m going to school tomorrow.
