In a bad placeI canâ€™t do this anymore, the pretending to be ok.  I just want to never wake up.  That would be so much easier.  I wouldnâ€™t shame my family, and I imagine their emotional trauma would be far less.  My mental state is constantly eroding despite being on multiple antidepressants.  I just canâ€™t do this.  I really canâ€™t.
