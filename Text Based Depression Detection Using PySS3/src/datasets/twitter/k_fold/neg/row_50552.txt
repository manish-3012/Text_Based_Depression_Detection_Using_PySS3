hey, what color is your world right now?I don't know what do i want but i know what   she wanted. The only reason to die is because i want to see her again, her smile, her eyes, to heard her voice again. I am pretty sure that dead word is not exist and i will never see her again. So what a damn purpose to live without her? I don't know what color is my world right now. seems, i like red, but green is so annoying. I tried to listen music, but what did i see.. NOTHING! This is a bad joke. Well, have a nice day!
