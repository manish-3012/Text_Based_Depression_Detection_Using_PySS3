Iâ€™m slowly veering off back into depression and this time I feel like Iâ€™m not going to be able to handle it.Iâ€™ve been feeling good for a little over a month, but Iâ€™m sinking back into the hole I had just crawled out from. Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts and Iâ€™m no longer afraid of hurting my parents or family. The only thing keeping me back is how I would be remembered by other people. I have friends, more than some people wish for. But I canâ€™t appreciate it. They canâ€™t make me feel better. Whenever I meet up with them weâ€™re drinking. I have only one friend with whom I sometimes (rarely) meet up with and weâ€™re not drinking. Iâ€™m back on smoking, I lost my shit because this weekend because I didnâ€™t get a chance to get shitfaced. My heart is also being slowly ripped into pieces. Itâ€™s been long since Iâ€™ve felt that bad. Iâ€™m slowly becoming a psychopath and a shitty human being. Iâ€™m afraid of myself. I want to cry but I canâ€™t. Why canâ€™t I just be a normal man?
