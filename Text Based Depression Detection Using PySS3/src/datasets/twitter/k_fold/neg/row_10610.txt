I feel so low it physically hurtsMy heart hurts from the pain, I wish I could just disappear, my parents have gone through so much because of me, they do so much to make me happy ,Even my siblings are jealous, I feel so guilty they have to deal with me, see their child try to kill themselves everyday, crying from depression. I just want them to know I love them so much, I canâ€™t even describe how much I love them, and Iâ€™m so sorry for what Iâ€™m doing, what I am feeling, what I am going to do in the future, I would love to change mum and dad but I canâ€™t.

I just wish there is something I can do to feel happy again.
