I fucked up. There's no path forward.I'm in my 30s. I've long lived with depression, anxiety, and ptsd. I have struggled with these illnesses. I met an amazing bright soul when I was 19. We stayed together, got married. We had our shitty moments and our best moments. Recently, this bright soul told me that he saw no path forward for us. I was (am?) emotionally abusive, emotionally dependent. I was in therapy to address these problems years ago, I thought I was doing better. But he saw no path forward even if I went through more therapy and counseling. I fucked up, I fucked him up. I didn't know it was so bad. My mom was abusive, she was a monster, I wasn't like her. Now he is going to leave--good for him, he deserves better.


This comes after my job cut my hours and I might lose it. No one is really hiring because of the pandemic. It's all too much to bear. I feel like I'm never going to get better. I hurt the person I love the absolute most in the world and I was too goddamned stupid to see it until he said  "I'm ending this." My life is knocked out from under my feet. I've been searching for an effective method. It's not a cry for attention, not revenge, not "I can't live without him." I'm fucking done. Like done done done. I'm tired of depression, I'm tired of fucking up everything. I hope my dogs forgive me.
