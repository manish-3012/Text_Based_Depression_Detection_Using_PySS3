Can't shake the idea of swallowing several razor blades. I have been very depressed for a while now. Won't bore you with the details. I find myself endlessly wondering if swallowing half a dozen or so razor blades wrapped in a cooked lasagna noodle would finally be the way to create a situation where i couldn't pussy out of dying. It's a maddening temptation I have been fighting off for literally months.
