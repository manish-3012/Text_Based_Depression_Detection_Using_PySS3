I don't knowi tried to overdose a couple of weeks ago. I don't know why. I don't think I i want to die but I don't know what to do anymore. people ask me if I'm sad or scared or is something wrong at college or at home, but nothing is wrong. I just can't connect with people, life feels like one big string of failures, even success doesn't paint over the feeling of emptiness for long. I hurt myself to try and make something happen. but how can I stop if the only reason I'm doing it is because there is nothing happening??? I'm so empty and lonely and even when people try and help they can never get in and I don't know what's wrong with me I don't even know who I am. I don't know what I can do anymore but keep hurting myself and doing stupid shit to try and feel like I have some control over my feelings
