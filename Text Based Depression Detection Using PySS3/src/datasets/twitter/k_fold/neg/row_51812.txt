My Best Friend Has Been Contemplating Suicide For Several Days Now. I Think She's Goinh Through With It Today.as the title says, my best friend has been contemplating suicide for multiple days now, she's been depressed for years but she just told me that she doesn't think she'll make it to the end of today, or even the end of next week. unfortunately, she lives in a different country from my own and I have little means of helping aside from texting her. I desperately need advice on what I can possibly do to prevent her from harming herself. I've been trying to cheer her up but of course there's only so much I can do given our distance from each other. 

apologies if I'm in the wrong place, but I desperately need advice and answers as soon as possible.
