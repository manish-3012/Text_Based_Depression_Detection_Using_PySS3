I let my OCD go too farI can't focus on anything anymore. Can't sleep so I can't go to work. Can't focus on TV, games, or anything. I just think. My brain sabotages every attempt at fun. The intrusive thoughts are so consistent I can't have a conversation. I haven't slept in 4 days. The only reason I'm holding out is for my parents, but I know it's hopeless. Therapy can't do anything if you can't focus on what they're saying to you. I wish I could get a labotomy because I simply can't do this to my parents. But I also can't take this very much longer.
