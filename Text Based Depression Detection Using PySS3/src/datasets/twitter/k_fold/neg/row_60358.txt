I think I'm bipolar but I can't get helpOver the last four years almost I've been drifting between periods of depression and phases where I want to be okay and feel better. Um....but here's the thing, where I come from mental illness isn't something anyone really acknowledges. I know if I alert my mother (single parent), I'll probably be brushed off. But recently I've been having severe depressive mood swings and the very next morning I'm bubbly and happy . But the depressive mood swings usually turn suicidal. My boyfriend tries to help me but it's not really working because we're both kids and have no way how to handle this. I've not been able to focus on studies, which has never been a problem and it's crucial that I do, especially this year. I also have severe anxiety, where I worry about even the smallest things and it's really making me lose my mind.
I'm sorry for going on a rant, but I needed someone to listen to me for once. Please, if there's any websites or anything I can use to help myself please share it because I'm in desperate need. I've been through some really bad shit in the last six years of life and I don't know whom to turn to for help, because the adults in my life don't really get the concept of 'mental illness'. I really desperately am seeking for any straws to grasp on. I really want to be able to do better.
