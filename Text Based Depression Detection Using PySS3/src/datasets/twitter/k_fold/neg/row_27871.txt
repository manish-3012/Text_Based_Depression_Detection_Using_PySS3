I have a therapy appointment tomorrow that I've been waiting months and it's the LAST chance I'm giving therapyI don't even wanna type it all out, I'm just exhausted. I've seen so many therapists and whatever other mental health professionals I don't even remember most of their names. I've had almost exclusively very bad experiences with therapists. I almost hanged myself a few days ago and one thing I said is I can wait and see this therapist. If it doesn't go well tomorrow then there's nothing left I can do. I've already given SO much more effort than anyone should be expected to. I'm not gonna "just keep trying" any longer if tomorrow goes badly. I really really can't keep trying forever.
