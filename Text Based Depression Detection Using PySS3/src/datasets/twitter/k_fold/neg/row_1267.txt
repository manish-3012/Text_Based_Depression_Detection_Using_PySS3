Got a DUI last night and will probably lose my job.I've been up for 36 hours and have been talking to lawyers all day. I got pulled over for speeding and my friends in the car were visibly drunk which started the whole process. The whole time I was in jail all I could think about was: how could I kill myself in jail because the rest of my life is pretty much fucked now. I got out after I had a low enough BAC and the lawyers I talked to said I'll lose my license. Without a license I can't get to work, and without work I can't live. Why not get it over with before all that hassle happens?
