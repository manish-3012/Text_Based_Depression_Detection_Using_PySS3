can someone please wish me happy birthday?Iâ€™m having the worst birthday ever.. I've been celebrating it on my own this whole day bc nobodyâ€™s been home and I just feel so fucking alone right now.. lmao I didnâ€™t even get to hear a "happy birthday" today- fuck I feel like crying and doing something really stupid rn.. I mean this definitely isnâ€™t how I hoped my 18th birthday to go but welp here we are I guess.. so can someone please just wish me happy birthday so I feel at least a little bit happy today? it would kinda mean the world..
