I hate talking about this shit but I have no alternatives anymore...Why does almost everyone in my life have these ridiculously high expectations of me, people have had them 
my entire life and every fucking time I always seem to fucking fail. Its to a point where I feel pointless
because I cant even do what people expect from me then how the fuck am I going to be successful in the
rest of my life. I cant handle the pressure people put on me with these fucking expectations. I just want
to curl up in a dark room and just let my life slip away I cant fucking handle it anymore. I never have
nor will I ever succeed in life. Its impossible for me.
