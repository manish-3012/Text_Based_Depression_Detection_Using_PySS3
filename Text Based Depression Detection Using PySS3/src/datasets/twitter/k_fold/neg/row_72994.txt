"You're so young"There isn't a phrase in the English language more infuriating than this. 

In saying "you're so young," your assumption is "it'll get better." You think that by changing the words up, it'll distract from the fact that you're just spouting a tired platitude. A lie. 

It *isn't* getting better, it *hasn't* yet gotten better in any of my 19 years, why \*precisely\* am I supposed to believe you when you say it will? What crystal ball do you have? Can you tell me *when* it'll get better? No? Oh, I'm being unreasonable for asking that, am I? *Am I?* 

Oh! Or maybe, I'm being selfish? By suggesting that my 19 years of constant tragedy and suffering is more than enough time *for me* to want to check out? Please explain why that's the case?

Are there any other platitudes you'd like to scrounge up? Maybe call me selfish for not considering the (non-existent) people who'll be \*so sad\* to see me gone. 

Maybe say that I'll regret it as I'm plummeting to my death? I'm sure! That's how biology works. My body doesn't want to die, but my mind is what has to deal with the torment, and it's more than ready to be done with this bullshit.

What else... oh, right, I'll go to hell? I'd be happy to. I'll probably fare a lot better than most - I've had quite a lot of time to build up some endurance to pain! 

My childhood has been nothing but abuse and trauma from start to finish. I am shackled to the ground by mental health issues that are only worsening with each day. I have no support system - not friends (*what are those?*), not family. I've been through six therapists and am now supposed to be moving to a seventh, I'm taking medication that's done nothing but given me physical side-effects while my mind and soul continue implode. I'm at the point where I will have to drop out of college again to avoid having *another* breakdown resulting in *another* hospitalization. And if I do, my parents will shame me every waking moment of my life until I drag myself back to school, only for the exact same shit to happen *another* time.

So, forgive me for saying, I'm way too old to begin with. This should've been done a long time ago.
