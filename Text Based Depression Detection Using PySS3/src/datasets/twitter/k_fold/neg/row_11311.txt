Is 19 too young too kill yourself?I had chronic depression as a gay man in a homophobic country with homophobic family and friends with whom I cant talk and I never even met a gay guy irl so far. I was always a good student and was always considered attractive even by the popular girls although I was more of a loner and never dated any of them (cuz im gay duh but wanted to make it look like they didnt want to date me). College is stressful cuz I am doing it online and from home and I feel like life will only get worse and worse for me and wasting my youth whike many gay guys in western countries already have boyfriends make me feel like a loser who will never find anyone and want me to kill myself. My father has a gun which I know how to load and use so it wouldnt be hard to do it, but maybe it's too early at 19? Should I wait a bit more in case thinfs change although im doubtful?
