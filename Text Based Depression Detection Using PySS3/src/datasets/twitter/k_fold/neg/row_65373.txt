Is it worth it?Is it really worth the fight of everyday life for the few sporadic moments of joy? The whole world is going to shit, and the current estimation of how long we have before global collapse over global warming is about 7 years or so. I canâ€™t stop asking myself if sticking around is worth the trouble if everything seems to be pointing towards a dystopian future. I try to stay in the present as much as I can but still. Iâ€™m also unemployed atm, and my industry is in shambles. I donâ€™t think I can even have a career in the only thing that I actually enjoy to work in, and to think about working some random job that I donâ€™t despise but donâ€™t love either, fills me with dread, and also, knowing that the human society has made capitalism such an integral part of life makes me sick too. I mean, simply not having a job or not being productive enough is enough for your whole human worth to decrease. You become a lazy ass, or a good for nothing, or a failure. Everything feels slowly more filled with bullshit that nobody cares about but that we canâ€™t escape either. Everywhere I look thereâ€™s dumb shallow airhead influencers, or massive publicity campaigns by corporations trying to sell me shit that I donâ€™t need nor want, and the world slowly feels hotter and hotter every year. I donâ€™t want to die, but thinking about what the future holds for all of us makes me think about suicide for real, because I donâ€™t want to live if it means that I have to suffer. Sure, not everything in life is suffering but lest be real, how much joy do we get if we compare it to the bad stuff? It just feels like the bad outweighs the good, and like you have to traverse through a field of shit to reach a small patch of beautiful flowers, and rinse and repeat...


Iâ€™ll finish this post with something positive.

Iâ€™ll be ok... weâ€™ll all be ok, weâ€™re nearly there, we must keep going, and keep going. Everything will be ok in the end.
