Iâ€™m probably going to lose herThereâ€˜s this girl I love. I love her more than anything else. Weâ€˜ve been talking for the past 6 months now. She told me multiple times she loved me too. I just donâ€˜t know if she really means it. We canâ€˜t see each other everyday since she lives in a completely different city thatâ€˜s about 100 kilometers away from my city, so we only see each other once a month but we text each other everyday.
Recently her behavior really changed. About a month ago she used to reply to my texts in under 5 - 10 minutes. Now she just ignores me for multiple hours even though sheâ€™s online almost every 10 minutes. We barely text since she replies so late I can barely get a conversation going. Of course she could be busy and I totally respect that, I just donâ€™t know why sheâ€™s online then and ignoring me. I know this will probably sound very childish but I just find it weird and Iâ€™m really scared she might have found a better one. She told me multiple times Iâ€™m the best and there isnâ€™t anyone better. Iâ€™m really sorry if I sound narcissistic and selfish, Iâ€™m neither of those. I would give my own life for her. Iâ€˜m just really scared that Iâ€˜m going to lose her. I donâ€™t want to lose her
