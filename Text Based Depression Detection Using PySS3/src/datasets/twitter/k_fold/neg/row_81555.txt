I am now scared.Obvious throwaway, but I needed some place to get this out of my chest.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for fifteen days. I am quite the introvert, my circle of friends is very small and I trust only a couple of them with "extreme" confessions, such as suicidal thoughts. They cannot help, yet they've been helpful in delaying my actions.

I'm three years late with my studies, I can't concentrate on them and, for one reason or another, I cannot properly complete my college tasks. If I will accumulate another year of delay, all the exams I passed may be revoked, and I will be delayed again. I can't bear the thought. I'll need to work in a laboratory to complete my degree, but I am scared of professors that will scan my career and see mediocre marks. There's a lot of "ifs" that makes my heart pound way too hard.

So I thought of suicide.

I thought five minutes that five minutes of pain couldn't be much worse than six months of anxiety and a lifetime of uncertainty. Then I used a scarf to try what hanging was like; I faced pain and I was scared. I tried two more times the same week, but I've always chickened out.

I never spoke with my family of my issues, because I don't trust them. Everyone is very judgemental, especially my mother, so I decided not to share information with them. My cousin, who's a doctor, prescribed me some Valium (Diazepam, I think it's best known like that), and now I have another means of terminating my life. But having the little bottle in my hand, knowing that a single chug could end my life, killing me possibly in my sleeps...it petrifies me. This is what I hoped, what I prayed for, what I wanted...but I can't do that.

I can't bring myself to suicide, although I see it as a way out for me. I am afraid, fear is taking control of my life. I don't know what to do anymore.
