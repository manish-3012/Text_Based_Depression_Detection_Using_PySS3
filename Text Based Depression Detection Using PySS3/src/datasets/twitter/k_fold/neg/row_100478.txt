Relieved?I posted here about a day ago. I had finally found a quick and easy method. (Though I won't state what it is specifically.) I spent a very long time doing research on it too. It just seems so strange that I can walk down to the store and get it at any time. I almost feel relieved? It's non-suspisous in itself and since I have a condition that relates to this thing nobody would suspect anything if I got it or if they found out I had it. I don't know what to do. I just keep staring into nothing. I feel so helpless and yet less than a percent of me says I should wait. I'm fucking shaking right now, knowing this would probably work. I feel relieved and somehow I also wanna throw up. :(
