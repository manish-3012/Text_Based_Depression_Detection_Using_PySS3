i hope the money was worth it. really, I do. and the reputation as well.At this stage i'd be disappointed to learn that it wasn't considering it was so much to clearly ruin your own child's life over. it took 4 years for my parents to actually do shit. 4 fucking years. they knew. those bastards knew about the issues I had.  I'd say how them denying this is dishonest, but they don't have principles in the first place. I legit have no future. i don't understand jack shit in school. but at least these greedy bastards have their money. whether going to be homeless, or somehow ending up rich, I'm not returning to these bastards or giving them a cent. I'm too scared to commit suicide because of hell. best believe if someone disproved religion i'd have killed myself longtime.
