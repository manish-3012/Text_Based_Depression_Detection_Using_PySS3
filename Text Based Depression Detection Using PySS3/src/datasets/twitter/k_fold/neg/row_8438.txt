I wanna kill myself cos my sexual desires are impossible. Why should I live with this?I have been jerking off to things that happened to me in high school for decades. Nothing I try in bed comes close to those experiences, and they involve perving on the hot guys and girls in high school. 

Therefore I should kill myself right? I mean thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™ll be able to replace the things i enjoyed so much in high school snd indulge in thinking about every day. But I cannot recreate them snd will never experience them again. 

Therefore this should be the end for me. Why should I live when thereâ€™s no way I will ever be happy? I mean, you canâ€™t change your sexual feelings.
