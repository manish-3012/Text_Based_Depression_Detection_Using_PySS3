I feel like a nobody. Should I just kill myself?It started in high school when a friend of mine just decided to ignore me for a reason I don't know. I was so stupid for chasing that friend over and over because that person is so important to me. I was also bullied that time for a reason I also don't know. It's like people just enjoy seeing me suffering. And then that gave me trauma after because I felt like no one stays for me. It seems like no one likes me. It has been 5 years already but it still haunts me. And every time I remember that, I just feel sad and I have no one to tell it to. I am afraid that people will judge me. I just wanted to end my life.
