Killing yourself over a girl.I was wondering if any of you other guys have felt like this and what did to get over it. I don't want to kill myself. I wouldn't mind not existing. So yeah, if anyone has any advice to get over heartbreak that would be appreciated. I'm lonely enough as it is, I don't need to be thinking like this.
