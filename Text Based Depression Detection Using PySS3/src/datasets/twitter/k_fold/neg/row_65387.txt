My life is grandI'm a recent graduate out of high school. I have a full time job, and go to a community college full time as well.

Throughout high school, I've had suicidal thoughts. I learned many a knot so I could be sure that I can tie a noose right. I've taken chemistry so I can have easy access to various forms of cyanide.

Ive always had trouble keeping friends. I'll hang out with a group and be an asshole to the person who invited me. Others make an attempt to reach me, but I blow them off because I don't feel like I'm good enough to be around them. I drive the people who could ever help me away.

School is stressful as I can't pass a thing. I'll spend hours on a simple math assignment, only to get a 30%. I'll ask others in the classes how long it took them to do the same assignments. They'll say an hour or two, and they did better than me. I try and fail.

I have no money to get to a doctor. I feel like a selfish prick just postage this message. I'm curretly laying in bed, crying over absolutely nothing. I'm ashamed of myself, and I have nothing left to live for.
