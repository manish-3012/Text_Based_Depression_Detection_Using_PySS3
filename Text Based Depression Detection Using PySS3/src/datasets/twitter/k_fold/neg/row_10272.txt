Can't do this anymore.I've never been super enthusiastic about living, never really saw too much appeal. About a week and a half ago, I ODed on a few various medications. Talked my way out of a stay in the psych facility, because I didn't even know if it was an attempt. I just wanted everything to shut up, and drugs are a pretty efficient way of doing it. But since then, I can't stop thinking that I should have died. I wished I had. I can't do this anymore. I can't.
