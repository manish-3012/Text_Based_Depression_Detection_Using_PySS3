I'm fucking sick of my pain being invalidatedIm absolutely god damn sick of hearing shit about how "dude you're lucky to be single" or "you'll find the right person someday" like fuck you thats not the issue here. I know I will never ever, not in a million years and not after ever be loved. I'm far too depressed to live without love and its driving me more and more insane every single day but I know I'll never be loved and even, hypothetically if I was able to be loved I know I'd be a horrible boyfriend because I fucking hate myself so much and I'm so irreparably fucked up Ive done everything I can to help and improve myself and nothing works because I have no one who can love me and no one who ever will and I'm not willing to waste this fucking live living in pointless pain.   


And before you say it, I dont want to hear how to get a girl or how I need to "love myself first." I've heard it and tried it all that's not the issue here and dont tell me to go get a hooker either I've fucked plenty and it doesnt do shit. Theres nothing that can help me not therapy not meds not psych wards not alternative therapies I've done it fucking all I just need to shoot myself as soon as possible and hopefully that's tomorrow I dont wanna try with pills and go to a hospital yet again
