Convenient opportunityMy step dad gave me a gun to keep in my apartment to protect myself if necessary but I think about about shooting myself with it every time I get upset. I have to keep it unloaded as to just deter myself at all. But then I realize that as a female Iâ€™m not supposed to think about violent ways like that and still canâ€™t do anything right.
