Can't take it anymoreHey I'm 17  I've been depressed for so long.. I have thoughts of killing myself all the time (I have several suicide attempts) I have no job no friends living in the same shitty family household 

Nothing makes me happy I can make music Not happy still and never will be.

I have thoughts about hanging myself on a noose. (so i can die)

I thought about buying a gun (to end my life) but i don't have any money...

i have did several drug overdoses and self-harm

I hate myself so much and I'm just a piece of shit

I don't bring anything to this world and I'm a horrible human being

I'm not motivated to do anything other than Suicide

I'm in constant pain every day of this shitty life.

I have my Suicide planned for 11/13/2020 

Goodbye..
