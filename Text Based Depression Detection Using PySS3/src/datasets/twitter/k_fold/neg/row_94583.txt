Every time I think I'm past this it comes backI'm 24 years old and was suicidal as a late teenager. I've gotten help and overall live a healthy, normal life. However, any time things start to not go well (i.e. someone I love gets mad at me and I'm triggered from past memories) all of the thoughts come back. In the past I've been able to fight the suicidal thoughts through self harm (I don't know why it helped but it satisfied me long enough for things to go back to normal) but in the end the suicidal thoughts come back. They always come back. It doesn't matter how much I fight or how long I can put it off. Eventually it will win and knowing that makes it hard to fight it any more.
