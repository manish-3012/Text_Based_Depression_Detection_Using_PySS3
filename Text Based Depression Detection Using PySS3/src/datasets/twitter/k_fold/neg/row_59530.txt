I wish I had no family member alive.The only reason I can't kill my self is my family. 

We've been through alot of shit...my father was an alcoholic and I made him stop drinking...his weekly madness are gone.

So, after all of this insane years...here am I...

Suicide will bring more pain to my family...my whole family will be devastated.

But how/why should I keep myself alive?

I no longer have friends...I live in a country where I don't speak the same language...miss one of my ex-gf everyday...have HPV (genital warts)...balding...I might have another STD...I have most of the traits of an adult child of alcoholic...and now I'm getting into my second depression. There are many other things but...I can't properly express myself and it's just a bunch of negative and weak things...

It sucks...I wonder if I have to keep myself alive until my parents die so only my brother would suffer...and until there he'll have his family, etc...
