Gender dysphoria.It's like a pain train that never stops coming, only stopping when it needs gas (aka sleep). i just wish i could stop it right now, to stop these bad thoughts, its a constant cycle, wake up, hang out with the family, play some games, sleep. and most of the time during all of that i have suicidal thoughts. I just needed to get my thoughts out, sorry
