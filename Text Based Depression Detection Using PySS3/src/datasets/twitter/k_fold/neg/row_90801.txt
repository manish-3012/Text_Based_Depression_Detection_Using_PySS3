My incentive to live keeps getting worseI just canâ€™t see a real reason to be alive when people around me are constantly excelling in whatever they do and their relationships are great and what not, when I canâ€™t even get a good job and donâ€™t connect with people at all. Iâ€™m just a massive heap of shit that needs to be cleaned up before it causes more of a mess. I can feel the people around me getting more irritated by my presence each day and I feel really bad about it. I just wish I could vanish from their lives so they wouldnâ€™t have to deal with my shit. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore and Iâ€™m angry at myself for being alive this long. Iâ€™ve retyped this like 5 times I just wish I could do something right for once instead of sulking in my room like the useless clump of atoms that I am.
