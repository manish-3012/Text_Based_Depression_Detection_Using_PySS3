I've been trying so hard to fix things, but I think it's over.First off - please don't say the obvious stuff to me.  Being told to 'hang in there' or that I'll be fine is not what I need right now.    


I left an abusive family behind nine months ago.  I've been doing entrepreneurial things while I job hunt, and we've been moving around doing month to month stuff.  I haven't been able to find a job, and the other project hasn't made money yet.  We had some moves that were scams or dangerous in some way, and lost a lot of our money, messing up our budget and my ability to actually make things work.  I've looked into gov help, church help, just got off the phone with a domestic violence shelter followed by a transitional housing shelter.  It seems I always fall right in the crack where I don't qualify.  I'm doing too well or not well enough.  Things are going to fall apart.  I even considered going back to the abuse, but even that isn't an option anymore.    


I just don't understand how when you work this hard, you're willing to work hard, you've never done anything legally wrong in your life, you've never even been dishonest with a person... how do you find yourself in this horrible of a situation where you're deciding if your daughter would be better off living in a car with you or in a foster HOME with someone else.    


I just can't believe I'm here.  I almost killed myself before leaving the abuse behind, but I decided to fight instead.  I just don't understand how I'm back here.
