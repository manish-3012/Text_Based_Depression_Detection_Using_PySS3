waiting to be pushed over the edgei would give anything to not be myself right now. my life is slowly nearing a close and i feel like i'm suffocating, just waiting for something small to finally edge me over so i finally finish it all and kill myself. my family doesn't know i'm trans and they likely never will, i've been self-harming for nine years and been suicidal for longer and i honestly just can't see a fucking point anymore. i'm too weak to just do it, but it feels like it's simmering under my skin. anyone want to run me over because i'd be happy to put my head on the road
