What's the point in life when you've never had anyone to share it with?I'm lonely. I have no friends, no family and no girlfriend. I've never had friends, family or a girlfriend. I've always been alone. All I've ever had is coworkers, fellow students and care givers. I fear that since I missed out on all of that that I will never have anyone in my life. I don't know what the issue is but I seem to lack the social skills to find someone. I keep getting close but it never works out. There is always something that happens and usually it's beyond my comprehension that just causes everything to end abruptly. I hate volunteering, I hate working, I hate waking up everyday. I just want to die now. I don't see things ever being any different. The only people that do show up in my life want something. I don't care about me. All they do is tell me all about themselves and when I reciprocate with about me they tune me out. This is a horrible world. It's never been fun. I've never been happy. Everywhere I've ever went I've been alone doing it. It's always sucked. I don't even want anything other than just someone to share my life with. I can't wake up tomorrow alone again. I don't want to be in this world anymore. 


Please make life stop.
