my brother once told me that when you look at the kids around you in highschool, you can tell which ones will and wont survive, because they'll kill themselvesI always wondered if i was going to be one of them. i never saw what he saw, so naturally why wouldnt it be me?

and then i graduated and started college


and i see people that remind me of me

and i worry that its just like what he said, and that ill snap one day and kill myself, because thats already basically happened to me before
