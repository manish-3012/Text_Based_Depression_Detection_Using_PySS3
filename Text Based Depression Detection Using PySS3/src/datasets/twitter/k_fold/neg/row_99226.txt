I finally have my answer.I know exactly how to kill myself. I finally know how. I won't get through this year. I won't. But I want all of you to know, reading this, that there is still hope for you. That your amazing, that you can fight through whatever your going through, that you need to live an extra day.

Nothings worked. Nothing ever changes and I only become worse. I only become sadder. More numb to the point it feels like I'm drowning in emotions i can't let out. And when I do, in a car full of people and I feel like i'm about to explode I'm suffocating, and my mind becomes bleary. Nothing can save me. We all die. 

But you, reader, can live longer. live instead of survive.
