I'm ending itHello, I think I will end it some time soon.
I am pressured around the house due to family problems.. considering mY dad cheated on mum and even though dad has came upfront to mum about it mum started to make my dad go crazy. Mostly inside our house me and my siblings fight a lot recently i received a punch to the ribs given to me by brother and i have bruises given to me by my younger sibling. I am not doing well at school but I wanted to be better although with the reoccuring issues and problems i became super sad especially now my father is pressuring me to become a soldier even though i don't want it. I do most works at house but i deem to be a daddy's girl whenever i do work at home. I tried telling my problems to my S/O and i know my S/O got his own problems he just srems to get caught with my problem too and then suddenly he gets too sad or angry about my problems which always ends in a fight. I am tired and i would want to end it. I dont know who to tell my problems.. i need rest... but a really long one
