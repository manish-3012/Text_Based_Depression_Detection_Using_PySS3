Goodbye to the most amazing community on earth.This is a final goodbye from me. The people here have gotten me through the worst of nights. And I am honored to have been a part of this community.

I wish you all the best of luck in life and hope you all get better. For me it's unfortunately the end of the line. Things won't get better or change, I've tried getting them to do so for a decade. 

I'm more lonely then ever before, the last few friends have left me and now only my family remains.
Not hurting them kept me going for years, but that isn't living. Being in pain every single day just to save them the pain of losing me. No more, it has to end. My best, and last, friend gave up on me a week ago and I haven't talked to a single person since. 

So goodbye to all you amazing people.
