Took some trazadone with alcoholI've already been in the hospital 3 times, twice these past few months. I can't find a job and I can't make myself do Door Dash. My husband has been supportive but I know I'm holding him back. We're in debt and it's because I couldn't stop spending money. I know I should stay and help him get out of debt but I'm having trouble doing that. 

I've been depressed since I was a child and I'm just tired. Its the same story every time I get depressed. I'm sad and I hate myself, I can't do anything which makes me feel lazy. And I just think everyone would be better off without me. I'm sure you've heard this all before. I can't make any friends and I'm just tired of being alone. 

I got weight loss surgery but I still eat like shit. I've lost weight but I'm still fat. 

I graduated college with a Communications degree and I can't find work. 

I want to go back to grad school but I already dropped out once. 

I can't make friends because I have a boring personality and resting bitch face. 

I want to help people but all the jobs I apply for like non profits I get turned down. Not to mention all of the other jobs I've applied for. 

I know my husband will be sad but I think he'll be ok in the end. He's stronger than me. He even said I need him more than he needs me. 

I'm just tired of being tired?
