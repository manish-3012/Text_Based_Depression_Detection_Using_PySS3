The scary part.As my date draws near, i've thought about some things. Are there things i'll miss here? Yes. Are there things i won't miss? YES. I asked myself , "have you done good in this life ?" I told myself,  "you did good." I'm not afraid of what to expect. I had an experience years ago that me an edge. This won't be "a road less traveled" for me. This time when i leave,  i won't have to worry about coming back. I have an existing medical condition that will insure that. The scary part is the thought of having unfinished business here. I don't want anything to keep me here once i'm free of this body.
