Sadness over realization I don't want to kill my physical bodyI have been depressed, off and on, for a very long time (age of 12 is first memory of active suicidal thoughts).  I'm now 34, and have had a rough year, with many active thoughts of suicide.

Things in my personal life seem to keep getting worse, and it's too much for me sometimes.  I think about killing myself -- either actively making up a plan, or envisioning jumping off a bridge, or passively, thinking how I want to be dead -- pretty much daily. 

But the fact remains -- there is no easy way to physically kill oneself.  Death itself actually terrifies me.

Last night I learned that hanging results in an involuntary voiding of the bladder and bowels, and all of a sudden I realized I don't want to kill myself.  I just don't want to be alive anymore.  My life is full of disappointment, rejection, mistakes, over and over and over and over again.

Lots of emotions since last night, but mostly overwhelming sadness.  Living doesn't seem a good option, but killing myself seems just as bad.
