Sick of the rat raceEverything my parents want me to do is focused on college. Do marching band (even though I don't want to). Every few days I would get called down and guilted about not doing enough to prepare for stupid college. I feel trapped. Everyone says getting all As is so easy but I struggle. I have thought about suicide and have almost attempted. I hate this existance. Asian parents suck.
