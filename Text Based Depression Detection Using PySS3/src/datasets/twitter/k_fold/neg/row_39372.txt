I'm just a stepping stoneI'm someone who loves to help the people I love better their lives. If I have the finances, I help. If I have the time, I help. And it seems that all of my help does one thing: gives people the stepping stone they need to reach their best life. And once they reach it, they dont need me anymore. 

I've helped people get to their best life. But I'm here struggling, going into bankruptcy, barely able to make ends meet and still feed myself. 

People I've helped are getting fucking vacations in Mexico and I'm struggling to get by. 

I'm glad I have a purpose, I guess. But I'm tired of being used and not getting anywhere. I guess I dont have what it takes to be a success even though I can help others get there?

What's the point though? I'm not a fucking doormat. I dont have anyone anymore cuz they're all too busy with their lives. I'm always the first to send a message to anyone nowadays. I hate this life.
