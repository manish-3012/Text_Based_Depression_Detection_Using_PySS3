Iâ€™m the biggest loser I know34 years old, still live with my mother, stupid, no money, worked a dead end job for 15 years, no skills, no qualifications, no attention span, no motivation, severely depressed and tired.

There is no way out of this mess. I have proven that Iâ€™m incapable of having a life worth living. I donâ€™t want to do anything. Crippling depression is real as fuck it seems. If not Iâ€™m a lazy piece of shit that doesnâ€™t deserve to live anyway.

I have also been lying to my girlfriend about my life for the past 2 years. I met her abroad and told her I had a better life. I pretty much lied to her about everything in the first paragraph except my age. We have been together several times since abroad and have been in a long term relationship when apart.

She is suffering badly from us being apart. She has been trying to get a visa to come to me but I canâ€™t make it work. I have been trying to stall things for as long as possible but Iâ€™ve ran out of time. I just do not know what to do. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide before and unfortunately failed, but Iâ€™m getting desperate to escape from this life again.
