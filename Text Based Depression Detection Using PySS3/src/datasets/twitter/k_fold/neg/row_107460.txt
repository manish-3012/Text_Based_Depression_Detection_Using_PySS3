need helpjust sitting down to write this and i cant hold back the tears ... i am in bad shape ... been getting worse for the last month ... i am severely depressed and i can't hold out much longer ... researched how to do it painlessly ... havent bought the tanks yet but have scoped out where i can get them and the store hours ... it is so simple to kill ones self ... living in torture vs quietly slipping away is becoming an easier choice ... went to a counselor for the first time on friday and have an appointment again on monday ... feeling worse by the hour ... it doesnt feel like i can think my way out of this ... feels like im physically and mentally breaking ... i think about talking to someone that i know like my parents or brother but i just cant ... i dont know how to fix this ... 

im not scared to die ... fear has nothing over the pain ...
