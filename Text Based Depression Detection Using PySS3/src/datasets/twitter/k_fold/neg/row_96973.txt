Is my dog upset with me because of what I tried to do?I attempted suicide last night and if it werenâ€™t for my dog I donâ€™t know what wouldâ€™ve happened. She saved my life, I was pretty out of it so I donâ€™t know exactly what happened but I know she was there and that she stayed with me until I woke up and started breathing properly. Soon after she just got up and left. She always sleeps by my side but after what happened she went as far away from me as possible. Even this morning sheâ€™s acting weird. Sheâ€™s normally happy when I wake up cause she knows we have a full day of fun together but today she just doesnâ€™t care. Did I offend her because I wanted to leave? Does she think I donâ€™t love her anymore?
