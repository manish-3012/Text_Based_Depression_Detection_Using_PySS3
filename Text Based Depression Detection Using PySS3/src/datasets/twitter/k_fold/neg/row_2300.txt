I wish I wasnâ€™t LGBT and being black only makes it worse.. ðŸ™ƒðŸ‘ŒðŸ½I just want to feel normal and not have to feel like a damn freak. I donâ€™t have much people in my life and being LGBT and apart of something that you feel youâ€™ve been outcasted from feels much worse. I have met alot of LGBT who have made me feel like crap with their attitudes iâ€™m so used to people being aggressive with me that iâ€™m starting not to care anymore. I tried to talk to someone about this issue whose supposed to be proffessional but they seemed to take it personal so I ended the chat because they were giving me short answers. Like wth man the ignorant are uplifted and the nice people are left lonely and treated poorly idk why this world is so backwards.
