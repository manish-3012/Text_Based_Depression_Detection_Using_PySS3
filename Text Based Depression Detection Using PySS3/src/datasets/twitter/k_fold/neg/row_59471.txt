Any help?Following is the note my parents will find tomorrow after I kill myself tonight. Any suggestions for what to say to make things easier for my parents? Thx this community is amazing... helping me through some hard times but Iâ€™ve had enough. Reddit you all are a light in the darkness I love you reddit. 

Iâ€™m sorry. I love you. It has been to long a run and Iâ€™m too tired to fight the good fight any longer. I love you both and I hope that you both know that you have been the one thing keeping me going throughout the last few years. Please love Ella and give her a big hug every day for me. She truly is the goodest girl. Despite our arguments and misunderstandings I love you both with all my heart and nothing will ever change that. I would like to be cremated and a portion of my ashes placed in Lilly lake, another portion placed in New Zealand up by the Mueller hut ( Maybe this time when you guys combine sleeping bags Dad wonâ€™t fart so much ). Joking joking. Please enjoy the rest of your lives together as I know that I pushed your relationship to the limit daily. Travel the world, Eat good food. Please distribute my belongings as you deem necessary. Please tell Bork, Abby and Miranda and everyone else thank you for me. I love you all so so much. Please the most important thing that I ask of you is that you donâ€™t blame yourselves or anyone else it was no ones fault for my decision. Again please donâ€™t separate yourselves from each other because of me. I love you all so much. It was not your fault. Iâ€™m so sorry. 
Much love,
