Alone everyday with nothing changing, this is a shit life.I honestly don't even know where to begin, I've been dealing with this for a few years now and despite my best efforts, nothing is improving. My depression started in high school and stayed with me while I was in the Army, certain things happened and I voluntarily left with an honorable discharge. I thought I met someone special but it was another person who screwed my ass over and now replaced me with someone better. I have no job and despite going college for Game design, the feeling that I have isn't going away. I can't talk about this with almost anyone (except for one person) because everyone's response is the same stupid thing, "Go see a therapist" I've tried it and I didn't like i, and I don't want to hear it anymore. I want to feel like I have some major reason for living otherwise I'd rather take my life and die alone then be putting on a fake smile everyday to please other people.
