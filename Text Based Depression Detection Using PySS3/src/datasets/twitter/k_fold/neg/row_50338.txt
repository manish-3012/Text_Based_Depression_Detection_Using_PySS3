OutI have been feeling myself veer closer and closer to the edge, sometimes I find myself staring at nothing at all and an hour has passed. My mind is full of memories, and I don't know if every day I have lived has simply been awful, or if I'm unable to remember any good memories. One second I'll suddenly feel disconnected from everything around me: the chair I'm sitting in, the floor beneath my feet, the clothes on my body. "Who am I?" and seconds later I'm crippled by fear and pain and terror. The sexual, verbal, emotional and psychological abuse from my family, as well as the physical abuse from my church family, and the years that pass all invade the tiny spaces I have left. There is only one way out, and it's all I can think about.
