Its really hard to solve your problems.I feel a bit like i'm slowly drowning. Every once and a while i get the energy to stay above the water, but most of the time I am slowly sinking. Suicidal thoughts are so awful, I know I want to die, but weighing that against how your death will effect people. I have what feels like a fake personality. I know it isnt, its the me when I forget about all my pain and problems. What feels like the real me is a pathetic human. It's so easy to cry, and so hard to get out of the pit i'm in. I'm backed into a corner. There's a way but I'm so conflicted about taking it. I saw a post earlier here saying that they are scared that if their suicide attempt fails that they will have to explain themselves. And that really hit the nail on the head. If I fail I don't want to explain everything. I've kept it under wraps for so long. I'm so sick of being stuck.
