I'm probably going to kill myself on what should be my prom nightI had this friend. He was my best friend and I trusted him completely. Turns out he didn't really care about me. I loved him more than anyone else in the world and I was nothing to him. I havnt spoken to him in months but next Tuesday is supposed to be my prom night, my choices are sit at home alone or go alone while all of my friends hang out with their dates and I see the man I love with someone else, I just don't think I'll be able to make it through either. That coupled with the fact that I'm a fat socially awkward loser with no college prospects just makes me think I should kill myself and be done with it
