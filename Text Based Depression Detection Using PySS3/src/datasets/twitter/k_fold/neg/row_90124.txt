Im thinking of ending it all tonightThe only thing that keeps me from killing myself are my parents and my little brother, i have been suicidal for way too long and the one time I tried doing so I ended up in a hospital. I am 22 yo, I am a worthless person with no job, dropped out of uni, I've gained about 60kg these last 2 years and im really scared that my brother will one day realise that I am not his hero that he thinks I am, but I cannot take this anymore,there hasnt been a day for so long that i havent thought about killing myself and right now im so close on doing it, so close that I actually feel better knowing that its all coming to an end.
