I haven't done my homeworkI was given so much work over the half term because we're quite behind at school. I spent quite a lot of time and yet I've only done about half. I could do a bit more tonight, but I just spent the last few hours crying and sleeping, and in the long term I just can't be bothered to spend so much time doing work. I would rather just kill myself and not have to be stressed over being told off about not doing work. 


All the effort i put into things doesn't seem to lead to anything worthwhile. Life doesn't seem to offer me anything worthwhile. I feel like there is nothing to look forward to apart from eating. I really want to be skinny but the only thing that I look forward to is food. It's my only happiness. I just feel like i've spent the last few years telling myself life gets better when that's not true.
