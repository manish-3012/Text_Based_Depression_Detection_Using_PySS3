I don't think I would, but I think about it a lot.I miss my mom, I miss my girlfriend, I miss stability, I miss having a real home and I miss having faith in something. All those things have been plucked from my life one at a time, and I don't think I have it worse than some other people, but I've got it too bad for me to handle. The people I put trust in betray and leave me. I guess I'm just tired of having to rely on myself emotionally. I was in love. Still am. She doesn't feel that way anymore. I guess that's the straw that broke the camel's back. If I'm not thinking about her, I'm thinking about not living anymore, and what a pleasant relief that would be. How can I stop this madness?
