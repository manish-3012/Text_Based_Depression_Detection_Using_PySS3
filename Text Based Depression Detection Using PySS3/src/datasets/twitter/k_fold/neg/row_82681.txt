Am afraidAm growing  tired of enduring the constant pain and stress everyday. Am most always social isolated but I enjoy the company of friends, but they all eventually left. Iâ€™ve grown in the family filled with problem, am just a failure that never meet any expectation. I still try to be good at the things I do, hoping maybe someone would need me recognized. Am in a relationship but itâ€™s so one sided, I try my best just so she would be happy  but am just there for when she needs me and leave alone when she doesnâ€™t, she never fail to remind that we are only two people thus love each other and nothing more. I try to become what people would expect me yet none would ever try to understand. Even she herself doesnâ€™t like the person I am now, emotionally fragile and in constant need of help and reassurance. Still I would always try to become whatever people want just so i could feel needed. I want to die but am afraid to take my own life but Iâ€™ve been trying to put my self at risk and not caring about my own health hoping that I would die that way. Everything hurts, is there anybody out there that would care about me other than the face Iâ€™ve put on for people to see? I been thinking of jumping of a bridge and I think am getting closer to the point of doing so
