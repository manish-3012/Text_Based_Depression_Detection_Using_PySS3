Taking the easy path or ending it?EDIT: Taking the easy path and ending it?*

Dear Reddit,

Tomorrow is the day that I will find out something that could change my life. It is a decision that someone will make for me, then I will decide my next path. If they choose the right decision, I will forever be indebted to them for giving me another chance. If they choose the wrong decision, then I feel like my only path would be to end it. 

Many thoughts have been in my head. How do I want to take my own life? How do I do it to where no one can save me? Should I make it seem like an accident? But the most important question of all is: how much am I willing to give up?

I'd be leaving my family. My sister who loves me unconditionally, who calls me when she has her problems, who makes going home so enjoyable. My brother, who is still young and plays games and doesn't have to deal with the hardships of life yet. My mother, who always annoys me and nags and nags and nags ... but I love her. There's been one memory that pops into my mind and that's when she was in another country, visiting family, and I was 10. She'd call and I'd tell her what I've been doing and then I start crying because I miss her. 

My boyfriend. He has never known my failures. We have been together for a few years now. I've imagined him proposing to me, us getting married, having kids. Everything. I imagined myself spending the rest of my life with him.... but how can he marry someone who he shouldn't trust?

My best friend, who has been honest with me the last decade. I don't think we've ever gotten into a screaming argument or have been mad at each other for more than a day. She doesn't know all of my failures either.

No one does. I want to keep it to myself. I don't want anyone to know how much I've let them down... I feel that they would just leave me if they knew. It needs to be a secret, but is it worth dying for? How much pride do I have that I would take my own life just so no one knows?
