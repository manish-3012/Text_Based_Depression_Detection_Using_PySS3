sorry for posting againthe crisis text line told me i have to call 911 myself if its going to be done ar all. i knew rhat from the start but sitting and processing that i have to do it is so harrd. nobody has ever taken me seriously when i reach out. i dont wwnt to waste their time and i dont want to be a fool, i dont wanna be seen as one. i couldnt do it, its unfortjnate. i can feel lumps in my throat and it feels like my pills have strted kicking in. cannot stop dhivering. its a lonely night. hopefully i stop shivering
