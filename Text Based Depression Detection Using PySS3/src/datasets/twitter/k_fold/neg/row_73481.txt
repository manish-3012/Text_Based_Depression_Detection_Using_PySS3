Useless and burden to others One more day to consider giving up. I have had similar thoughts before, ever since I went to college last year. It was a disaster and now I am on another college.
 To be honest I never had any ambitions or goals in life and 20 years have passed... 2 entire decades and I have done nothing! I hate myself, it is all my fault. I am life unworthy of living. People like me, who are unambitious and don't care about this established society. I feel randomly thrown into existence and be expected to have career planed already in my childhood.
I simply don't want to deal with all of this mess. Call me lazy or NEET, which I am probably. I don't care.
Now I just delve onto 2000s and early 2010s nostalgia trying to escape from all of this.
I think that I actually proved that my suicide is justified, I did nothing in 20 years, already failing new college. My death should save water and food for people who are not slackers like I am.
(sorry for my English and I am on phone so I am very sorry if it comes out unreadable).
