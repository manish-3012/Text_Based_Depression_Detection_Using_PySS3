I'm 15 and I struggle with depressionHi, I'm 15 and I am really sad and depressed...   
Almost every hour of my life is tormented by some random sadness moments and I feel like I'm very unlucky es(everyone is using the phone in class, the teacher called only my parents)... I know that some people are in a worse situation than mine but i still soffer... At school, half of my class hates me for no reason, outside i have only few true friends, even if some people thinks I'm a cool guy, I think I'm ugly couse I can't find a girlfriend and sometimes i can't even look at my reflection in the mirror, I just don't want to live anymore...I fell like almost everything is against me, the things that are happening to me are a lot of little things but one on the other make one big mountain that i need to carry... I don't know how to go further, every day i feel more bad than the past one, sorry for my bad english.
