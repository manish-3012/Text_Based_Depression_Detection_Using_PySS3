I'm on the verge of giving upI've attempted suicide 3 times this past week, two of them involving my mother calling the police and reporting me as a missing person. The last one I overdosed and tried to hang myself in the woods. I'm now in a mental health hospital as an informal patient. 
My boyfriend left me because of this,  he refuses to talk to me although I need to since I can't remember what happened during my last suicide attempt and he knows what happened and I need to know what I did. 
My friends refuse to talk since they're angry that Ive been trying to kill myself. My best friend only messaged me because I owe her a bit of money, she showed no concern for me.
My mum is scared of me but she's the only supportive person. My dad (who was never there for me) suddenly reappears which angers me since I feel it's too late.
Ive managed to gather some things together to kill myself whilst on the ward. 
Ive tried talking to the nurses here and they just say that the feeling wil pass but it won't move and killing myself is what I want to do.
