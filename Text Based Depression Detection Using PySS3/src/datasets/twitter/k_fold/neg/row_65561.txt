If I weren't an only child is have killed myself by nowI've been a cruel person. A dishonest person. A manipulative person. I started my first relationship with an attempted sexual assault (she was fucked up enough to stick around after that). I've probably been a motivating factor for other people's depression, certainly my parents. I should make the world a better place, but I can't get over feeling bad for my parents long enough to drive my car off the road. If they would die, this would be so much more straight forward.
