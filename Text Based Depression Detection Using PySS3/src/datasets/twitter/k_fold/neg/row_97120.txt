I'm glad that all of you exist, at least there are people out there like me.I'm at the end of my rope, I've become too sick to work. Physically I don't qualify for disability because I'm not disabled 12 months out of the year. I used to love my job, but my condition worsened and I just couldn't do it anymore.


Some days I can't even read multiple paragraphs, and my spine renders me unable to work consistently. My family doesn't care, it's mostly their fault that I am this fucked up to begin with. Years of malnutrition and neglect left me with multiple problems that have ruined any chance for a future.


When I did work, my cluster headaches made me unable to function normally, so my coworkers spread rumors that I was slow, or that I'm drug addict. My bad back worsened, and I could no longer walk for more than a mile, so I quit. My job was damaging my already damaged body.

So here I am, unable to work, yet unqualified for any assistance. I was depressed before because of how much harder I had to work just to appear normal, now all that I feel is hopelessness.


I think I'll wait a few more weeks, then I'll probably end my life. Maybe things will get better??


I hope no one ever has to suffer like me.
