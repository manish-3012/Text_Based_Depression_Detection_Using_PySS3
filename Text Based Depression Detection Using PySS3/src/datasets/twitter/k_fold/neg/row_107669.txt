RageI dont know what to do.  I cant even think straight, i dont know what message im trying to convey. So many thoughts and emotions are going through my head right now i feel like i could blow up. I used to be suicidal and really depressed but ive really worked hard to try to better myself and my state of mind but i dont know what im feeling. I want to kill myself but i made a promise to myself after a failed attempt that I wouldnt go out like that or put any family through that. I really dont know what to do. I hate myself so much, and i dont want to kill myself, but i constantly just want to hurt myself. I sometimes hit my head on hard surfaces and cut myself but im so tired. No one sees the battles i fight alone to be a better person, but noone believes im trying. Im just so confused and heartbroken.
