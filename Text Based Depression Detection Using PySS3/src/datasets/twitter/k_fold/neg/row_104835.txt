Worried about ex-girlfriendOkay, so this may be the wrong section, and I doubt anyone can help, but I'm a mess right now and need to at least see if someone can.

My ex girlfriend has been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, I've always made sure to be there for her when I can, and every time she has agreed to keep on fighting if I'm there to help her.

About an hour ago, however, she said that she couldn't take it anymore. She said that she was going to go kill herself, and to say anything I had to say to her now, because she was leaving her phone at home and going. I said to her "You've been here before, you can get through it." but didn't get a reply. After about 10 minutes I tried calling her, but to no answer. I know what she's like, so called her parents and explained the situation. They've spent the past hour or so driving around looking for her, but can't find her anywhere, she has no phone or anything to be contacted through, and has left no clue as to places she might be.

I can't think of anywhere special that we've been together in her area, so that's not help either.

I appreciated that this post is most likely useless, but if anyone has any idea on how we could find her, however small it may be, please say.
