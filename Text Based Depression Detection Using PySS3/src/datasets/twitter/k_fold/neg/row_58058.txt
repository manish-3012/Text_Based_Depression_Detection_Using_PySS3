Battling my own thoughtsFor as long as I can remember Iâ€™ve always had the thoughts of ending it. I have always just pushed them aside, battled through it on my own. Iâ€™ve never really talked to anyone about it, I talked to my partner (now ex) about it a little bit, she always told me that she would be there, we were together for 8 years. Now she says she doesnâ€™t love me, this hurts me a lot, all I want to do is end it, end my life, not because of the break up but because Iâ€™m not sure I can do this anymore, Iâ€™ve been like this a long time. I finally went to my doctor about how Iâ€™ve been feeling, but she wants me to feel the pain of the break up, I told her that Iâ€™ve been this way for a long time for as long as I can remember still nothing. I went to a therapist but I feel like she just thinks itâ€™s because of the break up. I admit the break up has triggered it back, but this time itâ€™s worse. I sit and stare into thin air how Iâ€™m going to do it. I then think who is going to find me, how long will I be dead for before someone finds me, I think about my ex and how much it would hurt her, I donâ€™t want her to feel like itâ€™s her fault I donâ€™t want her to find me. Itâ€™s not her fault, itâ€™s mine I shouldâ€™ve got help a long time ago, itâ€™s to late now.
