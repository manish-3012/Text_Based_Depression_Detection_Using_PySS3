I hope someone will see thisI plan on dying in a few hours, you might find this reason really stupid but here it is, my family is moving from a house that I have lived in since I was 1 and we're moving to a place where I suspect has asbestos and doesn't feel like home at all. I've felt tired and ready to go for the past couple of years, I was ready to go ever since my cats were given away without me knowing. I'm really tired and I'm currently watching my childhood get torn apart as we pack for our move in 2 days. I really want to jump of the balcony or hang myself. I've had a small rule about dying ever since my first attempt, it is where I have to wait until the end of the day. If I'm ready to go I'll overdose on sleeping pills before I go to bed. Today I'm ready. 

I can't watch my childhood and basically entire existence get packed up and moved away. So I really want to die, more than I usually want to. Also I couldn't sleep for the past few days, I stayed up until 7 or 8 in the morning then I fell asleep. I can't sleep because I just want to stay in *my room* in *my bed* for maybe the last time. 

I don't know what to do, it's too late to stop the move and I can't suffer any longer. I've been hurting for a long time already and this just went past the line. I also don't want to fail my overdose because then living is worse than dying and I'll have to deal with my family condemning me for trying to die. Last time I told them I wanted to die they said something along the lines of: 

"We raised you and this what we get."

Basically making me feel more useless than I already am.
