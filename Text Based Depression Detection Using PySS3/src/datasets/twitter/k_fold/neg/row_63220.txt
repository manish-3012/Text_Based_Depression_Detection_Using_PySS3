Iâ€™m 14, I just wrote my suicide note and Iâ€™m going to stab myself to death tonight. Iâ€™m scared, please help me.My parents are mormon, and Iâ€™m tired of being told that Iâ€™m going to hell for being gay, and that everything about me is wrong. Iâ€™m tired of never being happy, actually happy and not jsut me faking it. Iâ€™m tired of hiding my feelings and being scared of mental hospitals. Iâ€™ve already been twice for an attempt and I hated it more than anything. Iâ€™m tired of my parents arguing and fighting, and my dad being an absolute asshole to me. Iâ€™m tired of my sister making fun if me and making me feel like human garbage. I donâ€™t want to die, but I want my pain to end, and death is the only way. I jsut told my crush I liked him, he is bi so I actually had a chance with him. He declined and that was it, Iâ€™m tired of feeling like trash and a uselesss piece of garbage, crying my self to sleep every night. Iâ€™m weak, I canâ€™t even do a push up, not a single push-up, Iâ€™m an embarrassment to me and my family, especially my dad. Iâ€™ve been breathing heavily the last 2 hours and I have a knife to my stomach and I jsut want to push it in so bad but Iâ€™m so scared, please help me. I know no ones going to read this but I want to spill my feelings out before I die.
