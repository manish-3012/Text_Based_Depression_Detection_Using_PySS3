Eh just the usual breakup 17-y/o suicide stuffYeah post says it all. If you want more info, just check my post history. I'm done with this world. The only person that truly cared about me are gone. Fuck Long-Distance that shit's bad. But yeah, I've planned everything and I'm gonna pull the trigger this Monday or Tuesday. I won't talk to you guys who "care" about me, even tho we're just strangers. Goodbye and fuck this world
