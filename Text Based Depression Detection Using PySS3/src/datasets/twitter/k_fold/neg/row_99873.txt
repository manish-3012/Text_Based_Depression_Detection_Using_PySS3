Been feeling terribly lonelyPeople are probably gonna think this sounds stupid but I'm tired of feeling lonely my whole life and I can't take it anymore. I don't think I can even last another 4 months. So that's it I really don't even care about anything anymore and I'm not motivated to do anything because of it.
