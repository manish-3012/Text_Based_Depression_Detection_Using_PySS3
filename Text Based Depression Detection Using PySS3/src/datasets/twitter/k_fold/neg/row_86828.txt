I actually have a countdown running until I â€œcanâ€ kill myselfIâ€™ve tried a few times and, obviously, failed. I promised my son (who is too young to understand the words I said) that I wonâ€™t kill myself until heâ€™s 18. 5,950 days and 14 hours. Iâ€™m in therapy, Iâ€™m trying to get better. But I donâ€™t think I will.
