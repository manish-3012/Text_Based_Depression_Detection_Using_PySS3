I think I need help, I canâ€™t feel anything.This is a throwaway obviously.

For the past 2 years Iâ€™ve noticed that Iâ€™ve completely lost the ability to feel emotions and cry. I only ever feel sadness and all I can think about is wanting to disappear. My life in school has been on a downhill spiral. I used to love school and all this academical I even ended 4th year with Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s but then I began to despise going to school, I dreaded it everyday. I ended that year with nothing but Câ€™s and Dâ€™s. Iâ€™ve struggled to find a part time job. With my parents on my back about it everyday Iâ€™ve just lost all hope in succeeding in life. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore.

It began to enter my life outside school, I rarely ever leave my room or go out with friends. Only last year I joined my best friends band and got a girlfriend but even through that I felt as though I was wearing a mask, hiding what I was really like. I donâ€™t even know if I love her.

I looked up â€œwhy canâ€™t I cryâ€ and found that many of the symptoms Iâ€™ve been feeling are linked to â€œmelancholiaâ€ mainly the inability to cry.

I know this might sound as though Iâ€™m taking the piss but I genuinely do feel this way. I donâ€™t know Iâ€™ve this is the right place to put this so Iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s wrong but I help. 

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess, I donâ€™t really know what to write.
