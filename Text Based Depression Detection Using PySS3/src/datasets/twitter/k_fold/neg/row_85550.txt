Always thinking about suicide but I don't want to die.I'm thinking about it everyday sometimes several times a day, but I am it contemplating to do it. I am just thinking about how it would go about it, what I would leave behind and who it would affect the most. Sometimes it feels like revenge, sometimes it feels like a scream for attention, most of the times because I don't feel like I am ever going to accomplish anything serious in my life. It's quite tiring tbh.
Enough of my venting, thank you for reading this far.
