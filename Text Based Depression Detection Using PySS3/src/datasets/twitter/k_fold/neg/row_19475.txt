Iâ€™m gonna walk to my favourite place and swallow pillsI think today is the day, done is an understatement. I cried for the first time in years today and iâ€™ve finally had enough. Currently waiting for my phone to charge then iâ€™m gonna buy some whiskey and painkillers on the way to my favourite place, Walton Gardens. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen yet but Iâ€™m 99% sure on doing it. I donâ€™t have anyone I want to talk to about this so this feels fitting as I tend to read this sub a lot.
