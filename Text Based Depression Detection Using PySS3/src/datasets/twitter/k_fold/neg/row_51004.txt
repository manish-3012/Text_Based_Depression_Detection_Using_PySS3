I donâ€™t feel anythingI finally ordered it, itâ€™ll arrive by next week. Weirdly enough I donâ€™t really feel anything about it, not excited, not anxious. I wonâ€™t use it yet though, I still need to get some stuff. Itâ€™s not the ideal way, still figuring out if I could get my hands on my preferred one. 

Iâ€™ve never gone this far before, Iâ€™m low key surprised at how calm I feel. But Iâ€™m just taking it one day at a time. I think the anxiety would set it once I start thinking about all the things I have to settle first. 

Iâ€™m just writing here to gather all my thoughts. Iâ€™ve never been one to keep a journal, but putting it all in writing here helps me deal with it.
