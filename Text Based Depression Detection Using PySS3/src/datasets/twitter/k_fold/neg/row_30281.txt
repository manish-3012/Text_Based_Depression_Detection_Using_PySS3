My love tried to kill himselfWe were in a motel because weâ€™re basically homeless. A lot of stress between both of us. The homelessness definitely not being the only stressor. 

After a long night of drinking, I found myself wanting to wander into the bathroom with him. (Weâ€™re VERY comfortable together.) maybe it was a subconscious hunch given our current struggles, or maybe I simply was wondering what he was doing.

I walked into the bathroom with him hanging from the shower curtain tied around his neck. 

Of course I cried and screamed and pulled him down and called the police. 

It was minutes, maybe seconds before he would have died. 

Because of the lack of oxygen to his brain, one of the arteries in his brain could cause major problems with his motor skills. 

Iâ€™m terrified this could have been an act to keep me close because I tried to set myself free from his manipulation by telling him I didnâ€™t want to be around him anymore. 

Someone please help. I love him and donâ€™t want him to hurt himself. But I can no longer help him. I need my own freedom to help myself

TLDR; my ex tried to kill himself. I think it was out of manipulation. I want him safe but I need to care for myself as well
