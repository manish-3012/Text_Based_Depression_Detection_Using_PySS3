Should I tell my family?So I kinda tried to kill myself. Well- I wrapped a noose around my bedpost because my fan was too close to my bed. So I sat in my bedside with the noose around my neck and slowly slid down. When it tightened I felt numb. I wanted to die but I had my doubts. My vision was blurry and the numbing spread further and it was more intense. I felt sick to my stomach and my doubts hit me. I got up weakly and slowly. (Keep in my mind my feat were touching the ground I was just sliding down allowing it to strangle me) So should I tell my family? I'm afraid to. I hate myself and for the most part, always have even when I was a little kid. I'm 13 now and my brothers just make fun of me for being vegetarian and wanting to go vegan. They make fun of my beliefs and my mental illnesses (depression and anxiety). They call me gay, veggie boy, retarded, etc. my dad just tells me to man-up but they know I've always been the sensitive one. So should I tell them that I hung myself? I mostly did it because of who I am but also because of them. Sorry for the long post and thank you if you read it all.
