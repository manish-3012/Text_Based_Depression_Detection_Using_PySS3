This mental illness thing tired.If I don't pick between receding into my *unhealthy* eating habits or cutting myself again any time soon, I'm going to try to kill myself then fail and immediately endure a massive depressive episode for weeks on end again. I hate this cycle but I can't really ask anyone which of my self-harming tendencies are better to fall back with. 

And no. I don't have healthy coping mechanisms, not more than superficial ones anyway. I can only supress/repress my thoughts for so long !!
