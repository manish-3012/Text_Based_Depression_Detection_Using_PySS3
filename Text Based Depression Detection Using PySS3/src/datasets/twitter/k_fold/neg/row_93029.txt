Why notI've been depressed for years.  I was on a family trip when I was about 10 when I realised people don't like you when your depressed so i put on a mask.  People already didn't seem to like me so it was my only hope.  Since then I've managed to accumulate 0 friends.  My parents kicked me out after I finally shared my depression with them.  No one cares.  I've been rejected by every person I've ever asked out.  I'm 24 and things just get worse.  Even when I'm doing financially well it still feels as though happiness is just a myth.  My only distraction from constantly thinking about painting the walls is working.  Everyone talks about the reasons people shouldn't kill themselves is the people they leave behind.  What happens when that person doesn't have anyone?  They wouldn't find my body till someone smelled it.  The friends I manage to make always disappear when I try to tell them about my depression.  It's like a weird magic trick.  I don't see any hope for turning my shit hole of a life around.  Im going to die alone, and unhappy.  Why not just speed this shit up?  I feel so selfish just for wanting someone to talk to.  If I wasn't such a pussy maybe I could finally pull the trigger.
