Think i still love youTried to lie to myself, if you ignore me Iâ€™ll ignore you too. But I canâ€™t stop thinking, thinking about how much I loved being around you... it was only x weeks but I loved it, loved talking to you, joking with you hearing you laugh and smile. Even arguing with you was so exciting...but you didnâ€™t have anyone else around to give you attention you just took advantage of my feelings for you. Me a girl, trying to accept I fell in love with a girl, and this is what happens, itâ€™s no different 

Why canâ€™t you even look at my social media posts? Canâ€™t stop thinking about just ending it, canâ€™t even move to do something else and take my mind off of this, off of you. Youâ€™re not even my type, yet I find you to be perfect, I see past your flaws and Iâ€™m still nothing to you...
******* ******* youâ€™re stuck in my head and youâ€™re killing me
