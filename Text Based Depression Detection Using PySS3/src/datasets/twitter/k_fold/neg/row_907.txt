Drugs and death. The war in my headIts 3 am, im numb. The bottle of vodka hasn't been touched by anyone. Why not take a sip? Time passes and there I am throwing up on the carpet  losing so much bloods from my cuts im going to pass out. I didn't die. Damn. Second attempt didn't work. Am I so worthless and stupid I can't even take my own life properly? Holidays are over, back to school. I blacked out the first day on xanax. Good job arya you're such a funtioning member of society. Fuck this life. Fuck everything. Fuck everyone in the human race. Its only me and the war in my head.
