The only reason why I don't do it is my parentsI'm their only child, they'd be devastated, it's unfair to them.

But I can't say I don't wish that a car would run over me everyday.

I failed med school. Being a doctor was my biggest wish since childhood. Doctor or nothing was what I used to say (and still think). I see no hope for the future, nothing gives me joy anymore. I am dumb, I am worthless, I got dumped by "the love of my life", I am ugly, I am bulimic, depressive, untalented, lunatic, tiring and tired.

No one but my parents really love me. I just wish I could go without them being sad.

What can I do so they won't be that sad? Do you think that if I just jump in front of a car/train and make it look like I fell (for the security cameras) they would get over my death fast?

Please help I really tried my hardest but I really don't want to live anymore.
