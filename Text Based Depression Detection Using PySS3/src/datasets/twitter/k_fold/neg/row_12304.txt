I tried to kill myself last nightI'm a 26-year-old woman and my life has been pretty shit for awhile. I recently got out of a decade long abusive relationship in May and I've just been an emotional mess ever since. And to top it off I fell in love with the one person that helped me get out of that relationship. We had just become friends and I fell pretty hard for them. They have been through a lot in their life too and they let me know that being in a relationship wasnâ€™t what they wanted at this point in their life. I was okay with this and was just happy to talk to them but I started to feel for them more and I didnâ€™t tell them how I felt till recently. I feel like I ruined our friendship and I told them this. They comforted me when they didnâ€™t have to and yesterday they said something to me that hurt my feelings and I exploded on them and just ignored how all of this made them feel. My mind got the better of me and I tried to end my life because it became too overwhelming. I am ashamed of myself and I really just donâ€™t want to live anymore.
