this is such hopless lifewhats the point is of you going out of your way to improve or eat healthy to just sonner or later you'll die and rot underground? what's the point if you put so so much hard work and effort into a life when we all know we are going to die? why cant life be a little eaiser and give mercy to my depressed tried ass? why life is such a disapointment?
when i was a kid i never thought i would end up like this....i never thought how much of a waste of time everything is

i cant help but feel this way...
people always tell me to do better or to work harder when in reality i lost the will to do so...i lost the motivation...lol were these any motivation in me to begin with? no
