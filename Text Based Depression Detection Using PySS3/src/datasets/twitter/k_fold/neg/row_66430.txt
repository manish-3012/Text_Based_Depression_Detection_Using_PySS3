I might not be alive another month, and it scares me.I'm not going to go into it but I've been dealing with way too much bullshit for the last 6 months or so, and it only seems to get worse. The only thing that's kept me from blowing my brains out is the thought that no matter how much shit I go through, I'll be happy later on, and that itself is worth it. I would usually be distracted by my daily life and worry about it later, but recently my life has taken a turn for the worse, as my depression has. I think about killing myself every day, when I wake up, when I'm with family or friends, when I do absolutely anything all I think about anymore is about when I'm going to finally end everything. I go through so much mental pain every day, I'm just so fucking tired of it all. I can just jump off a ledge and boom, no more stressing all the time, no more dealing with people calling me a piece of shit every day, no more sitting in the dark with my thoughts every night due to not being able to sleep for 4 days in a row, I can pull a trigger and done. I don't know what makes life worth it anymore, everything just drags me down more and more. I feel like the end is so near, it scares me. It seems so blissful, just simply not existing anymore. I don't know what comes next, whether there's something waiting on the other side or that's the end of the road, it's better than it is now. I honestly don't know if I'm going to make it another month.
