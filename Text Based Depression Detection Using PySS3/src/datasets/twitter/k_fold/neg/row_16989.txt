Chronic and Sustained Isolation (23M)* Every time I see someone's Messenger texts and how many people they talk to, it hits me
* Every time I hear about someone referencing their friend in another country, it hits me
* Every time I listen to someone complaining about their long distance relationship, it hits me
* Every time someone tells me they "know" someone who's doing something (know someone who got COVID, know someone who volunteers, know someone from high school), it hits me
* Every time I see people out and about enjoying themselves, it hits me
* Every time I hear someone talk about their amazing friends or SO, it hits me
* Every time I hear someone discuss their travel plans, it hits me
* Every time I hear about all the friends someone has made from a certain experience, it hits me
* Every time I hear about someone's plan to visit their best friend in another country, it hits me
* Every time I hear about their friend's supporting them or referring them for a job application, it hits me
* Every time I see someone discussing their shopping list and all the presents they want to buy for their friends, it hits me
* Every time someone talks about how much they miss their friends and wants to hug them, it hits me
* Every time I see two people I know conversing with each other, it proves they'll form bonds that I never will. It hits me.

My isolation has reached it's breaking point. I don't think I can live in a world where I'm so different from every single person around me. So unfit and tossed aside. So resentful. It seems a bit like a war. Like a race. Them vs me.

It's almost always been this way. I've never seen it different.

Just to be clear, I don't think having someone to talk is going to help me, but it's more so dealing with the feeling of how different and unlikable I am. Furthermore, talking to someone who has all the things above really ruins the relationship between us, due to resentment. Anyways, I don't really see a path.

Thanks for any help in advance.
