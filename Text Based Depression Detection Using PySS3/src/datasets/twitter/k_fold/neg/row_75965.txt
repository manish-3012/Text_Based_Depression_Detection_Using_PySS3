don't see a point to life anymore.I feel stuck and don't think there's any way to get out of it except death. I've tried reaching out to people.  I reached out to real life "friends" for two days and none of them would talk to me.  They don't care anymore.  They're sick of my depression.  They're sick of me.
I tried calling my therapist.  No answer.  Left a message.  Despite the content, she didn't call me back.  I waited two hours before I called emergency services where she works, the people who are supposed to talk you down out of these sort of things.  I didn't bother to leave a message when no one answered.
I called a suicide hotline.  I could barely hear her.  She couldn't hear me very well.  I couldn't talk loud because I live with people, and if they know I'm suicidal, I'll get the "you don't have a right to be depressed" speech again.  They already don't think I should see a therapist because I'm "not depressed." I'm "faking."  
My medication has stopped working.  Can't get in touch with my psychiatrist either.  Can't get in touch with any of these people when I need them.
I'm too drained from trying today to take my life, but tomorrow is a new day.
