Relapsed, now I'm anxiousI hadn't SHarmed for a while, not 'properly' for about 4 months. Yesterday I cut my hand once but I didn't feel like it counted, you know? Now one plaster covers what's on my wrist. I hope I don't continue this, especially as its summer.

Now I'm getting anxious -
What if it gets infected?
What if someone sees it? 
Ect ect.

I can wipe it with an antibacterial wipe tomorrow morning, and get a new plaster, and can use concealer to cover it once it's healed a little, but it's WAY too hot to wear long sleeves. I don't want my mum to see the plaster when she comes in my room in the morning, but I can't control how I sleep. Aaaahhh.

I've also been cutting people off lately and it's not good.

I want to stay alive. For the plants I can have in my future home. For the friends I still have the possibility of making. For all the baking and cooking i haven't done yet. But it's hard sometimes. So hard. 

Any info, advice, or comments appreciated. &lt;3
