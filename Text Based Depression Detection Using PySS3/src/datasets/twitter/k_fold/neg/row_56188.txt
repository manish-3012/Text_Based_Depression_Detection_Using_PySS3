I'm ideating a lotDaily.  I've failed in a lot of things in my life and I'm headed further downward it seems.  I'm not exactly depressed, just, sick of things and afraid of the future.

I've watched a lot of friends and family die (like, literally sitting with some of them in a hospital as horrible things like cancer took the life out of their eyes) and it's actually made me less afraid of taking my own life.  I'm mostly just afraid of the pain or fear at the end.

Any way people know how to beat constant ideation?
