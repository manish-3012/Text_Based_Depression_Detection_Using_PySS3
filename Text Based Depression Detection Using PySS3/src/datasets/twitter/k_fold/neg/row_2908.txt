I'm seriously thinking about killing myself.Edit: Thank you everyone. I've decided to keep on, at least for another month and figure out my medications. Hopefully things will work out by then.

Special thanks to MonsieurJambon. He related to me more than I could have imagined. The rest of you helped me a lot too. I want to thank all of you for helping me. This will be the last time I use this account, but I really want to thank you all so much.

Love to you all.
