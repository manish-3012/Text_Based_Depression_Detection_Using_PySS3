Sorry feeling like killing myselfI feel like I am too dispassionate in how I feel this way, like it doesn't even matter and is as simple as making a coffee. I could just shoot myself. I am the only thing stopping me. What does it matter if there are suicide hotlines and 911 if I am already dead? I don't know what I should do other than sleep it off and hope tomorrow is better. I recently ran out of weed which I was using to stop feeling and thinking and now I am feeling and thinking and it is awful and I have a "need" to die, rather than want I really don't want to die, but I feel like I have to. Someone help sort out my thoughts with me, I am confused?
