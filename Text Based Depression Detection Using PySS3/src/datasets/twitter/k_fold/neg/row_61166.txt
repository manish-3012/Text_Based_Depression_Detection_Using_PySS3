Why am I so weak mindedHey reddit....So I'm 20[M] and my life has really hit a standstill and I don't know what to do. I've just been diagnosed bipolar 1 about a month and a half ago. It hasn't even been long but I had to withdraw from college because of the diagnosis and now I sit at home and do NOTHING. All of my friends are in college while I've been wasting away. I have one friend who comes by everyday pretty much but our conversations really consist of nothing sadly. I can't hold a conversation with people at all anymore...I've lost my ability to connect. The only thing I talk about now is how i'm so fucking bored and sad because of it and I have no motivation to change it. My memory is shot along with my attention span. I fell asleep at the movies last night for an excuse to leave bc everything was going over my head. I literally can't function anymore. I tried working but left within 2 hours of the first day bc I was so in my head about the whole situation and not being able to communicate with my coworkers. I used to be outgoing, friendly, social, happy all that shit but its completely gone. I've lost interest in life. Everyday is the exact same thing; I wake up at 7 AM and just ruminate until 9 PM, take my meds, then go to sleep. I'm a fucking waste of life. I feel so mentally weak from this bc I'm even considering suicide, I'm so fucking pathetic.
