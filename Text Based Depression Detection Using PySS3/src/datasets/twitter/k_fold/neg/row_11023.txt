My walk.Eight years ago, I walked two miles to an old abandoned church and cemetery in a cold rain, put two 158 grain hollow-points in my Smith and Wesson 686, spun the cylinder, put the barrel in my mouth, and pulled the trigger ... click. I don't remember walking back, but I guess I did. I have suffered from abuse, depression, and chronic pain all my life and had given up. After hospitalization, lots of therapy and better meds, I am doing better now but it's still a struggle. I have the best support system, wife, son, daughter-in-law, and dog in the world, or I would be right back there in that graveyard again. I hope guys can find the right formula that keeps you out of that graveyard too.
