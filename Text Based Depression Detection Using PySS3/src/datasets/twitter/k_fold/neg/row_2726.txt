Is it reasonable to kill oneself over this?Hypothetically speaking: If person A is a closeted homosexual and transgender, and they live in planet M.
Planet M is a place where one isn't allowed to travel outside of it, and they would get ostracized and executed if they did exhibit any form of behavior/belief that might indicate they are transgender/homosexual.

So person A would have no choice but to spend a lifelong amount of time pretending to be something they are not, be on high alert every time they are around people and bottling up oneâ€™s own actual personality ,thoughts and feelings for the fear of being found out, sprinkled with loneliness, depression, and suicidal identity.

Can you be objective and put urself in this personâ€™s shoes, whatâ€™s your opinion on this situation, is this person being dramatic or is it really painful to live like this? and why must this person choose constant extreme daily tourture over suicide?
