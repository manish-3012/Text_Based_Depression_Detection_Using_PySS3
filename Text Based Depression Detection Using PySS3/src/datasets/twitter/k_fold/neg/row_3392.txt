Why do you hate me?My life has been nothing. Just going through it. I feel like everyone hates me, im a bother to everyone just by being alive. I want to die but its hard to kill myself. I dont know what im doing here. I hate myself, who I am. Im a good liar and I fake things about myself to others to make it seem like im better than what I am. I thought i found someone who loved me for who i was but love doesnt exist. Why cant I just be dead.
