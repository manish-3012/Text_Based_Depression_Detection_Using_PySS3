This is my second post here, but I am starting to not careMy situation has only gotten worse and I feel like I have, for sure, lost at least 1 of my really close friends, and the other one is ignoring me. I don't know anymore and I've already seen all the types of responses on this subreddit. I managed to take a great opportunity (my life circumstances are mostly positive, family intact, money is fine for now) and just managed to be a disappointing child for my parents. I failed 3 classes too and my GPA has plummeted. I don't know anymore.
