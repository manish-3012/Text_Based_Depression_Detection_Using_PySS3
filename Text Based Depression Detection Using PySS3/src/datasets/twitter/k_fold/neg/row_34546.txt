I have no one.My life used to be really good, i was social, loved by a lot, did well in school and had a nice job, have been depressed before but i got a lot better.

Since 2020 began everything started to fall. I lost my relationship, my job, i skipped school, no contact with my parents, stopped working out, i lost all my friends and since corona i have been sitting inside for 2 months, everyday, with no social contact at all.

I have my therapist and been in therapy for years but nothing seems to help anymore.

I don't eat, shower, or do anything anymore. 

I don't want to die but what's the point in living if you have absolutely nothing to wake up or even live for?

I haven't been thinking about suicide for years but it feels like the only way out.
