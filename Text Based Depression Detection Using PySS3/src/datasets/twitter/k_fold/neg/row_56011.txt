Doing the deed in your headI have spent a major part of time during my undergraduate studies imagining suicide everyday. It happened especially after having a to do public speaking or when an introduction in public goes awry after I cannot even speak out my name because of stutter. I always imagine what will happen to my body, how my parents will react, how they will cry and how my friends / people I know will react to this situation. Does anyone else have such similar experiences? I still imagine all those scenarios every morning when I wake up.
