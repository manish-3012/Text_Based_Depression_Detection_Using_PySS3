Whenever something bad happens, I comfort myself by reminding me that I will kill myself eventually, so feeling bad doesnt even matterIt's a backwards kind of thinking. But for some reason it makes me feel better.

Something bad happens that I  have no control over? I've already decided that my life will end so why fucking care about it 

Something horrifyingly embarrasing happens? Whatever, gonna die, so I'm not gonna care. 

It's like the thought of eventually being able to control something for myself makes me feel at peace.

I dont know when or how but it somehow comforts me.
