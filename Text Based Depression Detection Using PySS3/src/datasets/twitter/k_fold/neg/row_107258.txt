M, 18, self-hatred, just don't want to live*(English is not my first language, so sorry if you have trouble reading what i wrote).*

_______________________________________

Ever since i was a young boy i was always socially awkward to an extent, i always had some friends, but i would still feel lonely because i didnt seek that kind of deep contact that you can get with a close friend.

Ever since i can remember, my parents never loved eachother either, infact they hated eachother, so i was always stuck in the middle of their battles, forced to choose sides.

_______________________________________

**When i was 12-13 years old**, the problems between my parents really got to me, i stopped going to school, took my built up anger out on my closest friends and my father also gained child custody through the court.
This, together with me not going to school, broke my mother at that time.
Through my parents struggles i always preffered to live with my mother, so my mother and i struggled for about 1Â½ years.

_______________________________________

**When i was 14**, my father took action and put me in a foster family, i got very angry at my father and chose to didn't speak to him at all. The foster family got me into school, but the problems from my parents relationship still followed me, i was a loner, i tried to isolate myself and i hated myself.

_______________________________________

**Fast forward two years - 16 years old.**
I was finally kind of comfortable living with my foster family, but i still had alot of hate towards my father and i also still hated myself.
Then my father died, this really broke me, and i'm still broken after it.

* I feel horrible for hating him, even though i knew he wanted me the best.

* I feel horrible for not taking the time to speak to him properly, instead of running from him.

* I feel horrible for not having him around anymore, i feel so much more lonely.

_______________________________________

**Then the next year came around - 17 years old (summertime)**
I was almost 18, ready to move back to my mother, i was looking forward to this, since i missed her and really believed that my life was turning around for the better.
Then my father's mother died (my grandmother), it already broke me that my grandmother had to witness my father's death, and then she also left me.
This was one of the few figures that had been there for my whole life, she took care of me when my parents couldn't, she teached me how to walk, and she helped me bond with my father's side of the family (atleast what i consider bonding).
Again, my grandmothers death broke me even more.
It threw me back into the realization that i feel lonely, and now i felt much much more lonely.

**Then my 18th birthday came around (last autumn)**, i was finally ready to move back with my mother, and i really believed that i could escape all my problems.
At first, i was very happy being home with my mother, we had issues, but they weren't the same kind of issues that we had when my father was still alive.
Then realization struck me again, i feel lonely, and i HATE MYSELF.

* I hate myself for not speaking to my father and ignoring him all those years.

* I hate myself for dropping out of school and getting dragged away to that foster family, when i could've been stronger and stayed in school and stayed at home.

* I hate myself for being weak and losing contact with all my affiliates i had back then.

* I hate myself for being 5"3 tall (160cm).

* I hate myself for my social skills, all my friends are getting into relationships, and i just don't have the courage or social skills to get into one myself.

* I hate myself for not being able to end it all, my mother loves me and it would break me knowing that she had to witness my death.

It's like all the hate i had for my father, stacked on top of the hate i already had towards myself.

I still fantazise about death though, every time i see a truck passing by, i hope it will slide off the track and ram into me.
Or every time i hear about terror attacks, i just wished that i was one of the casualties.

**Getting help:**
Believe me i've tried getting help, ever since my mother knew i was troubled, she brought me to a psychologist, this didn't help me at all, it was like all she did was guide my mother on how to help me, which didn't work at all of course.

My foster mother also tried to get me some help with a psychologist when i was around 15-16. I opened my heart wide open, told her all of my darkest thoughts and troubles, and it was like she didn't take me serious.

The only real help i've been getting is reading your threads and talking to some online friends that i have, whom are also troubled.

And i thank you for that, i also thank you for reading this, and i also thank you for every day you are staying alive. Keep trying to stay strong.
