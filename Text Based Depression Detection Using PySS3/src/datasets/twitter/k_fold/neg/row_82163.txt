I don't want to kill myself, but I've reached a dead end.I'm almost 30 and I've failed to make any progress in my life for more than three years now. I'm stuck in a job that bores me to tears (it's not even a dead end job - everyone else is moving on) and stuck in a home with a mother that abused me as a child and still controls me. No amount of new (and quickly abandoned) hobbies will replace the personality I lost over the years. 

I'm stuck because of my own laziness and stupidity, and I've wasted every good opportunity I've had. I changed GP and I was going to make one last effort to ask for help, but I can't even be bothered to do that now. I'd love for someone to just reach into my brain and replace the faulty part, but it'll obviously never happen.

I know if I kill myself that I'll leave people behind who have to deal with it. I don't want to put that on them, but I don't want to keep living the same five days a week for the rest of my life. I honestly feel like I've come as far in life as I ever will.

As for this post, I guess it's some childish attempt to find someone who can replace the faulty part. I'll settle for someone who'll agree with me and give me the final push that I need to shut up whining for good.
