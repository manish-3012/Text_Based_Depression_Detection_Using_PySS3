I don't really wannt to dieBut it's definitely seems like it'a my only option left. My life has fallen apart, I'm a burden to everyone I've ever meet. My family has started to hate me lately and it's understandable, I only hurt people, even if I don't want to. I don't really have any friends and with the few online ones, we started to grow apart. 
I feel lonely every single day, especially in school. I don't know why but I'm somehow unable to talk to anyone! For the past years, I only have trouble with my school, the teachers hate me (and once again that's understandable, I hate myself) I already have over 40 skipped days, now I'm in pretty deep legal problems and my family is already pretty poor. I just can't help myself,  I feel like I don't have control over myself, especially in the morning. I don't have any motivation to do or change anything,  I kinda already accepted that I've lost. 
I also don't experience any joy lately, all my life feels like suffering for nothing. My life is going nowhere and it can only get worse from here. I suck at everything, 
I just don't know anything anymore.
