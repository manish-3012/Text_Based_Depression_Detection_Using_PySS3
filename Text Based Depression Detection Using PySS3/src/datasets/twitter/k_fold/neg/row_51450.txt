I've had enough of it allI'm a 21 year old guy who is a kissless virgin. I'm good looking, tall, and very well endowed. However, I've suffered from crippling 'social anxiety' which makes me unable to do anything. I hate what my brain is doing to me and I cannot find a way through it. Turning 21 has made me feel like a true failure, that I'm wasting my prime. Girls even show interest in me and I've been on dates, but I've never been able to form a relationship as the anxiety takes over and the words I say are that off a lost kid and nothing happens. 

I hate my life and I hate wasting all my opportunities, not just with girls but with professional things too, I'm very skilled at what I do but cannot get employed because once they talk to me it fucking ends right there. I find myself spending nights awake thinking of ways to kill myself, travelling routes in the night and finding locations, but then backing off at the last minute. The next day I sometimes feel regret and that I was stupid for thinking like this, but then the a few days later I find myself going to the location on a night bus service at 3am. 

I hate being a virgin, I feel so lonely, and I don't want to get a prostitute because it's like a cheat code. I want to do things that other young people do but I fucking can't no matter how many times I try. I get deeply hurt seeing couples of young kids walking around happy with each other, even animals like cats and birds I've seen together makes me angry and feel so pathetic and like a waste of everything I have. I cannot take it anymore.
