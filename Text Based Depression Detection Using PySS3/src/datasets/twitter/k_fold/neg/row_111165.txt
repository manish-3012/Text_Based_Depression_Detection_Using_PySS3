I donâ€™t want to dieI love life. Waking up refreshed, doing something selfless and nice, being appreciated and feeling good about yourself. I want to live but the painâ€™s too much sometimes. Iâ€™m trash and I donâ€™t deserve life. 

One day I could love someone. Maybe a girl or another guy. Maybe theyâ€™re people or intelligent robots, idk. I just have so much love to give but I donâ€™t know how to give it and who to give it to. I want people to feel good but itâ€™s hard for me to show affection. 

It hurts knowing people love you only because theyâ€™re blind or feel morally obligated to. I want to earn love. Thatâ€™s all I want :/

Everyone who reads through the posts here and tries to help others, I love yâ€™all. I really do, but I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™m staying on this Earth for. This probably wonâ€™t be my last post but I just wanted to ramble some nonsense before I cry myself to sleep. 

I hope you all find happiness. Peace âœŒï¸
