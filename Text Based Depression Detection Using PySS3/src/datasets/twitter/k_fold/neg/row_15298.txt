I'm literally shaking right now. No money. Unemployed. And no friends or family to ask for money from.The worst part is this is largely my fault. When I lost my job last month I had money in my bank account but I spent it really irresponsibly. I just wasn't keeping track of my finances and now I literally don't even know how I'm gonna eat *tomorrow* let alone beyond that. Now I have nothing and have no luck finding even shitty work. I have no idea what to do, no way to afford food or fuel or anything.

No one in my family who is still alive cares about me. The only valuable item (sort of) I have is my car but I don't think I could sell it for much and even if I did I'd be kind of fucked without it. I just don't know what else to do. 

Been thinking about killing myself for a while but this is probably gonna finally do it for me.
