Hello?F(17)I cried infront of my friends and mom today. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I just email my school and tell them I'm suicidal and watch what happens next? Or should I just wait til I'm 18(next year) to get therapy. I'm at my breaking point, not now but my breaking point to actually fucking kill myself or run away TO kill myself or willingly get kidnapped and murdered, whatever type of death. I'm so close to just break and go die. This sounds literally so fucking ass I know, but. I feel so bad my mom has to deal with me. She doesn't care about my mental health, all she wants me to do is clean and shit and I don't do it (sometimes I do) , most bc I'm constantly dragging myself to even do thingsm I'm failing my classes, I'm pushing my friends away.

 lately I've felt so generous to give my friends home-made meals for them because they DESERVE meals and love. I just feel like giving everything I have, my love, my care, my food, my stuff, my joy. I feel like if I give everything away and watch and attend my friends birthdays before this year ends. I can finally kill myself and let everything go. I'll miss my mom, I'll miss my mom so much I just want to spend time with my mom before I go, my friends my cousin I want to spend my time with them before I can kill myself at the end of this year or soon. Maybe I won't but I have a feeling I will. I might fuck around maybe. 

Shahs it's funny I'm feeling like shit and I'm coming here on reddit to complain like I always do about this. I'm sorry to who has to read this and feel like they need to reply. There's no need to.i just. I needed to rant. But should I still email my school about some of this ? Like that Im suicidal and depressed? I'm pretty sure they'll send me to the hospital or something and send me into a panic attack but like. What else do I even have ?
