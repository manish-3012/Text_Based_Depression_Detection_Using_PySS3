Admitting I need help - a blog post about admitting to myself that I couldn't do this on my own, and learning that it's okay to ask for help.Hi all, I hope this is okay to share, I just thought maybe it could be beneficial to some. I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 11 years old - I'm 24 now. I've self harmed for more than half of my life, my parents were emotionally abusive and I was raped on two separate occasions. Once I moved out of home and in with my boyfriend (now husband) I was able to start healing, I thought I was doing better even though I still had low self esteem and self worth. But then in October last year my toxic brother in law came to live with us and triggered all of my old feelings. It was hell. For the first time in five years, I was self harming and having suicidal thoughts again. I was reminded how messed up and broken I am, something I'd previously been able to push to the back of my mind. It took me months to work up the courage to admit to myself that I need help, and seeking it and sticking to it has been one of the hardest things I've done. I wanted to share my experience with people in case anyone is in the position that I was in.

I know therapy isn't for everyone, and it's definitely not a magical cure all, I still find myself having suicidal thoughts a lot, but going to therapy has helped me start to be able to manage them, and I'm a huge advocate of trying therapy now. I've learned that it's okay to try, it doesn't make you weak if you can't do this on your own. It makes you human. I hope this can help someone.
