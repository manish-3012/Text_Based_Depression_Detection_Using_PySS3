whatâ€™s the point of living lulwhatâ€™s the point of living if thereâ€™s always someone better than you

whatâ€™s the point of living if youâ€™re just a number in this world

whatâ€™s the point of living if youâ€™re just known as â€œthat girlâ€ to some people

whatâ€™s the point of living if people pass by you without a second thought

nobody cares and there will always be someone to outshine you in every way. living is pointless and worthlessness is all i feel
