Mercy KillingI was driving home from school today when a few houses down I saw a bird on the steer. I stopped short in front of the bird, but it didn't fly away. Then I revved the engine a little to get it to go away. That's when I realized that it wanted to get hit. It wasn't going to fly away, it wasn't walking. So I did it. I would want someone to do it for me. So I shifted back into drive and pressed down the gas. There wasn't a single chirp. Lucky little guy.
