I want to,,, but I canâ€™t..â€ªIt would be so easy to kill myself. I could do it right now. Itâ€™s so easy. Itâ€™s right there I could do it right now. So why canâ€™t I? If my mom wasnâ€™t on hospice and my dad wasnâ€™t unraveling at the seams would that make it easier? Or am I too riddled with guilt? For feeling selfish? Guilty that I want to run away from everything? Am I scared? Scared I wonâ€™t see him when I die? If I willfully kill myself would I be sent somewhere else? Why canâ€™t I do it? Why canâ€™t I kill my self if itâ€™s so easy and I want to so bad?? I wish I didnâ€™t care. I wish I had the guts to. I wish I was so low I didnâ€™t care and just did it.â€¬ I deserved to be the one to have died months ago I believe that. I want to right my wrongs. Pay for my fuck up with my life.
