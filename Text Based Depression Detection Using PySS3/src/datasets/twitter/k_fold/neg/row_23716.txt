lonely is the new life addictionI feel like Iâ€™m hooked on being lonely, because I canâ€™t seem to stop being lonely. I have loving parents and a great job opportunity in the future but Iâ€™m still lonely AF. Maybe because I have no friends maybe because Iâ€™m 17 and still a virgin, or maybe because Iâ€™m 5 foot 3. I have never had a relationship with any girl or probably because I play Xbox and watch Netflix all day and Iâ€™m the biggest lazy cunt on planet earth. all I know is Iâ€™m addicted to being lonely. Ps if your going to reply please donâ€™t say maybe your gay and like men, trust me Iâ€™m straight and thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m into
