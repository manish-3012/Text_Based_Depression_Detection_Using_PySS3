I don't really know how to properly articulate this.Not a day goes by that I don't give legitimate thought to ending my life. I'm constantly overwhelmed with the idea that all of this is meaningless and there is no point to continue on. My death wouldn't mean anything anyways. It would carry no significance in the world. Sure my family and close friends would be saddened but they would adapt and carry on.

There are so many problems in the world today. So much pain and strife all over the planet. It all just feels so hopeless and the more I realize how much darkness there is the more I want to just end this for myself.

I've been struggling with depression for the last six years of my life and every time I think I'm getting better it comes back twice as bad as it was before. Honestly, if I wasn't so terrified of dying I probably wouldn't be here right now. But I don't know if that defense will hold strong forever. 

I can say with certainty that I won't be ending my life today or anytime in the near future, but my mind is just in a really dark place right now. I've struggled with self harm and I have had intense cravings to cut recently. I've been clean since March 21st but it's getting really difficult not to give in. I'm almost sure I will have new scars on my arm sometime soon.

I don't know what I'm saying really. I don't know why I'm posting this or what I hope to gain from posting this. I guess I needed to get some thoughts out of my head and I don't feel comfortable sharing them with anyone I know. 

I just feel so lost.
