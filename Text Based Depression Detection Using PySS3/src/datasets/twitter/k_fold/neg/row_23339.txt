Having the hardest time of my life.I am 25, I returned a year ago tothe UK after leaving to follow my dream of living in America, I tell everyone that it was because of coronavirus but it was because I was broke, sick and sleeping on the floor. Ever since I got back I feel like not one person in my life respects me even slightly. I started drinking almost daily about this time last year because itâ€™s the main thing that shuts up my newly (at the time) diagnosed tinnitus and have yet to go more than a week without getting drunk. My friends act like im a basket case or somehow embarrassing to them. My parents tell me that theyâ€™re happy to have me home but they do a worse job of hiding their disappointment than they think. I have 15 cousins and almost all of them are much more successful than me, at my age or younger. I have no job, no qualifications, my friends hate hearing from me and my girlfriend wants to get married and have kids way way before Iâ€™m ready. I try hard to enjoy small things in life and make steps to improve my circumstances and outlook but recently I think the only thing stopping me is lack of access to easy methods. I have no sense that my life will ever amount to anything and I donâ€™t have any motivation to get back on my feet. I have nothing that makes me feel like it wouldnâ€™t be so much better to just give up and stop experiencing all of this garbage. Happy Halloween.
