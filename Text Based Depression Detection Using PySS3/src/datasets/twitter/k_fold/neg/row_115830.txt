Just don't care anymore....Best way to describe it. Am 25 and have had clinical since I was 13. No friends, no job, no self-esteem, no gf, no life. I have gotten used to living  with constant clinical depression and anxiety, but after 12 years of it I really just don't care anymore. I don't want to exist anymore, every night I pray I die in my sleep or have some freak accident that kills me. Tried therapy, tried medication, tried CBT and nothing seems to take away any of the pain I constantly feel. I just wish I had the courage to step in front of the train that goes by my house, but I'm too scared. I've tried killing myself by od'ing on opiates, but never works as I always wake up. I will never find happiness or the feeling of content. I cannot connect with people and live in complete isolation. i just want this all to end...
