I'm probably not going to do it, but i feel closer to wanting to every day.The thing is, things get better, only to turn around and get worse. I'm trying to be strong for the sake of the people around me, but i can't be strong. I can't live up to what people want me to. I need friends to hang out with but everyone blows me off and fucks me over. Sometimes it feels like people do it on purpose and i hate it. I hate myself. I hate my family because they're so similar to me. I just want to be normal and well liked. Another thing is that girls never start conversations with me and i'm too much of a pussy to start conversations with them (if i don't know them already) and i really want some sort of companionship. sorry for the wall of text. I just need to get this out.
