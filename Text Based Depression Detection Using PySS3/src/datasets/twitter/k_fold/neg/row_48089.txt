Iâ€™m one impulsive decision away from killing myselfI fucking canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m a terrible person. I tried to tell my mom I have misophonia and she made it all about her and it made me realize that I am literally the problem. I am the problem in everyoneâ€™s life. Why canâ€™t I be normal? Why do I have all these mental illnesses?

I wish I was dead. I hate myself. Everyone hates me. I bet everyone wishes I was dead. Iâ€™m the problem. I have always been.
