Took xanax and alcoholI donâ€™t know if this is the right place to ask but Iâ€™ve called my psychiatristâ€™s office crisis line but rhey were closed. I feel very stupid and embarrassed about this but today I got both fired from my job and told I have a (probably) permanent and rather severe hearing condition. I took about 2mg of xanax (alprozalam) and washed it down with half a bottle of wine about one and a half hours ago. I currently feel horrible (big surprise hah), big headaches and rather nauseous. I know my best option is to calll a doctor but I cannot afford to worry my parents or mess up my medical record even more. I am 5â€™6 and weigh about 64 kg

If this is the wrong sub to ask this to it would really help me if someone could refer me to a better place to ask. Thank you so much in advance.
