Jobless, college drop outyes, i am 25 and college drop out, i dont have anykind of skill, plus I live in ex-ussr shithole, i am sure its worse than rwanda and kenya even bangladesh here. Practised myself stoicism and hinduism but for now my life has no light. I am useless my mother is 57 and she is feeding me, she broked her back 2 times in that work still working with broken back. And I have absolutely no plans nor talents on how to earn myself. I am almost bald because of the stress(look like trump now) and my penis sometimes didnt work with girls.  thats all what I wanted to say.  yes, i have interests like electronics and repairing them but have zero experience, never worked in my life not counting student part time works.
Any folks who self taught themselves repairing pcs and other electronic stuff?
