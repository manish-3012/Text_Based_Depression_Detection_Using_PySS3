I just want my life backI feel like so many things have been stolen from me. I've been abused for years and I have no idea how I'd ever break myself of having awful people in my life. I feel like I did something to deserve the way I'm treated, but it makes me want to die.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to be able to read again,play around with makeup, go hiking, write, play music, draw, paint, and trust. I have no energy to do the things I enjoyed, and when I do try, I break down because I can't stop thinking about all the horrible things that have happened recently, and forever ago. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't remember the last time I felt truly happy or secure. And even when I did, I was being betrayed behind my back, like an idiot. I can't trust anyone, I don't have anyone. I was promised the world and left with nothing but a broken soul. I gave everything up believing that I was making an investment, and I've lost everything.

&amp;nbsp;

I've had an attempt a few times a month up until lately, now it's more like at least once a week. I wondered why I couldn't do it. I feel like I get so close, but I can't shake that instinct to live. I realized that it's because I don't want to die, I just want my life back. 
&amp;nbsp;

I guess deep down, I don't want to die, I just know that I can never be the same, so I know I have to go. I've been through too much and I'm not strong enough to keep going and continue being hurt by everyone I love. Every time I try to get back up and brush myself off, someone hurts me. Every single time, without failure. I'm hurt, then told to go to therapy and promised a better life. I go to therapy, and then when I'm doing better, someone strikes again.

&amp;nbsp;


Yet, I'm so lonely. It's easier to be around people who you know you can't trust, than to find new people and wonder when they'll hurt you. I wish that I could have someone who I could trust completely, someone who would treat me kindly and with respect, someone who would just smile at me and hold me, but I know I can't have that. Especially not now. I'm just a broken person. This "life" experiment was a failure, I feel like it's reasonable to call it quits at this rate.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know when I will do it, but I'm determind.
