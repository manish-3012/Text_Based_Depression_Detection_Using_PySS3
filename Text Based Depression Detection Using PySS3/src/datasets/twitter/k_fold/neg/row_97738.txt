Someone suggested I post here to show what suicide does to the survivors.I don't know if this is allowed, I just became aware of this subreddit.

My best friend took his life last week and I've finally come to a point where I think I can share this here. His death has left me completely confused, angry and hurt. 

I posted  [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1232ii/my_best_friend_is_gone/) on /r/relationships asking for advice on how to cope with my friend's unexpected suicide.

I will never understand what he was going through and why he made the choice to take himself away. I hope that maybe this will give you some insight on how your decision could leave your family members and friends feeling. It's extremely painful and I wouldn't wish what I'm going through on my worst enemy. 

Every day I wake up and cry and beat myself up over what I could've/should've done to help him. I am coming to terms with the fact that there was nothing I could've done. Maybe there is something I can do now to help people facing the pain that my friend felt.
