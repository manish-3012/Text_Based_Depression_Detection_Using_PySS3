I have severe PTSD and won't admit i'm struggling to hold it altogether.I nearly lost my life now 3 times.  The people i thought i could trust wound up leaving.  I can't speak to my family back home because they very much don't understand what it feels like laying in a pool of your own blood thinking, "this is it." 

I'm still here!  Why the fuck am i still here???  What am i fighting for?  What is this life if something keeps trying to pull me away from it?  Am i supposed to be dead?  It's 3am and i can't fucking sleep!  I'm so damn tired but my body is totally wired.  

I don't have anyone who comes close to understanding.  I lost my bestest friend in the whole world last year and im starting to believe it was all my fault.  

I don't know what to do.  I've road tripped.  Hugged my kids a little tighter.  Tried to find something im my husband to hold onto.  Entered a writing competition.  Driven oodles of miles... 

I just want this to be over... i want the happiness to start.  People say, "it's your choice to be happy."  BUT I'M TRYING EVERYTHING.  

In the dark, i'm allowed to cry because no one will see me... but i just feel so damn alone...
