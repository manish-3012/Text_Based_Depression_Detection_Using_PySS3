When the quarantine is over.....I'll go to the bridge in my university town and jump

My crush of 8 years broken my heart into a million pieces  , and it hasn't healed. It never will 

She won't even be my friend.

And now I've fallen for a girl who sells nudes online

I've got stomach issues that I can't fix because Covid 19 seems to be the only thing that matters.


My life is a joke, I am the biggest looser who ever lived
