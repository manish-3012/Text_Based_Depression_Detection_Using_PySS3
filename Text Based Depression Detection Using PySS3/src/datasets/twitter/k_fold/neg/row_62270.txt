Do not want help, just a chance to unburden.I read a lot of the posts here, and it makes me hurt so bad. So many voices speaking what my heart tells me every day. I want to say the words of comfort, but I do not want to say what I do not believe, and I believe sometimes you simply need to stop being. It pisses me off that suicide is seen as a selfish act- is it not fucking selfish to FORCE someone to exist because YOU want them to?  "Fuck what the sufferer is going through, I want them to stay alive." The only reason I am here is fear of failure- being even more of a burden on people who must already detest what I am. I am over forty, let me go. My children do not need to watch me in mental agony, and my ability to mask my torment is slipping quickly. I apologize for the length, but this boil had to be lanced. Please do not feel obligated to "cheer me up"; so many here can actually use the well wishes and kind thoughts, but thank you.
