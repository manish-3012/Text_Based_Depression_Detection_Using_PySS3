I should be deadI never took my life seriously, dropped out of high-school and now I'm stuck in a shitty blue-collar job. I don't want to work to make myself a better person and I enjoy feeling bitter and resentful. The few friends moved on with their lives and they stopped trying to have me go out with them. Sometimes I enjoy watching people being happy and enjoying their life, others I feel angry at them and have violent thoughts. When I talk to someone about my feelings and they says something to comfort me, I assume they are either ipocrites or idiots. I feel guilty because there's people who got it way harder and still they don't whine and manage to make something out of themselves.
