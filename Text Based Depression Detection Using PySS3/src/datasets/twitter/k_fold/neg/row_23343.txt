GripFeel like I want to check in. Hi. I'm still here. I am off everything except weed 31 days and it finally starts to feel like im a person again. That comes with the same dread and joy and every feeling i buried. I cried today. I have a new job. Im fighting like hell to get the things I need so I can discover the things i want. My life isn't any easier than it was when i was breaking down last month but I know I need to try. I feel so alone sometimes but I've been trying to reconcile with friends I alienated over the last few years thru being self destructive. I remember now what it was to be loved and it's worth holding out for. To love other people and be loved wholly as you are. That's what drives me for now. To find those people and let myself be found. I know I have the capacity to love and be loved but there's nothing more terrifying and beautiful than someone knowing who you are. Sorry for getting rambly. I still have very, very long nights and this is going to be one of them. But I'm still here and I will be tomorrow when the sun comes up and I hope you will be too.
