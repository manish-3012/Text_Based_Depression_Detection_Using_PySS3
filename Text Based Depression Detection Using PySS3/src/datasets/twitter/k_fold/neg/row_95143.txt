Writing this is one of the hardest things I've done...Okay, I never really talk about my problems, or complain about the hand I've been dealt in life or whatever, so writing this and expressing my feelings is not only difficult, but also the first time I've ever opened up in my life to anyone. Even as I'm typing I keep wondering whether to actually push the submit button. 

I've reached a point where I no longer have the will to carry on doing anything... I go to sleep at 4am and don't get out of bed until 7pm. Days blur into one long corridor of fuck-ups, if you asked me what I was doing two days ago I can't even remember, let alone vast chunks of my turbulent childhood. I feel a disconnect with everyone whether or not they are my age. I look around me and see all these people taking endless amounts of photos of themselves, or fretting over how their decor looks and not caring that every second people are dying in war-torn countries, its fucking surreal.  I do things that I used to enjoy, but I feel like an automaton. Maybe I'm just rambling and complaining but I've reached a peak whereby I think about ending it every day, I've been in this state for a couple of months maybe. If I'm honest the main thing I can't deal with is the passage of time. I go to bed one day, and the next thing I know its been a month and my life has completely changed. Milestone moments just pass me by and it feels like days. 

I don't know any of you, but I love all of you, really. I look out of my window and see the beauty and splendor that the world has to offer, but I also see the messed up shit, some of which has happened to me throughout my (short) life. And I'm not sure if its worth it anymore. It scares me to even think about but I have a plan and everything required so I think tonight is going to be really close.
