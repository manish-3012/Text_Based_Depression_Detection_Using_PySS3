When I am gone, please place a daffodil on my grave.I wish I could be a normal child. 
I wish I could admit that I'm not really smart.
I wish that I could be the person that I want to be.

I'm expected to meet standards of academic excellence but my A's have turned into F's, and I am not sure of myself anymore. I do not have any aspirations and I believe that I have failed myself, but I write this short letter with no malice towards the world. I write this letter with the hope that if I when I am gone, that the world would be a little less bitter.

Though the people who expect much of me may feel ashamed of me, I do not hold such feelings towards them. It is the least I can do, as I am not untouched by sin. I have lied and cheated, and I no longer feel that I belong on the world.

Not only have I let others down, but I have also let myself down by being an immoral part of society.

My hope may dwindle, but I try my best to hold on for another morning. 

I must admit, it's getting far more difficult. Sometimes I feel as though it would be better if I just ended it now. Then, perhaps, I would be able to fly away to another world where I can be at peace.

The only thing I can ask of now, is that when I am gone, I hope to have a daffodil placed on my grave.
