Happy ThanksgivingJust wanted to hop on and say that I hope you found something to remind you that someoneâ€™s thinking of you this holiday. It could be me (if youâ€™d like), it could be another stranger, it could be someone unexpected, it could be someone youâ€™d expect, it could be family, it could be a friend, it could be a coworker, it could be a neighbor, etc. Regardless I hope youâ€™re doing well faceless internet being, and that you have a wonderful holiday.
