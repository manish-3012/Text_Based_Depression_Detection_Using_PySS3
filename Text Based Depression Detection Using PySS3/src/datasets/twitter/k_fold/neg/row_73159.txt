Thanks for crashing browser - heartfelt, in-depth, final letter deleted. Summary:

I'm a depressed, violent, narcissist who had a sucky childhood. 

I have no real friends aside from my fiance - who I feel like is growing to resent me more and more over time but is too far into this relationship to back out. Often when we fight (over trivial shit) he threatens me with breaking-up, so I think that's what he would really like but is too scared of the consequences. I want more than anything for this relationship to work but its a two-way street. I cant force someone to love me back, you know?

When we first started dating I was an exotic dancer and he pressured me to quit. So I did, moved in with him, and continued college which I had just enrolled in. Prior to living together I took out a fuck ton of student loans because hey, I'm a rich stripper who can make that back in a few months if I wanted. Now I have tens of thousands of dollars to repay when I graduate. Which should have already happened only I completely fucked up 3 semesters and am only still a Junior. I hate myself so much whenever I think about it.

I have no job. All I did as a young adult was strip and be irresponsible so now I am in my late 20's and have nothing at all to put on a resume. I've totally bombed the handful of interviews I've actually been called to. I'm just a freeloading loser who is only responsible for housework and schoolwork and I can't even do those well. 

I am growing to hate everything that I am. I feel like my relationship was the only thing keeping me grounded and if it ends, which it might, I have no idea how badly I am going to spiral out of control. I don't want to be the female that threatens to kill herself when you break up with her, but I truly think I would.  

For the record I'm on meds, have been to therapy. 
It helps to some extent, just not enough.
