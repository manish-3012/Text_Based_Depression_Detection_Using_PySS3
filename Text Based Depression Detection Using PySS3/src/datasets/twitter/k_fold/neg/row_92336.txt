i don't know why im still herei really want it to be over.  no one will care when im gone, and i know thats true because i already mostly disappeared.

seems like the only people who would have stuck by my side were my psycho family members who would blame me for ruining the holidays whenever i went home.

'we really care about you, person i raised as 'fucking shit head kid''

where does this leave me now?  most people won't even talk to me.  all the people i know decided they hated me one year to, and try as i could to figure it out, i could not.

every single person I've been 'friends' with since college does the same fucking thing - sit inside and watch netflix.

one of them moved &lt;1/2 mile away from me; i grew out a beard, started cutting myself, and moved 2,600 miles away before he even texted me (10 months later).

i don't understand.  Im a very skilled person.  i suppose it's just that i don't want to cater to people's frivolous emotions anymore - yeah, i could sit around and make people feel giddy/humored again, but what the fuck is it worth hanging out with people who are going to avoid you like the plague when you need help/company.

fuck me.  not sure when exactly, but ill be dead by my own hand someday soon.
