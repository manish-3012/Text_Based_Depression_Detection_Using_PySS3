Why do we have to do this?Life is inherently meaningless. It is amusing that i came to this conclusion after my struggle to find some meaning in my life. My life fell apart once. Struggled with depression and was suicidal. Attempted suicide twice. Ended up living through my final year and "got my shit together". Now I have secured a job in a big corporation with a decent pay. 3 years of living in misery finally pay off and I've successfully beat depression right? 

No. I didn't. I spent everyday drinking coffee, smoking, listening to music and coding to fill the emptiness that resides in me. I don't know what I can do to *feel alive*

As I lay on my bed staring at the fan in a dark room thinking why should we live? Every reason that comes to my mind when questioned further reaches a point where the answer is I don't know. 

I am done with life. I was, since a long time but I was waiting patiently for a way out. Something that takes me away without a hint of suicide surrounding my death. Something natural so that it doesn't hurt my parents as much. 

But thinking about it, why should I care if I'm gonna die? 

Wish me luck guys, hope something natural occurs soon or I think I'll just end up taking the human approach to it and make it man-made :)
