I don't know what else to doIt might sound stupid, generic, cliche, or whatever you feel like calling it, but it's true. I don't see any other way. 


A little background info, I'm currently 15 and in high school (out for the summer). I have just been lonely all summer. I have done close to nothing at all. There are two friends of mine who I have told, one of which is depressed and has been unable to text for the past two weeks or so. My other friend I just feel like I bother them, I feel they feel bad and do everything out of pity. They couldn't careless about me, they just want to "save a life". 


Now that should be most of the background, and might end up being longer than the real post. I hope to be able to do it before school starts again. During school I have the routine of being exhausted from Monday-Friday after tying to act normal and doing 5 hours of homework each night, spend Saturday relaxing, then Sunday preparing myself for school and doing more homework. And no matter how hard I try, I still get poor grades. I just barely passed a few classes and didn't do particularly well in any. I am just a failure in all regards, mentally, socially, physically, academically, everything. And nothing is going to change. I am not going to wake up one morning and realize there is some magical solution, suicide remains the best and only way. But then there is that problem, I have no idea how to do it. The best way I have found is a gun, but I don't know any way to get access to one. Overdose is too painful and unreliable, cutting is too painful and slow, it seems the nothing will work. Then once I figure out how, I then have to find a way to not fuck it up like I know I will.
