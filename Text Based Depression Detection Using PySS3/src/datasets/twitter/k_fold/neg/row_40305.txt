:-)Iâ€™m a 21 y/o woman and have been having intense suicidal thoughts recently. I donâ€™t have any support system as my friends think iâ€™m joking and that i have nothing to be sad about, that i should just â€œbe happyâ€. Itâ€™s been so hard for me for a long time and i donâ€™t usually do this but iâ€™m terrified about my life. I donâ€™t want to go.. but i feel like i have to..
