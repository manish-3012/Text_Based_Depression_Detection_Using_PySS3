I can't be perfect. My exsistence has no sense.I want to be perfect. I want to win every game in League of Legends. I fail everytime. I fall everyday on simple things. I'm not even good if I lose everytime. My suffering should be ended. Why me? What did I do to become suicidal? Why people around me are healthy, but I'm sick? Why me? What is sense of this endless suffering? (Until natural death)... I can't focus. I can't make good strategies. I can't be good at only thing I do everyday. I'm a mistake.
