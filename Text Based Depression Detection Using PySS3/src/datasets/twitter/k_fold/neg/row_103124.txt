I gave up everything for nothingI moved far away from the town I grew up in to get away from drugs and negativity that ate at my life. I left my closest friends behind to start a new life with my SO of several years. 

We were homeless together since the start. I changed so much for him yet he was chaos and that seems to be the only thing I'm attracted to. I'm a magnet for disaster. I've been abused constantly in every way, the only way I know how to live is to manipulate people in order to get what I want, but that always ends in more pain. 

I broke up with him after I bought my very first apartment because I needed a new positive fresh start because he kept bringing drugs back into my life and continued the abuse. Now that he's gone I don't have anything left in this town. My old friends are hours away. All I wanted was a positive life but I just keep fucking it up. I'm in so much pain. He was my world we fought so hard together but we hurt each other over and over again. Without him I feel like I have no purpose. I live to feed off other people. I ruin people's lives that's all I'm good for. 

I don't see any hope for me anymore. What's the point. I can't see myself changing for the better anymore. I feel as if I don't deserve to be happy. 

I don't know what to do anymore and I'm scared. I want to die but I don't want to put that burden on my family and friends. I'm so empty. All of this fighting was for nothing.
