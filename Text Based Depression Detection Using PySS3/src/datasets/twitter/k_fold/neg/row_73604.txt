I've been accused of a crime.. and it has ruined my life.Background...

Only child, aging parents. Met the woman of my dreams, she left her husband for me. She had children previously, we have one together. Been together for years. Child is very young.. young enough to never know me. 

I've been accused of sexual misconduct. 

Now I'm lost. I have my freedom still, and the opportunity to fight the charges. I've lost my family and the woman of my dreams. Nothing will ever be the same, no matter how this situation comes out. Fighting would put the family though the torture that is usually involved in these cases. 

The right thing to do is let the legal system decide on the merits of the case... but I can't imagine putting everyone through this. 

I can't help but think that it's all better with me not here... better for everyone. I'm lonely, and scared, and I'm afraid I'll be that way forever. 

Its selfish, I know. Even that point makes me believe it's the best for me to go.
