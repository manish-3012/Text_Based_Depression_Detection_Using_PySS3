I never said this to anyoneWell, it's a long story, I hope that someone will read it, I never said this what I'm about to say to anyone. 

I don't know if I'm  depressed or not to be honest, it all started from a young age actually, my parents argued a lot when I say a lot I mean, my father was a heavy drinker and he never actually yelled at me or my sister just on my stepmother who raised me, it was awful, but I learned to go along with it I just kind of got used to it, my sister run away from home when she was 17 and I was 8, it was a bad childhood but I had happy moments. I grew up and started going to high school, I was a smart kid, got good grades, didn't make any trouble, you couldn't notice me even if I was alone in a room with you, I always kept to myself, I did talk to other I wasn't shy or something like that I just didn't felt the need to talk to anybody now when I think about it I probably felt that way cause I never had anyone to talk to at home so I learned to just be alone. Since I like politics I read a lot about it, mostly about Communism at a young age ( I'm from Eastern Europe so it's not that odd here to read about Communism or Marxism) and just kind of kept to myself with my books, I had friends a lot of them actually, I don't know why but people liked me, always encouraging me to talk more, but I never did speak until I really had to. So high school went okay, I had a couple of really good friends with whom I went out sometimes, but it never felt good, I wasn't happy, I wasn't satisfied, I was just sad, I was sad when I pet my dog, when I eat, when I'm out with my friends, I don't have a sad face so no one ever asked me anything about it so there was no need for me to explain to someone my feelings. I finished high school and got into law school, I met a girl, I liked her instantly, I though that she was a good person, so I talked to her a bit and we started dating, and I think I fell in love with her, but I'm not sure cause I didn't feel happiness I just felt that I care about her, I still constantly felt sad, it just didn't matter what I did I was sad, well I read on the internet when a person is depressed they don't have the will to do anything, I sometimes felt like that, but I still did all of my responsibilities, my girlfriend never suspected anything and I never talked to her about it cause I didn't know how to explain it to her, I'm not good at explaining my feelings cause I mostly feel only sadness, it is probably strange, it didn't affect my studying or any other aspect of my life, I'm the type of person that if I get angry I won't show it or tell anyone I'll just ignore it, if I feel regret I can ignore it, or any other feeling, but not sadness, this is probably weird and I don't know how to express my self to all of you, but I don't feel empty I just feel sad, you know how you get sad when a family member dies or your pet, or when your girlfriend breaks up with you..or any other thing, that is how I feel most of the time. Recently I got a bit too sensitive, I wasn't used to it, so it was strange, I started to miss my classes, I wasn't studying, and I started to have problems with my girlfriend of 3 years now, the problem is I don't know if this is how depression feels or is, and I don't know how to fix things with other people, I think that I'm falling apart, it was all too much, all these years I kept every feeling to myself, 3 months ago I started to have panic attacks, I don't know what is happening to me or what should I do, I don't have anyone to talk to and this is the first time in my life that I really need someone to talk to, I don't have anyone to be honest, I'm not really in contact with my sister, I can't speak with my parents about this, and certainly not with my girlfriend who is angry at me for some reason and sleeping in the other room. 
So if anyone is willing to talk to me, it would mean so much to me right now. This isn't a typical post on this subreddit, but I don't have anyone to talk to, if this is not the right subredit for this kind of stuff, please redirect me to another one, or some website, or anyone...Thank you all for reading, I could type more and I feel the need for it, but not here it is already a long post.
