I'm backI kinda left this sub after a little bit, but I thought maybe someone on here might have been worried so I thought I should tell you what happened. I started cutting myself. I met a girl who has since been my girlfriend. She helped and helps me through the times where i'm sure I would be better off dead just by being there. I haven't stopped cutting myself really, but she doesn't like anything with knives and I think she's going to try to help me with the times where I'm searching for a knife. I'm doing okay now and I think my recovery started here when I figured out it was okay to tell people.
