Never enoughSimple and sweet. 


I know B.P.D is the blame for a lot


Not tonight 


My best will never be enough.

I'm too chicken shit to do anything. I died once, a fucking trucker saved me. 

I wish I died then. I wish I had the courage to do it again.


I can't  risk another week in a hospital if I fuck up dying. It's the only reason I'm still here....


I just want to get off this ride. Jesus fuck, PLEASE! I don't want to fucking wake up tomorrow. FUCKING PLEASE let me off!!! 




PLEASE!
