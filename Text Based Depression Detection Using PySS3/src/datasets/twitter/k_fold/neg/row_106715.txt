I just can't go on anymore.My life has been terrible for the past few years due to a multitude of reasons and I've always said that I wouldn't give up but now things just got worse and I don't see things getting better. I hate every aspect of my life and dread waking up every morning. I also have nothing to lose really so I may as well just end this pain rather than prolonging it for no reason. 

All the things that I dread are right in front of my face, while everything that I desire is galaxies away from me. I'm tired of it all. I may be alive on the outside but I've truly been dead for a while now on the inside. Most people have someone that can tell them that it'll be alright, someone who can hold them.. But not me. Nope. Apparently I don't deserve even the slightest amount of happiness. 

I've tried praying and pleading for the universe to help me or at least give me a sign of some sort, but nope. I guess the universe gives zero fucks about me. I'm done playing this stupid game that I can't even get past level 1 on. That's all really. I'm gonna go make plans to end this misery now, but I hope ya'll can find some way to keep on going.
