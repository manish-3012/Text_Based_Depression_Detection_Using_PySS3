Instead, I think I'll just go to bedI haven't slept properly in four days now.  I suspect I'm having a manic/mixed episode in that I can't sleep for more than an hour or two at a time but still want to kill myself.  I know I'm tired and that doesn't help.   

What does help tho, is someone I  met here.  They are forcing me to be more responsible and think of someone outside myself.  So maybe I'll just go to bed instead.   Maybe when I wake it will be better.  Just maybe
