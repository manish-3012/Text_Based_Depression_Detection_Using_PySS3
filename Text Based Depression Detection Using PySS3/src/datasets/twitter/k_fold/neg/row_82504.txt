I was suicidal twice.  I'm still here. AMAFirst when I was 14.  I was weird, had no friends, teased, picked on, and all alone.  Typical youth struggles, but i didn't know how to cope with it.  My mom talked me off the roof once.  

Second time was 6 months ago at the age of 26.  It got so unbearable one night all I could think about was an image of a knife in my heart to stop it from hurting.  I called 9-1-1 and spent 3 nights in a mental hospital.  I came out with the tools to make my life better.  

Ask me anything, or if you want to keep it private then send me a message.  This is not a throwaway account.  I don't use sockpuppets unless I'm performing for kids.  I am going to bed soon but I would love to talk to you instead of letting you hurt yourself.
