I've decided to do itAfter many years of dealing with depression and anxiety, I've decided it's finally time. I've had two previous attempts, both of which I fucked up, one of which landed me in hospital. This time I've found a quick and easy way to do it that has a very high success rate.

This has been a long time coming. I've planned everything out now and have decided it is what I want to do, this is not a spur of the moment thing. I've made sure that no debt will be left to my family and I'm in the process of writing a general suicide note, a goodbye note for each of my friends and family members, and selecting somebody I trust to pass my passwords etc. to when I do it.  


I'm not going to do it before Christmas simply for the fact that it would be unfair for my friends and family to have this festive time of the year ruined by my selfish decision. I've not decided the date but it'll probably be around February. I also need to gather the materials and decide on a suitable location.  


Does anyone have any advice for other things I should do in preparation? I want to make this as easy as possible for everyone else in my life.
