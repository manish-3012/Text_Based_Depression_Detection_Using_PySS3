HeySo...I have  few things on my mind. Sorry for my bad english. I just have so much sadness inside me. I feel like I have no right to feel this sad, to be this bad. I feel like there is nothing I can do to feel better, there is nothing anyone can do to help me, either.

I don't ever recall being geniunely happy. I never thought about it before, but now I know. There were times when I felt glad, or maybe even cheerful. But it just never lasted, everything went back to gray after that. Is happiness really necessary? Is it even possible for me?

I have become the worst posible version of me. And I just can't explain why. People who loved me, do not love me anymore. Am I unlovable? Maybe I am. The ones that still do, or even like me, just like/love my facade. My everyday mask. They would go away if they knew the real me. The broken, unstable, real me. Do I really need them?

I don't want to die, but I don't want to live this life, this way. I don't want to leave my brothers, but right know, I don't want to stay either.

I wish I was...I don't know, far. Drinking some tea, reading an amazing book that is actually making me feel something and forget about the world...I don't even feel that anymore. Then, coming back home, maybe alone, maybe with company, and being proud and happy of my home, my happy place. Not having to spend hours daydreaming, because there is nothing to daydream about, life is better than never, better than anything imaginary my mind could come up with.

But it is just not like that. Tomorrow I will woke up and everything will keep being sadness, nothing will make me think  "Maybe this current life is not at bad, maybe I am not wasting my time, maybe someday I will be happy with the way I spent and lived my best years". Nothing, I just can't feel anything good.
