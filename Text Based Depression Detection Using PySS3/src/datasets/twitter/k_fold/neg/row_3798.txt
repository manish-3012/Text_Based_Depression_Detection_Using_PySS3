What the hellI skipped the suicide hotline this morning because they're apparently staffed by people who make it worse, not better, and jumped the line to talk to the mental health ER that I can get to in my zip code. They're sort of notoriously terrible for LGBTQ people but they're the one I can get to, so why the hell not?

Before I could even get to my gender/sexuality (or mental health) concerns, the woman asked me for insurance and state ID (specifically for the state where I currently reside). When I said I don't have either, that I moved states when my husband passed, she told me I could get evaluated at the hospital because the county pays for it, but I could not get treatment, medication, in patient or out patient services, or see any medical staff outside the evaluation. 

I said I didn't want an evaluation because I already know that I am rampantly suicidal and a dangerous to myself and have already attempted once in the past 24 hours. I'm not so unwell that I don't know that. 

So... Apparently in the US, our mental health system is way shittier than I thought it was.
