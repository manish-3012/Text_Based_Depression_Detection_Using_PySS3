Feels like the end.
Iâ€™m not really looking for advice or solutions. Iâ€™m not being defeatist, and Iâ€™m not looking for words to remind me of all I have to live for. I have no one to talk to and things I want to say.

I have fucked up my life, big time. Every decision has an adverse effect. Some sledgehammer like, but mostly they have had a nagging, eroding impact that culminates in a tunnel out of which I canâ€™t see an exit. I am so sad to have wasted my potential, and to be disappointing.

This year has been awful, with the implosion of a long term relationship on the cusp of marriage, a home, a routine, expectation and resounding happiness. I have tried all year to keep afloat in a new city, with no support system, financially reliant on myself alone for the first time, whilst trying to find meaning in a world left blown open. That it was entirely my fault is the worst thing, I deserve all of this. Almost twelve months ago my life was perfect. Now Iâ€™m dreading Christmas on my own, my birthday is this month. Iâ€™m being bombarded with the one year anniversaries of every bad thing thatâ€™s happened. I just canâ€™t do it. People keep asking how 2019 has been for me and I want to scream.

I live in a very, very, HCL city on an unskilled wage with no one to share the bills. My justification is that what I pay is cheap for what I have, basically a studio. I could pay less but get less (I.e shared bathroom/ kitchen) and have less freedom. I acknowledge that this isnâ€™t the right mind set, but havenâ€™t never lived with anyone but a partner I canâ€™t face sharing a bathroom, especially at my age. Whilst trying to live a somewhat frugal lifestyle I still want to buy fresh veg, face wash that works for me etc nothing Iâ€™d consider extravagant but itâ€™s my the low end if the market, and makes me feel human. Tonight I went for dinner with three girls I used to work with. We go monthly and I love seeing them. I left having paid two weeks worth of groceries for a meal and drinks that it turns out werenâ€™t subject to the discount weâ€™d planned. 

I date, which is expensive. Again, it gives me something to do in a city where I know no one. Every month I extend my overdraft. I can barely make bills yet I canâ€™t give up the only things that bring me any enjoyment. I think about how it doesnâ€™t matter if Iâ€™m going to die soon. I struggle to buy washing powder thinking thereâ€™s no point because Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I think that everyday. I have the means and the wish to, only one off life events for others distract me (weddings etc). 
I tried therapy but it turns out a colleague volunteers there, so I stopped going. I started a degree course that I found hard to attend due to work commitments and anxiety, now Iâ€™ve withdrawn because Iâ€™ve not attended enough and Iâ€™m left Â£2000 further in the hole. I try to do something to help myself, but it backfires and itâ€™s all my fault. 

I have found some happiness with someone who is so out of my league it actually makes me feel worse, even though heâ€™s amazing and he loves me. But I shouldnâ€™t expect to be saved, and I canâ€™t save myself. Itâ€™s not fair to him. But selfishly canâ€™t think how to end things when I enjoy him so much. Logically I need to, so I will. I just wanted it all to work out so badly, I wanted to move on, I wanted to live an easy life, but I donâ€™t deserve it and I donâ€™t have the energy. I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m writing this, I just want someone to listen, and acknowledge that my life is shit and itâ€™s not selfish to consider ending it. I want to be reassured that it wonâ€™t hurt anymore, I wonâ€™t have to worry and itâ€™s ok to want out. Please understand, I need someone to understand.
