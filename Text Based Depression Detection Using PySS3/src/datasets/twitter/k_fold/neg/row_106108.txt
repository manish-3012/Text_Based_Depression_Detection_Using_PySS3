GoodbyeIve never been sadder and happier in my entire life. I have decided I shall end it this week. The only thing that makes me feel bad to go is my dad's condition when I'm gone. He's the only one that made me feel loved. And I hope he wont mourn too much. It's either by hanging or slitting my wrists.
