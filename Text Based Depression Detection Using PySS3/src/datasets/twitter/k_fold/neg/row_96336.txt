When I was 13-16, my mom forbade me from talking to girls to "protect me from the pain of rejection." She used the then-recent Myspace suicide story as justification. Ulitimately, I hated being forbidden from talking to girls so much that I was driven to suicide.Did my mom see some sort of suicidal inclination in me or does she just hate teenage girls?
