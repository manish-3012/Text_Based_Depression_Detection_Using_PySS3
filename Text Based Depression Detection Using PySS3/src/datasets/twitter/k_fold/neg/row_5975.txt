If only the chance of accuracy was 100%I would try to kill myself tonight if there was a way I could do it and not fail. I tried before and waking up was the worst pain Iâ€™ve ever felt. I just want to die. If I had a gun I would pull the trigger. Nobody cares about me, nobody wants me around. Iâ€™m such a loser and I just hate waking up everyday living this miserable life. I try so hard to be okay but Iâ€™m not and I hate myself. Why canâ€™t I just be normal? I want to de but what if I fail? Then Iâ€™d have to deal with everyoneâ€™s disappointment again, Iâ€™d be in the hospital, and I hate the hospital. But I know thereâ€™s no way for me to be 100% sure Iâ€™d be successful. I wish I would just die in some tragic accident.
