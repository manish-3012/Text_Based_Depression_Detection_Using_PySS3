What is there ahead for me?So this account is obviously a throwaway, because this is really a pathetic question I'm about to ask/give you a brief history about :x

What is there to do in life? I'm 20 (young, I know) (OH and I'm a girl, by the way); I have a horrible fear of social situations for which I've had all my life (been through therapists, meds, even a mental facility because I had a major breakdown in a situation with tons of people I don't know) &lt;- I'd like to point out that I am never violent in any of my breakdowns or freak-outs, as I call them. I've always loved music, however I can't afford a guitar or even a ukulele since I can't even get a job because of my condition, although I've taken a few online odd jobs here and there to support myself. To be honest, music is probably the only thing I'm really passionate about; the only thing I really enjoy and de-stress over. The problem is, this can't be made into a career (1-I can't afford the ohsoamazing stringed instrument and 2- my fear of human interaction). I realize that I can't live forever off internet odd-jobs and editing crap for people online, but what else is there left for me? A job doing something I'm not passionate about being in constant contact with people? I've just been thinking more and more about this lately... It's bothering me so much that I can't even eat sometimes, and I already am falling apart &gt;.&lt;; I just need to know what I can do in the future, I guess. And if you've read all this instead of skimming, thank you &lt;3
