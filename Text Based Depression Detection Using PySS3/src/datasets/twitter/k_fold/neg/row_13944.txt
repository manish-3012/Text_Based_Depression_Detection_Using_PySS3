It's just an offer, if you'd want an online friend, never hesitate to hit me up :)I'm not in a perfect state of mind myself so chances are that we will understand each other.

I might not be able to solve anything for you but I will try my best.

I'm a funny guy (well I think so), and one of those who doesn't care much about people's weird stares. I try to keep a positive attitude as long as possible but sometimes I break into pieces - and I realize it's OK and put myself back together whenever it's possible - so yeah, let's talk!
