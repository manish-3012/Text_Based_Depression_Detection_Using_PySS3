rant.i think iâ€™m having a mental breakdown. 
as of late my numbness has reached peaked annoyance ,, i cannot cry or let out any emotions in any way which is super!! itâ€™s not like iâ€™m stopping myself i desperately want to but nothing will happen nothing will fix it which again,, is super i love it so much hahaha!! along with that iâ€™m having random heart palpitations/ adrenaline shoots which might be some anxiety issue? i donâ€™t know bc iâ€™ve never come forward about my issues irl before which i also love so MUCH!! i want to scream very loudly but iâ€™m sure that would frighten some people, my hair is also falling out, again maybe due to stress ahaha i donâ€™t know anymore. letâ€™s see,, oh also i havenâ€™t slept in 4 entire days!! iâ€™m living on 3 hours of sleep and a gallon of water woohoo !! the past months ( iâ€™ve lost track) my entire sense of time has completely disappeared lol,, things that happened yesterday seem so distant  and i donâ€™t know if a major event that happened some time last week happened on friday or any other day !! woohooÂ² !! iâ€™ve disassociated a fuck ton and really have no idea whatâ€™s going on 
i also really feel like iâ€™m going to kill my self before the end of the year ,,, good night
