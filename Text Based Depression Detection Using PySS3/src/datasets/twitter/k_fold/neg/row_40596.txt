Iâ€™m just tiredI have no feelings for most of the day most days. Itâ€™s just kind of a listless drift through the events of each day until the sun goes down and I start to think and get angry at myself. I donâ€™t like anything about myself. I donâ€™t appreciate what and who I have in my life and I wonâ€™t let myself be happy. Iâ€™m tired and I just want to rest.
