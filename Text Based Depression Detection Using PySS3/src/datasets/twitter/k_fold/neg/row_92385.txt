Looking for a serious discussion on a simple question: why should I keep going?I was planning to do it tonight, but some quick research found my method to be a pretty bad idea. I've not got much to go at this point so any sort of serious response would be appreciated.

There's no real point in going over my entire history with depression, so I'll just cut to the current situation: chronic pain, mostly on the back but it occasionally flares up in random places with great intensity; migraines; exceptionally poor hygiene; poor diet; 0 exercise; 2 friends in total, one of whom will regularly respond to me; parents who care but won't help; poor grades; etc. etc.

Can someone honestly tell me there's something left me for me to hold onto? At this point I truly feel like I'm just obligated to live. I'm not living for myself anymore.

EDIT: Nearly forgot the most important one which has been plaguing me quite a bit recently: I'm unbelievably stubborn. It took the police for me to even mention depression to my parents, which hasn't come up since. I'm desperately trying to talk about it but it just doesn't happen, and I don't know why.

EDIT 2: The chance of anyone actually reading this is low but I'd feel like an asshole wasting time with a double post. I really don't feel any better than I did at the start of the day. I've got another method planned out already, probably gonna try that one tonight. Sorry for wasting your time.
