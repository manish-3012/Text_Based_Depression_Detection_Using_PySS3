Very glad I did not kill myself....My wife has no idea about my suicidal thoughts. She was gone all weekend and it was just me and the cat. She was at a church camp and I had to work at the hospital this weekend. The first day while at work I had thought very deeply about just going home and ending my life right after work. 

I decided not to. I wanted to try to help my cay acclimate instead to his new home. 

The next day, I woke up and was listening to some horror stories on YouTube. One of them described a child who heard her mother say she loves her very much, and then the child heard a very loud and described going to her mothers room and seeing her mother. The way it was described really struck me, and the trauma of finding her mother really struck me as well. 

I decided not to do it after that. I don't want my wife walking into that and having to face the trauma. I don't want my cat to have to go through the trauma of hearing and seeing his new friend die. 

Hope all is well with you guys... fight the good fight.
