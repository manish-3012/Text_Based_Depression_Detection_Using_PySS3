I'm failing everythingEverything's going to shit. Having therapy for rape for the first while doing my course has made everything come up for the first time, so my work is fucking terrible/not handed in on time. And this was kind of my last chance as well because I kept dropping out of school for years. 

That's just one thing. But I'm not sure how many more consequences of a fucked up childhood I can take. I can't take action because I can't stop believing that I don't deserve to. The way I take it feelings used to be on myself, but now the suicidal urges won't go away unless I \*completely\* destroy something, like a mug or a plate. 

I used to judge people who think like this, but I get it now: All I want to do is break things until it's all gone.
