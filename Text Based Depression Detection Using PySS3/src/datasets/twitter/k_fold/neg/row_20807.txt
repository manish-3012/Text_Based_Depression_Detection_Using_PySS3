I didnâ€˜t drink for 4 days.I stopped drinking for 4 days. It felt like having the flu, but much worse. I would almost faint when standing up. My mouth smelled like  crap because bacterias did their thing undisturbed, so I went to wash it. Thatâ€˜s when my survival instinct took over. Here I am, looking for a better suicide method. Fuck life.
