I just... need someone right now, pleaseContext: I went through a very traumatic, nasty divorce when I was a kid, and my dad got full custody. My bio mom was emotionally abusive and as a parent, neglectful. My dad, for the most part, is a good dad. He tries hard. I do love him and I know he cares about me but he also has a really bad temper. He doesnâ€™t believe in therapy. Iâ€™ve had really bad anxiety for as long as I can remember, and I experience panic attacks every now and again â€” more when Iâ€™m under stressful circumstances. Iâ€™ve struggled with suicidal thoughts for a long time and now, in college, have been getting help. Iâ€™ve tried to tell my parents about my mental health struggles but they always shut me down and say Iâ€™m making an excuse.
My dad has really bad anger issues/issues processing and expressing his emotions appropriately. He gets upset and blows up and says really horrible things. When I was twelve, he told me he didnâ€™t want a kid like me and that he was going to put me up for adoption. Anytime I mess up, he tells me Iâ€™m a selfish person, I donâ€™t care about my family, and that I should be out on the street, fending for myself.
Last night, I forgot to set two cups of rice for dinner (I am still taking online college courses, am walking the dog, and keeping the house clean), and my dadâ€™s response was to empty my bank account, shut off my phone, and is mandating I get up at 6:30 every morning. And then he screamed at me until I cried (because him screaming at me is very traumatic and reminds me of the really bad times during the divorce), and then screamed at me because I was crying, all the while telling me the things he always tells me. And I usually wind up feeling guilty like how Iâ€™m not a good person and I donâ€™t deserve anything, but two years into a psychology degree has taught me thatâ€™s not true. 
I havenâ€™t been close to an attempt in a few months, but I really donâ€™t know if I can live like this. We are under shelter in place orders for a month. 
I am so close to killing myself, and I feel so alone and isolated from my friends and support network, and I just...need to know someone is there
