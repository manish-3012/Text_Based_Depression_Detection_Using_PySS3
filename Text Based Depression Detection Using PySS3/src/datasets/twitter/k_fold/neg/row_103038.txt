AloneSo much has happened that caused my entire world to collapse. I don't know where to begin. My loved ones were picked off one after the other. I'm alone. Not the run of the mill "I feel alone". I mean alone. I have no one for the line, "In case of emergency contact __________". That was my "I have no one" moment. No one.
