How long til I feel better?It's now Day 6 being on fluoxetine after a Depression/Anxiety diagnosis and these symptoms have left me questioning if im really here, im practically void of any emotion. Nothing feels real anymore, it's as if my body's on auto pilot and I'm just watching through the cinema screen as life happens.  I've heard I'll get worse before I get better. Am I the only one that's felt this way? Anyone know how long this'll last?
