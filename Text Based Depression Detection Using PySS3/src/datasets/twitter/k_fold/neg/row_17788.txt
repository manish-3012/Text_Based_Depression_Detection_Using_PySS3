"I'm here for you"that's saying I'd bs everyone knows that .I never came to realise how helpful the anonymity on the internet is until I started having suicidal thoughts and  started self harming which almost resulted in me dying once unfortunately I did die.ite so hard to ask for help when you know no one cares and people say to talk to your parents like bitch they're part of the issue.And everytime someone thinks they're helping they make me want to kill myself even more .they don't know I'm suicidal but everytime the topic comes ugh... I need help and I can't get any.theres no way out.
