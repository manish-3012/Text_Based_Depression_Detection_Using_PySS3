Turned away from ERIâ€™m a 20 year old female, I walked myself into the emergency room because I canâ€™t take feeling the way I feel anymore. I needed immediate help. They turned me away and told me I had anxiety, to see my GP. 
No one knew I was there except for my boyfriend and my close friend, who showed up just as I was let go. I wouldnâ€™t be here if they werenâ€™t there to pick me up. 
Iâ€™m going to try again with the emergency room. I need help. I need to get better. For my boyfriend and for me. 
Iâ€™m not an emotional young female whoâ€™s over reacting, whoâ€™s having a panic attack, whoâ€™s over thinking. I need help.
