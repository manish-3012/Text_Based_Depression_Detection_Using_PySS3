I feel like the only reason I'm not following through with suicide is that I have a mother and brother, and I couldn't do that to them...I'm a middle aged guy, single, lonely, about to graduate college with a crappy gpa. I have no real hopes in life that feel within my grasp and I'm sick of needing to scrape off of others just to survive. My motivation has shriveled away, and I feel more like I'm just taking up space. My education is in psychology and neuroscience, and I've come to figure what I think are some quite effective and painless ways of doing it as well. My only frustration is that I have a mother and brother who love me very much, and it would destroy them for me to do such a thing. So, i feel trapped. I can't escape, because either way I'm hurting someone, and this just makes me feel more helpless and depressed.....
