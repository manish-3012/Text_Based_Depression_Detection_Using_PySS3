Another one So I've been thinking about suicide for a while now. Every day while I sit at my desk, walking home and before I go to sleep.

Sometimes I'm so determined to do it... It's just I haven't figured out how to do it yet. 

I guess I don't have a huge reason to feel or think like this, or do I, I guess it depends on perspective. But the way I see the world is just...I don't know how to put it in words.

I HATE it, everything. I despise, pity and hate every single thing or person in the world sometimes. Most of the times I just feel depressed/ sad.

I don't see any reason or hope to continue liek this, it's pointless.

I regret everything I do or say, even writing this right now, or the fact that I was born (even though it wasn't my decision, and that infuriates me).

You might say I need help but nobody can help me right now, because I can't talk directly to another person.I just can't.

Sorry for this, I just wanted to put this out there.
