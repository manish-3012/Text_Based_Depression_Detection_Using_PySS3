What the fuck? What is this thing called life?I lost all motivation to live, I really don't see a point in living and wondering what I have done in my life. I remember being one of the most passionate people but now I'm always in bed depressed. Why the fk is life like this? I'm just generally unhappy with life and how it turned to be. Thanks world.
