Do you feel like very few people take you seriously?After talking to my therapist about this, one of the main reasons I'm down so much is because, basically, people just don't take me seriously at all, which might be tolerable to some, but this is traumatic and wholly depressing to me, and I respond to it with emotional pain and tearfulness, sometimes I want to cut but I choose alcohol instead. This has to be one of the main reasons I idealize suicide so much, because I just can't imagine going my whole life being constantly... "invalidated". It's also why I spend so much time on my outward appearance, because I know for a fact this impacts how I'm treat 90% of the time. I know I'm hypersensitive to others, but a lot of it is just because, as I say others are just dicks to me often.

In fact the only reason I haven't offed myself here right now is because I have nice friends who treat me well.

Just wondering who relates?
