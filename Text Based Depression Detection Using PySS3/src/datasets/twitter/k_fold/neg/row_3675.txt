I don't feel anythingI haven't felt anything for years. I recently got a boyfriend and he's really nice and is the best person in the world but nothing has changed. He tries to help me but there's only so much he can do. I just have no motivation and I'm always sad. I have depression, social anxiety, mild asperger's and borderline personality disorder. I want to kill myself and idk why I haven't yet. I'm really close to doing it though because I have no more options. I won't get better. I think it would be better for my bf since I say mean things to him when I have mood swings. He could find someone who treats him better. I don't want to keep living for myself but maybe I could keep living for him and stay alive solely for him so at least he could be happy. I don't know how I would do that though. I feel like I'd need motivation and I'd have to be happy to do that. I don't know what other option there is. He loves me a lot for some reason and I know he really does so I don't want to leave him. I don't really know what I'm asking for but if anyone has advice I would appreciate it.
