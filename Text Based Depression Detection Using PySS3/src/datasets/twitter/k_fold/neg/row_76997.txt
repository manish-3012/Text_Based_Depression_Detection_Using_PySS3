Slowly falling into suicidal thoughtsI have been feeling suicidal for a couple of years, to be honest. Even though I have gotten help at high school, life is shit. There's no joy or satisfaction in anything I do, not even at home where I'm supposed to feel safe. All I've ever done is annoy people; it's obvious they all despise me, they just don't say it. My last school year especially was AWFUL, and the start of the shitty GCSEs. I have a terrible feeling that I'll either kill myself or just leave everything behind and leave my family and friends. What are they going to care? This is mainly because of school as well, which has given me SEVERE social anxiety and just no self-esteem or confidence. I've just given up on believing in myself and probably will do something to myself in a few months.
