Iâ€™m a high school senior with my entire future ahead of me and I donâ€™t careI donâ€™t see a point in being alive at all. I am always so down and lonely and even with therapy I have found myself slipping further and further into this very deep depression. I think about dying every single day. Living like this feels so pointless and I canâ€™t see myself ever recovering. I just donâ€™t want to continue.
