It doesn't seem worth it to try.Everyone says to find someone to talk to when suicidal, but what if you have no one? And it's not like I can just make friends, because I don't want to bother people because I realize I'm just sad/awkward all the time. People don't want to be the "first friend". Ugh. I'm never going to get over fucking my life over like I did.
