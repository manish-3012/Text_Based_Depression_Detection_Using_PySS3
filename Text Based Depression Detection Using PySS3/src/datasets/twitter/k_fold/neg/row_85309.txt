Long past time to goI turned 40 yesterday.  Birthdays, particularly decennials, are a time to reflect on accomplishments and achievements.  I have none.  I have an AS from a city college.  I've never been in a real relationship.  I have no assets.  I have no job.  I live off charity.  I'm a parasite and a burden to the very few people who still care about me.  I failed at killing myself when I was 23.  I am a coward.  I am completely worthless.  I should be dead.  I'm scared of trying and failing, being brain-damaged, being committed.  But I can't do this anymore.  I'm so lonely, but I have nothing to offer another person.  I can't sleep.  There is nothing to look forward to.  Whatever I did, I must have paid for it by now.  I don't fantasize about a better life; I fantasize about a quick, painless death.  I wouldn't even mind some pain if it meant doing something that would negate the pointlessness of my existence.  But that's not going to happen.  I'm going to die alone and my death will have as little meaning as my life.  God I fucking hate myself so much.
