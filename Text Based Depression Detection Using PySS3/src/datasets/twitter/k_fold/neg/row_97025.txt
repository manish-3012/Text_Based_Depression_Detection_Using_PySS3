sick of feeling this wayi went like 6 months without having any suicidal thoughts and i legitimately thought I had gotten through it but then something set me off at work and im immediately back to square one. does this ever get better or is this just gonna be my life forever? if so what's the point of trying to feel any better or even trying to live
