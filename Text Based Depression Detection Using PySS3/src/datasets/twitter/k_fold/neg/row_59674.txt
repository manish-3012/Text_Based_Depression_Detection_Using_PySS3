I don't know what's wrong with meI don't feel close to anybody. I don't love anyone. I don't feel loved by anyone. I never feel remorse for things I do wrong, I don't feel bad for hurting people. I don't know why, I just want to feel something. I have no one to talk to, I can joke around with a lot of people but I can't talk seriously to anyone. I've only ever told two people how I feel and neither seemed to care. Neither of my parents know how I feel and I don't think they'd care either. I want to be close to someone. I've thought about ending everything several times. I just need someone to talk to.
