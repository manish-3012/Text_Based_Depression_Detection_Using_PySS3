There is no reason in living if you know you're going to die aloneI've yet to have anyone prove me wrong.

Every time I ask whether or not life is worth living if you're never going to find love or even friendship, I'm never given an answer. Only people saying, "How do you *know* you're going to die alone?" Fuck you, I know goddamn well I'm never going to find anyone. I'm objectively ugly. There is not a single human being on the entire planet who is compatible with me. I'm utterly terrified of other people anyway. I never open up to anyone, ever. I've learned not to. Yet I still desire attention. I fucking hate it. It's extremely annoying and distressing. I wish I could force asexuality and aromanticism on myself.

The fact that no one ever really answers my question indicates that no, life is not worth living if you spend it alone, and that death truly is the best option in this situation. I just wish I wasn't too fucking pathetic to actually go through with it. I'm a slave to my instincts as always.
