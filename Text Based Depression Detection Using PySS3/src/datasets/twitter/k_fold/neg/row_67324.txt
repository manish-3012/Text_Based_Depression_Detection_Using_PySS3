welpsometimes I get fucked up thoughts like I wish my family was dead because then I wouldn't have anything to live for and it'd be so much easier and guilt free committing suicide

I don't want to ruin their lives any more than I already have, the thought of them having to deal with a dead kid just kills me. it feels like I'm forcing a dead body around with absolutely no motivation and drive whatsoever. I know I have to keep studying and working at my internship and get a legit career so my dad doesnt feel any more shame for his deadbeat kid than he already has

I'm literally a sinkhole bringing everything I touch down and it makes me want to leave. I don't know if one day my impulse would be stronger than my reason. it's really starting to feel that way. 

I'll probably start smoking cigs again. that way I get both stress relief and higher chance of dying without having to stress about doing it myself.
