I'm just really tiredhow do you even title shit like this? I mean honestly

I dunno. hey guys. The past few weeks have been really rough and tonight is one of those nights where it just. Im apathetic enough I might just kill myself. I have access to loaded guns or i could easily just slit my wrists. I don't ..... want to ... but I do. You know? 

Idk I've just been depressed for about two months after some mania and Im. Tired. Of myself, of being a failure, of having no friends

Okay, that's a lie. I have friends. They're just not .... idk. I just really want to stop existing. I'm sorry

I set this deadline for myself that by my birthday (may), ill kill myself if things aren't okay, and that seems so far away but also too close. Im just really tired of everything
