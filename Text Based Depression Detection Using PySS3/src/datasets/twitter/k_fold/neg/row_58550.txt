I want to die but can't ask for helpWow. This is hard. I'm 29 years old and I guess I saw everything going another way...but don't we all. I wake up every day with the thought of shooting myself. I've made some poor decisions in my life that I live with daily. For one I'm 99% sure I am bi-polar which has lead me down this path but I don't want to be diagnosed as mentally ill, because well, then I can't end my life as easily and humanly as I would like. I've never hurt anyone and I never will. Yet I continue to hurt myself. On paper I have it all, I work in the entertainment industry earning over 6 figures a year. My bi-polar has lead me down the road of promiscuity and as a result I have a few stds and fear I have HIV (not tested for it as the fear kills me) but either way I feel I can never live a normal life. I work, I drink, I go to sleep. I hate my job and feel like this is it. I don't have the confidence to ask for help at least in this current "low" which has lasted awhile. I used to get manic and just create art and have all these ideas and passion. The passion is gone and I feel like an empty vessel and I find myself asking what's the point we all die eventually? The worst part for me would be making my mother sad. She has been an incredible mom and sacrificed so much for me and I cry just thinking about what this would do to her . That is literally the only thing keeping me alive. I'm rambling (had a few drinks) I just don't know what to do anymore and I'm sick of the depression. I don't know...
