I got promoted yesterday. Ill be gone tomorrow.Iâ€™ve been working at a restaurant for a few months. My last shift I learned I got promoted to shift leader. For the time leading up to it while the position was open I actually felt some kind of emotion about it. Now that I actually have it I dont really feel anything. Iâ€™ve realized I cant get any fulfillment even out of my work anymore and I have nothing left. All my options are exhausted. 

Thereâ€™s nothing for me to do. Iâ€™ve tried the therapists. They either have me talk and press for answers but then not say anything or just give self help stuff that doesnt work. Iâ€™ve tried the medication. I dont remember how many Ive been on. Maybe 7. Stopped the current one a couple of months ago and so far nothing has gotten worse. Probably wasnt doing anything then. Exercising and eating right only goes so far. I have nobody to talk to about this other than strangers apparently. The one person I have really ever connected with was my boyfriend. Heâ€™s no longer the person he was, or at least who I thought he was. Lying, constantly angry, doesnt respect me at all, might not even love me anymore, idk. Threw a chair across the room just an hour ago. Even though it was towards me he claims he wasnt throwing it at me.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about leaving but I cant. I have nowhere to go other than to my abusive parents. Even if I did that I would have to quit my job. My coworkers and boyfriend are the only people I spend time with so I would go back to having nobody again. Iâ€™m trapped, both in life and in my mind. Thereâ€™s no other option. Iâ€™ve tried this path before. Know enough about what went wrong to not fail. Im not here for advice. Ive heard or read it all before. I just want to have at least someone to share this with before I go, even if its just a random person.
