Help... would be niceI'm dealing with some mental health problems that just keep coming back to me, i fight them off for a bit but when it comes back it come back hard and stronger, I used to take medication to help me but I've been lying to everyone telling them "I don't need them any more" that I'm " better " but in reality I'm just saying that because when I'm off of them I feel some what alive, even if that feeling is just pain. The meds I take make me feel like a shell of myself, I would like to talk to some pro life or not, I just want to talk to someone who understands me,
