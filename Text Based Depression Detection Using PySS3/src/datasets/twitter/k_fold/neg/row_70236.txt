no one caresive got so much on my mind lately n the only way i can think of 2 solve it is by dieing. last nite i rung the crisis team which for me is a huge effort as i dunt really trust them but i needed help. id take a few extra quitipine which is not abnormal gor me and just chill me out rather then 2 die so i explained this n they told me 2 ring an amberlance which i did not need so why waste there time and the crisis team terinated my call (there words) so i have noone 2 try n talk me out of these feelings and there getting worse n worse . now i feel wots the point in asking for help if i die ill just be another statistic
