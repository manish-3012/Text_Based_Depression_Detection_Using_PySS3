I think The end is the only way left..Hello, this post is gonna be a little incoherent and is going to ramble a lot so i'm sorry in advance for the trouble. Ok so recently suicide has dominated my thoughts both consciously and unconsciously and it seems like the best alternative to everything else. To help illustrate why this is the case im going to go over some shit.

To start I am a chronic introvert that suffers from severe depression. This depression started when my father abandoned me when I was only 1 year old and burgeoned to the front of my consciousness when I was 5  and my classmate threw an apple into a ground wasps nest. I being the stupid kid I am went and pulled the apple out leading the entire nest to attack me. now after that i was just referred to as stupid by my immediate family but it made me start to think of myself as worthless and undesirable and giving the fact that my dad left me the seeds were strewn so to speak Over the years my depression has grown with the reinforcement of these core beliefs by various actions caused by individuals. such as, my friends leaving when I had no money to spend on them, My aunt and Uncle kicking me out because they said I did not give a shit because I skipped school, and my mom disowning me when I was 15 because I did not listen to her boyfriend at the time because he beat me and I resented him for it. 

Now that left me in a foster home where they did not feed u if u were not home at exactly 3, 5, and 8 and they locked you out all night if i was not home by 11pm. I survived in that hell for three years without any real friends and after that spent some time homeless because i had no friends or family to help. A little while later i Got a message from my cousin who I had not seen since my uncle kicked me out. She let me stay at her place and we hang out for a week and It was among the happiest i've ever been just being able to spend time with someone and talk about things i love like music and animation. However because of my depression I constantly thought that I was a burden and that she hated having to spend time with me so i took a flight to Alberta to stay with sister for a month until I could find a place to live there. After one month my sister kicked me out because she said I did not care (I have to stress how much this hurts because everything I do is in the hopes that they are happy and for them but because of the fact that I have no self worth I end up pushing them away cause I know they will be happier that way but they always see it as me not caring and that if I did care I just would not do what I do) 

After that I found a place to stay and a couple months later my cousin came to visit for a week I did not see her despite wanting to until her last day because their is no way she could of enjoyed seeing me. Suffice to say when she did see me it ended with an argument where she said that I don't care about her and that she did not to see me again.

At this point everyone in my family has said that I dont give a shit and that they want nothing to do with me. Therapy has not helped i've seen 5 different therapists and they all basically said that my thinking was wrong and that I just needed to think differently. Which I've tried but it doesn't work. I have no friends So everyday I come home alone with nothing but thoughts of ending it consuming me. 

Which leads me to three weeks ago where I fell on a piece of ice and got a herniated disk in my back. Because of the pain I can't work because i work inventory jobs and the pain is too much. I can't afford the medicine or treatment so I just have to live with the pain and honestly I can't see how to do that at this point. Also everytime my eyes are drawn to my wrists I see the skin part and blood rush out and cover everything around Me with it seeming to reaffirm the relief I could have so soon. Anyways I really wish I could Have made something of life and found enjoyment with people but at this point I just don't see it. 

I'm really sorry for wasting your time with this mess of a post but I thank you for taking the time to read it regardless.
