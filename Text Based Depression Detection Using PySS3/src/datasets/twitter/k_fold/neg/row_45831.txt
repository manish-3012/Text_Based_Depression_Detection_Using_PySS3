Meeting friend who is on his Farewell Tour for dinner tonight. Need advice!I have a friend who's had serious depression for a number of years. He's made various Facebook posts over the years nearly tantount to suicide notes but has never followed through. He's been living in the Midwest for a few years but is now flying  across the states to see his friends he hasn't seen for a number of years. Based on some other clues there's a good chance he sees this as his Farewell world tour so I'm pretty concerned but have no idea what to do or say at the dinner we're having together in just a few hours. I don't even know how I'm going to look him in the eyes.
