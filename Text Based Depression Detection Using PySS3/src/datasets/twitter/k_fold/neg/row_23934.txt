i am a little bit tired.i'm misunderstood and i don't want to be understood anymore. i don't have to carry on your name. i will die alone with no home to keep me warm or food to keep me alive. i am already insane. i can't feel any taste. i can't wake up. i am. i. i don't like saying "i" all the time. i'm selfish. i'm miserable. i'm alone. If i was to kill myself, will my soul die together with my frail flesh?
