I made a will. Everything is getting closer now.For me, the will is essentially my suicide note. It's how I will be telling the people that I care about how much they meant to me, and maybe get a few digs in at the people I hated (you give them five bucks, they find out about the will and about what you wrote about them). I'm trying to stage this as an accident, so I won't be leaving a real note.

Now I have to get rid of as much stuff as possible without anyone putting the pieces together.

I've no one to talk me out of this. There's no one to talk to at all. The one person who was going through the same thing has a new job and a new boyfriend, and I feel like I'm just holding her back now, like getting your jacket snagged on a tree branch. She's a good person. I wrote a lot about her in the will, left her things she'll like.

I gave it twenty whole years to get better. Nothing got better. I just want it to finally be over. Soon.
