Ever since I was a kid I've always been depressed and anxious to some degree. Memories of my childhood are mostly neutral. I didn't have a bad childhood. My parents loved me and raised me the best they knew how. But my childhood was never that great either. I was bullied regularly and I was always anxious, neurotic and depressed. My anxiety and depression was pretty mild though my middle school and high school years. I have a very vivid memory of the first time I had suicidal thoughts when I was around 12 or 13 years old they have been there on and off ever since. When I was 19 my anxiety and depression got horribly worse. I would have bouts of anxiety that would last days to weeks. During these bouts I couldn't sleep and had to force myself to eat. I basically lived like this on and off throughout my twenties.

Here I am just a few months shy of my 33rd birthday. My mind and soul have been all but drained out of me after over a decade of dealing with this. Although I've managed to keep it all under control over the last couple of years I'm permanently scarred. I don't have a personality anymore. I don't have that spark or glow that you see in normal, happy people. When you look into my eyes they are just empty. They look through you, not at you. I don't have any close friends. The people I try to make friends with don't stick around very long. I'm at a point where I don't have the mental strength to live life in a fulfilling way. My plan currently is to ride out the next few years, save up as much money as I can, then disappear. I will then off myself in some quiet peaceful corner of the globe. The likelihood that I will see my 40th birthday is next to zero and I'm ok with that. I've experienced enough pain and suffering as someone two or three age. Looking back I guess I've always known in my gut I would never live a very long life. I figured I would just eventually reach that point where I knew enough is enough and it's time to leave for good. This is my version of retiring early and I look forward to it.
