Nervous about this afternoonI'm going to my gyno today because even though I've had suicidal thoughts before, off and on for years, it seems that this round came shortly after stopping birth control.  I'm going to my gyno to see if this is normal because I promised my partner that I would ask if I should start taking birth control again.  I really don't want to - I don't like that it almost totally blocks me off from a healthy sexual appetite.  I also don't want to be on medications if I don't have to be.  I'm slightly worried that if I am honest with my gyno about how I'm feeling/thinking, she may try something...even if I tell her that I have a therapist and he has not assessed me to be a risk to myself right now.  I wrote a letter today in case I get pushed over the edge.  The only way to push me over is to make it all known and get my family involved.  Then I have a plan and I will be carrying it in my purse.  I need to get my letter printed before tomorrow.  I hope she doesn't overreact and she takes my word for it that I'm not a danger to myself right now and certainly don't plan to be.  Still, I'm preparing myself for the idea that this may be my last day.
