it just hurtsHey if you're reading this I'm a 15 y/o male being homeschooled in my sophomore year

TLDR at the bottom 

Ok here we go 
(sorry its gonna be long and I ramble alot)
(I also dont care about grammar so yah sorry)

I have 3 younger siblings 13 11 and 8
(needed later)

So I've never been to close to my father he was 55 when I was born and had already had 8 kids before me so he doesnt give a shit he never did anything with us and sometimes he would hit me, so I've never been to close to him but I still looked up to him

But my real pain started when I was 9, I went to a schooling thing called CC and I had a few people I trusted there until they showed their true nature, the day my grandpa die my mother who helped with CC got me and said something happened I know what it was my grandpa had been battling cancer so I started balling my eyes out and my "friends" instead of comforting me in my moment of need saw it as weakness and that's when they started to emotionally and physically hurt me,

Oh yah and my youngest sibling wanted to be held so I didnt get a hug from my mom the day my grandpa died and I still havent forgiven her

the next time I saw my "trusted friends" they started to teach me to believe I was worthless , unattractive(I still feel this way) and shit like that they started to hit me they eventually got me to cut myself(which I havent stopped) and I trusted them and they were my only friends so I didn't leave them I stayed with that for three years before trying to off myself and after that I tought and realized I didn't need them and I just let the hate boil inside me to a point I stalked the one who started it and planned to kill him and only didn't because I couldnt get ahold of a firearm like I planned, on not proud of this but its part of my life but it will never go away,

in 2019 my cousin reached out to me and said he wanted to play videogames which then turned into him inviting me to a group movie which is where I met my now girlfriend and when I looked into her eyes ...i ...I just felt safe like no one could hurt me when she was around and that I could be myself(now I know she had the same feeling)

after that my cousin suggested that we watch the star wars series at my house and said he'd be bringing a friend and it was her and it was the second time she had met me she cuddled upto my side and ...i just didnt understand why she would because in her past relationship she was raped over a period of 6 months ....so I dont understand how she would want to do that when we had just met 

and after that the movies at my house kept happening and we went to the movies as a group and then we went to homecoming as a group with my cousin and his girlfriend and my now girlfriend and at this point we hadnt told eachother how we felt about eachother 

The day after the dance she told me that she really liked me and that she wanted to date me (neither of us what sex just someone to comfort us at hard times)and a month after that ahe said she wanted to spend her life with me .....and I want that because I love her and she makes me feel safe ....but I know I wont be able to provide a comfortable life for her and its making me stressed because I want a life with her but if my schooling keeps going at the rate its at I won't get a diploma and without that I can barely support myself and I want to be physically more for her

 and its making my depression worse and i just want the pain to go away
 ....but I know that my girlfriend and two like brothers will off themselves if I do ...and I dont want that for them .....but it hurts and I want it to stop

I ...I just don't know what to do

TLDR;
I had people I trusted treat me like shit for 3 years and I planned fucked up shit and now that I have friends and a girlfriend I feel that I don't deserve them and that I'm not enough for her and never will be and its making me stressed with my school and I just want the pain go go away but I know that my girlfriend and 2 like brothers would follow me in death and I dont want the people I love the most to off themselves because of me
