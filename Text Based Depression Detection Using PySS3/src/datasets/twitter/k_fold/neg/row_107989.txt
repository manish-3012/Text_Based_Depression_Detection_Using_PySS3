finally getting around to preparationsAs many of you know, planning a suicide is a lonely task. I don't have anyone to share this with, and I guess I'll dump it on you. 

I've picked my day, my 27th birthday. I will be joining the 27 club. I have 65 days to get everything in order. Today I have started my letters. I'm finding it rather difficult properly express my love so 65 days to draft isn't bad. I have the place, I have the method, once I have these letters written all I will have to worry about is the small details.
