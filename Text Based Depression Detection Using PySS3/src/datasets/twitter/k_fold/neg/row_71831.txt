Shouldn't have gone to collegeMy first semester of college just ended, and I failed half of my classes and got average grades everywhere else despite working hard. I've never failed classes before. Worse I've got until now were D's, and I at least got to make up for those. I want to blame it on uncooperative group members, individual assignments being too much of the final grade, or even just COVID for a variety of reasons. I desperately want to blame something else because I was getting A's in AP dual-credit classes *for the same college* a year ago without any issues. But I know this is all my fault anyway.
I just don't see how I'm gonna recover from these failed classes. The only way I can recover is if my next semester is damn near perfect, but I tried so hard this semester and it got me nowhere. I want to get my GPA back up because I'll lose all my scholarships and go into serious debt if I don't. Even then, the college screwed out of half of my scholarship money already.
A bunch of other things have driven me to suicidal thoughts, but this is what's finally caused me to hurt myself. Not that it helped, or that I could even do that right. A shitty knife in the hands of a weak idiot like me could never draw blood.
I know that there really isn't much for me to do but to grit my teeth and work like hell until my miserable life ends as God intends or whatever, but I'm entirely out of motivation. After Christmas is over, the only thing that's stopping me from going through with it is my family finding my body, and that can be prevented if I just crash my car somewhere.
I know it's selfish of me, but what is there within me to redeem? I've already done well to tarnish whatever good there was, and I'd rather worsen everyone's lives through my death than with my sorry life
