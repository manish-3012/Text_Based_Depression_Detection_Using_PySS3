I friend is having suicide thoughtsI was talking with a friend of mine, who was my girlfriend for a short time (I think that might matter?) and when saying goodbye I said: "Do nothing stupid", because she seemed unstable.

Then she smiled and accepted that she was thinking on suicide, and she said she was glad I caught that, but that I had nothing to worry about.

Still I contacted the Prevention department of her university, who deal with drugs, depression, anorexia and that sort of stuff, and told them about my friend, and she went to the university's psychologist.

Now what I want to know is: what else can I do?, what kind of things should I say?, I don't know.
