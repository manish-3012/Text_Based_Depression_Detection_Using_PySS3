I guess I'd been set up to fail in life. Goodbye, world. I hope you're happier without me.As title says. I'm stuck right now. My SO and I had been having a fight these past two days. It's about how we work our finances out and how I've not been helpful at all. I don't have a full-time office job because I can't have a full-time office job. I nearly got terminated, and resigned instead just to avoid the shame. I fucked up big-time in my previous workplace. Fed up with the way they deal with our time on our workdesks, I manipulated the time system. But that's not the only reason I quit--I really have a lot.

That said, I don't know if I could still be employed again. Right now, I'm a freelance recruiter and manager of ESL teachers. I don't earn much because operations just started recently--I only have five teachers, and I'm paid per class done. Money runs out quickly. SO had been frustrated with me lately with regards to that.

Life would surely have been better had I not gone through shit under my nMom and eDad. If I had not focused on what's wrong with my life then, with my nMom's help, maybe I'd have a great-paying supervisory job now. Hell, at least something bearable will do.

But unfortunately, I don't think I can still be employed again.     

 

 

 

Maybe this is how my life was meant to be. Perhaps I would be better off dead than start again in a call center or a similar toxic work environment. Perhaps I have no right to be a photographer. In that case, goodbye, everyone and my broken dreams. Someone hand me a gun with exactly one bullet chambered, please?         

 

 

Edit: I spent a hell of a time trying to get another job prior to my resignation, but they just don't want to hire me at all. Didn't help that I didn't want to write shit and boring articles anymore by then.
