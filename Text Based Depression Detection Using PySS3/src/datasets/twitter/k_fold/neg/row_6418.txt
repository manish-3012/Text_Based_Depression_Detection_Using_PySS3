The first step in getting out of depressive thoughtsGuys, Im here using reddit everyday for a while and I notice something really important.
Every since I joined much depressive communities, and I noticed that every time I started to look up those communities I would get worst and worst cause they actually dont help u in anything.
Its a good way to express urself by publishing something u really want to say, but seeing all posts of them just makes u more and more sad. Thats no healthy!
So, we all agree that we are here because we dont like our own life and stuff, so I suggest u to leave the group. 
I REALLY hope u guys can do it, can follow your dreams, can live ur life, can fit in society. I REALLY hope, but thats up on u now. People can aways help u, but rn, its just u
Kisses and hugs
I love all of u
