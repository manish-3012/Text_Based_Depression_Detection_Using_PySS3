I don't want to die, I just want to not live.The first time I thought about suicide I was in the fifth grade. I was standing on a sidewalk at a crosswalk and thought about how easy it was to just step in front of a car.

The next times were in middle school.

The next was four years ago in eleventh grade.

After that was early 2017 when everything went to shit.

And then there's now, the last few months.

Some days they're really strong, some days they're just lingers in the back of my mind. But they're always there.

When I'm driving I think about how easy is to just pull into the opposite lane. But then I remember that would hurt someone else and I *almost* don't care.

Whenever I'm a few floors up, the ground looks nice and hard.

Knives look very sharp and excellent for cutting wrists.

When walking by someone on a dark sidewalk, I almost expect them to lunge at me.

I've wondered what kinds of pills I could get over the counter to overdose on.

It just seems *soooooo* very easy.

Yet I KNOW it's not right.

I don't WANT to die. I WANT to see the world, I want to meet someone and have a life and have friends and do things and maybe have my own family and have a cool job and get some fulfilling hobbies. I WANT to be happy.

And I certainly don't want to hurt anyone. My family would be so mad and confused and disappointed and upset and I don't think I could ever do that to them.

But I want to stop drowning.

And it just looks so easy to stop swimming.
