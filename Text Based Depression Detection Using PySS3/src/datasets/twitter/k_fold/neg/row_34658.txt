My brain gave up and now my body is going tooI have struggled with codependency and love addiction all of my life. I have some early childhood trauma that is way darker than my memory is even allowing me to know about. There is something inherently dark and evil living inside of me and I have spent years trying to chase this evil force out of my body with therapy, emdr, 12 step groups, a pastor...I need an exorcist or to just die because I am the host of an evil parasite. I canâ€™t live with the pain anymore. Iâ€™m tired. My friends have disappeared and so has family. I reached out to people today but no one believed me or understood. Iâ€™m either going to take this bottle of Benadryl or drive myself to the hosptial. I wasnâ€™t supposed to be born, my parents told me. I am an unloved person. Every time I try to get help it is seen as attention seeking. Even this is attention seeking. I feel my body shutting down and giving up too. I wish I could smoke weed but Iâ€™m not allowed to. I need to be drugged into unconsciousness so I do not have to experience this pain anymore. I keep saying this too shall pass and pray and ask my higher power for help but the feeling stays and the evil continues to live inside of me and that alone is going to kill me. My body is shutting down.
