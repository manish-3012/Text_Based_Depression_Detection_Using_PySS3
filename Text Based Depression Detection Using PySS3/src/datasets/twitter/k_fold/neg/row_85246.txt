Just a bad daySo today has been a stressful day, almost couldn't pay rent, found out my mother has tumors in her lungs and they might be cancerous, my significant other got extremely pissed off at me because I forgot today was our anniversary because of the other stuff that piled on, ended up breaking my phone and now being constantly told by my other half that life would be better without me in it since all I do is make them miserable. I just want to end it all but because I have kids I don't want them to live with it. I am just at a loss.

Edit: forgot to add my spouse thinks I am cheating on them while I am just crying.
