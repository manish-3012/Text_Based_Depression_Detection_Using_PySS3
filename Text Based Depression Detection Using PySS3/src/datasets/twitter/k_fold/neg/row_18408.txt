fine, I'll post my ownI don't know. I just am so tired of the world. I will start this by stating I am vegan, and I have a hard time that so many people (most of the world) doesn't care about animals (the way I do). Then I go and watch videos on watchpeopledie and it's fucking depressing. Humans aren't even nice to each other. So basically the whole world is killing and I can't do a thing about it. Also, I'll add that it's hard when your family and friends also don't feel the same way about animals. I know this sounds stupid probably, but it is really hard for me. SO tired of trudging along...
