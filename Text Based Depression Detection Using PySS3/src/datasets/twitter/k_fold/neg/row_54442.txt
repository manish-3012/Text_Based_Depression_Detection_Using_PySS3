Always thinking about it?Whenever something slightly bad happens my first thought is ending my life. I always think about it and my life really isnâ€™t worth living so whenever something bad happens I think â€œmay as well end it now, end the suffering.â€ I really feel like a waste of space and a waste of resources. If anyone else had the resources I was given in life they could have made something with themselves and done so much but here I am not even wanting to live. 

It just seems life is dragging me through it and Iâ€™m enduring this constant torture. I find almost nothing exciting and nothing makes me happy. I almost feel no emotion throughout the day and if I do itâ€™s not for long. 

I donâ€™t even want to go out with people anymore, why go out just to be miserable? Iâ€™d rather be miserable in my own house by myself. My friends hit me up but thereâ€™s no point in going with them I can be happy for a while with them but it runs out. I canâ€™t manage to stay with them for too long because my sadness comes back and I just canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself. So when this happens I just stop talking, stop engaging with them and it makes me feel terrible so I try to go home quickly. I think about what their reactions would be and if any of them have a clue. Iâ€™m sure some do because of the cuts on my arm. 

I always think about it but I canâ€™t/wonâ€™t do it. The pain that my death would bring to my family and how it would disgrace their image is too much for me. 
I never want my family to hear  â€œis that ____ didnâ€™t her brother/son kill them selves?â€ 

I like to think I wonâ€™t do it because of my family but maybe itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m too much of a fucking pussy to just do it.
