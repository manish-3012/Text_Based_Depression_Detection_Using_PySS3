i want to so badlyi am worried. i am drowning in a sea of fear and guilt and worry and regret. i was fine until i checked my grades a few minutes ago. not even two weeks into the 4th quarter and i already have an f. since there isnt much done in the last quarter of the year the most i can bring it up is maybe a letter grade and if i have a d i am going to get my ass kicked to the point of me probably getting disowned anyway so why would they care if i offed myself now.

its not even that. i broke up with my SO last night and he went on a suicidal tangent talking about how he was never going to find anyone else and how no one would care if he was gone. i talked him out of it for now but i still worry that i just took someone out.

i dont even know if im being rational or irrational right now. ive been having random suicidal outbursts for a while. out of the blue an intense feeling of wanting to end it just pops up. its like you just want out. out. out. turn off the light. just a release. i just want gone. my thoughts have been getting progressively unhealthier as well. before it was just thinking of downing a bottle of pills and risk organ damage or just puking it out. bleeding out never seems to work and im too much of a pussy to wait that long. so i thought about my dads gun. i have an old antique bb gun in the room with me that wont do anything, but it does remind me of that option. 

i dont think anyone would care if i was gone. sure some might be a bit sad. but when it comes to my family, they only ever tell me how lazy i am. im just too damn apathetic to get off my ass and do anything. im lazy and ill be an invalid all my life. nothing motivates me so they would care i was gone one less person creating a mess in the house. my brothers going off to college in a few months so he could just forget that way. my friends might be sad but theyd get over it and at this point i dont fucking care i wont even be here so oh well.

i just want out.
