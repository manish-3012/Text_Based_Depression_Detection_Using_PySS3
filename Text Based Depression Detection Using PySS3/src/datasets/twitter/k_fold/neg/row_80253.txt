I'm gonna try againI posted something about a month back about this but allow me to recap. I'm 14 and my life is continuously falling into a downwards spiral. Part of me thinks that ending it is the best way out but another part of me knows countless people would fake sympathy just to get attention. That's the only thing that's holding me back. I guess I kinda just want someone to vent to without holding back at all. So I might kill myself tonight I might not.
