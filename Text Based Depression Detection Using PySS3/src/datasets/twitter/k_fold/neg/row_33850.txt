I changed medications, had mania, took Ativan and said some crazy stuff, now my only friends donâ€™t seem to want to talk to me, I donâ€™t blame them.I feel like crying while hitting my head against a brick wall. I donâ€™t even get left on seen anymore, I donâ€™t get left on seen anymore, people just donâ€™t even look at the messages. Before everyone liked me and wanted to meet up and now Iâ€™ve just messed it up and have no one. I know I deserve it but it just hurts quite a lot. Iâ€™m cutting but i can barely feel it anymore. I donâ€™t even feel real right now. Although I realize they already hated me before this, I notice the little things they do. People just be a bit nice to me (not really actually, I could write an essay explaining why) because they think Iâ€™ll kill myself if they arenâ€™t, and theyâ€™re right. Theyâ€™re not nice anymore.
