I'm sick of everything.I'm a bisexual 14 year old atheist, and Ive been in a tough spot for a while. I've been suicidal since 6th grade, and I've become super hateful of like everything. I feel like a bitter awful misanthrope. I can't get along with people. My closest friend has told me that he hates me, and I only have one friend left. I'm super awkward so I feel like I can't talk to anyone about anything. I can't even be myself around my parents, because they are homophobic generic conservative Christians (I'm in the Bible Belt). I have to pretend to be a republican Jesus loving straight dude, and I end up bottling everything up. I'm being sent to a Christian school, and I have to pretend there as well. I'm sick of living this way, and I can't leave my school or get away from the people there. I feel like the only option is to end it all, but I don't want to because I want to exist. I can't stand the idea of dying now without having done anything. Please help.
