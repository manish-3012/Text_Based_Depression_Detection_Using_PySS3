The beginning of the end.So at about 4 am this morning me and my GF of four months broke up. She was everything to me. She said it was just a break and that she still loves me. She then went on to block me on a few social medias. She was the one who stopped me from killing myself a few months back. Many times. But now, I feel like i've failed the only person i care about. The only person i can love. And it feels like crap. I've failed too many people. I'm all cried out and now i believe it is the appropriate time to remove the problem. Myself.
