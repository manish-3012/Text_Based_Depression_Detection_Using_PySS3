Is it still possible to jump off of any point of the Golden Gate Bridge?I know theyâ€™re working on constructing barriers to prevent this, but I read somewhere it wonâ€™t be done until 2020. Iâ€™ve decided this is how I want to die. It seems easiest (even though itâ€™s a long drive for me). I love San Francisco, and I was told I was conceived there. It would be a full circle thing for me. 

I donâ€™t think anything can fix my problems. Iâ€™ve been trying my whole life. Nothing can fix me; the way I view myself and the world. Iâ€™ve been sick to my stomach for days and just got a headache from writing my suicide note in my head. I need to end this pain now because itâ€™s just getting worse.
