My son sent me a suicidal text. I am so scared.He is 23 and currently lives at home and works full time.

I don't want to be here anymore and by here I mean alive I can't find anything or anyone to hold on to. I don't have any friends I don't have a life I'm not good at anything. I lose everyone and everything. I really just want to end it all and I don't see any problems with that. I'm losing my mind I can't take it. I don't know what to do I don't even want to do anything other then jump into traffic. I'm a pathetic waste of space and I don't see anything else.
