TuesdayIâ€™m going on break starting after school on Tuesday, for thanksgiving. Iâ€™m thinking about doing it after school. I donâ€™t know why the urge is suddenly so strong. But I know that Iâ€™m tired, very tired. I know that Iâ€™m good at hurting people. And Iâ€™ve never brought any joy to anyoneâ€™s life. My family is struggling financially, and without me theyâ€™ll be better off. I know some people will be upset, but theyâ€™ll all be better off in the long run. Iâ€™m ready to give up, and the thought use to scare me. Recently though itâ€™s been very appealing. I planned on doing it after graduation, but it seems like itâ€™d be better to do it sooner. I donâ€™t want to suffer any longer. Although if hell exists Iâ€™ll be suffering for an eternity. But at least then I deserve it more.
