Dropped out, dropped out, dropped out, dropped out, dropped outI don't know what to do anymore.       
I've dropped out of uni once, now it's almost like I'm at it again.        
I want to figure out a major that I like but it seems like I can't.       
Everything I'm interested in is considered a "useless degree" by today's society.       
I hate how living works in the modern era.            
I don't understand why things are like this.          
I've been such a disappointment to my parents, I've already done so well in high school after all. Things just fell apart after that.        
I don't want to work without a degree either, I'm interested in doing college but I don't know what to pursue. Time is ticking. I don't know what to do.            
There are no community colleges here, taking a major means that'll become your major for life, switching majors here will result in taking the usual 4-year bachelor's program all over again.         
I hate this. I'm not fit for adulthood in today's society. I've been such a letdown, and that's a fact.
