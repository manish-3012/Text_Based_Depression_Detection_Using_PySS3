I've never wanted to live.I suffer from clinical depression and social anxiety and although I'm only 15, I've been struggling with depression for quite a long time. I have never shared what I felt with anyone, the only reason I'm writing this is that English isn't my first language and it just doesn't feel that serious I guess. 

I'm a fucking loser and piece of shit, I have literally no friends at all, I go out once a week to see my therapist, actually he's the only person I feel like I can talk to. My parents care so much about me and it makes me even more sad because my depression is affecting them what I can see everyday. I've been hating myself for literally everything, for how I interact with people, for how I look, how I think. 

I also don't know how to talk to people, I have been diagnosed with social anxiety. I can't take phone calls, eat when I'm around other people, drink, talk, think. It made me stay at home most of the time, pretty much all of the time. I only go out when I need to see my therapist. 

The last time I was at school and actually talked to someone was in December, I haven't spoken to anyone except my parents, psychiatrist and therapist. 
I've never had many friends, I've barely had any, but now I'm completely alone and lost. I don't know what to write, I just feel like I need to get it out of me, I feel so fucking miserable and lost and fucking alone, I wish I had anyone to talk to. I've had lessons at my home since February which I kinda liked but now I have to go back to school and I know I wouldn't be able to do it. I'm killing myself tonight, I've planned everything. I just wanted someone to know, anyone. 
I'm really sorry if I made many mistakes but I had no time to check for typos and grammar and everything. I wish I was a native speaker so I would've written it way better but whatever. 
Bye.
