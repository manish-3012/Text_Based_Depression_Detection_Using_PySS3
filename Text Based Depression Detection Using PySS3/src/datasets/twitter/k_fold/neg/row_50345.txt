Does it get any better?I'm only 15 and I think about killing myself nearly everyday, I wouldn't act on it, but I just cant fucking take how much my dad seems to hate me and my family, how I fear for my life if me and my boyfriend were to walk down the street holding hands, how the US is taking COVID, When does it get better? My family is in shambles, our house is a disaster, we fight everyday. Why can't I just leave? Why?
