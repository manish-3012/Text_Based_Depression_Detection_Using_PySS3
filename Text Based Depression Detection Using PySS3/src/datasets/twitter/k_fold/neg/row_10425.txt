I donâ€™t even want to live anymore.Of course everything had to come crashing down tonight. I feel so fucking hopeless. Itâ€™s like the universe mocking me at the fact I barely have friends. Fuck you. I wanted you out of my life for good. Youâ€™re anything but a friend. I never wanted to hear from you ever again.

I seriously want to kill myself. This day has been fucking awful. I feel awful. I want to do so many stupid things. But I donâ€™t even fucking care. If nobody else does, why should I? I just want to do it. I want to get it over with. I want to be gone. Iâ€™ve had enough.

Iâ€™ve. Had. Enough.

Hereâ€™s to hoping for the best, that I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow.
