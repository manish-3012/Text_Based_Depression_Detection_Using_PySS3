Nothing is changingAll of my problems come from living at home. I don't want to live here anymore. I have been trying over the past year to leave and I just can't. Either I am not emotionally ready to leave and deal with the yelling, screaming and harassment from my parents because I want to live on my own, or when I am ready, there are no good listings. 

I hate my life so much and I see how much I am standing still and my friends have already done so much and I have done nothing. I have never traveled, went to a party, or have done anything remotely fun. All I do is stay home because I'm not allowed to do anything. I feel like a husk and I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm sick of trying and I'm even more sick of failing. I just want to end this suffering. 

I tried calling my local crisis line but I was on hold for an hour and 15 minutes with no answer. I don't care anymore I just want to end it.
