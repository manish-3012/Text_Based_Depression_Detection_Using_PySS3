I just want it to endI can't deal with this stress anymore. This pressure. School is building up way too much. There's too much at once and I can't handle it no matter how much I plan, no matter how hard I try. I feel like such a failure because I keep fucking up in everything I do. My grades keep falling and falling no matter how much I do my best. The time to apply to grad school is getting closer and closer and no one is going to want me with my grades at this rate. I'm gonna end up graduating 2 years late if I keep this up. I can't afford to keep retaking classes, I don't have the money. I can't switch paths, I love my major and it's much too late to change now, anyway. I'm never going to get a job in my field, no one will want me. This is exactly how it was years ago in high school when I attempted last time. Too much stress and pressure and nothing I can do about it except try to power through.

And the voices. GOD, the VOICES. Some encouraging, some indifferent, but some just constantly telling me I'm not good enough. LEAVE ME ALONE! But when they do, I get lonely and panic because I'm all alone in the world. No one understands, not completely; not like they do. But some of them scare me. Make me afraid of what they, what *I*, might do. I refuse to be the monster they tell me I am.

I deserve a chance at life but it's all going to shit anyway. Maybe I should do it. Maybe I'd be protecting everyone. God, it's just too much. I just want it to end.
