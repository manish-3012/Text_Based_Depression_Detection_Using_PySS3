I honestly donâ€™t know if I can do this anymoreThis is a throwaway account of course. 

Iâ€™ve had severe depression for a long time now. Tomorrowâ€™s my birthday, Iâ€™m turning 25. I was supposed to go out with my sister and her fiancÃ© tonight and hang out, but they bailed. So this is going to be the 4th year in a row Iâ€™ve sat home and done nothing because no one cares about it. 

I honestly donâ€™t have any friends. I donâ€™t have anything going for me in life. I lost my job a few months back, moved back in with my parents, got kicked out because I have a job thatâ€™s supposed to start next month that Iâ€™m just waiting for. Iâ€™ve been staying in hotels/my car because I donâ€™t know what else to do, 

I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d make it past 23, I didnâ€™t plan on it. Than 24. And this year is worse than any before. 

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen but I just had to get this out. Been a long time lurker in this sub and tried to help from my regular account but itâ€™s jus too much for me now and I donâ€™t know if I can do it anymore
