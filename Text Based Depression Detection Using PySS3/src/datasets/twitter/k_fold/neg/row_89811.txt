Rant (TW?: Mentally // Emotionally Abusive Relationships)I don't know how to begin and I'm sorry if this post will be all over the place but here we go:

&amp;nbsp;

I have been feeling dead inside lately. So much has happened which contributed to this. First, my mother literally said I am a failure and I have so many problems that she has to deal with. Wow, I'm sorry that I'm a depressed fuck that has been trying. I try everything to make her happy but she always wants more. I do AP in school, I am a concurrent student, I go to VoTech... I try my absolute best academically and it's killing me. All the A+'s are nothing to her. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've also been having relationship problems. I feel like the whole relationship is just mentally exhausting. I was doing so fine before the relationship but I've already relapsed into my old ways. I started taking more than my prescribed dosage. I don't do this often but what happened throughout the relationship - especially the past week - has literally messed me up. I haven't been able to take care of my well-being since the beginning of the relationship... They want to be so touchy on dates and when I tell them I possibly can't go on a date, they get so whiny and suicidal. They're dealing with depression so I've been trying my best to make them happy too...

&amp;nbsp;

I guess I want to shed some light... I planned to kill myself on this very day, Christmas Eve, a few years ago. However, I'm still here. It does get better but there will be ups and downs. I finally told myself I am young and have much to live for even though the view may be cloudy now. However, I have taken steps towards my future... I've decided I want to double/triple major. I specifically want to major in Computer Science, Criminology, and Forensic Science.

&amp;nbsp;

I hope everyone has a well Eve and Day! If you don't celebrate, I hope you are well anyways. Once again, I'm sorry this post is all over the place but I need to let things off my chest.
