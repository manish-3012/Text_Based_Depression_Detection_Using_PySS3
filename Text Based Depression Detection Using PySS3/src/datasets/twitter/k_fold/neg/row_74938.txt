Overcoming depression and low self esteemI have made progress, I can say I am a lot better than what I was a couple of months ago. But there is still times where I feel low. And during those times I want to revert to my old ways so bad, and just spend hours comparing myself, thinking of reasons why I am not worthy of anything. And because I actually believed these things for so long, it became the way I saw myself all the time. Like today I found out that one of my friends that I liked In the past, got a girlfriend. Instead of being happy, I felt sad. It made me feel lonely and my brain instantly wanted to go back to those bad thoughts. Itâ€™s just hard changing the way I think. I am trying though but I am scared I will go back to who I was.
