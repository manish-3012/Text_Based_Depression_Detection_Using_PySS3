How many resources do I need to waste before they realize I just need to die?Hell. I don't even want to die, but at this point I've gone through the system so many times and wasted so many peoples time and ruined the days of so many people that I'm starting to think it's pointless. It's been 20 years. I've successfully conditioned myself to believe I deserve literally fucking nothing good in my life, and every time I do anything that makes me comfortable my body starts ringing alarm bells to remind me I don't deserve to forget how much of a waste of flesh I am.

Everything's my fault, you know? It's not even something I say for pity anymore. I can't justifiably find a way to convince myself something might not be my fault, because as long as I'm in any way involved, I can be blamed for it in one way or another. If someone hurts me and I tell them, they'll feel guilty. They'll blame me for hurting them like that, eventually. It's my fault. It's my fault, and I deserve every bit of pain I'm in.

But I'm tired. I'm so, so, so incredibly tired and even though I know the only way for the people around me to be happy is for me to suffer in silence, I'm still tired. I need to die. That's the only way things can ever be okay for any of us; me, or my friends.

It's always been hard but at some point you realize it's always going to pass. It's always going to get easier with time because time will heal all wounds; but if my existence in itself is the issue, that's an entirely different thing altogether. I can't separate from myself. Time won't make me not exist.

... Unless I die, anyway.
