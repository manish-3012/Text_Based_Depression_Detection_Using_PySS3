I canâ€™t find a reason to liveIâ€™m just going to hop into the first reason I donâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m really short for my age. Iâ€™m 13 and either 4 foot 9 or 4 foot 10, and I hate the shape of my body. I have so much excess fat that just is always there. Iâ€™m constantly sucking in to look decent and I wear shirts that hang a little lose so that people donâ€™t know how fat I look. The weird thing is, Iâ€™m low on the BMI scale. If Iâ€™m 4 foot 10, Iâ€™m actually underweight. If Iâ€™m any shorter, Iâ€™m just barely not underweight. I havenâ€™t been eating because I hate my body shape, but that has made me underweight so Iâ€™m just confused now. Iâ€™m pretty sure it just means I have 0 muscle, which I wouldnâ€™t be shocked by. I want to fix it, but then I proceed to do absolutely nothing to do so. I hate it. I hate how I do that. I hate my body shape. I hate everything about me.  I have a few good friends, but I donâ€™t know if they really like me. Just everything thatâ€™s been happening in my life feels like too much. I donâ€™t know why. Iâ€™ve made some posts on this account so no one I know finds out the details of this stuff, but it all feels like just too much. I donâ€™t even know why. So many people have it so much worse, and Iâ€™m over here in a good house wanting to kill myself. It makes me realize Iâ€™m a bad person, but I want to kill myself more because of that. We all end up dying, and boom thereâ€™s nothing. Why stay then? Thereâ€™s no point. Weâ€™ll all end up the same. Dead. Gone. I just hate everything about living, and especially I hate myself. I just canâ€™t find a reason to live, yet Iâ€™m still here somehow. I donâ€™t know why, or why I broke down after an attempt on my life. Maybe I donâ€™t want my friends to kill themselves. They probably wouldnâ€™t though. I doubt they even care about me. They just keep me around because they need to for some reason. What am I doing? Iâ€™m literally on an app typing out shit to a bunch of random people in hopes to not feel as bad. This is wasting my limited time existing. Iâ€™m going to just curl up in a ball, hate myself, and hopefully kill myself in the end. Who knows, maybe there is something after death. In which case, Iâ€™ll see maybe 1 of you in hell.
