Has anyone here committed themselves voluntarily, without the urging of family or friends?How did you know it was time? I've been struggling for a while now, and I just don't know when enough is enough, because I always think it will pass, but I don't want to find out what happens if it doesn't and I actually end up hurting myself or something like that. It's gotten to the point where some days I barely have the strength to pull the wheel so that I don't hit the concrete barrier on my drive home from work. Like, actual physical strength. I can't grip the wheel, and it's hard to turn. I don't understand it. 

What did you do beforehand, for work, family, friends, if at all? I just want to make sure no one has any extra burden to handle because I decided to go in. I own some firearms, but I don't want to have them taken by family, or police. They are a hobby, and source of passion and joy to use and stuff. I wouldn't use them on myself. I would never want to make someone see that. I don't want them to suffer, just because I ended mine.
