It is too easy to buy a gun in my stateThe only restriction my state has is that in order to carry a handgun in public you must have a license. If I really wanted to which I have been debating the past day or two I found out all I have to do is wait a few days for my background check to clear (which it will) and I can buy a handgun since I'm over 21. But hell I could have done this with a shotgun a few years ago since as long as you are over 18 you can just fucking buy one of those. I have never googled buying a gun before but I have been pretty low the past week and it makes me scared how easy this is. I'm afraid that I might just buy one and kill myself with it. I'm just fucking tired of trying so hard to be alive.
