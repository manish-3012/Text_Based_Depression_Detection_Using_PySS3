It's cold, heavy, and been at my temple for 20 minutes now.I've pump faked the trigger.
The coldness feels good on my sweaty head.
My mother would flip.
You just had to do it huh.
I feel your mocking me, is this what you want?

Tears roll down my cheek as my jaw tenses up.
Leaving me in a state of blankness in this fucking room.
Its so quiet.
I'm so done.
