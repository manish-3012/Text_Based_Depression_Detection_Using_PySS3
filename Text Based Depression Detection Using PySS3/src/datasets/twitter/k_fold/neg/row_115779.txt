Idk if this is allowed hereI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m allowed to say this here but I just had to get this off my chest. I felt pretty sad and and couldnâ€™t sleep, itâ€™s 6 am and I tied a noose around my neck and then proceeded to tie it to the tree in my backyard. I climbed to the nearest branch which wouldâ€™ve done me for good. But I decided today was not the day while climbing down and took the noose off as I breathed in the fresh cold air.
