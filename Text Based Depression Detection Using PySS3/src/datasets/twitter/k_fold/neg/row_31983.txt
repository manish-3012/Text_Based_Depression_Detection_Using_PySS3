I began cutting againI haven't self-harmed in over 2 years. Last night, I broke that and made cuts all across my chest and upper arms. I continued today after lying in bed for 18 hours with barely any sleep. My only friend left is the half empty bottle of southern comfort next to me, which will probably be gone by tonight. I haven't been to classes at university for the past 2 weeks, I doubt I'll go into work tomorrow. I just want to crawl into a corner, take all the painkillers in my drawer and swallow them down with a lot of booze. My existence means nothing after she left me. She meant the world to me, and then she put our relationship on hold about a month ago. Last week, I found out she's currently sleeping with her friend and I still have no idea what's going on between us. I'm stuck in limbo. I've asked her so many times if we'll be getting back together. She either just ignores me or replies back saying that she's already told me, despite the fact she hasn't. I miss her so much and I just want everything to be the way it was a year ago. At the rate I'm declining, I'll probably be dead by the end of the week. I have nothing left for me. I'm stuck in a pit of despair and no amount of antidepressants or therapy is going to get me out of this. I hate myself and how I couldn't keep her.
