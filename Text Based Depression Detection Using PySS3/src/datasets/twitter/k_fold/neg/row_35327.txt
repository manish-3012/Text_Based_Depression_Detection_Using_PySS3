If I go to an er what will happen to meI'm really nervous about asking for help. If I go to an er will I be committed to a psych ward involuntary? I'm really really scared of what people would think of me if I asked for help or told them what's going on. I've been thinking about suicide for months and I know how to do basically every method. I have a note. All that I need to do now is go through with it. I'm considering taking a sleeping pill on a train track or crashing my car since they are pretty straight forward. What would happen if I dialed 911 and told them of my intent/suicidal ideations?
