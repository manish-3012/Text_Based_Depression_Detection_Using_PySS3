I need help2 months ago, the girl I love left me, and since then everything has slowly deteriorated and my life is in pieces. I have nothing to keep me motivated, no reason to wake up in the morning. All my friends are distant and won't return my calls or messages, and nobody is ever here when I need them. I'm an outcast. While I was once a fairly popular person with many friends, I now hang out at school by myself, because I have no one to be with. Life is beginning to feel like a chore that I can never finish, and my mind constantly drifts to thoughts of death and suicide. On 3 different occasions, I've planned out my suicide and almost carried it through, however I stopped due to fear of failure. I feel invisible, almost as if no one would even notice that I had committed suicide. Maybe if I did it, people would finally understand how hard this is. She would see how much pain she's caused, and then they'd all beg for another chance to see me. A chance they were never willing to take while I was around. I need a reason to keep going. Something other than "it gets better" or "You'll meet new people". Because that isn't enough to stop me. I want to know it's worth it to put the knife down if I ever try again. I want to have hope, that maybe I'll get through it and be the old me again.
