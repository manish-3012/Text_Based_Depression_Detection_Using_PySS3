How do you deal with everything in this sub?This is a serious question and not a random complaint or rant. I myself suffer from extreme mental health issues and I have to keep walls up so inherently I came here by accident but good god. Even though I didn't mean to come here, and as much as I support this place I've never seen such a concentrated window into the atrocities humans create. One of my own issues is misanthropy and I spend all my time reading on the internet so I by no means am naive to what humans have done but this has floored me. How do you people deal with it?
