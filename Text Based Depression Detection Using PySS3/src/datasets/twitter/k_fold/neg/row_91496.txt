I can't do it anymore...I'm a single Mother of an amazing little boy. I recently went through a terrible break up with my sons Dad. He was an extreme alcoholic...he cheated on me, mentally and physical abused me yet I stayed in the relationship til I couldn't do it anymore. 
I've recently moved out on my own became independent and the relationship with my ex (now sober) has changed, as friends.
Things were okay but the sad thought of killing myself always lingered. Today has been the final straw...my ex recently admitted to having random sex again with strangers. To me this is hits so hard to home...I just feel like giving up.
I try to be a good person, good parent and I just never win. I just want to follow through with my plan...but my son's birthday is tomorrow.
Why am I so selfish in these thoughts?
