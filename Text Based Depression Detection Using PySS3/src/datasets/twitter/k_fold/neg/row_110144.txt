Does anyone else wish they were in a medically-induced coma?Often when I'm suicidal I really just want to stop feeling anything for awhile, and death is so permanent, not to mention risky to achieve; if doctors offered to let people chill out for a couple weeks, unconscious, just a rest from having to fucking think and endure whatever they're enduring.

I know there are risks like bed sores and you require care &amp; a feeding tube or whatever but it's better than being fucking dead. When you wake up things won't have changed much but at least you got a vacation.

DAE envy people in comas...
