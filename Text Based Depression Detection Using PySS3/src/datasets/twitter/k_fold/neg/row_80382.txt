I donâ€™t really know what else to doMaybe I just want to vent before I get start killing myself. Things just arenâ€™t getting better and life has been playing around with me with bad luck. Now my life has just fallen rock bottom. I really want to kill myself and venting doesnâ€™t help because no one will respond to me. I canâ€™t blame them I just stress them out with my suicidal ideations. I think it would be better if I wasnâ€™t alive. Even as I type this I feel like whoever will reply to this saying â€œI wonâ€™t leaveâ€ will just leave like everyone else. I genuinely think unless I say I want to kill myself there is no such thing as someone willing to put time into me. Whenever I brush off the idea of being ignored they always leave. But when I get worried that someone I care about ignores me it ironically pushes them away. Iâ€™m a worried mess and I feel like Iâ€™d be doing everyone a favor if I was gone
