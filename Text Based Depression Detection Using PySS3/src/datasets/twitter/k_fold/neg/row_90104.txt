fat ugly loserI've never really been good at talking to people, especially women. I don't know how I'm ever going to meet the one.  Or anyone. I've always have been single, due to the fact that I'm a fat ugly pathetic loser. I can't talk to people online because they lose interest quickly. An old friend told me to try tinder. Every match I got was either them trying to fuck with me, I would say hi and they don't respond, or they would unmatch me because, well I'm not sure. They always send a message then unmatch me but I can't see the conversation anymore after that. All I want is to have someone to love and care for. So I don't feel lonley. So I'm not bored with life. So I can have someone to spoil and make her smile. Someone to make me happy. But it's never going to happen. I accept the fact that I'm going to die alone but at the same time I keep beating myself up over it. I've tried to talk to hotlines through text, they all refer me to some online shit. People just don't wanna deal with depressive people. That's just it. It doesn't help that I'm a huge fat guy. 5' 11, 300 pounds. I don't know what's stopping me from just buying a gun and shooting myself straight through the skull. I have a job and can easily get one. If I did end up doing it, it'd probably a joke among my friends. They'll say something like, "Remember when Jonathan killed himself?" And laugh about it. Maybe I'm just waiting for fanime. But, last fanime wasn't all that great either.. I'm just blabbering on at this point...thanks for reading.
