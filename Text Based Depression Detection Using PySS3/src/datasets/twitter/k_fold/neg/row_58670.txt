experiencing no joyim eating. im showering. im applying for unemployment. im cleaning the cat box. im taking out the trash. im being performatively happy for my friends and loved ones. not because i have any desire to, but because doing these things will make other people happy, and it will make me appear like i'm functioning, which is what's expected of me and usually makes other people happy. everything is a slog. i get no joy out of it. it is fake.

i cling to escapism fantasies as the real world is rough and unforgiving. i desire something unrealistic. i wish i could be a child that wasn't abused. i wish i could be a happy child forever. nothing other than being that child makes me experience satisfaction or joy. i'm just not willing to put in the hard work of being an adult. it's easier to escape.

im going to stop eating. maybe my body that ive been dragging for so long will either start making food desirable again so i can keep it alive or i'll start starving and either go to the hospital or die. maybe im selfish. i dont care anymore.

im tired of existing. i can only do things for other people and i'm tired of it. i can't escape. it's better that i stop existing.
