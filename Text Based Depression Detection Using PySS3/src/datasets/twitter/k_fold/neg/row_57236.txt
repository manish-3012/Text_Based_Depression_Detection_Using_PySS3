people FINALLY got fed up with meI really am just a worthless good for nothing. Even my partner thinks so. Everybody thinks so. They're fed  up with me doing nothing, being a lazy fuck. I wish I'd just off myself already so I'd stop burdening them. I wish I did it before I ruined their image of me, at least, so when I die they'd think of me fondly. But I ruin everything. I'm such a bad person, for the love of god, why do I never do right?
