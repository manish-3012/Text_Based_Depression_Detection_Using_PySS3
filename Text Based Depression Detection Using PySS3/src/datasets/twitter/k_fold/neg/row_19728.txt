I don't know what I'm doingHey SW. I don't have any real skills or abilities, I'm fat, I flunked out of college, I don't have any real friends, and my family doesn't care. Whenever I mention all of this, they make it about themselves. I really think I'm done. Tomorrow, I'm going to the top of a parking garage. I'm going to watch the sunrise, and then I'm going to make a decision on what to do. I don't even know why I'm making this post, but I guess I need help.
