I picked a date a while back, but now I'm really wishing it was today.A couple years ago, I picked a date to kill myself. It was the only way I could stop thinking about it long enough to be functional. For longer than I expected, it worked.

But here I am. I can't stop thinking about how miserable and pathetic I am. A loser and a disappointment. Bad friend, bad son, bad brother, bad person. I can't sleep. I don't take care of myself anymore. I can't work. Hell, I can barely even think about anything else.  I think I overestimated myself picking a date in over a decade. I really wish it was today because I think I'm done. I did my best, even if it was pathetic. Sorry.
