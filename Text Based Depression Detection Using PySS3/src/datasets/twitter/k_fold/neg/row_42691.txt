Why even write this.I apologize to you. Yes, you. 

No. *Not* the generic fourth-wall-breaking "you" but **You**. Looking at your phone now, or uncomfortably sat reading this, still..reading.

I am here because I know this isn't real, this is a throwaway account, and if anyone finds it I'll swear blind I haven't a clue. Because I cannot stand the thought of anyone k... Please don't continue reading this. I fucking hate this. This phone, this place, her, there, everything. She's been depressed longer than I have.. or has she? I know this feeling like the back of my eyelids, mum had it and it slipped from her to me like a hand-me-down sweater. A warm, comfortable, squeeze-the-lungs-so-tight-they-implode-kind-of fleece that only an overbearing and manipulative mother could give you.

"I". What a way to start a sentence. Who the fuck cares. 

I love life. I know I do, you know you do too. I'm smart, you're intelligent, and together we are humanity. You are the mind behind the technology in my hand, you are the nameless fisherman braving 40ft waves in the fridgid black night to earn a wage while I sleep, you are the girl on the bus. the one with pretty hair or a nice smile. You. You are too good to be reading this shite.

It's going to be over soon. They'll find the notes - this. This. This reddit account. A testament to my bleak half hearted, cowardly (but always internal) cries for help. She cuts herself. Well, she's told me she stopped, but I saw the marks that time and she had to tell me she lied. She's ashamed to be alive and I'm too broken to help her.

She's lying in bed right now reading and I'm writing a reddit post about ...well. fuck cares.

I wouldn't still be reading either.
