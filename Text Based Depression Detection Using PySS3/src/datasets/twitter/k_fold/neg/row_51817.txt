Always been a lurker on here. But I just lost my queue on a suicide hotline. So I came here to word vomit. Sorry to bother.Is there anyone whoâ€™s here solely because youâ€™re afraid of failing suicide and being looked at as that failed attempt afterwards? Or because youâ€™ll then be in a hospital? Because you might be even more miserable after, from brain damage? I feel like thatâ€™s what holds me back.
