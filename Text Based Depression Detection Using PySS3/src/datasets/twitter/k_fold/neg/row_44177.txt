I have no one and I am good at nothingI am transgender and a university student. I have no friends. Whenever I try to make friends, it never lasts long because I am an incredibly toxic person. I don't fit in with any particular crowd, not even with other queers. I don't have any semblance of personality. I wish I were normal. I don't even have a full set of fingers due to birth defects. And because of related medical issues I'm very likely to die from cancer before I turn 50. There's nothing I'm particularly good at but I like math. But even so I'll never be able to make a career out of it because my handwriting isn't good enough, I lost points on my last problem set because of it. I don't know LaTex well enough to type solutions nor do I have time to learn it. But what's the point if I'm not even very good at it? I'll never get into a good grad school and no one would want to hire me.
I am incredibly unpleasant to look at and have no personality, but earlier this weekend I was at a gay night club and a cute person danced with me and kissed me and we are going out for coffee later but it's not going to last long if at all because she'll realise these things about me and how toxic I am. I'm still confused by why she seemed into me, and I don't want her to waste her time.
I used to have something to distract me, I used to have a place I felt like I belonged, but because of my incompetence I am not very welcome in that community anymore. And even so, everyone in that community is better off without me. Everyone's lives would be better if I wasn't around. The only thing I have left to grasp onto is math, and I'm already starting to slip. What's the point if even I have nothing more to live for?
