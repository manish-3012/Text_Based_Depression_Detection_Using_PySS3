I've failed what I wanted to achieve in my life. I don't see the point in just waiting to die when I could get the materials to end it all in a week max.I've failed to achieve my life's dream. There is absolutely no chance anymore. I'm someone who **NEVER EVER** gives up, but I don't see the point anymore. 

It's impossible to achieve my life's goal, just like it's impossible to touch the sun. I don't have any other goals in mind.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't see the point in being a biological machine just waiting to die. 

The worst part is that it's my fault. I've got myself in this situation. I can't blame anybody. 

**Why should I carry on living**? 

I feel like I'm fading out of existence. Like I'm irrelevant. 

Edit: I'm not going to mention my goals because people will start to figure out who I am.
