I think I'm going insane.My Mom hoards.  I go to school, so I cant move out.  But her clutter makes it hard to focus on anything.  I remember I went into the kitchen, and saw the clutter and filth on the counter.  Then and there, my breathing and heartrate went erratic and I fell to the floor.  My vision almost appeared altered, and everything around me looked stretched out to tower over me.  I spend my nights pacing until 2 or 3 in the morning.  I feel like I'm going insane.  Please help me.
