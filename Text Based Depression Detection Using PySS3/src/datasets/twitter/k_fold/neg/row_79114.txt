Here againI post here every other week. This time I'm serious. I have enough sleeping pills. Both my parents and ex boyfriend said that I ruined everything. And maybe I have. I've ruined every good thing in life. My ex has blocked me from everything so he doesn't have to witness what he's done to me. So now my death is going to be on his hands. But I'm scared. Again. I'm scared of how much this is going to hurt. My ex kicked me out so now I haven't been to class in two weeks, haven't seen my amazing therapist i
n two weeks and my pet rats in two weeks. He's broken every promise he's made. And now I'm just tired. I'm sad and defeated. He has won. He's killing me now. So he wins. He gets what he wants.

Edit: I just got out of the hospital and the new meds they put me on literally make me throw up 3+ times a day with sweaty shakes. Nothing is improving. Its all only getting worse.
