Someone pls hear my out.Iâ€™m not suicidal let me just say that first. but I feel as if Iâ€™m alone asf. Like I just donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about anything. Like even typing this out is making me feel some type of way. Idk I just want to be able to express myself in front of people and not feel like Iâ€™m being judged and shit. I usually smoke weed to help me cope but I donâ€™t wanna do that anymore. Iâ€™m not asking for sympathy or anything I really just want to get some things out. Idk I canâ€™t even finish this shit without crying. My life man. Itâ€™s crazy. I just need to be stronger mentally I guess idk. I just turned 20 a few days ago and not too many people actually remembered. Itâ€™s not really the fact that a lot of people didnâ€™t tell me happy birthday itâ€™s more of the fact that people that I expected to tell me didnâ€™t. At the same time I feel like I have no one at all to talk to about my problems. Like I know I have people there for me but I donâ€™t even know how I would approach them and tell them everything thatâ€™s going on in my head. I love My parents and I know they do care but itâ€™s nearly impossible for me to talk to them. Itâ€™s like my moms wants me to be this spiritual person and my father wants me to be this thug and I donâ€™t wanna do either of those things I just wanna be me man. When It comes to talking to them about my problems My mom would just show me something out the Bible and my dad isnâ€™t someone I can just talk to about my problems. I really feel like I cant be myself around them. I honestly feel like Iâ€™m being judged by everyone. I dropped out of school right before the pandemic hit and now I just feel stuck in life. I spent all of 2020 smoking to get over the fact that me and my ex broke up. I loved tf out of her btw. Idk if any of this is making sense or if anyone is even gonna read this whole thing but this is the first time that ive been able to talk(type) out my problems. I hate feeling alone man. And I HATE the fact that I canâ€™t be myself in front of my parents. They judge me so much and itâ€™s like they donâ€™t even realize it. At this point itâ€™s not even funny anymore. Idk what to do. I have more to say but Idk I just need to get myself right man.
