Might end my life tonightIâ€™m not going to type my story or why I want to kill myself because nobody really reads my posts on this subreddit. So Iâ€™m just going to say that thinking about committing suicide gives me a strange feeling. A feeling that tells me that I was meant for this kind of death ever since I was born. Thatâ€™s the best I can describe it as. I might even write a little suicide note to explain why I did what I did. 

Other than that... I feel fine that Iâ€™m going end my life like this. It seems right. Even, if I were to fail, Iâ€™ll just try again another day.
