Very vivid ideationI'm a bipolar male 24 in a few weeks. Currently going through vivid images of commiting suicide in different ways, like as vivid as real life. Its painful because I only think about the thought of failing to succeed, I used to think about loved ones but that doesnt mean anything to me anymore. Something stops me and i dont know if is that i care deep down or that I'm just too much if a pussy to go forward
