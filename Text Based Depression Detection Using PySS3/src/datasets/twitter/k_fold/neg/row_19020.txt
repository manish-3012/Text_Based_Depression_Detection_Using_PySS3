Advice for coping with impulses?Hi, SW.

So... I'm bipolar, depressed or mixed most of the time.  Thoughts are racing again after months of being slowed by depression.  The problem is, my "bleh, I wish I was dead" is turning into impulses to actually do something when the opportunity arises.  Like, a bus is coming down the road as I'm walking on the sidewalk, and for a second I feel like maybe just stepping in front of it.  The feeling doesn't pass until the opportunity (bus) does.  

I'm a little scared, so clearly some part of me still wants to live.  And if I'm going to do it, I'm going to plan it out, tie up loose ends, find a home for my cat -- I don't want to just do it on a whim.

I'm supposed to hear back next week about making an appointment with a psychiatrist, but in the meantime, does anyone have advice on dealing with these impulses?  I suppose I could isolate myself from opportunities that might prompt it, but I've also been trying to not be a complete shut-in and I live right on a busy street, so going out = encountering opportunities.

**tl;dr**: How can I cope with impulses to step in front of a truck every time one drives by?
