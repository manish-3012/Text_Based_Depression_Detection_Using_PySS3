Just tired of lifeI just graduated college and Iâ€™ve not found a job, and Iâ€™m currently living at home while working at my dadâ€™s deli. The payâ€™s shit and I want to move out, but Iâ€™ve been spending money on weed and porn to numb myself because my whole life Iâ€™ve been lonely and always felt like Iâ€™ve never belonged anywhere and it hurts a lot. Iâ€™m not sure how to get over this hump but it really sucks. Recently, I started talking to this girl but I was an idiot and caused it to fall thru because I, apparently, have attachment issues (I jumped the gun QUITE a bit- told her Iâ€™d go to graduate school near where sheâ€™s going) and Iâ€™ve been kicking my own ass ever since cuz it was going well. Iâ€™ve been feeling seriously cold ever since that happened and everyoneâ€™s been telling me that Iâ€™ve been being kind of a dick, which I realize... I just canâ€™t help it. I feel like such a huge fuck up because Iâ€™ve just been sitting at home with my history degree up my ass, not doing anything with myself and idk where to start because I donâ€™t know what I want to do with myself. I feel useless and I feel like I wanna hop off this ride a little bit early.
