Attempt ExperienceHas anyone ever made an attempt (or known the story of someone who has) and are willing to talk about? Like, what was going on in your life, what happened the day of, and what happened after? I'm not trying to encourage anyone to share exact  details of their methods. I'm just wondering if my experience is similar to others.
