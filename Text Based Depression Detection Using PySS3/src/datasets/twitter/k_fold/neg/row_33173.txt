Treatment options during pandemicI contacted a suicide hotline in May, and they suggested I go for a run the next morning.


I finally contacted two actual treatment centers on Thursday and Friday.  I said "no," when they asked if I was actively suicidal because I don't want to get committed involuntarily, and I'm more just vaguely kind of suicidal most of the time with some upticks into "beginning to consider it more actively," territory."

It seems like I may not be able to be seen at either place, or may have to wait weeks.

I do not want to be in-patient anywhere, be held involuntarily or abuse system.

I'm really tired and confused and desperate, and would just like help of some kind.  

Is there something I can tell the intake people to get prioritized without being  a horrible human being or getting myself trapped somewhere?
