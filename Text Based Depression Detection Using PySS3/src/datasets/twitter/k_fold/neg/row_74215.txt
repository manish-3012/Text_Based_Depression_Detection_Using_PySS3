[UPDATE] Two nights ago I posted here about taking a handful of pills and dying.I made a post a couple nights ago about listening to God Only Knows and then taking my own life via overdose. My ex SO called the police and well here I am today, alive. I was angry she did that. But if she didn't I probably would be dead right now. It's very creepy but they knew about me contemplating jumping off a bridge (something no one knew on here but reddit) which is kind of scary but either way I'm here.

I am broken and miserable. I feel as though my life is an empty vessel and that death is my only true destiny. Yet, I am determined to give life another shot. Just take it day by day. The main reason I post this is because I got several comments and messages from you guys worried for my safety. I even suspect someone might have told the police about my previous episode with the bridge. This place is very warm and welcoming. The amount of people who came to help this lost internet stranger is incredible. I owe it to you guys, my ex SO, my mother and most of all myself to try and live what left I have of my life. If anyone is considering or going through these suicidal urges, just talk to someone anyone. Even strangers on reddit. Thank you guys. Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.
