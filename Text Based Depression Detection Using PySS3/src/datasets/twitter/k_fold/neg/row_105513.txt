unemployed 38 living w parents / no careerI went to grad school 4 yrs ago in a big city, I was in my early thirties in the program.  It was a disaster.  I wasn't feeling too good around that time, had yrs of restorative dental work that was giving me problems.  Also found out I had a type of cancer the last week of school.  Went back to the parents thinking I would try to get the dental work fixed while I figure out the cancer situation and then go back to the city for a job. I was 100 k in debt, barely anything in the bank account, parents would not help.  Spent 3 years in depression in their guest room, friends stopped calling, lost all contact with people.  I really couldn't tell you what I did in those three years.  

This year finally had some money to fix a few teeth that were fd up from crowns I had gotten back when I was 28.  Basically fixing decade old dental work which had massive decay under them for years.  Somehow I am sure the cancer is linked to this.

My parents are old and uninterested, havenâ€™t the best childhood or history w them.  It hurt  they donâ€™t care much about what is happening w me, they see me struggling but don't think much of it.  They don't  talk about the cancer diagnoses which makes it easier for me to ignore it.

In the last month I got one interview but they rejected me based off lack of experience.  I feel out of it, I get the feeling I weird ppl out when I meet them and I feel like I am too old for my career.  Donâ€™t know if I will ever have a career, ppl my age are in their senior positions at most practices now.  

All my network in the city I used to work in is gone, I had a friend group there but had a massive fall out w one person in particular who is friends with everyone.  Before I left she got pissed off and starting telling most of the group I was mentally ill/ bi polar.  Ive tried to reach out to some of them bc we are all in the same profession but don't hear back.  

Feel like the situation is just going to get worse the more time passes.  The only money I make is online which is not enough, I have 150 K debt to figure out.  My career never started.  I have no friends, ppl my age have families and  kids by now.  I keep telling myself somehow it will get better but it is hard to believe.  I feel really disillusioned and out of it, most times I don't feel like a real person.  

I had someone call me in for a meeting , not interview, just to get to know me, had the most awkward meeting of my life.  I can't gauge whether ppl are offended or genuinely not interested in me anymore, it's all a blur of nothing.
