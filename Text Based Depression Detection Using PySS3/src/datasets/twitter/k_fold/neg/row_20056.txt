Little reason to continue livingI don't really know what else to say other than I can't really see much point in continuing on with my life. It's already basically reached it's high point so it's all downhill from here. I won't leave many people sad when I die because there are few people out that care about me, at my funeral there'll be a maximum of like 4 people, and I can't imagine them staying sad at my death for very long.

All the things I used to do for fun no longer entertain me and they certainly don't give me any motivation to go on. I don't have anything to look forward too to keep me going either, so why continue to live?
