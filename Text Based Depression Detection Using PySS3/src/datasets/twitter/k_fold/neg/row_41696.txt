post suicidali canâ€™t help but notice how tone deaf ppl r.... like iâ€™m Trying my hardest to recover and ur just being uncomfortable and calling me weird. the way they feel more comfortable filling up my place than saving it

after a period of introspection iâ€™ve realized my only solace is self destruction and mindless fake deep entertainment. but im down with frying my brain. beats the shit out of living with my thoughts everyday. 

thatâ€™s it. i like living. i love having my life together, exercising control over it. itâ€™s just my thoughts, my emotions. i canâ€™t deal with them.  i need a distraction But i cant focus in the first place

so vodka , B movies, and lana del rey it is
