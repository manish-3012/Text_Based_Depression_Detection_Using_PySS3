Im basically doneLove is not for me I freak out when trying to put a condom on which only confused and made her feel rejected and it wasnâ€™t my intention at all it was all me . I love this girl and I want her but my body just is broken and a mess. And so I feel all I deserve is death nothing I feel will bring me peace or comfort in this quiet. I hate every thread and grain that makes up my soul. Iâ€™m definitely worth nothing more than dust. This life I live these loves I have that all I do is ruin terrible.
