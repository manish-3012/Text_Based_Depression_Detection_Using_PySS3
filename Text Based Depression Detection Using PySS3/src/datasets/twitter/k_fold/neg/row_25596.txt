I've had no friends for the entirety of my life, and now my most beloved family member, my mom, has turned on me.When I was smaller, about 10 years old I had a lot of friends, but that changed when I turned 15 and had to move to another school.
At this time I was getting bullied daily, not physically though, only psychically. This really tore me down as I felt as I couldn't speak to anyone in my life about it.
I bit my tongue and fought through the school. Now I'm all grown up, have no friends due to the bullying and I have a nine to five job.
I thought about moving to a new country for a fresh start, and so I did. I live in Sweden now but yet I have a hard time making friends and I really feel unwanted.
My mom turned on me because she didn't understand why I moved and I felt I couldn't tell her..

Like, is this even worth it? The hassle all my life for having a shitty 9 to 5 job, family members turning on me and no friends, so I basically work, eat, sleep, repeat...

Yes, I've been to many psychologists but they only feel sorry for me, giving me empathy which I feel I don't need. I need a way, a way out of hell, but it feels as if hell is inescapable.
