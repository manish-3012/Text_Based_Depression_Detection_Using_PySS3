Is anyone awake ? Even just to chat about nothing would help me right now.Hey is anyone awake? I live in Canada and am coming down from a bender because it helped me mask my anxiety and depression but now everything is flooding in and Iâ€™m alone watching tv in my room. Would be nice to have someone to chat with and itâ€™s 4am here so I canâ€™t really reach out to anyone without waking them up and fucking up their day on a Tuesday. I havenâ€™t slept since Saturday night for 4 hours.
