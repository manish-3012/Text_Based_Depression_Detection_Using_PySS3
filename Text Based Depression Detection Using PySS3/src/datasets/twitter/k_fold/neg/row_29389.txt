Intrusive thoughtsThereâ€™s such sick shit going through my mind lately, I vividly imagine what my friend would of looked like hanging from his belt, I keep getting nightmares my girlfriend is going to leave me and I wake up with terror in my body. I canâ€™t kill my self because I already have survivors guilt, but I keep making a stupid plan of my depressed girlfriend and I slitting each others throats to end this incessant suffering that is life, weâ€™d die together at least. I cut my arm a little and I felt pretty good for a couple hours but the depression is back, and now I just feel guilty for doing it. I just hope the 30 melatonin tablets I took will let me sleep a little for once.
