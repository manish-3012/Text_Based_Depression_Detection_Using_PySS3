FUCK MY LIFE, I'M A FUCKING DISGRACE! LIFE HAS KICKED ME IN THE FACE FOR TOO LONG AND I WANT FUCKING DIE!I'm done with life, just when I thought I was getting better with my anti-depressants 200mg and CBT, life has decided to kick me in the face once again and beat me up while I'm down! 

I'm fucking done with life, I want to hang myself in my bedroom and say fuck the world and wait for someone to see my body rot as it hangs from the coat hanger in my room. I don't want anyone to remember me or even think of me in the future because I'm a worthless piece of shit who does not deserve love from anyone! 

I'm an ugly piece of shit with no future! I'm ready to take my life today! 

Here is my last words before I go....

Mum, Dad, and my sweet little brother, I'm sorry that you have to see my body hanging in my room, lifeless and worthless, I'm sorry that our trips to Walt Disney World will feel like magical because I won't be there and it will feel more sober. I hope that the magic of Disney on your next trip can help you through the fact that I'm gone. 

To my friends at university, I'm sorry that you'll have to carry with the project without me, I hope you do well because you would have failed with me in the group. 

To my friends that I have met at the Download Festival since 2013, I'm sorry that I won't there next year to see Guns N Roses headline the main stage, nor will I get to see A7X and Ozzy headline. I'm sorry, but I hope you have a cold Jack Daniels for me next year when you go to Donington Park. 

Again, I'm done with life, goodbye!
