In a bad spot hereAs long as there is smokes and alcohol, I am okay I think. I am looking for a job to be a dishwasher or at CVS/Walgreens cashier, it's been four days since I've applied. Unemployment is literally killing me. I dont have purpose to continue, I am very paranoid, anxious and depressed. I am very scared of the psych ward and hospitals, I cannot see myself taking pills to ease my suffering. My siblings are on medication/therapy and I refuse to be like them...

I smashed my hard drives for my computer because I was going to kill myself but I never had the means and clearly not the will. So I have no computer, just this phone here. I can only use it when it's charged, and cant use it when it's charging. I am 20k in debt, everything little thing takes work, I have very noticeable eye shadows. My father gives my sister money to food shop but they never buy for me. My sister, brother and mother are very crazy and I think they are out to get me. My father obviously regrets having children, and he is upset with me of course.

I am scared and sad everyday. I am trying to get away but I must live here since I have no where else to go until I fix my debt/life but even then I don't ever see myself being happy. 

I wanted to move out West, hike, take care of my health, have an apartment, play games, love the West but here I am wanting to cease to exist. 

I had sex with escorts and I have never felt so dirty in my life. Every little thing is a God damn challenge.
