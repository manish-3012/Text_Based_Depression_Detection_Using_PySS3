To find the peace in death that I never could in lifeIt seems the worst thing you can be in life is different. I am different. I am Fat. I have always been and possibly will always be. The whys and wherefores are not relevant; in fact to a large extent I don't know the basis for it. I am not looking to assign blame, for it is I who am in the end responsible. No one put a gun to my head and forced me to do it.
People are cruel. Kids are cruel. I had a living hell as a child.. I had no friends.. I was a social outcast, told day after day by my peers what a horrible fat person I was. It was a team sport, one person would start and then others would join in. And people you thought were your friends. . ... They would have to make a choice, be with the "in" crowd or be with you. And you know what, it has an effect. Sooner or later, when you hear the same thing over and over again, it sinks in and has a direct bearing on your development. What did those years do to me? They insulated me. I built a wall around myself that I would not let anyone through. While that my be the right thing to do to protect oneself, it also has the negative effect that not only does it not let anyone it, it doesn't let you out. I live in a perpetual state of "blah" with no hope or expectation that it will change. The weight is starting to take its toll on my health. I have Diabetes, but I don't care. I am in Denial. Every day, I lose more sensation in my extremities and I don't know why I don't care. I have never tried to kill myself, but that is what it seems I am doing. I have thought about doing just that a lot over the years, but it seems I focus on it more now.
I have even lost interest in sex, though even when I was trying to find someone oral was my only choice, because intercourse was not physically possible with my size. Being Fat. It is the worst thing that you can do in this life. You are treated like a second class citizen, and the worst part about it is it is accepted by people. You are denied seating in restaurants because you cannot fit into their booths; you are looked at and laughed at, publicly when you try to jam yourself into a seat. People whisper and point. People who would never openly laugh and giggle at someone in a wheelchair feel perfectly justified in laughing at me. While it would not be socially acceptable to taunt a black person and call them names, in fact there are statutes to protect people, it seems perfectly acceptable to taunt people who are fat. Members of other minority groups. . . Blacks, Hispanics, Gays. . . at least have the option it seems to fall back within their own group for help and support among "their own". Fat people do not. Fat people it seems only want to be with thin people. It is fine to discriminate against fat people. Unfortunately, people for the most part are cruel, and I don't hold out any great hope that will change in my lifetime, if ever.
I have decided that my life is no longer worth continuing. Emotional pain can be just as devastating as physical pain, in fact sometimes it can be worse. I have taken all I can take, and just cannot go on. If someone reads this, hopefully sometime in the future you will think of it when you see someone like me, and maybe the next person will not have to go through what I do. I guess the only thing that kept me going was my job. I loved my job, and had it for just over 10 years. But about 13 months ago I lost it and haven't had any success finding a new one since then.
I think the only reason I haven't yet done it would be the effect it would have on the members of my family. But even that doesn't seem enough anymore to offset the pain and loneliness I feel inside. They say you have to be able to love yourself to let someone else love you.. I hate myself, actively hate who I am. And I hope with my suicide I can find the peace in death that I could never find in this life.
