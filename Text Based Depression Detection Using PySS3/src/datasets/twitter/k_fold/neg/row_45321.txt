Extremely Depressed..I've been self-medicating for the past few years and it's come to the point where the drugs don't even bring me above baseline. I am always depressed and when I don't self-medicate I get suicidal (and sometimes even when I do). I am addicted to hydrocodone and its bad. I recently went through a divorce (8 months ago). She was my true love and I don't go an hour without thinking about her. I can't let go. I want to get clean and be happy, but I don't think that will ever happen. I really just want to die. She left me for someone else and honestly she was a horrible person, but I loved her. I'm stuck here alone and I can barely get the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. I hide it well, but I am a wreck. I need to get off the drugs, and I know it. I'm just afraid I'll never feel happy again.
