Think about killing myself a lot but never want to do it.Im a senior now and with everything going on in school and college being close I feel like everything is kind of compounding. Ever since junior year ive been working on bettering myself and trying to go out more, talk to more people, eating better, and just trying to be a better person. Though for some reason even with these improvements Ive felt worse than I ever have. Like, i have more friends and Im going out every weekend and I have a great friend group but I constantly feel like its not enough, even with a good mindset and its just been getting worse. Last week I was home just crying and wanting to just kill myself. Ive finally told a really close friends but half the time i just make joke about killing myself and hoping that someone will notice or say something, but when they do i just say im fine anyways. I just dont get why i cant be happy. Like im happy but im not content. College applications are stressful, i have an alchoholic mother who is almost never supportive, shes fun but I feel like at times she projects her own insecurities onto me and it kind of hurts. I understand she had her problems and i dont resent her for it but it still affects. My dad is nice but for some reason i resent him even more. Hes a great dad but i kind of resent him for some reason. I just dont get it. ANd its not depression.. like im not depressed. But sometimes i feel like i want help but when its there in front of me i just deny it. I dont even know anymore but i feel like even with my efforts to become a better person, when the good things come i just deny. I have horrible self esteem and even though its gotten much much better i still fall into these little holes sometimes. I just dont get why i cant appreciate what i have. Nothings ever enough and i think its just because i thrive on negativity. I just want to be content is all.
