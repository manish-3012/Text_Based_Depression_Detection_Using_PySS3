My noteFor the past 2 years Iâ€™ve suffered from depression and anxiety. 

I told no one.

At first I thought I was just sad and stressed over the classes I took and the seemingly lack of time I had left in college. But I soon realized and that that sadness I felt wouldnâ€™t go away. It slowly grew stronger as time went on and by the time I realized what I actually had, the depression consumed me. I was struggling just to feel a genuine happiness. That didnâ€™t mean I stopped smiling. I smiled all the time, but I wasnâ€™t truly happy. 
I slowly thought I was getting better last summer. I spent more time in the sun and going out with my friends and I felt happier almost to a point where I thought I was going to be normal again. But at the same time I was tired and stressed from studying for the MCATs so the fun I had soon turned into guilt. Guilt from not studying hard enough or long enough. So to compensate for the guilt, I drank. A lot. I drank to drown out the emotions. For a while it worked. I would wake up feeling like a new day was ahead of me and I would continue to study. 

I started to notice my depression getting worse about 8 months ago. I just laid in bed and I never wanted to go out. I stayed at home and told my friends I was too tired or I didnâ€™t have money at the time so I couldnâ€™t go out. It got to a point where people started to notice so I started to go out every once in a while even though I didnâ€™t want to. 
Still, I told no one of the depression I was feeling.

As months passed, I noticed I developed bad anxiety and up until a couple months ago I would wake up in the middle of the night with panic attacks. My depression was no longer about the sadness that I felt, it was about all the insecurities I thought I could just bury. I was suddenly worried whether or not I was good enough for medical school, whether or not I had a future, or how I felt like a constant disappointment to my parents. 

Iâ€™ve tried a couple times in the past to kill myself but I never had the courage to do it. I kept thinking about how selfish that would be but I soon realized it wasnâ€™t selfish at all. This pain that Iâ€™m feeling was going to go away. How do I tell someone what Iâ€™m feeling when Iâ€™ve barely come to terms with it myself? My sorority fought to break the stigma of depression but still Iâ€™m struggling to let people in. 

Eventually I just became numb. I no longer worried about what would happen to me or anyone else. The pain was far to great to go through again and the numbness seemed like a happy medium. 

I donâ€™t blame anyone. I still love every single person in my life. I just donâ€™t love myself enough to keep fighting anymore.
