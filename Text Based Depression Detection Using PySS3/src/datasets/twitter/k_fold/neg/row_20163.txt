How do i hang myselfI want to know what it will take, experiences from anyone who has tried it (if youre comfortable ofc), and any tips and things i should take note of. Will a ceiling fan be able to suppirt my weight? (Im slightly below 50kg) how do you tie a noose? Etc etc

Please dont tell me that things will be fine and what not. I may not even go through with this but i am planning for a time where i can do it.
