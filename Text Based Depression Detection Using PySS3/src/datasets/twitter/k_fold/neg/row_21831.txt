I have no clue what to sayI usually express myself through poems, photography, and music but I think this is goodbye. At least to whoever reads this. Iâ€™m 28 years old and schizophrenic and have been on medication and brought knives to my room since 3rd grade. Everybody wants the end of your life mean something but I donâ€™t think I get that.
