Need adviceHello everyone

I came to talk about my case here which I consider a great place to get good advice for my problem. After all, you know a lot about the internet

I have a friend, a best friend, or... I had. He is one of those friends that we tell everything without fear, he knows my secrets and I know his secrets. Our friendship is for 7 years. But I didn't know who he really was. One day, I saw a post of him going viral where he used my photo as a "meme" in his "shitposting" group ... well, I then discovered that he used me to generate jokes and content for the group he participates in. It is a group where people humiliate and make fun of others on the internet. It is a large group of incels and people with hatred.

I do not know what else to do. I am taking sleeping pills and I am very afraid of having my reputation destroyed, losing my job and being ashamed before my family. He has since blocked me on social media and I no longer have contact with him.

I need to study and work, but I can't do anything else. It destroyed me and I fear for the future, as well as being very disappointed.
