The suicide of others comforts meThat sounds terrible in retrospect, but let me explain.  Seeing posts about people going through with it or saying they will and then disappearing, it makes the idea easier for me.  I dunno, it's weird, but I guess it just makes me feel like the pool is bigger and I'll seem even smaller in comparison, and that people will care slightly less.  I'm tired.  I'm confused.  I'm lonely.  I wish I was just nothing.
