life just kinda sucks right nowscared of posting this due to some of my friends following me, but Iâ€™m terrified of reaching out to anyone specific since weâ€™re all going through some shit right now and I donâ€™t want to be a burden.

I donâ€™t even know how to put it into words. Life is just not treating me well and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m swamped with school work and I have no time to just live. Hobbies, watching movies or shows, socializing, etc, nothing. I donâ€™t have time for any of that. I go to sleep, I wake up and I give myself one hour to do what I want before I spend the rest of the day staring at a screen and cramping my hand by writing so much.

My family just gets worse and worse everyday. I live with my twin sister, my mom, and my grandparents. Every time I talk with my sister, she just insults me and calls it a â€œjokeâ€. Sheâ€™s mocked and bullied me throughout this time of quarantine and before that and I canâ€™t take it anymore. My grandparents, my sister, and my mom are always yelling at each other. Especially my grandma and my sister. Every night at dinner ends in a screaming match. My grandma has guilt tripped me a lot and Iâ€™ve started to be scared of my grandpa as he gets angry very easily and lashes out. My mom is the only person I can really talk to, and even with that I feel like a burden.

Iâ€™m trying to get an autism diagnosis as well, but it seems as if no one believes me. I told my therapist and sheâ€™s having me screened for social anxiety and autism, and my mom has said that Iâ€™ve â€œconvinced [myself] [Iâ€™m] autisticâ€. My sister has often use the r slur and autism as insults as well, and despite me telling her that she shouldnâ€™t she still does.

Not to mention the current politic state of America, and the pandemic that is still happening. Sometimes I wish I could contract it so I could die. People wonâ€™t wear masks or quarantine themselves, and all theyâ€™re doing is making this pandemic worse.

Iâ€™ve lost over ten pounds since Iâ€™ve started antidepressants. Iâ€™m never hungry and Iâ€™m never thirsty. I donâ€™t have the energy to take care of myself. I almost fainted in the shower a few days ago.

I just want to end it. I wish 5th grade me went through with their plan. I have no escape besides the internet, and I have no time to consume content I like. Iâ€™ve never wanted to kill myself so bad. In theory it would be so easy, but Iâ€™m too much of a coward to actually do it. Iâ€™m 15, turning 16 next February. I wonâ€™t be able to move out for another 2 years. Iâ€™m terrified of driving. I donâ€™t want to hurt the friends I have or my mom but it just hurts to live. I promised a friend of mine and my mom I wouldnâ€™t leave. I have possibly the most amazing and supportive partner ever and I would never want to hurt him.

I donâ€™t see myself graduating high school. I donâ€™t see myself going to college or growing old. I didnâ€™t even plan to make it this far in life but here I am and Iâ€™m suffering because of it.

I would tell my therapist about this but the last thing I want to do is be placed in a mental hospital/psych ward/whatever they put you in. I donâ€™t want my entire school knowing Iâ€™m suicidal. I donâ€™t want my family to hang it over my head. I donâ€™t want my old ex-friends from my old religious private school calling me selfish and sinful. I donâ€™t want my sister to use it against me in ever interaction we have. I would rather just kill myself than go through that.

Iâ€™m so tired. I want to leave this life so bad, and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m too scared to do it. 

People say â€œit gets betterâ€ or â€œif you canâ€™t live for yourself, life for someone elseâ€ and... I donâ€™t think it does, and I donâ€™t know if I can.

I just need a break.
