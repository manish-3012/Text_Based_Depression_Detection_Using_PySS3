Havent felt happiness in so long.Im 19 currently. And its been years since I enjoyed living. Life all the way from my middle school years through highschool up untill now just feel so unfulfilling. Im at a point where I think about suicide every day now. Idk if im diagnosed with depression or not but i really dont care. Even on my "good days"  i still think about suicide given how much of a loser I am. I also have the inability to enjoy things. Things i liked doing like playing video games and going to ammusment parks just feel bland to me. For the time being it takes away thoughts of suicide. But those things get very boring very fast and then im back to wondering why im even living. I dont look forward to anything in the future. Absolutely nothing. Im going to buy a gun just so i can have the freedom to kill myself in moments like now. Working out and eating right helped in the past. But now it does nothing for me. I still continue to do my workout routine because i used to be fat and as long as im still alive i never want to go back to that lifestyle. Good days for me are basically just flatline boring days and the bad days are filled with sadness and the urge to kill myself. Just posting here too see what people will say to this. If theres a solution to this then ill gladly listen to suggestions. But if im honest to myself i know that whatever anyone says will help me and im really just posting this because im just flatlined and bored with life and want to see what people say i guess as entertainment  because like i said i already know there is no solution to this sad boring life that i live. And i might as well just die because its not like ive ever felt happiness before so i will probably never find it at all.
