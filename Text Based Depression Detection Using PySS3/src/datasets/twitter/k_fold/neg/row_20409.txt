I was a monster. I hurt the person I loved. Can I really go on living?I typed up a message to send my ex of a year. Decided not to. Posted to a subreddit here.

&gt; This isn't a drunken text issued out at 3 am in the hopes of regaining your love or acquiring your sentiments--this is me breaking down as a human being, because I am so wracked with grief from what I've done to you. It's been a year since we dated. I have such a painfully short memory--I don't remember the good parts. But I certainly remember the bad parts. They were my fault. They were always my fault. I said mean things to you. I held my ego higher than my love for you, and I'm so sorry. I thought I deserved sex so much--I pressured you into doing things you didn't want to do, and I'm so sorry.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm a monster. I was a monster when I dated you, and I still am, but I am a monster that is so goddamn sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. I never wanted to damage your very being. I was younger--and stupid. So goddamn stupid. There's not enough stupids in the fucking world to describe myself.
&gt; 
&gt; I have descended from grace and landed within the land of the damned. I deserve it.
&gt; 
&gt; I have lost the will to want to live, and have lost shreds of sleep and happiness over the awful things I did to you. I deserve it.
&gt; 
&gt; I have caused so much pain and grief to you, that even an apology will never be enough. You will always hate me because I deserve it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to put a gun in my mouth and pull this trigger. 
&gt; 
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; 
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; 
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; 
&gt; Because I deserve it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Because I deserve it.**

I'm on the verge here. I want to do it. End it. Can't go on living like this. I am a monster.
