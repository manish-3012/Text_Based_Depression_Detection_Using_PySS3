Is suicide like euthanization?When a dog has cancer and is in horrible pain, and would be for the rest of its life, we euthanize it. So is suicide the same way? 
To be clear, I'm not personally suicidal at the moment, I'm lucky and was able to overcome my suicidal feelings, I know not everyone is that way though.
 Some people have depression to a degree to where they are in so much pain and will be for the foreseeable future where death is the only way to make it stop. What differentiates that from when dogs are in so much pain and we euthanize them? 
I want to understand this better, does anyone have any ideas as of how it is different and/or why suicide and euthanization are different?
