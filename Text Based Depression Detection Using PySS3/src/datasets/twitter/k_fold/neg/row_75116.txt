i want to kmsi hate doing anything, to the point where suicide looks like this golden escape plan if everything goes wrong
i act in a totally reckless way only to realize what ive done later and cry about it, but who cares? i can kill myself and boom. i cease to exist and so do all of my problems and ive been overeating daily. i dont look for help due to insecurity and financial issues 
i cry everyday in my bedroom wanting someone to come in and say "calm down, everythings alright!" but no one does. i know i need help but im so scared of ppl saying "oh, stop it, youre just doing this for attention!" or my parents ignoring, rejecting or mocking me, after all, who would take a 12 yr old seriously?
