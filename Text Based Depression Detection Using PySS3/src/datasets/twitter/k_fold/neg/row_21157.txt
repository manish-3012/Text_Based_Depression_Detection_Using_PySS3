Its never going to changeNothing changes. Everyone says it gets better but it just gets worse. I tried to kill myself 2 months ago, hoping it would trigger some sort of will to live. After I took the pills I was just relieved and calmly waited for the end. Stepmom called an ambulance and they did nothing. I was so dissapointed to learn I was gonna live. I know my family loves me and theyll miss me but theyll get over it. They tried to help. Everyone always tries to help. It doesnt work. No one can help. 
I dont have any friends left. Theyve all moved on. And now the only person who I still trusted said I was too much work. Im depressing him. He doesnt have any feelings for me anymore.
I havent been this lonely before. It burns inside me. I just dont want to be here anymore. 
It doesnt get better.
