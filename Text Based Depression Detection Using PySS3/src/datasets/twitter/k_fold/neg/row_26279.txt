I don't know what to do.There is some background to this but it's not really worth talking about it other than that i have to attend to quite a few appointments with different psychiatrists and psychologists and the like after 2 suicide attempts.
The point is though that i can't open up about it all no matter how much i want to. This isn't helped by the fact that i get often threatened to be taken into the local hospital because i am having a way to low weight for my height and getting told the psychiatrist is obliged to have get me into the hospital if i show signs of suicidal tendencies. So yeah, i feel like i am stuck. What people don't know is i tried a third time and the only reason i am alive is because i choose to for my own reasons. Suicide is an option that i could take when at any point things go downhill too much. I try to move on but i don't have the resources i need to get rid of these thoughts and the main reason is my own inability to open up for reasons that are unknown to me.
