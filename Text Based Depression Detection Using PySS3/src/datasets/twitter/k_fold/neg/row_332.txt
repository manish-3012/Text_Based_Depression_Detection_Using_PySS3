I'm going to kill myselfI've simply had enough. I'm done, I don't want to live anymore, the effort doesn't seem worth it to continue living. Ive already tried twice with no success a few years ago it got better for about 3 months after 6 years of depression and then it just got worse again. I'm just done. My 3 best friends are the only thing keeping me here but it takes too much effort getting out of bed and living life and after all these years trying to change things up changing some routines nothing worked, therapy didn't help, Nothing has and I kept hearing the same shit I knew didn't do anything, working out didn't help going for walks all that shit everyone who is depressed or suicidal hears from everyone, I've just about seen enough of this world and I hate it here.
