What should I do?Recently I've been having thoughts of suicide. I'm not sure if it's just my depression kicking in or what but I just imagine situations in where it would just be easier if it was over and I was gone. Life just keeps dragging me down and it seems like nothing is going my way. Grades are dropping, work life is getting worse, I'm not happy with myself. I just don't know who to talk to. I don't want my parents to think differently of me because of this, and same for my friends. I'm lost and just need some guidance. Who do I talk to when it is so hard to reach out? What do I do?
