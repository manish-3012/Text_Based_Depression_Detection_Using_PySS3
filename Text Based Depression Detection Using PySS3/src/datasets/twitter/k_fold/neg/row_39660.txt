I want to die, but Iâ€™m too worried about my CatI imagine killing myself in my room and since I have no life anyways, I hate the idea of my body rotting next to my cat.

Iâ€™m also worried about my parents cause they love me a lot and would be devastated when they find out about my death. Iâ€™ve already let them down so much, they deserve a better son.

So up til now I convinced myself that living this shit life and being me is the punishment for me, for taking so many of my blessings for granted and throwing all my life and opportunities away.

Everyday is a drag, I have failed in so many aspects of life itâ€™s hard to live with myself anymore. I feel sharp pain throughout my body, pure agony, itâ€™s the pain of being a failure and a loser.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the point of posting this here. Iâ€™m too scared to even kill myself. I will miss my cat my parents and a few friends and I will miss what my life could have been if I wasnt so lazy.

I just want to say that I love you all, I love this beautiful planet we live on. I just donâ€™t love myself and I donâ€™t love life. I am unable to find happiness in anything. 

Please end this pain I really am tired and annoyed. I wish I could restart life. Oh god what have I become, just let me go. Iâ€™m sorry! Iâ€™m not a bad person but Iâ€™m not great either. My life is not special. 

I just wanna die. I really do, I fantasize about getting run over. I donâ€™t care for physical pain because Iâ€™ve been hurting since forever now.
