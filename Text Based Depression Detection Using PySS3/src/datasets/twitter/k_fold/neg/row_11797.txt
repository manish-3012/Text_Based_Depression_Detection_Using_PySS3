I am drained, I am tired, I have nothing left.I have failed everyone, I have spat on every love given to me. I fail again and again, I am so tired. I wanted some peace in life, Some happiness, I wanted to rest. I've only fell further and further

I am so lonely, so tired. I am tired from crying so much, I am so so drained. What's the point anymore ?
