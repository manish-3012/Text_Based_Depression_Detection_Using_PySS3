im just going to continue living miserably. for my dad.Iâ€™m going to spare you most of the pretty sordid details. Much about wanting to die is, anyway, quite tedious business, which, for the most part, is self\-evident: you just really want to stop everything and be fucking done with all of it. It is a formidable bummer.

Iâ€™m sparing you all the grim, insignificant gewgaws because I have to spare myself of the agony, too, if Iâ€™m going to try and continue.

My dad arrived from Japan just last night. We had not seen each other in nine months, and I am hardly the same person he had left, misty\-eyed but willfully intrepid, just a year ago; I was still seeing this girl from UP I had met on Tinder (lmfao); I still read PhilStar editorials I barely understood every morning; I still had it in me to leave my doorstep armed with enough hope and naivete to scour the earth for purpose.

All of thatâ€™s gone now. My Papa and I arenâ€™t.

Iâ€™m going to spare both of us the details of my wanting to drop the fuck dead, if only for the fact that I know I owe it to him to try and endure a life of solitude, ennui, and perpetual anguish, just to spare my Papa the grief.
