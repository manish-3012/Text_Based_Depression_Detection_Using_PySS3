Itâ€™s always my jobLife is ok but my job gives me so much anxiety and self hate that it makes me hate my life. I donâ€™t want to do this forever. I donâ€™t want to think about killing myself just because my job makes me feel that way. People say just quit but I need to find another job first. Iâ€™m looking. Nothing so far that could let me keep my apartment. I was just lucky enough to find this apartment because the one we were living in kicked us out (long story, new owners, we did nothing wrong) canâ€™t find anything cheaper. 
I donâ€™t have anyone that I can go to for help and this stress is killing me anyway so maybe I donâ€™t even have to worry, i feel like I could have a stroke or a heart attack at any moment my chest hurts so much and my head is pounding so hard. 
I know this is all karma punishment for me because I didnâ€™t do well in school. I regret everything in my life.
