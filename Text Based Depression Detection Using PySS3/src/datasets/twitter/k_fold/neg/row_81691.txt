I don't really know again (It's long I'm sorry) &gt;~&lt;(again on posting I apologize if my words are everywhere &gt;-&lt; I have a difficulty on organizing my thoughts. It's fine if you would tell me to edit this because I am not sure what am I doing either)

So here I am in another edge of my life situation ._. &amp; again I am afraid that this might snowball into a larger problem &amp; backlash.

Yet this time it's different. In the past I was determined to die.

But now I'm kinda terrified &gt;_&gt;

No, not dying but feeling that incredible pain that would kill me ._.

I've been dreaming &amp; simulating on how the pain would feel as my first option is falling.
There's that small percentage that I would actually be still conscious as I die which I really don't want to happen 0-0

I don't have a rope or a ceiling to hold (I'm chubby XD)

I want to live yet my time is running out &amp; I have already ruined my future by bashing my head against the wall multiple times along my lifetime (Yep I had already forgotten a bit why) in which might be resulting to "lag" on my brain (memory &amp; coordination mostly). The results is my grades failing as the years goes by.

No one actually pressures me to be at my best but another voice seems to be eating my brains lately. Even the smallest bad wording that will be said to me becomes intensified a thousand fold in my brain ._.

Although there is that voice that I actually cling to tightly that says "Don't die, you can do this, I'm sorry you have to suffer. I love you " &gt;\\\&lt;
(kinda embarrassing &amp; the first time I had to admit this.)

I want to do good to the world :D
To create art that will enlighten others &amp; make inventions that will help society while recycling to the fullest ^w^
&amp; better yet I want to be my strange, weird unique self =3

I believe in karma &amp; so I RARELY do any evil (I don't want it to come back to me  -_-)
But if I'm at fault, I would take the responsibility.

But everyone knows that peace would never last forever :&lt;
I kinda just hope but I'm losing it now.

I love learning &amp; addicted to learning so that I don't have to think about the black maggots eating away my brain &amp; stuff the holes with the knowledge I gain ^w^

I don't really think that I should be helped .-.
I don't deserve it.
I'd probably just delete this post again like my others.
But maybe it's time to change a bit? Or not.
Why am I posting this here if I'm thinking of not dying .-.
Afterall, it's not anybody's fault that I'm in pain now right? I only can blame myself =3

I've been keeping this a secret for 10yrs.
I guess posting here &amp; telling a bit to a counselor means that this might really be the end &amp; also the mask I wear is starting to crack.

I should've died a long time ago. Things just get worse in the future so it's a waste on waiting for something good to happen.
I have "My R" 's

Maybe I should just continue to sleep destruct though, If I can only destroy this kind &amp; giving heart of mine then change it for a darker one &amp; just be more selfish of myself so I can succeed in my life. 

Focusing in right goals, leaving everyone behind, cutting out useless friends, Making new efficient friends, lie more often &amp; just throwing out my hobbies, memories &amp; sentimental things that wouldn't be helpful in the future long term anyways. 

I would regret it, but that would be the old me talking.

(I am 100% sure I forgot to add something but I already forgot why did I even .w.)
