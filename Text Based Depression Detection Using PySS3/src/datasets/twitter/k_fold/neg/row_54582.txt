Take me down,painlesslyObviously,throwaway acc.

I don't know how to even start,I feel like shit,I'm writing this to vent off and perhaps as an epilogue,'till now I wrote them on paper but the risk of someone finding it is too high.

I'm useless,hopeless and I'm so wasted and burnt inside that I can not even pitty myself.All I feel is my old friend,the endless painfull void in my chest that eats up everything.I barely have energy to stay up 12h/day but this will be quite long so skip it if you don't have time,I don't want to eat up the time of others as perhaps yours is valuable,mine will mean nothing in 2 days.This is just the ending of a story.The story of a pathetic trash...

I've been suicidal since I can remember,everytime I hit a bad spot there was always this possibility in the back of my mind,I have a way out,I can leave on my own terms.

I wasn't extremely poor,I didn't remember to be abused yet I still became a fragile and pathetic piece of trash. I was always the empathetic,naive,idealist and very anxious,THE snowflake,shielded by my parents and never let to venture out  into the world,controlled at every point in my ealry childhood.I was their "work of art" so they never let me do anything outside of school and close friends,I was always maneuvred like a doll.

When it came to emotions , I started to see them as a liability,so I blocked them from 7 or 8 yo , they were keeping me down so I decided I'll be cold and calculated,people around me noticed the change but they thought I was simply too mature for my age so no one [bothered. At](https://bothered.At) that time I also started to read extensively,history,economics,psychology,sciences,I was doing the bills for my family,I started to research(if you can call it that way at the comprehension level of a 8 yo) politics aaand I became , since a young age , very grim.People started to tell me that I behave like an old guy and I took it as a compliment.Grown ups liked to have me around so I took in all the information they had to offer,always watching,always [learning](https://learning.My).My father still scolded and extensively put pressure on me, even when I had an A- on some calligraphy homework in my first grade,he kept me up at night and continously yelled and slapped me because I was bad at writting 2's in italic.He also kept yelling how I was ashaming him.After I was graded he made a fool out of me at a parents meeting and all those meaningless idiots had something to laugh at everytime they met me(never thought I was gonna cry writing this).I didn't think that my parents were wrong,no,I completely gave in to their way of forming me,I became the most obedient student,I started to behave and tried to never bother anyone,not even my colleagues , because I could get a beating at home,this increased my coldness ,I became airtight and that's when I wanted to drink bleach or insecticide for the first time but I found another way of ending it.

At around ten I was playing with some neighbours,I was having a rough time ('cause my grandma recently died , she was the only person that let me to behave like the child I was) and I  saw the opportunity to hang myself and make it seem like a play accident.I told those kids to play a new hide and seek,I was going to hang myself(because it is more exciting and they don't know exactly how much time I have left 'till I'm out of breath to come and seek them) and they had to hide really fast and stay there,so we did but when I was almost passing out their mother entered the backyard and she took me down,I played the stupid kid and said I didn't know what would happen and all the adults took me for a retard.After that I blend in and played my role even though I had some thoughts ocasionally.

The real bad part came at puberty,I was in 6th grade,I think,and I fell deeply in love with one of my classmates.We were both "early bloomers",looking like at least 16 at 12 yo and she was mature too,mature enough that I talked anything with her.I was energized,feeling life flowing through my every cell,I found what I was looking for,someone to like and love,she was everything to me,ambitious,smart,beautiful and kind,agressive and bitchy when she had to but I loved her wholly.'Till she told me" this can't go own,I want to know more guys,you're young and naive,a dreamer and a child,when you are at school you are too serious and when you're with me you're a total idiot".So she cut ties,started to go out with older guys,15 or more,I started to write poetry,I felt broken inside,real fucking pain,like my chest was ripped apart and afterwards I don't remember,all is foggy in that period.I became reclusive,apathetic,read books endlessly to occupy my mind or did the same with WOW,I studied,I was first in 400 in my middle school,entered a top 1% highschool but nothing mattered,I was dead since then.

When I talked to my parents first time about depression and my suicidal ideation they told me I'm just a kid and it'll pass,"don't ruin your future with psychiatrists and bullshits like that,who knows where you will get in life and a file could take you down,when you'll think about it in 10 years it will seem like a childish joke".So I vegetated,still doing essentially nothing,learning to pretend in order to blend in,dead inside with an agreable smile.I had a few incidents in highschool regarding emotions,everytime I was careless those bottled emotions went up and I had to kill them off,sleep seemed the best way to do it.But I managed to survive UNTILL I fell in love again and everything I swore to burn and lock came out,the ecstatic feeling again,I was feeling alive,'till it ended , again,and I was worse,I don't remember much after that. 2 years are foggy,entirely.I was a walking corpse.

From that point on nothing mattered,again.I barely studied,still ended up with  a decent grade in my equivalent SAT ,passed my admission exam at medschool,but I had no direction,I realised that I went there just because of the ideas I had when I was little and naive,I wanted to study neurology , do research on cognition and find ways of improving my mind "this way I'll always be the best" like my father always forced me to,like my life was a fucking pokemon game,"gotta be the best...".But that was the dream of someone else,I didn't fit in,barely studied,wanted nothing else but to die.The reality was that everytime I was under stress I remembered all my fails,all my insecurities and I was paralyzed.I couldn't do shit and all I wanted to do at that time was to die,I even prepared to hang myself a few times but there was always someone showing up when they shouldn't have.I was never caught and no one suspected a thing but I was in ruin.I always kept people away from me to prevent any  incident of caring too much but I let the guard down one time again with a [colleague.](https://colleague.It) It started like a simple friendship and I think she liked me,or at least she liked who I pretended to be,after getting to know me she broke ties,saying I'm too anxious and sentimental(I didn't propose to her,lol).She said I'm way too needy,emotionally,and way too jigglypuff when I'm with her. So I fell and fell,over that summer I invented some stupid excuse that the system is corrupt and how unhappy I'd be as a doctor and I  quit it.  Over a couple of months I prepared my suicide,always the next day,everything was prepared,I wanted it badly,but I was so apathetic that I was sleeping 16h a day and barely did anything,I was in the twilight zone.

After unknowingly postponing , I started to heal,I started to meditate and to induce myslef in hypnosis,I brought up under hypnosis all the shits I've suffered as a kid,all the beatings for meaningless things,all the public shamings that were supposed to make tougher,all the lecturings and slaps(most of them undeserved),essentially,all the humiliating incidents I suffered as a kid.On  top of that I remembered a sexual abuse incident I suffered with a neighbour when I was 5 and he was around 12.I relived them,I cried,I suffered again but I accepted them,I was getting better,then I got to my teenage years and did the same,I was starting to feel alive again.I started to study at an  engineering university,I was full of enthusiasm.I thought I cured my depression but after a couple of months I fell again.All I can think of now is that I somehow sucked up some positive experiences from my meditation sessions,in reality I never healed my scars,they  are all there,still hurting,I just didn't feel it 'cause I was somehow sucking the will to live and the enthusiam I had as a 5yo.When the tank emptied out I was still burnt to ashes.

I always had sports when everything failed :weightlifting,jogging,tennis,they didn't cure me but kept me functional .Now I don't feel  even the least pleasure or excitement pushing my body,I feel heavy and full of pain.I also deeply loved animals,anything I blocked from humans I felt towards animals,and they liked me too,cats,dogs,my friends always joked that I'm a magnet to strays,abandoned and beaten souls.I was a disney princess when it came to mammals.Truth be told I think those poor beings felt my pain,smelled it or saw it in my movements or on my face,somehow they were attracted to me as we were alike,at least that's my theory.But in the last months I felt nothing towards animals,not even my dogs or my cat,I'm not crude but I'm as cold to them as I was generally before.Just the other day a kitten had the misfortune to sleep under my tier,I didn't know it was there, as I was moving the car I heard loud noises and as I came out of the car I saw it there,broken,with her lower body damaged,crying.And I felt nothing,no remorse,no pain,nothing.I knew I should've felt at least regret but it wasn't there.I dug the poor kitty a grave in my backyard,not of remorse but more out of a twisted sense of duty,a grave for 2 souls,mine and hers.

I tried to do it many times since that time at  10yo.In highschool I took over 30 pills of ibuprofen.I was light headed and drunk like  a couple of days and I had black stool but...still alive.

I tried to suffocate in my bathub at 18,I was dead drunk after a party,I filled the thub and as I've felt I'm falling asleep, I slowly slipped down the thub and felt how the water was over me,thinking that this is such an inconspicous and stupid way to die that no one will doubt it was an accident.Somehow I woke up after 2 hours,in  freezing water,with  wet hair but standing on my butt,still in the thub, unconciously , I somehow got up and continued to sleep standing on my ass.

I tried to jump in front of the subway one time but in the last second I had second thoughts,if I didn't die I'd get even worse,paralyzed and put under supervision so I stopped in the last second.

Oh,I'm tired.I've read NDEs and all say they feel a moment of clarity and calmness when their heart stops.I wish that to be true.

I'm home alone now,my parents are abroad and I'm supposedly staying home to study for two exams I didn't take during the last semester,I'm preparing a high dose of potassium  for tomorrow,after an hour or so I'll drink a few energy  drinks and I'll go for a run,a breathtaking [one](https://one.No),on the fields around here,with no one around for miles,my heart should stop and I shouldn't feel much pain,perhaps a gastric ache but the stress from sprinting should end it pretty fast.All I think of now,laughing,is the irony of wanting to raise the perfect kid, only to get a weak and self-hating piece of trash. No one should guess a thing as I have the perfect life from the exterior,"I live on the back of my parents",I have tons of free time(which I mostly sleep  but I pretend to be in full mode learning and playing),in the eyes of the many I suffer of the peter pan syndrome so there shouldn't even be doubt that my heart stopped due to overexercising and hypertrophy of the left ventricle. My mom will get it as she always knew me but I hope she keeps it to herself.I don't blame them,I really don't , they were just kids not knowing what they were doing,smart but poorly educated . Someone else in my situation would've fought back,would've endured and would've become hard as a rock.But it's not the case for my nervous system,nope.

Take care of you guys,hope I'll make another post listing some of the things that helped over the years and hopefully I'll  have the guts to do it and that the method will work.Then I'd be on the outside as I am on the inside. Meet all of you on the other side,if such thing exists, but not after you've lived all your days and fought off this nightmare &gt;:D&lt;
