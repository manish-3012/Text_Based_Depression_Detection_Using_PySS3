What is the purpose of this stupid subreddit? I am so depressed, I've reached out but no one cares. I see this as a place for people to go to pretend to have interest in people without actually having to get involved with their sticky, shitty lives. You can offer your ignorant advice without having to worry about anyone seeking you our for physical help. Basically a way to make yourself feel good without actually having any real emotional relationship with the people here. You have basically taken over /r/suicide and turned it into some kind of lame, do-gooder circle jerk for people with no training to teach those of us who are very depressed.
