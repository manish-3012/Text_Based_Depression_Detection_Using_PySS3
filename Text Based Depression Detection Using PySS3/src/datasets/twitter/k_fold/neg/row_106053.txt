I want to die with my childhood bulliesI am 19 years old male south korean. I was bullied since first year of elementary school til the last year of high school. Even though in high school i was barely bullied except few cases, i hate bullies in this period the most than other school age. 

The worst memory is middle school age, where people around me had assaulted me physically, verbally, financially and even sexually. For example they hit and kicked face and body, sometimes in pit of the stomach. They made fun of my mom sexually and i cant do anything. They took my money and food. They stole my book. They throw my shoes and bag,cases out of the window and i couldnt find some of them. They even stole school lunch. In sexually, they kicked my balls, squash and scratch my penis, taking my pants off(even underwear too) in front of girls and made fun of me sexually and spread lies about my body and more. They made my mental illness way worse and they now be like nothing happend.

Why i did not fight back is i was too afraid and they are too many.
Some of bullies learned martial arts like boxing and taekwondo or even muay thai so they beat other people more cruelly. I know martial arts should be for weaker people. But in korea, bullies uses their martial arts to beat more people worse. 

Now i am college student but couldnt forgive what they had done to me. So i want to revenge. Sometimes i think what if i chose one(the worst and strongest) of my bullies and kill him and all of his family cause i cant find all of them, then i kill myself too. It is just thought i am having these days and it gives me both thrill and anxiety at the same time.
