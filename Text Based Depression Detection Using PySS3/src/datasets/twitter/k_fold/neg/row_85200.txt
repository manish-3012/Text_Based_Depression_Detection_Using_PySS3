Am I losing my mind over loneliness? Overthinking it?Hello Friends!

I need your help in understanding why I'm ignored and seemingly despised by the people I meet. I apologize for the text wall.

Even typing "friends" made me feel weird. I say so because all my friends, without exception, fail to text me every now and then. I find myself reaching out to them way more often than they reach out to me.

I'm a dark skinned guy, well kempt (brush my teeth well, shower thrice a day). I'm eager to connect with people, but since high school, I've noticed that my peers don't seem to want to include me when a team has people of different races. I've noticed the same trend when another guy my race is in a poly-racial group - the dude is sorta *there, y*ou know? Just hangin' around, not involved in the group project. No one asks him his opinion, and he must barge in to make himself heard, at which point they look at him like he's an alien who's rudely interrupted their convo. I've felt the same. It was even more humiliating when a kid two years younger than me told me to shut up and that no one cared about what I had to say. :/ idk why lol, was too afraid to ask and humiliate myself further, in front of five other kids.

Not trying to play the race card to gain sympathy, but my cousin, who's the same race, got picked on at the same hs. They'd say where's X? All I can see is his shadow! My cousin X has darker skin than me... And mind you, this was the school year 2017-2018.

I'm seriously confused as to why people seem to hate conversing with me. My accent is just like theirs too, so it can't be a language barrier. I'm friendly, although I do make sex jokes from time to time, because I think it'll make people like me more.

Regarding culture, I don't like subscribing to the new gangsta/slang/pop culture all that much. It seems way too haughty to me. Maybe that's why they can't relate? I don't use a lotta slang/hand signs etc.

I also don't use Instagram/FaceBook/Snapchat/Twitter/TikTok. I don't even have accounts.

Apparel: I think I need to say that I don't wanna spend a lot of my parents' money on clothes. I own a **single** pair of running shoes, and a couple shorts and few shirts, and a couple jackets. I think it might be this one, because a friend called me a cheap-ass once for wearing my favorite yellow hoodie thrice the same week.

Tech: I don't have the Airpods or Apple Watch or the latest iPhone. Didn't have a phone in high school. I have the 8 plus, a 15" MBP bought in 2018, and Solo3 wireless headphones.

**Consequences:** Because of the constant ignorance, I tend to suppress my eagerness to connect and be part of the group. Even when I approach someone to converse with them, I lose all my confidence and what comes out is an embarrassing stammer. Obviously, they think I'm weird, and turn to the person next to them to converse with them instead. When I'm at home, I *rarely* stammer. I feel so fucking embarrassed. I'm also a little emotional for a guy. I don't like being an arrogant alpha male type. Heck, I'm crying right now as I write this post.

I feel like everyone else's having fun in college, except me. Even at a nearby church, everyone's paired up, boyfriend-girlfriend. It felt really awkward being alone in my pew. I took the bus there, but I couldn't bear being seen by everyone else at church. So as soon as mass was over, despite the hard rain, I ran toward the bus stop to beat them to it. Unfortunately, my plan didn't work. I saw the bus approach, and knew that I couldn't bear to ride the bus with them. So I started running away at night in the rain, without an umbrella, despite my fellow church-goers calling after me saying, "Hey wait! The bus is here!" I ran all the way home to my dorm like a wimp. I can't ever show my face there again.

Can anyone else relate? Thanks so much for taking time to read this :) God Bless.
