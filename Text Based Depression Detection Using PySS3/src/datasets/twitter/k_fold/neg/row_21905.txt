How do I ask for help?I've been wanting to end my life as long as I can remember. I've always pretended to be happy so no one really suspects it, but I don't know how much longer I can keep the act up. I don't know how to tell my parents I need to talk to a professional, I'm only sixteen. I've talked to the psychologists at my school a few times but I can't be fully honest with them without being sent to a hospital. I want to talk to someone I can be completely honest with that will actually take me seriously. I'd prefer to talk face to face, I get very anxious talking over the phone. How should I go about telling my parents I want/need help?
