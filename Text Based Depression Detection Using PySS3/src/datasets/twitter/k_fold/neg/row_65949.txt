I donâ€™t know where else to turnYears ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I cut myself on the regular and attempted suicide more than once. I went on meds for a while and worked really hard on improving myself and my situation, and eventually found some coping mechanisms. 

Things were going really well for me for a while. I finally finished college after 6 years because my depression caused me to fail so many classes. I found a high-paying job that I didnâ€™t necessarily love, but it gave me the funds to go out and do the things I did love. Iâ€™ve been in a good relationship for 4 years, own my own place, and was genuinely happy. I hadnâ€™t even thought about hurting myself for a couple years. 

All that went to shit since this virus. The biggest thing I used to cope was making fun plans so I always had something to look forward to. There is nothing to look forward to anymore. My boyfriends mom has stage 4 cancer, and we were supposed to do her bucket list this year before sheâ€™s housebound. We canâ€™t do any of that. My anxiety has been so high itâ€™s unbearable. Iâ€™ve had panic attacks every night and can barely sleep. I want to hurt myself all the time. I learned how to tie a noose yesterday and if things donâ€™t get better I know itâ€™s going to end up around my neck.

Iâ€™m scared and I have no idea how to deal with this. I donâ€™t know if I can.
