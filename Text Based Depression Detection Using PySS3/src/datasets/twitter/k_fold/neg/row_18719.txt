To all the people who hurt meI'm not gonna come up with some excessively long sob story just to call for some attention that I'm not sure I even want anymore, so here goes nothing. To all the "best friends" I have made that end up using me and abandoning me, I hope everyone is truly happy after they someday find out I ended up pulling the trigger or hear about me peacefully hanging off a thread that so easily chooses the destiny of life.
