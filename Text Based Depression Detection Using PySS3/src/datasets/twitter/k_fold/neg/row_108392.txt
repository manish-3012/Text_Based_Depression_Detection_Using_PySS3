I still dont see the point in living.After trying to keep my peace of mind after more than 2 months, i constantly thought of what my life's role is. I thought of getting out of this shithole and study again try to prove something to myself. I wanted to volunteer for animal rescue and such. Ive listed down a ton of things but i dont feel that there is still a point to live til im old. Why not end it soon? I had a "schedule" but i failed my "tasks" and the "due date" just passed. I feel bad for being a coward not being able to end it until now. I feel like shit.
