I was going wait and I did!I had been waiting for the result of the job role I have been interviewing for and it turns out I didn't get it! I really needed this! Only found out about 30 mins ago that I didn't get it! I had decided that if I hadn't got the job I'd kill my self this weekend, I don't think I can even be bothered to wait until then.  My friends and family will be incredibly shocked and upset but I let everyone down anyway so they will get over it.
