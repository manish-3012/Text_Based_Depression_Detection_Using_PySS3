I don't know anymoreI kinda just wanna write out what I'm thinking I guess. No one probably looks at these really but it's worth a shot. So uh I'm young. An underclassman in high school. A couple months ago I tried to OD, but my parents rushed me to the hospital and I was okay. I love my mom to death and hate to even think about putting her through that again, but sometimes my thoughts are just too much. I've tried taking meds, but the voices don't go away so I've kinda given up and just lied and said I'm better. I don't like the pills. I feel numb on them and that's honestly worse than feeling down. I had issues at my school which led to me leaving so now I'm in this place where I have no one but my mom and my sister maybe. I know for a fact that if my mother wasn't here, I wouldn't be either. It's just sometimes it's so hard to keep going despite knowing she cares. Idk I guess I'm just lost lmao. It's nearly 1am and my mind is just all over the place. Don't really want to go one. Just want it all to stop. I don't wanna see the shadows in the corners of my room that talk to me. I just don't wanna anymore...
