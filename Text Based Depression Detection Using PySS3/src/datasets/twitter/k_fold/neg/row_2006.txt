I really just want to OD and call it a dayI donâ€™t know where to start, but here goes:

Iâ€™ve been clean from heroin almost a year. Never thought Iâ€™d make it this far. My life fucking sucked with the drugs and itâ€™s absolutely awful without the drugs. I just really want to take a heroic does of heroin and end it all. Which makes me feel really selfish because I lost three friends to overdoses last year, but I cannot take this pain anymore. Every second of every day is a fucking struggle.
