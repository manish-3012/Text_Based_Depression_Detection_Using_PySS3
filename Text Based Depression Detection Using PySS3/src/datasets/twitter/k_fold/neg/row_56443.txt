Iâ€™m done reaching outI canâ€™t force people to care about me or whatever bond we may have. Friendship, relationship, whatever. Donâ€™t know why that always catches me by surprise.

Iâ€™m done caring about people who donâ€™t give a fuck about me or (whatever type of) relationship they have with me. The people in this city are fickle as hell. I miss the people I have back home who actually have my back. But theyâ€™re too fuckin far. They have their own thing going on. 

Iâ€™ve relapsed and cut myself again for the first time in over a year. Harmed myself in other ways enough to pass out. I know how Iâ€™ll go out. Iâ€™ve been testing it, and I know itâ€™ll work this time.

Iâ€™ll give myself until the end of the year. Maybe things will improve by then. But If not, I feel comfort in knowing I at least have a way out. Fuck it.
