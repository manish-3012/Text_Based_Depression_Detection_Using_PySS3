Regret-ishLast month I could have died and I have regrets that I didnâ€™t. At the time I was not anywhere near that mindset and not currently but when I think about it I wish that I did die. All I can think of that things would be better for those around me*. Plus I think in the long run I donâ€™t think my death would leave an lasting impression. That and I never really imagine living to an old age I always wanted die young. 

For me I never picture my death being by suicide. I pictured death more from long term damage plans or something silly happened. There are also at points occasional via cancer plays into the dream.  Itâ€™s just in general I pictured death being suffering and by something I did to myself for the most part. To me suicide was a faster way to die but desires to do so become stronger when I been on antidepressants. 

Although because of what happened with the almost death I find myself thinking that maybe I should rethink that twisted idea.  I think what could make think and act if I have that strong impulse to do so is that I actually have a way to do it. I can with much ease to repeat what caused the almost death. Before I never really had one and kept things like guns arms away to not have that temptations.
