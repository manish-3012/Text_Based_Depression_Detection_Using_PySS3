I am mostly scared by passing timeIâ€™m 22F and to start off my childhood sucked. Majority of my highschool life I have spend alone being sad or playing video games all day. Iâ€™m now 22 still havenâ€™t finished a major and highly suicidal. I donâ€™t know what to do recently talked to a psychologist for the first time and I didnâ€™t work also my sessions canâ€™t keep fort because of the corona virus. Every night I go to bed wishing I didnâ€™t wake up but here I am again.  I donâ€™t know what to do, I have a paper do in a few hours but I could not be bothered to start. Since quarantine I sleep 10+ hours a day and rarely leave my bed unless itâ€™s necessary, I spend a lot of time crying or contemplating suicide. But I think iâ€™m ready, I once tried to kill myself in highschool but I think iâ€™m ready now. Nothing brings me joy anymore Reddit has been a great place to waste time and I have lurked this sub for years but I think itâ€™s my time to go. I sincerely hope you fellow lurkers make it out of this and live a happy life iâ€™ll watch from wherever I go and root for you. 

Thank you reddit, the internet, video games and music for providing me comfort in my lonely life.
