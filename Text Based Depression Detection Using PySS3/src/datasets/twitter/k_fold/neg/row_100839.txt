I had a panic attack at work...I finished by 1st real week of work at the miserable Wal-Mart and I had a panic attack for the 1st time in public.

I was the only one scheduled to work produce that day (on a fucking holiday mind you.) and I was expected to just know what to do despite the only two other produce workers showing fuck all but stocking fruits and veggies.

For 2 hours straight I had to keep the produce aisle clean, tell people where stuff was (assuming that I knew where EVERYTHING was) as well as restocking other produce at the same time.

The corn was getting low so I had to pull that giant pallet of corn out of the freeze and put it on the store floor.

It was wet and slippery in the room outside of the freezer, so I slipped and fell.

Hurt myself pretty bad and then burst into tears and become inconsolable for about 10 minutes.

I only regain composure because I saw someone coming to see what the noise was.

I played it off and just asked her for help to remove the pallet from the doorway.

It was only after my 1st break did one of the only two produce guys come in to aid me, and the one that came in had that day off.

So if I didn't tell anyone I was supposed to be working alone, today would have gone so much worse.

I wanted to fucking die right then and there, expecting a noobie like me to just fucking know what to do only after being here for less then one full week...

And even after telling my mother this she still won't let me quit...

I'm starting to think myself I just need to show this suicidal entries to my step father...

I mean I got nothing to lose at this point, my family becoming homeless is looking like more and more of a reality...

My meaningless paycheck isn't going to be enough to bail us out.

Might at well show someone before it's too late...
