I'm ready to die...I'm ready. It's actually very soothing. For a while fear of what lies beyond death has stopped me but I have come to peace with it. I'm not saying I'm going to do it right now but I have accepted that it will happen at some point or another. So why am I here? I'm here to ask someone to talk me out of it. I can't find a reason to live, but perhaps one of you can. I ask because I'd rather not go through the whole suicide thing again, attempts tend to be rather unpleasant in my experience. I'm nothing to my parents, I have literally no friends and I enjoy nothing, like i shit you not, nothing. I also have autism which makes everyday life slightly more hellish. So convince me if you will... Why should I stay alive?
