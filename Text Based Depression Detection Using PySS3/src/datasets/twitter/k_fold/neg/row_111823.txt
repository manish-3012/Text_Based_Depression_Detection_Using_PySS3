I just don't understand why I continue to live. I wish I got a heart attack and just stopped already.I'm so tired. Life feels painful. Just getting out of bed feels difficult.

I keep wishing I never even existed.

There is stuff I enjoy, I just obviously can't do them much. And I know, fucking first world problems and whatever. But I don't feel the positives outweigh the negative.

My head feels like it's boiling alive every day.

I feel the only think keeping me alive some days is spite.
