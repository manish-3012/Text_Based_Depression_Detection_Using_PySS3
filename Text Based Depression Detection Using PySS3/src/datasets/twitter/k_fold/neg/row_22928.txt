I hate living...It's never been enjoyable... The best way to describe my life is "agony." I don't want to keep on living but because I'm so cowardly I don't kill myself... especially since the risk of survival (but being fucked up somehow) is so high. I thought maybe if I can't die I have to make my life worth living somehow. But it's never been. Ever since I was a child... there's never been anything to live for and my life has always just been shit. Now that I'm older I try to be more positive but it's like a binge purge or  yo-yo diet. I'll try really really hard to be positive and ignore all the shitty things but then it hits me like a truck and I'm on floor sobbing again wondering why I'm even here or why I'm trying to convince myself of things that aren't true. I guess cbt only works when you're actually delusional but all my negative thoughts are real things that are happening. This is why therapists don't help me. And I keep hoping they will but instead I just keep losing money I could have spent on other shit. Idk what saying all this is gonna do... no one can say anything I haven't heard before... meaningless words from people who don't know me nor give a fuck about me. I miss that other subreddit about suicide that wasn't about trying to convince others not to commit it...
