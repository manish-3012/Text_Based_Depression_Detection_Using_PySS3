Not sure where else to put this, but maybe this will resonate with someoneI feel like shit. I fucking hate this would and I just want to die. I can't wait for the sweet relief of death. What is the point of life if you cannot truly feel alive? And then we continue the same bullshit cycle over and over again, adding more links in the chain of human suffering, all for what? What is the real purpose? What is the point in it all? I did not ask to be here. I did not ask to be alive, to deal with the burden of life. Why couldn't we have chosen to not exist at all? I have no legacy, no meaning. Just a faceless person, a nobody. How does anyone have the courage or strength to maintain the unrelenting pressures and demands of society? Fuck society, they want nothing more but to bleed you dry until there is nothing left of you to give. I feel dead already, how do I feel alive? Why does life have to be this way? Why does no one demand an answer, why do we all pretend that it's okay for life to be this way and accept it so that out children can grow up and live the same shitty life that we once lived. I'm not sure if I'll ever understand this.
