35 days....Thats all i'm going to give myself. If things dont look up by then i'm going to end it all. I'm tired of this thing they call love. 2 1/2 months have been hell and its just getting worse as every day goes by. I have no friends and my family tells me that I am a coward to think about the things I do. 3 years ago I moved and gave up everything I had worked for just to be near the girl I loved more than anything else in this world and after 6 years and 8 months of being together with 10 months being engaged she just walked away. Told me I was nothing and that i'd never be anything. I can't go on like this. I no longer enjoy the things I used to. No passion left for what I had planned to do with my life. She had saved me from hell 7 years ago after my niece and nephew died and now I have nobody here to give me a reason to go on....
