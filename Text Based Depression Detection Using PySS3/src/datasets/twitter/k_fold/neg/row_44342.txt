i donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m so lost. I lost 2 of the most valuable relationships iâ€™ve ever had. Every time I see them, think of them or see their friends, my heart fucking drops. I donâ€™t know what to do cause it feels like the world is against me. Everything is falling apart because everyone hates me and I donâ€™t know what to do. It doesnâ€™t help that iâ€™m struggling with MDD and GAD. Iâ€™m pushing people away and it fucking sucks. I hate this and i canâ€™t deal with this pain. I just want to end it all. Iâ€™m sorry
