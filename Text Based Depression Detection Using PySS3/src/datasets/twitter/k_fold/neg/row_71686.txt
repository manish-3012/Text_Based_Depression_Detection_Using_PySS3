I don't know how much longer I can do thingsI've always been the joker of my group of friends and always try to make people laugh and enjoy it

Whenever I leave those people I feel so terrible inside, I just feel so lonely and helpless, there is nothing I can seem to do right. I never want to disappoint my parents and want to save them the embarrassment of identifying my body but I'm not sure

I can't do it for much longer if nothing changes
