Just another statisticI'm a man in my midtwenties who struggles with borderline personality...
And what was a good news and a literal life saver (and hash buyer) became also an official governmental samp that I'm 40% disabled. With no end term. 
All of my mistakes and failures flood me. 
Next week I will not witness.
