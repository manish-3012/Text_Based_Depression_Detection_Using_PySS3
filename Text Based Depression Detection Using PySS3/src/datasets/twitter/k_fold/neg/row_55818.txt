Losing itI'm coming closer and closer to doing it. Thinking about my ex, We've patched things up as best we could. I am now able to talk to her in casual conversation. 

But...I know that no matter how good I become, no matter how fit, how friendly, how much a genuinely honest and good person I become, I won't find someone else. I won't find another person who will love me back. I don't see how they could. 

If I fail my attempt, nobody will be able to deal with me. Even if I still try to be open and friendly... Once they find out that I made an attempt, they will leave me, and I will actually be alone instead of just feeling alone.

They'll see the cut on my wrist and I'll be branded...if I fail, I won't be able to live the life I have now.

Yet I don't want to continue. I don't see good things in my future. I felt love for the first, and if I so choose, only time in my life. I don't see myself having it again, I mean, life has a way to bring out unexpected things, but I can't depend on that. I've tried to keep living and keep doing what I have to and what is expected of me. So out of the blue, without saying anything to anyone, except here. I'll be leaving everything I've done behind. 

I won't lie, I'm still broken over my ex, I used to be open, but now I close myself off, put on the mask like many other people do. I've made friends, Despite all of it I've still socialized,
Still created relatipnships...but I'm still missing the one I want. I know I'm not fit for it, I'm not stable. I've tried. not long enough but still, I tried. 

I am going to do everything I need to do, get a job for the summer, pass my one class that will ensure my continuation in my major. I will keep being friendly, making people think that all is good with me. Then I'll leave. I don't know how bad those people will miss me, but they'll get over it, eventually. They are stronger than I am.
