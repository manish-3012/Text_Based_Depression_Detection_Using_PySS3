After 5 years, I'm tired of fighting.This is long but I thank anyone who will read it. Itâ€™s also not super urgent; Iâ€™m not about to attempt in the imminent future. 

Iâ€™m a 17 year old white male and after fighting depression for 5 years, Iâ€™m tired of fighting. I canâ€™t stand other people. I canâ€™t stand how cruel they are to each other. I canâ€™t stand how happy simple things can make them. I donâ€™t understand how someone can enjoy things like Jersey Shore and Twilight and still be considered worthwhile. Worse yet Iâ€™m told I have to tolerate these people and that their opinions and values and unfounded ignorant dogmas are just as valuable and â€œrightâ€ as mine. Fine, whatever, I can just ignore them. Sometimes I canâ€™t but that isnâ€™t my biggest issue, not by far. Iâ€™ve become convinced there is no one in the world with political views close enough to mine for a world I want to live in to ever exist. The liberals are too liberal, the conservatives are too conservative, the libertarians are too liberal, the religious are too religious, the atheistic arenâ€™t religious enough. I canâ€™t even stand my parents anymore. They know Iâ€™m depressed, they are trying their best to help, but they just donâ€™t get it. Every time they ask a question that Iâ€™ve answered before, every time they tell me one of my opinions or actions is not okay or they donâ€™t understand, every time they act like a bottle of pills and a few weeks will solve everything, I just want to gouge my eyes out. 

In the 3rd grade I was identified as gifted and from then until Freshman year I was the smartest kid in my town of 18,000 or so residents. After the 5th grade I didnâ€™t want it anymore. It never got me anything. Everyone thought it was cool that I knew so much stuff yet they still teased me because I was short and skinny and weak. Iâ€™m an only child and parents can only help as parents. Every girl I was interested during this period completely blew me off until one led me on all the way up to the point where a relationship was certain and then snubbed me for a football player. Typical. I had a group of 4ish close friends and they are still good friends, but theyâ€™re simpletons and donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t just â€œcheer up and change stuff.â€ In the 8th grade hit full depression mode and after that girl snubbed me I said â€œfuck itâ€ and tried cannabis even though I believed all the D.A.R.E. bullshit. Weed more or less made me function normally. I have severe social anxiety and fairly strong depression but after a few puffs (Not nearly enough to even be noticeably different) I felt normal. I wasnâ€™t anxious or upset most of the time but obviously smoking weed all the time has its own problems. My parents were not initially receptive but I didnâ€™t care. After freshman year I left for a boarding school for gifted/smart kids. It was a very stressful, very hard work environment, and after a few months I started smoking at school. But soon it wasnâ€™t enough, I was still depressed and still anxious so I started smoking every day. And Soon multiple times a day. That was 2 years ago. A year and a quarter ago I finally got a wonderful, loving girlfriend and it was the best thing ever. But I soon learned that even that was not a panacea. For a year and a quarter I still fought depression and anxiety and smoked 3-4 times a day and no one bothered me and I was the envious bad-boy but incredibly smart and informed kid that everyone respected but no one was really friends with. For the most part I didnâ€™t want to be their friends. I was still living in my own hell. November 2011 I got arrested for possession and let off with a $100 dollar ticket and no record. 

And then last week I got busted. Dorm management caught me smoking, searched my room and stole over $200 of my drug related possessions. Tomorrow I have to go before a committee and explain to them why they shouldnâ€™t expel me 2 weeks before I was to graduate. Everyone is convinced theyâ€™ll let me graduate but I probably wonâ€™t walk. I was also forced to miss Prom that was Friday. That was a huge let down. I had wanted to go to Prom since like the 6th grade. And now I never will. Iâ€™ve let my parents down so much. My friends have shown an outpouring of support but I still feel wrong. Everything feels wrong including feeling wrong. I canâ€™t smoke weed now and Iâ€™ve lost all my possessions related to it. Its not even about the smoking anymore and just the principle that Iâ€™m being punished for using and being forced not to use the only medicine that ever helped me. Iâ€™m finally tired of running from my problems, Iâ€™m tired of living surrounded by assholes and simpletons I canâ€™t fucking stand. Iâ€™m tired of my rich, spoiled Jew roommate acting like he has such a pitiful life. Iâ€™m so depressed and Iâ€™ve said these things so many times my girlfriend has basically said she doesnâ€™t know what to say and is tired of listeningâ€”not that she doesnâ€™t love me anymore, just unable to help. For the past 4 nights Iâ€™ve walked out on my roof and looked over the edge. One step and all the pain, all the anguish finally goes away. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™ve walked away. I donâ€™t know if death is what I want but I know I donâ€™t want this life anymore. Iâ€™ve never been seriously suicidal but it seems like the best option of all my shitty options. There is no â€œupâ€, only sideways from shitty situation to shitty situation and one, final down. Iâ€™ve become so broken that things like dropping a pen make me breakdown and start crying because Iâ€™m not even competent enough to hold a fucking pen. Iâ€™m inches away and I just canâ€™t see a future. I want to live, but not like this, not in this life. Itâ€™s been too fucking cruel.
