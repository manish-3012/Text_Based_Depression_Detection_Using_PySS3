my mom and brother make me want to kill myselfso my brother (younger than me) yells for my mom when I do something he doesn't like and then my mom yells at me because I'm her least favorite and I feel like she doesn't care for me. I've tried to kill myself multiple times but something has always stopped me from doing it. i need help but I'm too shy and afraid to talk to anyone about it. btw my dad and both my grandmas are the only people that make me not want to kill myself.
