I've wanted to kill myself for various reasons, but this is the last strawI've had to use a throwaway account and it is a deep, serious subject I don't want seen on my main account

I have autism and I feel like I let my country down by not registering to vote.  I am very anxious when it comes to new stuff and I can't do things like that without the help of others.  

I found out I still have time to register online and my dad is still awake but I just...can't.  I could ask him but I just feel tired and I don't feel like I'm ready yet.

I turned 18 in March, I'm on disability benefits, I'm unemployed and I have 1 GCSE, which was in maths, I only got a B, and that was my **best** grade.  I failed 3 GCSE's, as I only got 2 D's and an E.  I'm in college and I am not doing A-levels.  In fact, I am not doing anything useful because I end up coming out of most lessons due to meltdowns.  I want to focus on college before getting a job due to my levels of stress.  I don't think I'll be capable of doing A-levels and I'm worried the stress will make me suicidal.

Most of the people on my course are more successful than me.  I get jealous of students who can fill out simple forms I have problems with.  One of them comes from a town with a bad reputation and I was comparing myself to her and a couple of boys who often need more help.  I yelled out offensive terms towards the less capable students once during a meltdown, because I was frustrated that I was one of them.

I feel like I have to blame my chav personality for my fuck ups instead of my autism.  I feel like I shouldn't be in this world.  I am a chav but I had my life planned out to move to Swindon and work there.  Nope, that's not going to happen.  I don't want the locals to be grossed out by a scumbag.

I have had suicidal thoughts before due to my autism, my genetics (I am short, obese and I have no tits or ass and I am covered in acne from head to toe), my lack of intelligence and my general lack of class or empathy.  But this is the final straw.  If I didn't bother to vote, I have failed all young people and ignored the campaigns to get young people to vote.

I still feel 17 years old and not ready to vote yet.  I feel like it's too late.  I was going to put off voting until I was in my late 20's or 30's but now I feel like shit for not voting just **3 months after my 18th birthday**.

There was a model on Instagram who was telling everyone to vote.  I wrote a short angry comment and then unfollowed and blocked her.

All of my suicidal thoughts involve starving myself (because I am a fat ass with disgusting cellulite).  There are very few things that will make me postpone my suicide.

* People telling me I'm not chavvy/ugly/stupid etc. (This only works for a few days and then I'm suicidal again)
* Trips out (especially if it is in the West Country, which I have sadly never been to)
* A special event with a buffet
* Someone agreeing to help me with my future (help me move house, support me etc.)

edit: I don't feel suicidal anymore, but I might do in the future.  The feelings seem to be on and off.
