I've never self harmed besides trying to overdose butI started destroying my arm with a box cutter but I'm about to just slice this shit from wrist to elbow. It doesn't help that I'm drinking but I know I'm never going to stop feeling this way. I want to go-to the hospital and be admitted again but I have bills. It's only temporary the feeling after I get out, but I'm always just back where I started.
