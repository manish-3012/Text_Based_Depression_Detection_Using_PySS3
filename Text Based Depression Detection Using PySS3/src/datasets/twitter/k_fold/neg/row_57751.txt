I can't bear the thought of continuing my lifeI am thinking about killing myself. I've disappointed so many people. I don't fit in. I can't concentrate on my work. I can't find enjoyment in anything I do. Every year I hit new lows. I've been very depressed since I was 17 and I am now 26. 

I am in graduate school and I can't keep up with my work in this state of mind. I've done next to nothing for a year. I've had the degrading experience of having to let my superiors know that I have a depression problem in order for them to not hate me for what appears to be laziness. First I said I was quitting the phd program. Then I said I wanted to stay. I'm frustrating them enough. The general piece of advice I read is to simply take things slow. What if I don't have that luxury anymore because I've tested everyone's patience enough already?

All I do is consume resources and contribute nothing because I am always depressed and lacking motivation. I've tried meds, therapy, sports, gym, eating healthy. All have temporary effects that lose steam very quickly. Before I know it, I have to confront my true self again. Of course. What the fuck did I expect? 

I hate everyone and envy everyone at the same time. People always say "just live life and see what happens. we all die anyway." I think that shows a lot of ignorance. Sure, a lot of fortuitous things can happen in life, but why keep struggling for the off chance that something will good will happen? I've given my life countless shots, and I'm tired of having hope and then finding disappointment. 

I can't live just because family and friends will be hurt if I kill myself. Ultimately, the strong will survive and the weak will die off. If you are strong enough to accept my death, you'll make it. If not, then kill yourself too. There's no point in wallowing in a shithole because you're concerned about what someone else will think if you depart. Fuck this shit.
