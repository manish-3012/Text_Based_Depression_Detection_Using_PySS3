MY girlfriend cheated on me and ruined my family life, and my distant friend killed himself recently.I just don't know what to do, I feel sick to my stomach about what my girlfriend did to me. My friend was so bright smart and only 20 years old. I liked him so much and I feel like he never knew how much I appreciated him. I'm just so sad and heart broken by all of this.
