I just feel lonely and scaredI feel like being honest. But there is no one who I feel I can come out to right now about this.

I've been thinking about killing myself for a long while, and each time I feel more and more helpless and lost. I feel like my options for improving myself and my life have runned out. I live in a foreign country where I can't find a psychiatrist by myself easily, I have no truly close friends or family to talk about my suicidal thoughts with, and I just don't know where to get help. I take the train every morning, I just feel like one day, my mind will just make me jump.
