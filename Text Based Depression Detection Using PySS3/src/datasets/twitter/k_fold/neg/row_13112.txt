Please answer thisSo, I [13m] have been thinking about it for a while. I feel so worthless and my parents think Iâ€™m doing it for attention, is it a phase? I donâ€™t fucking know anymore, I ruin literally every little thing and I have nobody to talk to and i feel like everyone and everything would be better if I was gone. I can never sleep anymore, I donâ€™t really have much interests in things I used to love. I feel like a fucking awful person and Iâ€™m just so worthless thereâ€™s one person who wants to help me, who wants me to talk to them but I just canâ€™t, they have to much on them and I donâ€™t wanna add anything. Please reddit, is it a phase? Am I begging for attention? Am I just being dumb? I personally donâ€™t think so but what the fuck do I know
