Sorry just ventingYour all beautiful people, even if you donâ€™t realise it. Please stay safe, Iâ€™m so proud of you and how far you have come. i mean that with my whole heart.

Sorry I just have no one to talk to and I really feel like just venting, you can ignore this.

Im so sick of being alive, I hate it more than anything. I have to get up and go to school and pretend like everything is fine, my friends donâ€™t know about me being suicidal or that I self harm or that Iâ€™m depressed. Iâ€™m always so animated at school, and itâ€™s so fucking hard to stay like that. I donâ€™t want to worry them so I donâ€™t say anything. I try to be as kind as I possibly can, I try to accept everyone and be as supportive as possible but Iâ€™m still a fucking horrible person. Iâ€™m trans to, thatâ€™s my main struggle. I hear people constantly making fun of people like me and I tell myself that they arnt educated or that they just donâ€™t understand but they are still so fucking mean. I hate being trans I hate it so much. Iâ€™m not proud or special, Iâ€™m sick and Iâ€™m tired. My body disgusts me, I canâ€™t even walk without getting dysphoric because my hands brush against my hips. Speaking hurts too. I told my parents and they swept it under the carpet for 6 months, and are only starting to get better now. But it hasnâ€™t helped at all, my body is abhorrent. I canâ€™t wash myself I canâ€™t put my hands on my body I cant sit down without feeling terrible. I donâ€™t even have the energy to self harm anymore. And my parents donâ€™t know any of this, they expect me to function normally. Iâ€™m scared to tell anyone that Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself and Iâ€™m thinking about it again incase they tell my parents and it makes them even more worried about me.   
I have terrible social anxiety as well, I canâ€™t go anywhere alone. Iâ€™m so scared to come out or cut my hair or do anything because Iâ€™m just so terrified. It makes the things that should be easy so hard for me. I wish I could just be a cisgendered boy, I wish my life could be a little bit easier.  
im just so sick of living like this it makes me want to be sick. The only reason Iâ€™m still here is because I dont want my family to be sad. I wish they didnâ€™t love me so I could leave this place. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m going into the army, so I can pretend my death was a mistake, but I donâ€™t even know if they are going to accept a trans mistake like me.   
im sorry if you read that, please look out for yourself I believe in you.
