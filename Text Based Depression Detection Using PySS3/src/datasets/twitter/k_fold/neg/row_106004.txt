Ex called me up depressed and near suicide. What do I do?Okay, this is probably going to be long. I'll try to be as concise/succinct as possible...but I tend to get a little verbose (as you can probably already tell by this first sentence).

**So a little background**

I started dating my ex about 4 years ago and we ended up dating for about 2 years, then dated on-and-off for another year or two. We were both each others' "first love" and I still care for her very much. She is a wonderful, beautiful girl but has struggled with depression and low self-concept/esteem for almost as long as I have known her. I suspect it is a product of genetics (her mom and brother also were diagnosed with depression), a sexual assault, and an unstable home environment. Further compounding the issue, her brother (and mom, for that matter) became addicted to Oxycontin while I was dating her. She became vehemently opposed to my cannabis use (which she equated to her brother's oxycodone addiction) and any experimentation with drugs. 
She underwent a drastic personality change during the height of her depression (near the end of our relationship) - she was more insecure, less social, and exhibited most of the major symptoms of clinical depression. They were hard times for the both of us, but especially for her. She eventually ended our relationship, rationalizing her decision by saying that I only compounded and made her insecurities worse (She saw me as essentially the antithesis of herself...she perceived herself as ugly, unpopular, anti-social, on the lower end of the social spectrum [totally untrue btw]--while she perceived me as the attractive popular kid everybody liked and got along with).

**More background**
After she dumped me, she seemed to make somewhat of a rebound in terms of attitude and happiness. As horrible as I felt about not being with her anymore, I was at least somewhat happy she was no longer a danger to herself (or so I thought). What I later learned from her and from mutual friends shocked, scared, and angered me. She decided to cope with her depression by getting fucked up. Royally fucked up. She'd go out drinking every night, so she could black out. She started smoking weed, cigarettes, and meth daily. Okay, just kidding about the meth. Her depression didn't worsen, but it definitely didn't improve...she was just putting it on the side and trying to not deal with it (or something like that - I am no psychologist). Here is the worst of it though - I learned from her she unsuccessfully tried to overdose on hydrocodone twice, she had to go to the hospital and everything. 

**What happend a few days ago - the phone call**
She texted me out of the blue a couple days ago (there had been little contact between us for a few months at this point); I could tell she was down and wanted to talk. After a few texts back and forth I decided calling her would be easier and more effective. She was fucked out of her gourd on oxycodone and hydrocodone. It scared me. I am no stranger to the drugs, I don't have a problem with recreational use but I can say with 100% certainty she is psychologically and physiologically addicted to these terrible drugs. I talked with her and tried to calm her down, tell her things will be okay and I am here for her. She has suffered from migraine headaches since she was a pre-teen (same as her mom) so she is prescribed 25mg hydrocodone for her headaches (mom is prescribed oxycontin - that's how her brother got addicted).

She admitted to me that she has been snorting them *at least* once a day to "escape" from her life. I asked her why she did it, what was the point? She responded that she hates herself. I have no idea how to properly respond to this, but I do my best. I just tried to let her know she is NOT alone, that I care for her and I think she is an amazing person, and I'd be supportive and she has my shoulder to cry on etc, etc. 

But wait, I am not done. It gets more complicated. She also admitted to me that she still loves me and wants me back, she can see us together and sharing our lives together. Funny thing is, I had been trying to win her back for nearly the entire time we were broken up, but I finally got my shit together and stopped being a pathetic bitch - no more calls/texts to try to get her to hang out or let me take her on a date, I was finally moving on with my life and meeting new people. Maybe it was the passion of the moment or maybe I'm just stupid, but I admitted to her I share similar feelings...that I still love her and care for her (which I do...but I don't really see us getting back together again. However, that is another story for another time).

**Since the phone call**
At the end of our conversation, she told me something that chilled me to the bones, I don't think I'll ever forget how I felt when I heard her say it. She said something along the lines of, *"You saved my life tonight."* That scared me shitless (literally - I had violent diarhia afterword...they are most likely unrelated though). I really do love and care for this girl, and she has so much talent and light to offer to the world. The very thought of her killing herself makes me sick to my stomach. I made her promise me to text me the next day or give me a call just to say hi, I wanted to make sure she was okay and give her a reason to keep going (even if it's something as insignificant as giving her word to text me..maybe that sounds stupid but I was willing to do anything to make sure she didn't make a VERY stupid decision).

A few days has passed and we will text/call occasionally. She tells me she loves me more than life. Normally I would love to hear something like that, but I am worried. I am worried that the thought of a relationship with me is a big part of what is keeping her from killing herself. I moved 4 hours away from her a few months after we broke up, she has hurt me too many times for me to want to rekindle an old relationship and the long distance thing just isn't my piece of cake.

So, what do I do? She is addicted to opiates, is near suicidal, and thinks I want to rekindle our old relationship. She has talked to a shrink before, after her brother tried to kill himself when he was strung out on Oxy. It didn't work though, because she refused to talk. She wouldn't say a goddamn thing, just sat there for the entire hour in near silence. I love this girl and she brightened my life, all I want to do is help her to be happy and get out of this terrible nightmare. I have never felt so helpless and powerless. :(

**TL;DR: Ex-girlfriend called me up, would have committed suicide if I hadn't been there to talk with her. She feels very alone and worthless, turned to snorting pills to cope. *I think* that a major reason she has a reason to live is the thought about getting back together with me, which I don't see happening. Delicate situation, what do I do?**
