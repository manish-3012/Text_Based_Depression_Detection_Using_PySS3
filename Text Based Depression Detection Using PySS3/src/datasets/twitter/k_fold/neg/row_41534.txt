Is anybody else suicidal for super irrational reasons?I'm suicidal because I'm a tall woman. For the record, I'm twenty four years old, but I've been having these feelings since I was in ninth grade. I can't seem to stop them from coming, and I can't even tell where they come from. It's a super irrational thing to be suicidal over, and people don't take it seriously. It's 100% the root cause of my depression, and medication doesn't work for me because it's part of me that I can't change. 

People don't get how much it affects me. I have breakdowns between 3-4 times a day and I barely leave my house. I had to quit my job because I didn't want to be seen out in public. I measure myself compulsively, between 5-10 times every week. And of course, it doesn't help that it's the first thing people comment on whenever they see me. And, of course, it's not something I can complain about because people would think I'm "humble-bragging" since apparently being tall is desired for some reason. And I can't share with them even a fraction of how much it affects me and my life, because they'd just be horrified.

I don't know what's wrong with me or why this has taken over my life. I just want to be shorter, but since that can never ever happen in any way, it makes me feel hopeless. I'd honestly just rather die because I know that this problem will probably never go away on its own and I cant live the rest of my life like this.
