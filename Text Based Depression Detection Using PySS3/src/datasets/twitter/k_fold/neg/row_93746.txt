My feelings. I guess. (Sorry it's such a mess.)
I'm just constantly sad, I hide my real feelings from people. Noone really knows this part of me, first time really letting all of this out.
I have been feeling this way for a long time now, year or so.
Most of this started after I lost my gf who I was with for a few years, to add. Then I found someone else who then let go of me, yesterday infact. Maybe it's my fault, maybe not. Guess I did okay to have them in the first place though.
I feel so lonely sometimes too...Scared off the outside world I guess, don't really want to try anymore. Also noise, I really hate noise, makes me go crazy..I enjoy silent things...
I am really scared to actually hurt myself though. Incase it goes wrong..
Maybe I shouldn't be saying this here, but I'm just trying to write what I think and feel. I do sometimes have a feeling to just...shoot, I guess. Sometimes just want to go on a 'rampage'. (probably fail at that too.) I may sound like a dick but this is how I feel. This will all fuck me over one day, won't it. But I guess others have felt this way before too.
This post is a mess and I am deeply sorry and I'm sorry for making you have to read this.
