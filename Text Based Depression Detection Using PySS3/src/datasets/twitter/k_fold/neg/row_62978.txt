I wrote a poem of sorts about my suicide attempt, can you tell me your honest thoughts?TL;DR;

Do you know pain, do you sadness inside of your brain?

forever an entity, living in enmity

Do you know how hard it is too refrain.

&amp;#x200B;

A hollow shell pulling itself through a world with no existence,

hard to keep your distance,

finding roads to feel emotion, the avenues with most resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

The surface is full of life,

deep down it's cold filled with heart ache and sorrow.

Always fighting to survive,

Hold your head high there's always tomorrow!!

&amp;#x200B;

Getting tough now, you don't need help you'll be fine!

Clocks still ticking, it gets better just give it some time,

Your waiting patiently moving closer to the edge,

Been years now, when does it get better please give him a sign.

&amp;#x200B;

Lights diminishing, losing belief, starting to doubt,

The darkness is daunting, you've started looking for a way out,

Each thought darker than the emptiness of space,

They're just thoughts, nothing to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

The surface is full of life,

deep down it's cold filled with heart ache and sorrow.

Always fighting to survive,

Hold your head high... there's always tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

There's always someone that has it worse right?

a crushing mindset this is your fight,

disregarding your problems for years,

Until you decide this will be your final night.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth can be a hard pill to swallow,

Some pills are easy the throat felt hollow,

close those eyes now time to sleep,

Sweet dreams young man, nobody knows what will follow.

&amp;#x200B;

The surface is full of life,

deep down it's cold filled with heart ache and sorrow.

losing the fight to survive,

This time... there will be no tomorrow.
