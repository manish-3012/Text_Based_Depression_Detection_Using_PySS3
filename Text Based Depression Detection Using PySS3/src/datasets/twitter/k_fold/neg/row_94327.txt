Easy (donâ€™t really care about painless) ways to kill yourself as a teen? (Alternatively: the final adventure of the worldâ€™s most burnt out GiFtEd KiD)Note: Iâ€™m not looking for therapy. Iâ€™m done with life once and for all. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized before: no effect. Iâ€™m exhausted, lonely, and tired above all else. Let me explain.

# Part I: Causes.

For the first few years of my life, I was supposedly smarter than everyone else. In grade 1, I was doing high-school level math without anyone else's help (my family couldn't afford anything except for public school at the time). I got moved to a containment program for GiftedÂ®â„¢ kids just like me, and I was having a blast! I learned how to code at a stupidly young age, conducted some pretty cool experiments, and did a lot of amazing stuff!

Unfortunately, I started developing a superiority complex. I turned from someone that loved learning because math and CS was fun to someone that loved comparing above all else; my merit came from quantification. I had to have more awards, more prestige, more medals, more ECs, more *everything* than other kids. I think that a lot of it comes from the fact that my family was never really middle-class; we've always been struggling. I've always had a mindset that I needed to prove everyone wrong.

I was stuck in the Gifted program until I got accepted to what I think is the only program more toxic than that: IBMYP. In middle school, I went from seeing kids that loved learning (and didn't really care about competition) to seeing kids that were the complete opposite; that's what cemented my superiority complex. We never really had friends there; middle school was only a place where we had to compete for everything. We had to get into the best high school (to get into the best university), marks (even though they didn't mean anything), and stupid extracurriculars. Luckily, I made it to the top high school in the region (I would reveal its name but I'm stupidly scared that someone will find this alt and ship me off to the mental health program at our hospital again), and graduated with some pretty prestigious awards. At that point, I'd been coding for about 5 years, and I had one dream university program (really my only real dream): software engineering at the university of Waterloo. It had everything that I valued: a rigorous curriculum, amazing work experience and people, and a crazy cool math department. The only issue? Itâ€™s the most difficult eng program to get into in the whole frickin country. 

As such, I started seeing it as my only goal in life, eventually looking at admission as the only possible path to success. More importantly though, I started seeing others not as people but as numbers: the only thing I care about it how likely they are to make it into the program, and how (if) I have to beat them at anything. Iâ€™ve lost all sense of reality and emotion; I put on the worldâ€™s greatest show for my parents (maybe I should pursue acting if this whole suicide thing doesnâ€™t work out) at home, and school isnâ€™t much better. 

# Part II: The now. 

Anyways, long after I started comparing likelihoods of making it into uw, I started to shift my vision. I started seeing all the places that I was lacking (I love to build apps and cool server infra and tooling, not â€œtrendyâ€ stuff like machine learning and blockchain). I started seeing how much better other seemed to be; they started racking up awards and accomplishments that I thought I was supposed to get. They started getting into programs that Iâ€™d never be able to afford in a million years; and started getting into amazing positions as a result. 

Iâ€™m now a stagnant creature. I code, sleep, maybe study, and thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™ve fallen into an endless cycle of anxiety and depressions, and I canâ€™t get out. 

See, this is usually the part when Iâ€™d ask for help or something. The problem is, Iâ€™ve been helped for too often. My brainâ€™s just wired wrong. Every time I get lifted out of the hole, my head just starts seeing negatives again and I fall even deeper. Iâ€™ve tried to keep this stuff from my best friends (only one of them actually knows about this alt account, and I honestly love him so frickin much. Agam, if youâ€™re reading this, Iâ€™m sorry. I really am. I know you tried to help, but I canâ€™t be helped anymore. Iâ€™m sorry.)

Iâ€™m done with life. I canâ€™t go on. I donâ€™t have any real chance at getting the one dream that Iâ€™ve wanted since I was 11. Every time I see hope, there are a million bullets put into my head from competition. I wanted to build things, but I got dragged into a lifetime of politics. 

Donâ€™t try to help. It wonâ€™t matter. Iâ€™ll always be back to square one. Emotions donâ€™t work on me anymore. Guilt doesnâ€™t work on me anymore. Iâ€™m nothing more than a shell of a human: someone whose sole purpose is to get into UW SWE. 

# Part III: Suicide. 

Iâ€™ve tried this before, to no avail. Back in my gifted days, I used to study anatomy from this one textbook (I didnâ€™t have any electronics lol) and I tried stabbing myself in the knee. That didnâ€™t do anything except break it and land me a trip into the hospital. 

Does anyone have any methods of suicide that donâ€™t involve any invasive procedures or things like that? Iâ€™m planning on building my own exit bag or hanging but Iâ€™m not too sure. I already have my suicide notes finished (theyâ€™re all really long; I guess the perfectionist in me wanted to tag along for the death ride); I just need to do the deed, I guess. 

Thank you for your help,

A very sad 15 year old.
