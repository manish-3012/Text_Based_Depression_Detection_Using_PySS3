I just kill myselfI have been battling numerous chronic illness which have gotten worse. The back and leg pain is sooo bad. I have spend most of my time at home for the past year which has made me a bit agoraphobic. My anxiety is so bad and now since my last spine surgery it feel as if my head isnt on straight, like i cannot think clearly. Sometime a have these delusions or weird thoughts, but im good at hiding it in public. I feel very sad. My entire life was a struggle. Over 50 fucking surgeries and still nothing has gotten any better. I thought i would get through college, but had to drop out. I have ativan, 76mg of dilaudid, and some oxy. Im planning to end it tonight. It just feels like the right thing to do.
