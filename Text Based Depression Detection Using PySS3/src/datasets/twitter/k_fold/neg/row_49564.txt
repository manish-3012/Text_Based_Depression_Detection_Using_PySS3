Iâ€™ve been living the past five years for others.If it was up to me, Iâ€™d have killed myself so very, very long ago. Many close encounters and never went through with them just because Iâ€™m not selfish enough to do so yet. Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Used to self harm but stopped cause people started getting worried. Used to drink till I dropped but stopped cause of the meds. I donâ€™t have a coping mechanism anymore. I feel it coming soon. Life goes on. People forget.
