OverreactingI'm so quick to panic. I invest myself in my relationships too heavily. I'm in my mid-20's and have been on this rollercoaster so many times, it's exhausting. I've tried in the past, but only ever landed myself in the psych ward. I feel trapped in an endless loop of insecurity and self-destruction.

I had a lot of ambitions coming out of college, but I don't know that I have the strength of mind and character to do what I want to do. I'm watching my dreams and my relationships with my family and my girlfriend of almost a year crumble from beneath me, especially in the past few days. I am frustrated and lonely. I don't know how likely it is that I'll take action, but I tend to surprise even myself with the things that I say and do.
