I told my mom that her wanting a baby (me) was a selfish act.My mother took fertility treatments and tried for over a year to get pregnant. Now she is religious and believes in god and all that. Doesnâ€™t that mean that god didnâ€™t want me to exist if she couldnâ€™t conceive naturally??? I never asked to he here. I never asked to exist but yet here I am all because my mother wanted a â€œbaybeeeâ€ that she would end up treating like shit most of its life. Just plain selfish if you ask me.
