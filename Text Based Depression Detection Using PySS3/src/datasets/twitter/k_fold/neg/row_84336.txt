I just wish I was a girlSo I'm not sure if I should be here or not. My name is Ally, I'm a 21 year old trans girl. I've attempted suicide once in 2018 and was in a mental hospital January of 2020. 

I've been on hormones for 7 months and started taking them November 19th, 2019, a day before my birthday. 

I know I can't attempt suicide. Because just going to the mental hospital at all had people worried about me, and that could lead to me not having hormones anymore. 

I have to see this through, and I want to. But being trans is so tiring. I feel while a lot of us pass so many of us look just a bit off. 

I know I don't have a super manly face. I know I actually look feminine. But I still look like a boy. 

I know so many say you don't need to pass, but I do. Gender isn't just something I like. It's attached to me. I feel like I'll always come short of all the other girls. 

Sometimes I feel like, after all this is done. I'll still look not quite right. And this is where I'll be.
