I realized Iâ€™m better off deadI keep coming back to the thought that people, my friends, would be better if I never talked to them. Iâ€™m always so selfish, so worried, so anxious, so weird, so abrupt, and I hardly think about anyone but myself. I always keep thinking everyoneâ€™s better if I just not involve myself, because Iâ€™m always going to let everyone down. I try to fix myself but Iâ€™m just so bad. I get so emotional so fast. I try to cut contact, and I think about doing it, but I can never bring myself to. I always go back to talking to people, even if it just stresses them out and brings them down. So Iâ€™d, itâ€™d, and theyâ€™d be better off if I just died. I feel scared and sad thinking about it, but I donâ€™t know. Even if people were sad at first, I wouldnâ€™t keep bringing them down constantly. Itâ€™d be temporary, opposed to the entire time they know me.
