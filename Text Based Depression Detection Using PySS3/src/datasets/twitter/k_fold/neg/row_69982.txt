Just want to say goodbye.I just want to thank everyone who posts here to try and help people in need. I've posted here a few times with different accounts over the last few years and the friendly people on this sub have been the only thing keeping me alive for so long. However it's time for me to say goodbye. I've tried to be happy and be better but it's just not gonna happen.
