Iâ€™m just useless and my girlfriend wants to break up.I add nothing to anyoneâ€™s life. I donâ€™t have a job, my parents kicked me out, Iâ€™m 12 hours away from anyone who loves me and I have nothing else. I dropped out of highschool because of stress and I canâ€™t get a job. I put everything I have into a relationship and she wants to break up with me. I have nothing, and I donâ€™t have any ideas for becoming something. Suicide is my only option like I donâ€™t want this to be a sob story because itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s my fault, for everything. I just canâ€™t live with myself because of that. I have nothing.
