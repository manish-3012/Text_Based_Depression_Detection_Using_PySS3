Getting Closer and Closer every dayThousands of dollars behind on bills, rent is due in a couple days and my wife and I can't even stop fighting long enough to talk about how we are going to try and fix things. I don't know what to do and I don't want to be alive when we get evicted but then I look at my kids and I just cry. Part of me doesn't want to leave them.. but there's a part that just.. doesn't care.. I guess.. I've struggled on and off with the thought of killing myself for at least a decade but it's never been this bad before. I've always been the kind of person to just run away when shit gets tough but this time I have nowhere to run to..

Please tell me it can get better. Please help me see it because right now I just want to be gone.
