Trying to sleepBut I just canâ€™t stop thinking about it. I have work in 5 hours. This is every single night.. I wish I just had the guts. Because itâ€™s the fear that stops me otherwise I would I would I would. I wonder if that fearless day will ever come.. just a moment of pain for endless peace. No more fear. No more judgement.. no more hurting....
