Mostly need to vent. I'm rather confused and sad.It's strange.  I have a good life.  I'm in high school with good grades, I've never experienced the death of a loved one, I have a loving family, a roof over my head... pretty much the ideal package for a kid.  But for some reason, at seemingly random times, I just get so fucking sad, sometimes to the point where I fantasize about offing myself, but I haven't resorted to any self harm outside of a brief faze where I cut myself.  While I don't know why this is for certain, I have some ideas.  First, I can say that the closer I get to adulthood, the more I see just how horribly fucking nasty this world is in all its operations.  You have to constantly outclass and compete with others for promotions, money, friends... fucking everything.  And with just one missed payment or other little slip: Bam.  You're homeless.  It's all just so nerve wracking and awful that I guess I just don't feel like dealing with it.  A life like that just doesn't seem to be worth living.  I am aware that there is plenty of time to actually go out and find something you like to do and make friends... but is that really worth it for all the misery one suffers from all the aforementioned aspects?  My thoughts say no.  Another thing that really gets to me is that I'm just fucking terrible at all academic skills that will actually land you a decent job in today's society.  The only reason I have good grades in school is because it's ludicrously easy.  I get 2-3 short assignments a week.  I want more than anything to pursue a job in technology, engineering, mathematics, science and the like.  But I just seemed to get all of the worst possible genetic traits for any such field.  The only things I'm truly good at are reading and writing, and neither of those skills get you shit in the real world.  Sure, I could work hard and learn something else, but like I said before, *what's the point*?  It's just so much damn effort that could very well be for nothing in the end.  I'm also terrible at making friends.  For the first 13 years of my life, I barely got to interact with other kids at all, and it's taken its toll.  This point I've pretty much accepted and gone numb too, but it still hurts deep knowing that I am widely incapable of forging the intimate relationships that I so desperately wish I had.

All in all, I just have the most powerful feeling within me that I **will** fail in life.  I just don't have the tools to succeed, so I don't see the point in trying.  But at the same time, I loathe the thought of taking my own life.  I don't want to be a coward... What I find myself wishing for daily is a **reason** to die.  I fantasize about it more often than I'd like to admit.  Giving my life in a war (any war, for any side, I don't care), Being assassinated while giving a speech, being murdered while trying to save a loved one from a mugger... These are just some of them.  Sometimes I wonder if I should just enlist out of high school and hope that death comes swiftly.  I want to die, but I want there to be a reason  for it.  Due to this, I guess you could say I'm not suicidal (yet... no telling how bad it could get in the coming years), but I due think I may be depressed, even though I am able to put aside and ignore these feelings most of the time.

That's basically it.  You don't really need to respond if you don't feel like it (though I would find it to be a pleasant surprise if you did).  I just wanted to get it off my chest to someone.
