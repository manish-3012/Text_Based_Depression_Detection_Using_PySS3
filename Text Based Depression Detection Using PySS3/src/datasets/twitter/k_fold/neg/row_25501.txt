It just makes more and more sense as time goes on.I have times when I spiral out of control and want to kill myself, and then am okay after. And then it happens again as a cycle.
But the scary times are when I'm just going about my day and I think about how I want to die and I'll probably commit suicide sooner rather than later. It's becoming a more and more frequent thought, and it doesn't just occur when I'm out of control. It's like a thing that sounds more and more tempting as time goes on.
I have physical health issues, mental health issues (and my bpd is out of control lately making me feel like I'm crazy), relationship issues, I could go on. For example my bf is an angel but there's so many things wrong that I have to break up with him and break his heart. And it's gonna make me wanna die even more because I barely have any friends and he was a big support in my life and won't be anymore.
The only things holding me back from dying are a little fear and not wanting to hurt my soon-to-be ex, and another person, my only close friend. But it doesn't seem worth the price of staying alive. I've looked for help and I have not been helped.
