Seeing an escort made me suicidal againI was doing OK for a few months I still has not problems but I coped well. I turned 18 recently and I did the usual stuff like buying lots of weed and alcohol with my inheritance money I finally got access to. On top of that I figured visiting an escort might be fun because it's legal in my country so I figured that people have casual sex all the time so it must be fun without any emotional connection.

I was absolutely devasted in hindsight by not true that was. I mean there's is no emotional connection but the interactions are genuine. For example when I said I'm kinda shy and how she instantly changed her way of talking and comforted me I figured she could easily get away by also not doing that. I thought it was going to be just pleasure like in porn or something but it was a lot of caring by kissing and saying stuff like I'm in a safe place and goddamn that's right and it's the most brutal thing. The whole thing was made so much worse by how clearly she did care about my psychological needs. 

It was the most thoughtful, caring and understanding way another person has ever interacted with me and that's devastating. I haven't had any friends for roughly the last 30% of my life so jumping from nothing to simulating passionate love was too much for me to take when I don't have any people than can provide me with that intimacy and care without paying.
