back to having no oneJust kinda sucks to know I wasted these past 2 years trying to build strong friendships, just to realize I wasted my time and I mean nothing to anyone. 

Even when telling my former best friend how I attempted last week, just getting no real love and support they used to give me. Guess everyone got sick of me. Can't blame them really I guess. I shouldn't have tried to build friendships and relationships again, I just became a burden and more of a fool.
