Iâ€™m doneI need a really good reason right now not to sling a rope round my fucking neck and cease this monotonous endless tedious bullshit. Nobody will read this but I couldnâ€™t give a fuck. Just needed to get my anger out somewhere instead of screaming at my missus or calling my ex. Itâ€™s all pointless and we are all alone. Fuck this complete and total bullshit. Lifeâ€™s a gift? No, itâ€™s a fucking curse. I need to cure the disease of my life. Rotting and putrid endless shit.
