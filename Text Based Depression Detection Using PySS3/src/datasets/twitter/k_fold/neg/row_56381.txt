anyone else?Even if I werenâ€™t sad, why should I be forced to live, to play this game? I did not sign up, and Iâ€™m certainly not having fun. Iâ€™m a biochemical meat robot, as is everyone else. so, why not turn myself off, along with this terrible, meaningless experience? if i video game sucked, you wouldnâ€™t keep playing. so why are people expected to keep living when life sucks? â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ yea... maybe, but so too might the shitty video game. probly a better bet to toss it, though. my life is no more meaningful than an ants, and neither is yours. committing suicide is the ultimate fuck you to a universe â€œcruelâ€ enough to have natural selection mechanisms that produce so much suffering. whew. ill be gone soon
