Just a disappoint and loser of a person venting (0 structure just wall of text)have never used Reddit before, honestly donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Itâ€™s highly unlikely anyone will see this or give a fuck but just wanna get shit off my chest.

Currently am a student and seems like everything is going wrong. These online classes have completely screwed me over and I have no clue how to recover. The grades I used to have were the only thing that was even remotely good about me. My problems are minuscule compared to everyone else on here and Iâ€™m not even suicidal, just wish I never existed. 

Iâ€™m lazy as fuck and have zero drive whatsoever to get my life back together. I have no friends and nothing that genuinely makes me happy and Iâ€™m not even in adulthood yet, if I canâ€™t even survive this I have full confidence that in the real world Iâ€™m going to struggle even more. I have a loving family which is why I fucking hate myself, Iâ€™m a disappointment and a failure. My sister and my parents are all hard working and Iâ€™m the exact opposite, shame is eating me from the inside but because I have no motivation I donâ€™t care enough to fix it. 

I hate doing this shit too because I feel like Iâ€™m just an attention seeker and Iâ€™m making a mockery of people with real struggles. I donâ€™t have depression or want to commit suicide, I just wish I was never born so that I wouldnâ€™t disappoint my family. My parents got me a therapist which didnâ€™t help me in the slightest because I canâ€™t open up to people and I felt bad about wasting their money. Theyâ€™ve done everything but because Iâ€™m so lazy and hopeless nothing works and at this point I donâ€™t believe that anything can help me. 

Going to cut it off here, Iâ€™m just repeating myself and getting nowhere. If anyone read whatever the fuck I just wrote I hope that you donâ€™t relate to me in any way, and if you do I sincerely hope things get better for you.
