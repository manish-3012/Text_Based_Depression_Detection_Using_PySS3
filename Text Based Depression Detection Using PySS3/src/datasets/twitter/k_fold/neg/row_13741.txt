now i really know my "loved ones" don't care about me.I isolated myself for a month. I cut myself regularly. I asked my dad if I can go see a therapist bcs I want to live. I started wearing long sleeved clothing everyday and the people I told abt my cutting asked me, "Why do you wear long sleeve clothes so much? It's so hot here" and my heart just dropped to my stomach. I can just feel like there. What the actual fuck? I thought I was delusional that they didn't care but. they actually, didnt. Idk if it was on purpose just to trigger me bcs i remember my friend using a meme picture of a person cutting themselves (emoji) and I was just shocked that she used it in the groupchat so i stayed silent. Upon seeing me being silent she asked "Isn't the emoji pretty" as if to make sure I see it. I just feel like they don't take me seriously unless I stab myself first. Why is everyone doubting that I'm suicidal? I'm just so confused and lost rn. There's no one here. They just want to "help" so I don't die but then how could I when I live like this? I could jump off a bridge rn
