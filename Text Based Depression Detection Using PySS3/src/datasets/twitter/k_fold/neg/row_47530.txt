I don't wanna do this anymoreeverything that I hoped for is gone,everything that I wanted and loved is gone,i can't control anything in my life everything that I was afraid of is now normal to me,one side I don't care about anything at all and the other side of my head is telling me that the non existent worth of my life is worthful,I fucking hate this worthless existence,I tried to do everything that I could,I thought it could get better but it doesn't,will it ever?
