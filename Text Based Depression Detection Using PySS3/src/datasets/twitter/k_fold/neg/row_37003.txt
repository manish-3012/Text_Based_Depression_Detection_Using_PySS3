Suicidal but scared of death itself?I just can't take it. I feel like I'm drowning in my own words and I'm trapped inside myself, but that's a whole other story for another time. I don't even have a question or anything. I just need this somewhere. I want to die. More than anything, I think. But I'm scared of death, what's it like? How does the world keep going after? That sort of thing. I wish I had never existed. I would never have experienced life at all, both good and bad times would have never existed. And without experience, I wouldn't have to worry about missing out on stuff. I'm merely existing, with no real life in anything I do, yet the thought of it ending sends me into a downward spiral 

In a couple words, I wish I had never existed. Absolutely nothing is worth the fear I have every day over dying. Ironically, dying seems to be the only solution.
