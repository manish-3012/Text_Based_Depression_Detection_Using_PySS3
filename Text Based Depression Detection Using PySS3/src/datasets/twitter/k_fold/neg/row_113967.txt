I just realized that my narcissistic family is the main reason I feel like I can't kill myselfI was born and grew up in an abusive environment. I was abused at home by my "family" (phisically, emotionally), I was bullied at school and harassed on the street and in hospital. A few years ago I went no contact with everyone in my family that's full of narcissists, except my father. We have a toxic codependent relationship, but I'm the only one who's aware of this.

Here's the problem: if I'd kill myself, my father would inevitably tell the whole "family" about it and I would give them indirectly a great, great satisfaction, because they will feel like won the War they created between me and them. So it's like, after all these years, they still manage to control me by not letting me taking my own life, because that would make them happy, and I don't want to make them happy, because they don't deserve that.

At the same time, I simply can't move forward neither. The life I have right now is not worth living. It was never worth living. I've been through a lot and I just feel like I'm too damaged to ever function properly. I do have dreams, but I desperately need instant gratification - and I don't know how to get that.

It's like my abusive "family" didn't let me live my life when I wanted to do that. And now, when I finally want to give up, they don't let me kill myself neither.

What to do if you want to live your life, but you're now allowed to do that?
