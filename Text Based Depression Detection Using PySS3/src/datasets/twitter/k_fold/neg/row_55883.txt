Dear future wifeHey darling.
I'll never get to meet you, but damn I know you would've been a beautiful woman. Inside and out. I would've loved you so much... I really would've. But the pain is too much. I can't live with it like this. I know you'll never understand, and that's ok...

I really hope you get someone who'll love you like I would've. You deserve the best, and that's why it's good that I'm going out of your life. All I would've been is an abusive piece of shit like my father was. 

I love you. I love you so fucking much. I wish nothing but the best for you.
