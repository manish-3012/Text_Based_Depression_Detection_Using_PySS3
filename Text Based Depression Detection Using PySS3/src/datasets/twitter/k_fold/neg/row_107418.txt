So much for a second chanceI'm 21. I am a Junior now at a state college, recently transferred. I've been feeling more depressed lately, it's uncontrollable, even when I should be happy, it always feels like something is looming above me. My GPA has dropped drastically, I went from being a straight A student to getting slightly above a 2.5. I don't know if I suffer from depression. About a year ago I went to the doctor once to see what he thought, we took some blood tests and they said they would call me back but they never did. I figured since they didn't contact me, then it shouldn't too serious. (Basically,  I think it's also not really worth hearing if they don't want to tell me.) More recently I've been using my school's free counseling program, but that just made me feel more confused and upset with myself. I've tried to commit suicide before once, I just felt like this feeling wouldn't go away. It still hasn't, my suicidal thoughts keep getting worse.

I feel worthless, unaccomplished, alienated. I just feel like shit. I feel like I have no one. I don't really have anyone to talk to about this, usually the internet is my only escape/distraction but now its haunting me. I can't talk to my family about it since we're not really close, I don't talk to my dad, he doesn't really acknowledge that I'm there, and my mom constantly looks down on me and never fails to mention how horrible I've become as a person. I don't talk with my siblings either, they have openly expressed that they don't want to hear any of it. I don't really have friends, I find it hard staying close to people, even if I do try to become their friend, they usually end up not speaking to me unless they want me to listen to their problems. It is pretty frustrating since when I try to talk  to them about mine I usually get the cold shoulder. I am also in a relationship, I practically have known my significant other for more than a decade, we have been in an on again off again relationship for about two years now. He is my best friend. I hesitant in saying that he could possibly be the only thing that makes me feel bright again, only because whenever I say that he feels like there is so much pressure in keeping me happy. This year I promised myself to stay committed to trying to have happy thoughts and getting my life together for the sake of my relationship and whatever friends I have left. Unfortunately, my friends have distanced themselves more from me and I've been bringing down my boyfriend with my emotional instability. I know we're going to break up soon. I know if we don't that we should for his sake. Sometimes I feel like I'm the bane of his existence. I know that he will be happier without me. All his problems probably exist because of mine. I'm just so scared right now to lose the one person that has always been there for me and I'm willing to sacrifice anything and everything I have if that meant he was happy. 

After typing this up I realized, despite all my sadness I don't really have much to say. I don't really know anymore. I don't know what to do with my life. I don't know what I can do for my SO, for my friends, for my family. I'm just so lost. I feel like if I end it all now that there wouldn't be a difference and that I'll just be freeing everyone from me.
