I need help for a friend.I play with a guy online and he has mentioned suicide before. We recently got into a fight with some other friends and someone I knew for longer then him blocked me. I was mad and so I blocked my friend one. The thing is Right after the fight he had said thank you to me for siding with him and that if he had lost me or the other friends in the fight he would have committed suicide. I said ok. The next day another friend I trusted and who is 19 said he had experience and that friend one was probably lying.

I am only 13 and I donâ€™t know what to do.
