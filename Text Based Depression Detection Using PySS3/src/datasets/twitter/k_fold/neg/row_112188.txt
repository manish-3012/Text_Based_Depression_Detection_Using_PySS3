The thought of my death brings me a peace I've never felt. Between now (22) and when I'm 30, whenever I decide.. I won't be here.I always knew I was different. I knew I was fucked way before I got here. I've just about had it with my life. I haven't been formally diagnosed but I've struggled with short term memory loss since I was a kid. This brings so much anxiety into my life and I cannot be myself because I really don't know who I am. I want to die, and I already know how I'd do it.  

So it's just waiting on me, really is a shame. I wanted to be somebody and when I try I fail. Every single time. I hate myself. It'll be a huge shock for everyone in my family but I always knew I had this coming. Until that day.
