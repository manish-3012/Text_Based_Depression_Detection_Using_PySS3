Iâ€™m not sure if I have clinical Depression.Iâ€™m 13, I do great in school, generally getting Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s on my report card, but Iâ€™m so lonely and sad all the time so I started getting Câ€™s and Bâ€™s. Iâ€™m not happy with it. Iâ€™m not giving my 100% and I want to, but I just canâ€™t find the motivation. I feel like none of my friends care about my sadness lately and it makes me feel like Iâ€™m burdening them. In fact, my friends are the reason Iâ€™m sad. I feel like Iâ€™m the one always starting the fights and I feel like nobody cares about me anymore. I feel so lonely all day, and cry myself to sleep at night. I show tons of symptoms of clinical Depression and have never told my parents; my brother is depressed, and when he told my parents, they got him into therapy. Iâ€™m not afraid to tell my parents, but I donâ€™t know what to say.
