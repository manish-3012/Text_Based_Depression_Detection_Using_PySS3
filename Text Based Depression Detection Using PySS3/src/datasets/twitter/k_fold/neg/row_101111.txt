Divorce is hard. I've measured rope out a few times in preparation of ending this misery.The past few months have been grueling and there's been so much confusion and hatred and just disgust and I'm so tired. 

I truly don't have it in me to do any of the things that are going to be asked of me after the divorce is finalized. I spent a few weeks with my family and upon the first night of staying there, I noticed rope in the garage. At night I went out to measure it to see if it was long enough to make a noose. I tried to remember how to tie one and I did and I placed it around my neck. It felt.... comfortable and I knew it was only a matter of time. 

Since being back in the same area as my soon-to-be ex-wife, it's only been harder and harder seeing that this could all be fixed but it's basically over and my son...my beautiful son...he's getting so smart and big and I won't be able to see him every second of the day like I have for the past 2 years. 

She makes an excellent point of "this needs to happen now" because he's so young. But...maybe it's for the best that I do the thing that feels most comforting to me and getting some of that rope out. If I die now, he won't really know why until later if my family or anyone else decides to tell him. 

I know it's selfish but in all honesty everything I've ever done has been for the pure benefit of everyone around me. I am the least selfish person I know by choice and every decision is informed by what I think is best for everyone. I just wish that someone out there that's close to me would issue that same.kind of response. It all just feels so natural and comforting to know that I can do this one thing to ultimately make me feel better. 

My future is floating around me with pockets of confusion and hatred and stress and loneliness and misery. I can see light at the end of the tunnel but Ive been trapped in this tunnel for so long that it only feels right to just want to keep placing blocks in front of me to block out that light for good and just sleep. 

I **really** hate all of this.
