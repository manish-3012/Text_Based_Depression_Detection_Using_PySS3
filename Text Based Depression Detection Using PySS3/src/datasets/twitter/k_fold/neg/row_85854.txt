not an interesting titleTwo days ago I attempted suicide by overdose. I didn't succeed, but what I did succeed at was getting a seizure in the middle of the night and vomiting a few times. I feel like an inconvenience to people, but I also am by all of this. 

People say that they're glad that I'm alive, but I don't even want to be. In the hospital while I was getting tests and such, the medical staff even complimented my health. What good is a good health if I don't want to live, it's wasteful. Why can't I just give my good health to someone who actually wants to live, there are so many people who want to. 

Eh, rant over, this is fucking idiotic.
