Someone kill meFor the love of God have mercy and fucking kill me. I hate this world and everything that's on it. I fucking hate this, every little thing. The tedious sayings, the constant hospitalization and loneliness. Someone please just kill me for fuck sake, it's too much for me too handle. I thought it was bad but it got so much worse. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate my life. I've heard it all and it does nothing, none of this helps. This loneliness, this bitterness, this grief, these fantasies, these lies, this depression, the lonely nights, the constant arguments, the ever growing hatred for myself, this pain. It's not worth it, it's just not worth it.
