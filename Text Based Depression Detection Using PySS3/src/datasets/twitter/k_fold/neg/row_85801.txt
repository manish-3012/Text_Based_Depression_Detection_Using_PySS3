Help me make a safety plan?So I don't have many friends. Last time I felt the worst I ever have and really close to ending things I texted my best friend at the time to come over. She turned me down because she was tired and had a test the next day. I managed to fall asleep that night, who knows how, and felt less awful in the morning, who knows why, but learned I can't rely on anyone to be there for me. What can I do next time? I haven't felt that bad since then, yet, but I've also started being unable to sleep when I do feel bad, so I have no way back.
