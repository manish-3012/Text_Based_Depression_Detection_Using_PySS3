Holy crap Iâ€™m backIs that what this account will be? Pouring my heart out to strangers high on my latest fix, low on my latest failure, left to plateau with my head just above water? Iâ€™m breathing but barely, and too much. Breath caught in my throat in almost sobs, a deep breath in for that life saving smoke, that smothers all else, even at the cost on my conscious. Such expensive habits, only slightly more effective than nothing at all. But I cling to my vices for just on more step down and I may actually cry, whether I allow it or not. But the world doesnâ€™t stop for misery, work isnâ€™t canceled for the headache from long repressed tears. I only wish I had enough left of me to remember how I survived before my addictive indulgence. I push these feelings out by force, blasting my ear drums into an even sadder state, erasing and rewriting until the feelings come out just right, until Iâ€™ve run out of steam and lie helplessly in bed as though Iâ€™m in a coma waiting for someone to pull the plug. Even when nothingâ€™s happened today to cause such a spike, my medications taken, my life unchanged. No worse for wear, but no better. Is this my lowest? A faceless stranger with a story so tragic only for you to see and wish you could help, and wishing for help yourself. Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m writing here again. Perhaps I crave that level state, not feeling good but no longer feeling as though I could just will my soul to leave my body and for once, truly rest. That would be it, the depressing icing on this sadcake. I canâ€™t bring myself to write the note, but I can write to all of you, and just for a moment, feel just a little better.
