my notes on peoplei have learned a lot 
about people.

some people want to make other people happy. some people try so hard to make others happy that they fail in succeeding to ever make themselves happy. 

some people don't care about other people, but that doesn't work either. they realise near the end that there could have been more to their life, but that's all idealisation on their part. it would have turned out the same in the end, wishing for the opposite life they never had. you can't win.

some people are stolen.

some people leave.

sometimes you are broken. 

but maybe you find someone. someone who makes you feel like you don't need to fit into any of these categories anymore, for with them you can simply 

live.

so you hand them your life, all of the little broken pieces,

because they tell you they can fix it. 

but they leave too,

and they take it away with them. 


and so, in the end, you are left with nothing at all.

the person who cares for nothing is left with nothing.

the person who cares too much gives everything away, so we end up just the same.

the person who tries to be neither of these things, is forgotten, because they never get close enough to anyone to be remembered.

like with most of what life gives us, there are exceptions. some people are happy and have just enough, so that they no longer care whether or not they are remembered, because this one life is enough. they are the ones who are stolen.

but most of us just leave, because there's nothing left worth sticking around for.
