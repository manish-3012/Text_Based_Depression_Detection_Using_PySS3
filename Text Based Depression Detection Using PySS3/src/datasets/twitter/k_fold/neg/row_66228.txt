survived my first attempt, regretting it heavyon april 7th at night i swallowed a whole bottle of xanax. my dose was really low, so i knew it wasnt enough to kill me, but it was worth a shot. i dont remember it being a suicide attempt at first until i reread old messages. my memory of that day is near completely gone. 

i was sent to a psych ward after my mom took me to the er. it felt like prison at first, but once i got used to it i came to like it a little. now im back to the real world and i regret surviving that attempt.

i really dont got shit to live for, or at least i dont care about anything i do have enough to live for it. im overwhelmed by my negative emotions. depression and anxiety. i feel dead. i wish i were dead. i dont care about who'll be sad im gone and blah blah blah. i know its selfish and ruthless but thats always been my personality anyways. and yes i want people who've hurt me to feel guilty for what theyve done. 

anyways. life is short and im trying to make it shorter. next attempt, if i can ever get my hands on xanax again, will be successful. im not afraid to try like i used to be.
