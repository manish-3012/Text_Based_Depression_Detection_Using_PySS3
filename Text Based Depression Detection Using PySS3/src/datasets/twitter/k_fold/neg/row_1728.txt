I'm so calm about it.So me and my girlfriend of two years just broke up, and it was all my fault. I wanted it first and now I realize it's one of those, you don't know what you got till its gone, moments. I told her I made a huge mistake and I don't expect to be immediately back together but I still love her and ill wait for her if she needs. She told me don't wait you'll make yourself miserable which makes me realize she has no intent to get back together with me. I basically have already made the decision and once the opportunity arises, I will most likely take my life. Just wanted to get it all written down. Thanks guys!
