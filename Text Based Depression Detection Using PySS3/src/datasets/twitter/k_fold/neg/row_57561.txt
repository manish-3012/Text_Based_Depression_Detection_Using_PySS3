It hurts sometimesSometimes it hurts watching someone who is happy, someone who wants to live, someone who doesn't have to wake up everyday mad that they didn't fucking die in their sleep hoping one day God drops a shotgun from the sky they can use on themselves. 

Why though? I already made my decision to kill myself no matter what and to avoid happiness because it's so worthless to me but still...Why does it hurt to see this people? Why does it hurt knowing I could have had that? Why does it hurt knowing that these people don't have to plan out how and when they'll kill themselves? 

It's completely moronic. I asked for this and I agreed I would stick with it, yet here I am pondering about life would be like if things were different. 

Fucking emotions. They were never good for anything, just a damn hindrance. I could've already been dead how if it wasn't for fear and sadness getting in the way.
