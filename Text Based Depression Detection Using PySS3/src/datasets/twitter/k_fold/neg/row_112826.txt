Depressive episodes in relation to own birthdayMy birthday, October 20th, is around the corner, and I've fallen into a deep, deep depression - the self-destructive kind. I eat until my stomach rejects it and makes me vomit until there's blood, then I rinse out my mouth and just continue eating grotesque amounts of food. Or I'd drink too much water at once. 

It's not that I necessarily WANT to commit suicide, I'm just at a point that it feels like there's no moving forward, and I'm at the edge of a dead-end road with nowhere else to go; like I cannot progress/grow from my current situation, no matter how hard I try. I keep trying to just wait it out, but it feels like I've been waiting forever.

Earlier years, I would've gotten drunk enough to wake up in a puddle of bile or cut myself until I fall asleep. But I don't drink anymore, and I don't cut anymore. But the heavy feelings that I associate with my birthday are ever present.

As a kid, my parents would have us drive across the country to Kwa-Zulu Natal (a full 10 hour's drive from where we used to live) every year on my birthday because they were going to compete in the Amashova cycling challenge, and I never liked spending my whole birthday in the car. 

One year, they used my birthday as an excuse to go on a 4x4 journey through Botswana with some "friends" of theirs, which again, my whole birthday weekend was spent in an uncomfortably overpacked car and lack of actual birthday celebrations.

The next year, my senior year of high school, my grandfather succumbed to cancer on my birthday, a month after my grandmother gave up her fight with cancer. I like to think he died of heartbreak. Shortly after, another close family friend passed away.

I've had a boyfriend leave me on my birthday, and I've spent my birthday at an orphanage playing with those kids with tears in my eyes (not that it's bad, but the guilt hurt me).

I've just developed such a negative connotation with my own birthday, that I always have a long-lasting depressive episode prior to my birthday. I don't know how to break out of this cycle of hating my birthday. I know that there are many people who have it worse, but I'm at such a low point in my life right now.

My birthday is the ultimate low point in every year of my life like everything gets worse like it's building up to an ultimate low. Every year I feel like ending myself around this time. 

Is this merely psychological, or do the financial and political and educational years just match up to make this time of October feel unbearable? Am I the only person that feels this way about their birthday? What can I do?
