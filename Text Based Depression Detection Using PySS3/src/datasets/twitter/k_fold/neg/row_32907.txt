Help me I feel suicidal all over again Iâ€™m brokenAre used to have an obsessive behavior where I would constantly check and think about my ex from two years ago I would check their social media to a point where it was stocky even if I didnâ€™t want to I would have a compulsive urge to check. In the past six months I finally stopped I had not done it for months but just 10 minutes ago I didnâ€™t resist the urge. I feel so broke it I looked so deep into everything I feel like this is never going to end. I feel so broken. Iâ€™ve also been having these thoughts about bad things that happened to me as a child traumatized me even though I never had those thoughts before. I would be aware of those memories but not think it traumatized me but my Brian has been telling me that in the past 2 weeks. I was thinking those thoughts I got frustrated and that lead me to check my ex social media. Also I kept having dreams about her. Nightmares because I would wake up thinking I did my problem or wake up knowing I dreamt about her and not know why. Help me I wanna die now and I thought I was better I thought suicidal thoughts were gone
