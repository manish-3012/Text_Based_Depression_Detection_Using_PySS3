Gay guy back into a downward spiralI know what it's like to want to die, and until recently, that desire went away, everything turned around when i came out but now things are going downhill again and i was just wondering if anyone was online to talk to, i can't talk to any of my friends or family about this, /r/SW is kinda my last hope before things get any worse..
