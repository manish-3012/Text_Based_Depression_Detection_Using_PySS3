Not entirely feeling it, but...Itâ€™s here. 
Itâ€™s awake.
I felt it earlier in the day, and I felt it just now as I was driving.

Iâ€™m not feeling entirely suicidal. Maybe Iâ€™ll give in to my stupid urges, but the thoughts are there. 

Steer a hard right. Speed up. 

Honestly Iâ€™m just waiting for a car accident to take me out. Driving home tonight, I really couldnâ€™t care less if I were hit or if I lost control. But I didnâ€™t. I drove minimum speed. My intrusive thoughts were far louder than the songs playing and I hated every second of it despite being calm. 

I donâ€™t want to drive anymore. Much less with people in the car. I just want to stop thinking like this.
