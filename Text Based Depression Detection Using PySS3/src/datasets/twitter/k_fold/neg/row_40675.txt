PeopleOne thing that pisses me off about this subreddit is that people always pretend to care about other people. And they do it to make themselves feel better. Like your using my pain for your own personal betterment. Like wtf is wrong with you huh? Your also just lieing to my face. Plus most of the people haven't been close to being in my shoes. It's like walking into a mechanic shop and acting like you know what your doing. It's fucked.(just a rant)(pm if you want to "give feed back" about this)
