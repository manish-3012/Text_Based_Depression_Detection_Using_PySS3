It feels like I'm strapped with locked chains to the driver's seatIt feels like I'm strapped with heavy,ocked chains to the driver's seat of a car that has no brakes and is going at highway speed at night with weak lights and I have no idea where I'm going, and I want the constant anxiety and sadness of my pointles situation to stop by crashing into another car an frequently come close to doing it but never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact and that I'll just end up with pain that doesn't kill me and that I'll be restrapped into the car again.
