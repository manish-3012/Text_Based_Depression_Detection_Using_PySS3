Thoughts of past and fake friends sometimes makes we want to end things. I feel like things will never improve.My credit is shit. Sales people try to rip me off. Constantly having car troubles and getting ripped off finding a car. NParents calling me when I'm trying to sleep or at work when I'm trying to improve my life. Work is unstable because I'm weak and not confident because of my past. Therapy didn't help and they're still harassing me about a bill that insurance should've paid.

For a long time I forgot about my past because for a long time I was afraid of leaving my house or posting on there internet because of frenemies. 

I failed so many interviews at Fortune 500 companies and I would get to final rounds yet no job offer. I hate everything about myself.

I probably have multiple cavities again and my teeth are shit after braces. Constantly getting sick. Haven't seen friends a while. Guys stopped talking to me.

I'm weak.
