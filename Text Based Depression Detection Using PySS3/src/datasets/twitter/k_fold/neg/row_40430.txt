I donâ€™t want to do this any longerIt does not â€˜get betterâ€™. I am 50 years old. Itâ€™s been like this for 35 years. There is no treatment that works. Whatever it is, Iâ€™ve tried it. Numerous times. 

I feel like I am expected to continue living to mollify society. But the truth is, if anyone kept an animal in suffering this long, theyâ€™d be prosecuted, and the animal put out of itâ€™s misery. 

I donâ€™t want to do this any more.
