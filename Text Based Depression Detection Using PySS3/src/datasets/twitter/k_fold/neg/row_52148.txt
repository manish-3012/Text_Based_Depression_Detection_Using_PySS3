What happened to the bubbly little girl I used to beI used to be so happy and extroverted when I was little. Now I rarely speak to anyone at school other than teachers. I have an apathetic stare when I walk down the hallways. I don't let my eyes wander and look at that girl's shirt, that guy's hair, that freshman's shoes anymore. I just stare straight ahead. Even when I see someone I know in my peripheral vision walking towards me I don't give a single glance towards them. I feel no emotion whatsoever. Even when I'm crying, I barely feel sad. It just hurts now.

My grades are going to start slipping soon. My only good quality will be gone. I'll just disappoint my parents even more. I'm so sorry, mom. I know I was always the favorite child but I still failed you. Dad, I wish you understood even just a little bit of what I'm feeling. I can't just climb out of the hole I've been digging since 4th grade. I can't be rational. I can't just be happy all of the sudden. I can't 'have hope' when I lost it all in 8th grade. I'm a lost cause. I'll never be happy and deep down you know it.
