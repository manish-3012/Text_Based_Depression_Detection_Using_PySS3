Iâ€™m ready to kill myself, but Iâ€™m still trying to find hopeIâ€™ve been planning for a while about how I was going to commit suicide. Today, Iâ€™ve finally got my hands on everything I need. I planned on trying to kill myself tonight. My plan was to kill myself with carbon monoxide, also known as the â€œsilent killer.â€ More specifically on how I was going to do it, I planned on burning charcoal in a closed spaceâ€”Iâ€™d breath in the poisonous smoke and eventually pass out and then die. It seems like a good way to go out, considering itâ€™s relatively painless, not messy, and it can kill in a matter of minutes or hours. 

I donâ€™t plan on doing it now though because my ex talked me out of it. He told me I should go to a mental hospital, but I told him they donâ€™t really work. I just feel the same 2 weeks after getting out of them anyways.

I thought Iâ€™d just get this out there. If youâ€™re planning on commiting suicide, just know that you are always loved by somebody, and you leaving their lives forever will stick with them for the rest of their lives. However, I still want to end it sometimes too, so I understand. I canâ€™t say that life always gets better, but if you end yours, it certainly wonâ€™t get any better either.
