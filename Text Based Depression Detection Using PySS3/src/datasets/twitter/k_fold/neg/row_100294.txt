When does it get better?Ive been depressed since I was about 14, I'm 24 now. In that decade, I was always hopeful that my sorrow was temporary and set out to achieve some goals (I went from childhood obesity to in shape, I finished college, got a job), people always told me that suicide is a temporary solution. 

In that those ten years, I look back, to realize that I was never truly happy. 

I've tried immersing myself with friends, I've tried drugs (recreational and pharma), I've tried exercising heavily, everything is temporary happiness. At the end of the day, I'm always in pain, I'm just barely tolerating life. I've tried so many distractions, hobbies, socializing and things to help me grow.

I've alienated myself from all of my friends, even though they've reached out to me. I'm fairly attractive and I have no problem talking to people and girls. But I don't care about relationships anymore (its more like I don't care about anything anymore), and every year I grow older I realize how hideous the people around me are, and how hideous I have grown. I realize that beauty is a vision of youth. 

Is ten years long enough? When does it stop being temporary? Can I die now?
