I just want to make the pain stopI know breakups happen. Divorces happen. But I let my world slip away and my husband left me. Somehow I'm still hurting him even now and I want to stop it. I want to stop feeling the loss and stop hurting him. I want it all to end. Maybe this isn't the right place for this but I am spending so much time in my day wanting to end it and have no one to turn to.
