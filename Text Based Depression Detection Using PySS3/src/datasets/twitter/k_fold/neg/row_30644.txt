I'm tired of trying. All I have done is fuck upI'm a fucking loser. I'm 19 and I don't have any friends. I'm barely making it through college. I've never kissed a girl, had sex or even held a girls hand. Hell, I even joined the military but I couldn't even do that. I'm a failure. I can't do this anymore. I'm worthless. There is  nothing redeemable about me. I'm just going to drink myself to death at this rate. I give up.
