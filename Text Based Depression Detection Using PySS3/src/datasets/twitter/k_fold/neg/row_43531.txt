Feeling betterFor the past few weeks or so, I've barely had any suicidal thoughts.  My confidence has been increasing lately, as well.  Oddly, I think some of that was from participating more in discussions here on Reddit instead of just lurking.  Being able to express my opinions, hopefully in well, thought-out, comments, has helped.  I've also done a few things that have put me in the public spotlight (in the news) for positive things.

I'm not sure why I decided to visit SW today, the thought just occurred to me.  It sort of made me a bit uneasy, so I decided I wouldn't read any of the posts here.  It's not that they aren't worthy of being read, I simply don't feel I could read any of these without bringing back some of my feelings of depression or having suicidal thoughts again.  I'd like to push these aside and continue my progress to being a productive and healthy individual (but I wouldn't say I'm there yet, I'm not quite the person I want to be).  Since I did visit, I thought I'd write an update.

Thank you all for the previous help you've offered.  I still don't know what the future holds for me, especially with any financial hardships ahead.  At least in the meantime, I can slowly feel better about myself.  I'm not sure I'll respond to any comments, as I'm planning on logging out of this account after I submit it, since it is hard to visit this place again.
