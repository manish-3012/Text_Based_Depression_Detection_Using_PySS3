I can't decide if I deserve to die or if that would be getting off too easyI used to have real friends; people whom I loved and loved me. My friendship with them was the most beautiful thing in my life. But, a few years ago I went through an awful breakup (my fault) and in the most pathetic fashion possible I withdrew from social life entirely. I suddenly stopped speaking to almost anyone. Eventually it got to the point where I could go weeks without speaking to anyone in person. Of course it wasn't long before my friends stopped trying to reach out to me, why would they? I abandoned them. Now, im alone, and I deserve it. I had a chance to hold onto the family I've always wanted and I threw it away. I know that the pain I have is something I deserve but I can't stand it anymore. I just want it to end.
