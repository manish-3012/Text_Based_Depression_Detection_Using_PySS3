I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™m fucking done.  I have been in and out of the hospital for yearsâ€”none of the meds work. I always felt like I had a little speck of light that was carrying me through but it seems itâ€™s disappeared.  I had a nightmare last night and awoke from it with the surest feeling that I want to die.  It was crystal in its nature... Iâ€™ve never felt it so clearly and strongly before. I am sure that if in that moment if I had a gun I would be gone.  I am overwhelmed with memories and feelings from past trauma.  I am endlessly tired but so afraid to go to sleep because my brain makes up terrible nightmares with content one million times worse than the trauma I actually endured in real life.  I have a bottle of pills and some liquor or access to a firearm if I drive to my parents house for it and I cannot find a reason to not go through with this.  My boyfriend is exhausted and I highly suspect that he doesnâ€™t love me anyway and unfortunately he is one of the only pillars in my support system.  Fuck.  I canâ€™t fucking do this anymore.
