Having trouble falling asleep. Just thoughts, it makes me feel better knowing someone will read them.
I can't sleep tonight. I hate that I still have hope things will get better. I hate feeling sad. I hate my stutter. I hate the stars in the sky. I hate getting up in the morning. I hate seeing Emma. I hate how my instructors seem to hate me. I hate how I hate myself. 

I wish hanging myself wasn't going to be painful and that overdosing wasn't so unsuccessful. I self sabotage myself because I don't want people to believe me when I say I'm okay. I pray to God I pass in my sleep tonight. But I know I will wake tomorrow, I will be positive and try to will myself toward happiness but when I get home there will be no one to talk to or see. 

"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
And Mourners to and fro
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed
That Sense was breaking through -

And when they all were seated,
A Service, like a Drum -
Kept beating - beating - till I thought
My mind was going numb -

And then I heard them lift a Box
And creak across my Soul
With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space - began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race,
Wrecked, solitary, here -

And then a Plank in Reason, broke,
And I dropped down, and down -
And hit a World, at every plunge,
And Finished knowing - then -"
-Emily Dickinson
