I was raped a few months ago. never told anyone. I wanna die.its been pretty bad ever since it happened. i started self harming, feeling depressed. having flashbacks. everything just went downhill mentally. im a guy, im in 11th grade. its embarrassing and shitty. im pathetic.
i just need a friend to help me through this because i can't do it by myself anymore. i feel like if i keep it in any longer ill explode.
It was the worst night of my life. i just want it out of my head.
