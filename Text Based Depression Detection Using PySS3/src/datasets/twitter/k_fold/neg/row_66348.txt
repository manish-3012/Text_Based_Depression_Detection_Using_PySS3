Reasons to Not Join the 27 ClubIt's my 27th birthday tomorrow and a few people have joked to me about not joining the 27 club. If only they knew that I have contemplated being part of it in my low moments. And so I figured I'd write a list of my reasons not to join it in hopes of helping myself and others who struggle. 

Your pain and trauma is not who you are. Even in the most difficult of circumstances things can improve. The love that you have in your heart will be awakened again. Your reason to go on should not be dictated by the amount of texts you received today. Progress takes time. Some of the best and the greatest humans in history accomplished things over the course of decades. Whatever mark you want to leave on this world can happen. You are loved and cherished by your friends and family, even the ones that don't have the emotional capacity to tell you. You have the power to make a positive influence on someone or something. Your ideas and art should see the light of day. 

Even if your luck seems down or that everything is wrong, focus on your body, your health. If you have food in the fridge, internet, clothes, an education etc you are far better off than most people in the world. Try to take that negative energy and focus it towards being grateful, towards your passions and towards your breath. Go take a walk, write down a crazy story about you achieving your greatest dream of all time and how you felt. 

**** Side note as I was writing the last line of that there was a knock on my bedroom door. I opened it up to find two of my best friends. They stood there with a box of brownies and came to surprise me. We proceeded by sitting on my balcony with some tea and they brought in my 27th birthday for me. I almost cried. And that my friends is literally the essence of what we live for, to reap every second we have to enjoy the company of other souls and make every second count â¤ï¸ 

Sending all my love and virtual brownies to whoever needs it
