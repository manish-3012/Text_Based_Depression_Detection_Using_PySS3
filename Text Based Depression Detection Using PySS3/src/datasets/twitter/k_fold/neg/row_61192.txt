I don't get shitI don't know, I really don't know what to do.

One day I started to not give a fuck about anything in my life and so I slowly lost interest in life,  
now I'm someone who never goes outside, I don't have any friends too. And If I do I just leave em hanging because I really don't care. I tried getting a hobby, I tried a lot of things out and nothing clicked for me, I always knew that I'm talent less, but the fact that I don't even find something that brings me joy in life kinda annoys me. I'm really bad at school too, even If I try.

I just really don't know what to do,  
I made plans to kill myself after I move from my parents house.
