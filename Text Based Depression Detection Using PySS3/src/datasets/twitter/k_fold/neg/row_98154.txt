Ive been getting worse.Ive felt absolutely awful, it seems like hiking isn't working, talking to friends, family and trained professionals isn't working. I've gotten so pulsive and I try to fight it. What is wrong with me. I also feel very invalidated because everyone says depression isn't obvious, but I'm one to wear my emotions on my sleeves. I'm not doing it for attention, I have a councilor to try and help, and I like her a lot, but nothings working. I've just secluded myself in my room, locked the doors and prayed to die in my sleep.

I love earth and nature and everything it has to offer, but I don't want to live anymore. I'd rather be apart of the earth than walk on it. I don't want to be here anymore but don't want to die. I don't want death to be my only option. But i don't feel like anything will work. Ive already given up on letting things help me. I don't know what I want exactly except for this feeling to stop.
