Iâ€™m doing it this week. HSV-2+I am a beautiful, smart, sweet 19 year old girl who got HSV-2 from my first â€œboyfriendâ€ when he forced himself on top of me. He was the first person to ever do anything sexual with me and I didnâ€™t want it. I am having a full identity crisis over this. This is not how I imagined my life to go, I never thought it would be possible for me to have a hard time dating or finding love, and now I have to face the possibility of getting rejected over and over. I cannot handle that thought at all. I have a panic attack every morning I wake up thinking about how my life was and how it could have been. I feel like I need to crawl out of my own body. This is not me. This was not supposed to happen to me. I do not deserve this. I deserve to live a beautiful happy life and that was taken away from me. I will never find anyone to love me. Everyday I think of new ways to kill my self. This was not supposed to be my life. I canâ€™t handle it anymore. I canâ€™t do it. I have no one. People who would have slept with me in a second, donâ€™t want to even touch my now. My life is forever changed because of something I didnâ€™t want or ask for. I didnâ€™t get a choice. I can not handle my life anymore. I am giving up. My body is tired. I am tired. So so so tired. I feel bad for my family but my body and mind are tired, I have no will to live. I am tired. I am tired.
