I have my own death planned out and I don't know if I'm going to go through with it anymore.When I was younger, I decided that I'd use my lucky numbers as a date. If nothing important happened before that date, I'd kill myself. Later, I plotted out my entire death. I know my exact plans, what I'll use, even the entire week leading up to the event.

Recently, I thought I'd found a reason to live. But, it's so hard to think of a plan for the future. I don't know what I'm good at. I don't like any of my hobbies. I don't want to do my 'dream job.' I don't even know if I want to continue living after that date, this is so hard. 

Can't wait until a little under a year and a half. &lt;3
