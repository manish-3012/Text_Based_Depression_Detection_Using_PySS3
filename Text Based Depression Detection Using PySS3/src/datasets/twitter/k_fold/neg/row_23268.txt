Not safe TonightI'm going to hang myself Tonight, nothings ever going to get better but when it does it just falls back ten times harder, my mum is making fun of me for having PTSD and many other problems and calling me a snowflake. Maybe I'm over reacting but I guess it's my time to go, I hope you all do well and get better, but for me it's the end of the road
