It's been exactly 6 months (May 15) since "it" happened, and I'm finally taking initiative to write my suicide note.My plan is to write one huge all encompassing suicide note that closes off all loose ends with people, let's them know how much I loved them and that I forgive them for any rough spots we had, includes some form of informal will (where my possessions go, what to do with my body, etc.), some suggestions for my funeral (although I'll mostly leave it up to then since funerals are for the living), some of my thoughts leading up to death, a link to some songs, a description of where I'm going in heaven to make them feel like I'm safe, and much much more. It's gonna be a lot of work, but it's my last big project before I die so I need to hit it home.
