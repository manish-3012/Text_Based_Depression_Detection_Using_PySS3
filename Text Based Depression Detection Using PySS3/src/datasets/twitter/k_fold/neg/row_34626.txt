Called suicide hotline, they traced the call and sent policeSo I'm a vet with PTSD. I called the hotline because I was just overwhelmed and I didn't want to feel like that anymore. Feeling pretty helpless. I made it extremely clear that I wasn't going to kill myself. I did say that I wanted to die, but I said over and over again that I wouldn't kill myself. I never even gave her my name, just some basic info like what state I lived in and when I got out. 

Without my permission, she somehow found TWO of my addresses and sent police to two separate houses at 5am. 4 cops woke up my tenants and then two woke my entire family up.

I'm just sad that I don't have that resource if I'm ever having a really rough night. I will never feel safe enough to call them again. I feel very violated by the whole experience and now I'm wondering if the call was recorded or if it's in my VA medical record? I called the 273-HELP one and you have to press 1 for vets, so I bet that combined with help from the police is how they traced it. 

I'm humiliated that so many people now know way too many personal things about me because the police asked for me by name and said why they were there. I feel very betrayed.
