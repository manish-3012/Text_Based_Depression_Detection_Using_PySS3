I'm reaching the end of the lineI'm 18, I'm autistic and bi-polar, I have no one, everything has just gone downhill every year, I've failed everything I've tried, friends, relationships, school etc. 

I kicked out of college in November last year because of my attendance despite telling them about my condition and having multiple panic attacks from going to certain lessons. 

The past few months all I've done is smoke, listen to music and cut myself, I can barely sleep because of my medication which causes the worse dreams imaginable. 

I don't know what more I can do, I have severe problems with going anywhere, I get panic attacks and start to feel literally sick, how am I supposed to get a job and move out or do anything if I can't even manage basic human interaction. 

I want to die so bad, yet I'm terrified, I'm not religious, but I'm so scared of what comes after, who knows, no one can prove anything right. 

I just wish I had a friend....
