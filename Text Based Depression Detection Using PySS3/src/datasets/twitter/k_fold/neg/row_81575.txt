I know now I am undeserving of love I want to die so badI feel alone I got rejected by someone that understands me the most and that I am inlove with and she holds back those feelings towards me because another guy hurt her really bad. I am obsessed with this girl so much I feel she is my soulmate and she completes me. We spend so much time together and I love when she touches me and i'm close to her I feel safe from my mind when i'm around her. She makes me feel like a man for once in my life and not insufficient until she told me to repress my feelings I am having. Please this hurts so bad I don't think I can live without this person.
