I wish I could stop being paranoid...That has been my number one source of anxiety and depression...

Three years ago, I went to talk with a "psychic" in my city, or someone who could somehow help me...

I asked random things, even a bit about my future love life... Not only he misunderstood that and treated me like a womanizer, but he also said some words I will not be able to forget in my life...

"I see that you're going to become insane, insane! You need to be cleaned as soon as possible!"

Ever since then, I've been afraid that his words were going to become true... I've distanced from many people, isolated myself, stopped talking with many people, didn't put effort in med school and ended up being treated like a child/snowflake (found the truth eventually), ended up with most people just talking to me when they need something or when we're face to face... It sort of hurts...

I want to stop, I want these thoughts to stop, it hurts to think the worst possible scenarios with no evidence, it really hurts, I want it to stop...
