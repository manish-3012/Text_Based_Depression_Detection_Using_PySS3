I feel so guiltyIm sorry if this doesnt fit but I need to let it out
I'm on mobile

I feel so guilty about existing. I feel like I'm not worth anything. I stopped eating at work and school because I feel like there to good for me to be near. Everyday it's so hard not to think about just ending it. All the time it's just guilt and I don't mean just pity my self I legitimately feel bad about existing. I caused my mom and dad's financial issues and probably there divorce. I watched my friends die from suicide. I was suppose to go with but I was to much of a coward to go with. I've been seeing a therapist which is expensive as hell and that hasn't helped at all because I have a bad habit of just hiding every emotion. One of my other therapists had enough of my shit and told me to kill my self. Granted I flipped shit and started talking about how the therapy wasn't helping. I want to eat and hangout with my friends but I feel like I annoy them to much and want to leave them alone. When I came out as bi to my friends one of closest ones was not happy about that and mocked me and got mad at me. I lied to her that it was just a phase but in reality I'm not straight. At my job I pretend to be happy but sometimes my real side peaks out and everyone's like "why are you so depressed?" I also can't keep a relationship because if my past with abusive SOs. One of them used to beat me on a daily basis and sometimes made me sleep outside chained up like a dog. I usually stayed over at her house because my parents were either fighting or gone. I feel alone guilty and just straight up depressed all the time. I don't want to feel this way I don't know why the guilt is so strong I just want it to end one way or another.
