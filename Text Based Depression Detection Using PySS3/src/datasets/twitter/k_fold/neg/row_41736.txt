My boyfriend of 5 years just broke up with me with me.Itâ€™s been coming. Weâ€™ve been off and on and had plenty of issues throughout the years. We both have our faults but ultimately, I was so so so in love with him and still am. He told me that people have told him heâ€™s just â€œsettlingâ€ for me and that one of his coworkers wants to set him up with her sister. We have a son together and heâ€™s the only father figure my daughter has ever known. Iâ€™m in so much pain and I canâ€™t even begin to heal from it because I fucking live with him. Iâ€™m currently out on the couch crying my eyes out. I feel so hopeless and alone. I just donâ€™t know what to do right now but cry.
