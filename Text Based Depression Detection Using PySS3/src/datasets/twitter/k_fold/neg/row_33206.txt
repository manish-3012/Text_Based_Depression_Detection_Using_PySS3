Soon, I will kill myself at 15. I'd like to immortalize my final thoughts.(I posted this on another sub and account, but it was removed and I was reccomended this place) (I've also omitted a lot of sentimental and personal parts).

So, I also owe you an explanation. This may be difficult to understand and you may not want to, but I was not depressed. I did not hate myself. I was not traumatized. This could not have been stopped. Not by words, not by pills, not by love and not by you. I had people who loved and cared about me. I was not mentally ill. I was simply...able to see past it all, I suppose. And I was unable to handle what looked back. Not because I'm superior, or because I have a gift. No no, it's actually an incredible flaw (fatal, in fact). **I understand 15 is a young age to make such a drastic decision, but hear me out.**

I spent a while searching for the "point" of life. I obviously realized that there is no objective point. Everything fades away and in a matter of years, it will be as if I never existed. No matter what I do, what rules I follow, how nice I am, how many people I love, whether I continue living for 70 more years or not. It all means nothing. But this isn't neccesarily a bad thing. It's somewhat liberating. 

The "point" is entirely up to the individual - everyone lives in their own reality. Some care about legacy, some care about wealth, some care about love, some care about social validation of their achievments, some simply care about living day to day. All of these things, however, have the same goal - to make the individual "happy". So what does it mean to be "happy"? A constant influx of dopamine and serotonin? In such a case, wouldn't it be far easier just to do actual drugs instead of brain chemicals? Everyone - from Bill Gates to the homeless man in the city - have both happiness and sadness in their daily lives. So what everyone really wants is contentness. As little of the "bad" brain chemicals as possible. We do not have free will. For the mentally healthy, our brains control every aspect of our lives. The love of your life is such simply because parts of your brain decided he was the ideal evolutionary partner for reasons you may not even be consciously aware of. But that's just it - things will go wrong simply because they can. This is not a fictional tale. There are no happy endings. 

Unless you perish holding the love of your life's hand and being shot in the back of the head unexpectedly, you will likely die alone and in agony as your brain fights to live - like most other people. **Life doesn't end with a happy kiss and immortality; it ends with shitting yourself in a nursing home everyday and being unable to move or think properly while your children take your place and everyone you loved is dead**. It's disgusting and undignifed. Humans were only supposed to live for 20 years. The aging process is practically a punishment. Humans strive for success, but success clearly doesn't make anyone "happy". Look at all the drug addicted, mentally ill and suicidal celebrities. We can do nothing. Our lives are too short. I am simply leaving the party slightly earlier. There's nothing left that I particularly want to experience.

I cannot do the few things that I enjoy because they do not benefit the elite members of society. Instead, I must work, work, work! Try hard! Follow every rule they set as complacently as possible! If you step off path, you will be drugged and punished!

So, with that, I take my leave. I do not want this to be seen as a tragic little girl taking her life because she was sad. I want people to read this note and understand that I am freeing myself from the constraints of this unfair existence. I have no desire to participate in a game that I was forced to play. **Please don't make this a mental health issue.**

I am sorry, though. I understand that I've done something horrible. I've done my research, too. If this is simply how the world "is", then I'm done here. Goodbye. You couldn't have done anything. Thankyou. This is all there is. No secrets, no hidden meanings...Just this.
