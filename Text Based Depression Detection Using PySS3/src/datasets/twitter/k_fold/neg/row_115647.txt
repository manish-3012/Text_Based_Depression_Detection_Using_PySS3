what i would like to tell my parentsDear person who loves too much, give it all for me, I never lost hope, who wants the best for me and asking for my every day since before I was born,
I have a confession to make to you it is from the heart. And it's the last thing I want. And I feel very selfish.
All this has me in a state of confusion and guilt.
On the one hand I feel useless and selfish because being aware of what I have I can not repair. And you think that my "problem" or "condition" has no qualms. And I know it is. But I can not confront and I can not solve my problem. And every day I want. But every failure days.
It's something that happens to me for a long time. Before college. Even from small.
Wishes to escape from the house to the point of making bags. Desire to end it all, to the point of writing letters saying goodbye all. I felt as a nuisance and as a weight.

I hurt myself. I thought as ways to end it all. And this comes from long ago, but he was always there close to you and those feelings did not last more than one day. But now being in another country, away from you despite talking once a week the feeling became more unbareable. I just wanted to stop feeling.

I learned that when I ate so much I had a hard time breathing The only thing I felt was that it was full. So When I stopped feeling stuffed Eat again.
What happened? I gained weight. The weight is very superficial. But that has been a problem for me since childhood. And then I learned to get rid of what they ate. I have purged. And I have taken laxatives.
And when I did not want to eat to not gain weight? I learned that sleeping pills without hunger kept me because I could spend hours sleeping without feeling and without eating.

The truth is that throughout this semester have not made any friends. I have not gone out even once except the trip to Chicago. And all this has me very anxious. It has cost me hours of sleep. I will go to class with anxiety because I do not like to see people or talk to them
I do not want anyone to see what I really am. A very good actress.
Sorry. I apologize, you who love me so much and do not want to me to be feeling like this. I have no reason to feel so. And every time I see around me I feel worse because I have everything and yet I can not stop feeling this way.
I did not want disappoint you. you had so much faith in me. So many hopes. And I let you down. I just wanted you proud of me. Being here and being the best.
But this is a call for help before it gets out of my hands ask you to give me your hand and do not trust so much in my when I say I'm fine.
 sorry for wasting you two whole years.
