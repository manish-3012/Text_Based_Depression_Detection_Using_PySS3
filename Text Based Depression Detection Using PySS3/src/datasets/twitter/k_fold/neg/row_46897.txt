My Lifeâ€™s Falling Apart and I Donâ€™t Want it to Get WorseEverythingâ€™s been awful lately and itâ€™s just getting more and more ass backwards.


My â€œexâ€ dad disowned me earlier this year after I refused to let him keep saying awful things about my little sister and her baby to me, bf of 2yrs told me he doesnâ€™t love me, hasnâ€™t for a while, and broke up with me a few days ago, and now my sister is back in contact and building a relationship with our â€œexâ€dad and has told him everything about me over the past few months.


I feel betrayed, violated, and like Iâ€™m at the end of my rope here. It feels like everythingâ€™s just getting worse and worse every day. Iâ€™m unable to leave the bed most days and my nan is getting more and more annoyed with me over it, I keep crying all the time and just canâ€™t stop thinking about what Iâ€™ve lost. 


Iâ€™m back around my shitty abusive family and have no escape, I canâ€™t get away to my ex bfâ€™s house anymore, I donâ€™t have his family to talk to anymore.


Iâ€™m sick of being told it gets better. It already got better for me when I found out my dad molested me and I was able to get away but now everything I had has been taken away from me. Everything that made me feel happy and safe is gone and I donâ€™t want to lose anything else or risk things getting even worse than this. 


The only way thisâ€™ll stop is if I stop myself from going any further. This is it for me. Iâ€™ve felt like some fucked up force in the universe has been telling me to kill myself for a while and now I really want to do it but Iâ€™m so fucking scared. 


I donâ€™ want to be tortured anymore but I donâ€™t want to give up and die like that. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. My friends are getting more and more annoyed with me. Iâ€™m becoming an inconvenience and I have no escape. I want it to end. I donâ€™t want to hurt anymore
