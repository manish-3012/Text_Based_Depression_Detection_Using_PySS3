I failedI am a private medic and today i was off duty when i attended a rtc, 2 teenagers under a lorry. One died while on scene, the other in critical care. I deal with this often but just something about this one, its killing me. she was just a fucking teenager on the front of her boyfriends bike, they made a stupid fucking mistake and went without looking, they didn't deserve this. If i was there 2 minutes earlier i might have been able to get chest compressions started, i could have stabilized the lad and maybe saved the girl but because i was 2 fucking minutes late they is now a mother sobbing her eyes out coming to the realization her daughter is never fucking coming home again. i stayed on scene for 3 hours assisting police to direct traffic but just 2 fucking minutes and i could have maybe saved her.   


This isn't the first time a patient has died on me or that if i was just a tad sooner i might have been able to get them but this one hurts so fucking bad and i cant handle it. i cant stop thinking, what if i left the gym at this time, what if i didn't talk to this person, what if i didn't dordle here etc etc. one little fucking thing different and some poor kid might still be alive today. i failed and i dont want to live with that failure anymore
