Was think about thisI was thinking about this during a conversation with someone. If I really wanted to do "it" right about now, I have a car, with gas, I have rope, I know how to tie a noose, and there is roughly about 276,619 miles of road in the current state I live in, 306,614 in in the state next to it, and 235,048 in the state above it, and million+ of trees in each of thoes states. If I really wanted to do it I could disappear and no body would ever find my body... 

I really scared the hell out of the guys I was talking with but the plus side is its been roughly 5 months since my last attempt...
