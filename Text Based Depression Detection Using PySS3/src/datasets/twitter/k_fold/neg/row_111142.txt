Nothing's wrongMy life is going alright. I've passed the year, if by only half a percent, I am on vacation and it's almost Christmas.

Yet I want to die.

There's nothing wrong with me, yeah my ribs are a little fucked up and I should gain some weight, but that's all.

Yet I want to die.

What is the point of being here? Nobody loves me anyways. I'm 1,80 and weight 50kg.

50. let that sink in. Does this sound like a man to you? I couldn't hurt a fly, and j just have to trust that nobody's going to mess with me.

Nobody ever loved me, and nobody ever will. I've never been in a relationship, or even had anyone have a crush on me. Only rejection. Everywhere. Life is a cycle of pain. Nobody gives a shit about me. You probably don't either. I'm an annoying, dumb, worthless cunt and I'm fully aware of that. Yet nobody hates me, out of pity. It's even worse: I'm not relevant enough to be hated. Except of course by my """"""father""""" who's threathened to kill me more times than I can remember.

The tough that I'll never keep anyone safe, I'll never make anyone happy, just destroys me. I don't know why I'm alive. Probably because I'm too much of a wimpy little bitch to off myself, but that didn't stop me from cutting.

I know I've seen nothing of life, and that's even worse. It only gets worse from here, as everyone says, 14 year olds have it easy. I know I won't be able to live like that. I know what the future holds and I'm having none of it. I am the Apex of "waste". I just need a gun.
