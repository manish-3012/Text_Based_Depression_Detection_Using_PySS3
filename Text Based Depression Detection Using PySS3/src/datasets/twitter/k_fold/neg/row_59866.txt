I don't feel rightI called my best friend aka older brother he texted that he would call me back that was 8 hours ago, I lost most of my friends and the few remaining barely speak to me. I can barely speak to my sons and haven't seen them in 3 months, I am too disabled to work and struggling for 2 months to get welfare/disability/food stamps. I also lost my license. I just don't want to live anymore. I feel noting will get better. I am 26 living with my father, car parked in the driveway, unemployed, broke, pics of my kids plastered over my walls, I have zero sex life (I did 2 weeks ago one night stand and now she wants nothing to do with me) or social life etc.
