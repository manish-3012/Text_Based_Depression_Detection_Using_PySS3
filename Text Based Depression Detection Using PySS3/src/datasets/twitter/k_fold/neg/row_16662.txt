Help me pleaseI'm contemplating suicide, I have something called COTV. I'm sure you've heard of it. It's been two years since last time, my wife found me on the kitchen floor with two knives pressed against my wrists. At the moment I'm sick with neuroborreliosis which has spread to my CNS and my spine so I'm having convulsions and cramps and headaches all the time. Went to the ER but it feels like I'm more educated than them. I just want the pain to stop. I've got diazepam, tramadol, oxycodone and lergigan at home but I am very reluctant to use any. Alcohol works best and worst. I'm also on nebido, anastrozol, Sertralin and doxycycline.

Please just reply. Doesn't matter what you say.
