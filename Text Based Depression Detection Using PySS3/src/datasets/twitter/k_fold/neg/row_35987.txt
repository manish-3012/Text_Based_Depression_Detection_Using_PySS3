HeartbreakI have been heartbroken for the past year over a lost love . At first I told myself the pain was normal and I would get over it but itâ€™s not getting any better . Heâ€™s moved on and doesnâ€™t care anymore , if he ever really did in the first place . Has anyone been through something similar ? Iâ€™ve never really been the type to consider ending in all but this pain has truly cut me to my core and I just want it all to stop :/
