Iâ€™m not happyIâ€™m not. I canâ€™t please anyone, not even the closest ones around me. Iâ€™m not worth anything, and Iâ€™m useless in every aspect. I thought I was worth of love and affection, but Iâ€™m just a worthless spec of dust in a neverendless dust fucking tornado. My death will affect no one and the world will keep spinning. Iâ€™ve bought my rope now I just need a tree.
