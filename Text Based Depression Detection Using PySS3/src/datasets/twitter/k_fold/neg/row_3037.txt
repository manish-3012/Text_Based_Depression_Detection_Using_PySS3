AngryI have gone from feeling nothing at all to just...feeling so angry. I want to stop existing so fucking badly, but I could never do that to my cats, to my friends, to my family even if my family doesnâ€™t even know the real me. I feel guilty and angry and trapped. Iâ€™ve felt depressed before, due to situation or circumstance. But this feeling is entirely different. Itâ€™s so much more than what I used to think was my worst depression. I used to, no matter how bad it got, be able to push these thoughts aside for my significant other. Unfortunately we are long distance. Heâ€™s been extremely sick with worsening seizures the last week, and just...gone. Seemingly mid text conversation. I havenâ€™t heard from him since Thursday. Sunday was my birthday. Our families are NParents and his dad hates me so if something happened I would never be told. Every iMessage goes through...every phone call rings entirely then goes to voicemail. I check obituaries every day. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m saving up now for a private investigator. But he was really it. Now I just...feel obligated to be alive. It no longer feels like a positive choice I made. It just feels like no choice now... I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore. If you read this mess of a post thank you. I tried to give what details I can about my thoughts and circumstances but honestly thereâ€™s just so much. I am so lost.
