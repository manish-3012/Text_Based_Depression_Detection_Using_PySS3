I'm so tired of everythingit's all for nothing. I'm never going to be able to get happy, I'll just be stuck in my endless limbo of distracting myself from reality and having reality hit me like a truck. Every day, for the rest of my life. So why shouldn't I just go and get it done. All I do is take up space that would be better suited for other people. And it's not like anyone would miss me either. I've got no friends to speak of and my family has made their opinion of me very clear. I used to think suicide was terrible. That somehow I'd better myself by staying alive. So I waited, and waited. And all I have to show for it is just more things for me to be upset about constantly. I just wish someone would for the love of god just end me or help me because I am so sick of slowly decaying into nothing, doing nothing but being a waste.
