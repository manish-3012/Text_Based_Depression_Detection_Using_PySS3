Iâ€™m going to buy some rope tomorrow and kill myself with it.My upstairs neighbors are constantly causing too much noise through loud walking and loud banging. It keeps me from being able to go to sleep at night, and when I am finally able to go to sleep, theyâ€™re the reason why I get woken up. I canâ€™t ever sleep on my own time. Not to mention the fact that theyâ€™re causing so much noise throughout the entire day that I canâ€™t even focus on school work. My mental health and future is at stake here because of these people, and Iâ€™m completely powerless. I canâ€™t move out because Iâ€™m stuck in a lease. I have to put up with this bullshit until then and I canâ€™t fucking do it. I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™d rather die.
