My parents cannot fix my issues, so why don't I fix them myself?I fucking hate life from head to toe, and I have felt like this for half a year. I am not mentally and emotionally strong at all, because I already feel like dying when there are people who go through tougher things and have way longer than I am and are not suicidal, or are, and it took them longer than it did for me. 

My mom thinks I like being sad for the sake of it, when I am actually calling for help subtly, same thing my dad thinks. My sister told me I can tell them everything, I cannot. I'm a closet bi in a Christian household, I feel like cutting and killing myself, education is putting so much stress on me, social anxiety is overwhelming, I'm ugly and insecure as fuck.

I am tired of them ignoring me, I am tired of life. I have been doubting my faith for so long I don't consider myself Christian or Atheist anymore, just questioning, in between. So I don't worry about going to hell that much anymore. I want them to know that I am going through so much pain in life,  want them to regret ignoring me. I don't want them to pray for me, because I don't want to be "cured" of my bisexuality and nothing will change, like almost everytime we pray.

Is there any way I can just express my sadness and suicidal desires without killing myself, I need an outlet of my anger and sadness. Because I have decided I feel depressed, and I don't want therapy and I don't want a diagnoses test, my parents will make life worse after that.
