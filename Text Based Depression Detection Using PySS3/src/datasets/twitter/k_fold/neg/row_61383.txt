Every post I see on here they always start the same I hate myself and so on I feel how you feel I see youIâ€™m done with my life and during the past week Iâ€™ve planned to do it so many times Iâ€™ve stood on the edge of a beautiful cliff and Iâ€™d love to fly I have a really strong urge to jump, when I was a kid I had dreams about it jumping and getting those few seconds while falling to think about your life before you die and thereâ€™s no turning back even if I wanted to save myself and change my mind I canâ€™t and I couldnâ€™t think of a better way to go Iâ€™ve wanted to do it my whole life since those dreams started happening so here I am at the same cliff edge but I donâ€™t get to close because I really will jump and I just not ready yet when I first had dreams about it as a kid I jumped off the roof of the house Iâ€™m not sure why it didnâ€™t hurt but it felt good for some reason I donâ€™t see myself living past the age of 30 so Iâ€™m convinced I do it eventually Iâ€™m not sure if anyone else has this fantasy to jump off high places but if so please let me know and if you have any other fantasyâ€™s of suicide let me know I might sound like a weird cunt so yeah thatâ€™s me I have no friends I just work and drink too much on my days off and I have a lot of problems that I canâ€™t fix so haha pretty chill overdosing wasnâ€™t as fun as I thought so I wanted to mix it up try something new that will work and I canâ€™t fuck it up no matter how much a fuck things up
