Urgent help required. My friend, who displays serious self-harming tendencies, is suffering from guiltFor rejecting me. Im perfectly fine with it, since its her choice. But she thinks that im sad even though i have tried very hard to make her realize that im not. She often self-harms and im worried that she might cut or do something even worse. She's such a nice person, and i want her to be happy. What should i do? She lives in another city, so i can't physically be with her just now. 
Please help. :(
