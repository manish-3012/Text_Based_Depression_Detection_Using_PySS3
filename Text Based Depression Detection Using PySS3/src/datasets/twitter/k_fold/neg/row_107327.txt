Can I die with this?First of all, sorry for the mistakes I am going to make, English is not my first language.

Long story short, 18 year old male. I want to commit suicide.

 My parents don't know how bad I am, recently I have finally told them about this "feeling" (I don't want to tell them that is depression or something worse, they will break their marriage and they need to take care of my brother and sister; they are so good fellas)

But I cannot tell them that I am failing in college because I cannot approach to people. They know that I failed the difficult classes because I can't think because of this "feeling", but I cannot let them know that I almost failed my history class (my favourite subject) because I could not enter the classroom.

 Everyday I dream of jumping on the tracks of the subway. Now I need to go to the college and ask them how I can retake the classes. I FUCKING CANT, IS FUCKING SCARY. I CANNOT DO IT. IT IS FREAKING ME OUT. 


We went to a psychiatrist and he gave me Paxil, 10 pills, each one 12,5 mg. My mother had them in someplace hidden, but I have them. I am thinking about taking them all at once and drink some alcohol, we got whiskey here. If thats not enough I will wait till tomorrow and buy something more strong (Legal age here is 18).  

TL;DR: 18 Male wanting to kill myself, parents don't know how bad I am. Nobody knows.

PS:You don't need to answer, I can guarantee you that I am such a fucking pussy and a coward that I wont do it.
