Help meI dont know when it started but I hate myself, but I do.  I hate who I am and how I look. Words cant Express how lonely I am. It's been so long since I had a friend. Honestly my depression is so bad now that I cant even sleep. As I write this its half 4 in the morning.
 I see no point in continuing to live. It's just a cycle and all the days blur together. I told my parents, but my dad screamed at me so now the whole neighbourhood knows I'm suicidal. I tried to kill myself twice in November but was unsuccessful. I dont want to be here anymore, but I cant die. I feel ashamed even writing this but i want to be a girl. I always have, but there is no way for me to live my life that way. The pain i feel just waking up and seeing myself is too much to bear. I'm religious but it's becoming hard to believe in a God who would create me to suffer.

Even if i do become a girl, i lose everyone. I already lost all of my freinds, I'm already lonely, but it will kill me to throw away what little I have left. before covid I was in the house for 3 months anyway. Because of my fucking autism, school was a nightmare and, though I loved my freinds, I couldn't go. So I just stayed home and rotted away. What's worse is that I'm not even sure my friends liked me, looking back, I think I was a joke to them, which hurts more than I can explain. 

I have no one. No one can help me. My parents keep saying that they need me and I can tell they're worried I'm gonna kill myself, but this is something I need to do since there is no way out. My voice will never be higher.  My feet will never be small. I'll never wear a dress. I'll never make a friend, I'll never be normal. I'm completely  emotionally drained. 

Do I live my life completely alone and depressed but look the way I want to, or stay how I am and remain suicidal. No matter which I choose I still wont be happy. There is no way out
