I am not meant to this lifeI have no clue how things work, i don't know how to pay bills, i don't understand politics, i honestly am not prepared for life i'm 18 and i should know better, i never been to college due to social anxiety, i am just not prepared for life or life is not meant for me, and i don't know what i should do, if i either keep living or if i just die, because i don't give a fuck about life, and how it works.'  


for now ill go back to my miserable life in my room doing nothing all day, hoping for a miracle that will help me understand life and get me to get out of the house.
