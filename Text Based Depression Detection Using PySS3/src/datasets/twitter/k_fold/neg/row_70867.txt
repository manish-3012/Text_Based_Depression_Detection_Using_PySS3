Im so tiredI want to end it all sooner or later.

Hey people, probably last time I might be typing something (I hope) because death is inevitable. There's no much good people left in the world. I have everything in life - money, good family, good friends, can speak multiple languages, can sketch, write poetry, can meditate for long hours, good home, excellent academic background.

Due to some incidents in the past, I've been suffering from chronic depression, pain, anxiety, overthinking from many years. I just hate the way it is. I tried studying hard from past 10 months, but every effort failed. It's not like I'm a dumb kid. I have fairly good academic grip. I underwent rehab thrice due to some addictions and now I'm taking Therapy  yet, I feel like shit all the time. I don't want this to continue. So  I have some tools which can help me end me. Life. I can go jump into that lake with little efforts. I suck, I'm a miserable person. Why am I typing here? To let you know that it is okay to die willingly. I can't take this anymore. I'm right now trying to starve to death. I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of dying while living. :(
