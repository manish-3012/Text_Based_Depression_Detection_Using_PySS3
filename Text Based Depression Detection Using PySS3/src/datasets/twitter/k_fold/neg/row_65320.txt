Why do I have to be such an attention whoreI always just grab things and poke people and say stupid shit just so my friends will pay attention to me. I can tell they're annoyed and that I'm annoying but I can't stop no matter how hard I try. One of my friends even asked if I had ADHD (I do not as far as I'm aware). 

I can't change myself and I can tell everyone is done with me. It would be so much better if I just stopped breathing.
