iâ€™m a leechmy boyfriend carries all our financial burdens. i only work one day a week. i donâ€™t drive. iâ€™ve never had my license because of anxiety. he drives us everywhere. even when heâ€™s tired after working 45 hours a week. i donâ€™t even clean the apartment or do his laundry often. the most i do is cook. aside from that i just sleep all day or lay on the couch staring at the wall or my phone. 

heâ€™s very good about my depression. he is understanding and checks on me all the time and assured me iâ€™m not a burden. but it doesnâ€™t make me feel less like one. i contribute nothing at all. i just make him listen to my crying and leave takeout containers on the floor because i canâ€™t get out of bed to throw it away. i donâ€™t deserve him and i donâ€™t deserve to take up space in his life. he could have any beautiful, kind, talented and hard working girl he wanted that takes care of herself. but he has me. 

i hate myself. iâ€™m a leech and i donâ€™t have the energy to change it. every job iâ€™ve had the past year iâ€™ve ended up quitting because i was too miserable. i hate myself and i want to kill myself. i just donâ€™t know how.
