"Most suicidal people donâ€™t actually want to die, they want an answer to their problems. Itâ€™s a decision made when other decisions seem impossible."So much this. i dont want to kill myself in the sense i want to end my life, i just want an answer to my problems, i want to stop feeling the pain.
