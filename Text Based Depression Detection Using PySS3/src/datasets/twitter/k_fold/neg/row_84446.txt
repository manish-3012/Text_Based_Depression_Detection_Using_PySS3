How concerned should I be?  Should I talk to my psychologist about current suicide ideation?I have been pretty fucked up for the past year.  Diagnosed bipolar, detachment, paranoid, and sever anxiety.  Maybe more that they just haven't told me about.  Doc says I am not a schizophrenic though.

Anyway, when my parents divorced, I used to think about committing suicide.  I was 5 or maybe 6.  Now I am mid 30's, and I have been married 12 years.  I have no idea why anyone would marry me.

Well, it seems my wife is sick of being with someone sick.  I can't blame her.  I am surprised she has stuck around this long.  We do have two kids together, 6 and 8.

The thought has crossed my mind that the world, my family, and especially my wife would be better off if I wasn't around.  I have life insurance that will take care of them much better than I can in the short run, and if they are smart, it will last through the long run.  I can't say the same for me.

So, while I am not in a mindset of, "okay, it is time to make a plan or move on," I do find myself thinking of the most efficient ways to die.  Like tripping in front of a light rail train car or something, falling into the street.

Is this what suicide ideation is?  Is it something I should mention to my psych?  I don't think I am going to off myself, and I do NOT want to end up in a 72 hour non voluntary hold.  Hell, after 72 hours they might decide to keep me.
