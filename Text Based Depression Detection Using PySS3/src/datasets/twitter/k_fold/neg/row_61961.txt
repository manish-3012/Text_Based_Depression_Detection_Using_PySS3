Well, my last days, 12/16/16My life is shit

I'm failing school being in and out of hospitals all the time

My mom caught me trying to hang myself with my bed sheets and called the police

My parents abuse me

I have no friends and I get made fun of

I cut myself every day, (no where else to cut body is filled with slits)

I try to drink my problems away

I get bullied for being "a fucking emo 14 year old"

I'm done with everything, can't handle this anymore, I tried posting here before and I got nothing, someone told me to try this for help and It doesn't do anything

Fuck life.
