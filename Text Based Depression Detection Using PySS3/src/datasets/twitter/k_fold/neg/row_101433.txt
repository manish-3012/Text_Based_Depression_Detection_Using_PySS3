I found myself sorting out my things and writing another suicide note today.I found some calm in writing it, but I still have dark thoughts of hanging myself off the upstairs banister. 

I wrote this:

&gt;How long did it take you to notice I was dead? weeks, or maybe even months? Did you even notice, or did a neighbor complain about the smell coming from next door of my corpse rotting away?  Yeah, that is part of the problem on why I did it. None of you cared. Nobody cared. You cant say that isn't true. I really haven't spoken to anyone in months, I get more conversation with the grocery and parcel delivery guys. I'm sure you all can carry on, as usual, me being dead makes not a blind bit of change or difference to your lives, and you know that's true. Bye.

Thanks for reading.
