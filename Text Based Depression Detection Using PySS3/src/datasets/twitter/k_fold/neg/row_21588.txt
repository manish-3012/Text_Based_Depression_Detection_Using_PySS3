I don't understandEverything in my life seems to be getting gradually better but I'm just getting more and more sad. I'm 20 with a career, a paid off car, had laser eye surgery and only about $1000 dollars total debt. I have just about everything I want but nothing makes me happy. I feel a deep sadness in my chest that won't go away and I don't want to feel anything any more.
