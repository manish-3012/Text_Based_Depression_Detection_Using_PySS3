NoteMom, Dad, D, H, everyone

I love you. I'm so so sorry.

I usually have so much to say. But as I'm writing this, I'm at a loss.

I've given up. When a man loses hope, it doesn't matter how much else he has, he has lost everything.

I could write essays about what's bumming me out. About what's got me angry. I could obsess and mull over every single intricate little detail.

But that seems wholly inappropriate. It seems unfair. As if this could have a justification. Even if I believe it does, I know it doesn't. I've spent my entire life trying to be "good". I know this is far and away my greatest sin.

I hate my life. And I'm so so so very sorry. I'm so sorry.

I can't handle it. And I can't articulate it in a way that would make any of it understandable, much less better. You all gave me every chance in the world. Every opportunity. Every shoulder to cry on. None of this has anything at all to do with any of you. Not a bit of it.

I love you all so much. But I hate my life. And I *hate* drama. So I won't blather on or make this any more melodramatic than it has to be.

If at all possible, make the narrative that I died in a car accident. I think that will help quell the wildfire of pain I'm about to cause.
