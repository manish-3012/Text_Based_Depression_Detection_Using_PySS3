I shouldn't be having these thoughts...I shouldn't be posting here. I'm supposed to be happy, my family just keeps telling me to make myself happy. I danced with a girl last night for the second time in my life, I was so happy... But everything is spiraling down. People are so rude and competitive in my sport, one of the only things that is important to me. My mom is stressed a lot and I can't make my Dad proud because I'm too hurt to run. People who don't deserve what they have flaunt it in front of me. I always told myself I'd be fine. I'd never be this kid, but everything seems like it's crashing down. I can't put up with it every day.
