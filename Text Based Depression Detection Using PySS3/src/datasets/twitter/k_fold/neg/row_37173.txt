My little brother on the other side of the country...So I called my step dad yesterday (He lives in Philly, I'm in Cali) to wish him a happy father's day and check in on my two little brothers. (11 and soon to be 13) I found out that my 11 year old brother tried to kill himself about 2 weeks ago and was hospitalized from it. I didn't ask what he did cause I knew, when talking to my little brother, he was embarrassed about it. I feel so afraid of something happening. I cried in my girlfriend's arms last night about it. I love my brother and don't know what I can do to help him. Please give me advice?
