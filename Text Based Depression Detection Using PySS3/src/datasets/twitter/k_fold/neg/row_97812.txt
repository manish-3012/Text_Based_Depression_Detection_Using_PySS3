Not gonna bother with a throwawayBecause it's no use. I've hit rock bottom with everything. Been on antidepressants for a long time now. I've just lost my only love, I hate the field I'm working in. Had to move back home because I am currently on sick leave for depression. 

At this point, I've tried before, unsuccessfully unfortunately. Now though, I'm almost there where I'd get an illegal firearm for this purpose only. It'd be hard to get a hold of, but my last paycheck should cover it just about. 

I feel bad for my brothers, I wish I could get euthanasia in Belgium or Netherlands, because I might be able to explain to them that I can't live with this pain. It's okay to not want to go on sometimes, I just really wanna go peacefully. I've prayed for dying in my sleep for years, best proof ever God is either not listening or a complete prick. Either way, all I need is a handgun now.

So I've got a couple of weeks before last paycheck. After that, I'll see you on the other side.
