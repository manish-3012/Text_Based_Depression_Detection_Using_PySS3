shouldnt school make us happy happywhen i wake up in the mornings i want to cry. i always wake up with this feeling that there's a hole in my stomach and it makes me want to rip my guts out. i go to school and get graded and i always get bad grades and it constantly makes me feel like absolute worthless shit. i feel like less than shit less than dirt less than nothing. i keep getting bad grades and it makes me just want to go home and distract myself with anything but school work and because of that i end up not doing my school work then i get disappointed glares from teachers which makes me feel worse and then i get shit test grades and i feel even worse and everyone else talks about how easy it was and i feel worse and worse and worse and it just keeps going and I don't know what to do anymore other than give up and just get a GED when I'm older. school shouldn't make us feel this way. all my teachers say grades aren't that important and we should focus on our own learning but it is. if it wasn't like that I probably wouldn't be feeling like less than shit right now. everything is weighed on how good we do when we're only fucking teenagers. i have been diagnosed with depression and i told one of my teachers about it and she's sweet but god she made it so much worse. she treats me different now she gives me hints on tests she always looks at me with her un-known pity and in the mornings says good morning to me with a voice you would use to lovingly talk to a baby or dog. i don't want to be talked to like a dog i want to be talked to and treated like a fucking equal like I'm just another fucking student makes me feel worse and different and less than others. a place where we spend the majority of our days shouldn't make us feel like crap I shouldn't have to feel this way I'm only 15 and I can only take so much of this. as i wrote this my mom yelled at me for not doing school work. i dont want to be here anymore.
