I don't know how much longer I can do this


I really don't... every day gets worse and worse and I have to force myself to do all these things like work and school, otherwise i'll get in trouble. I never get a break, no days off. Just constant work and it never stops. I just want it all to stop, I want calmness I hate all the pressure that's on me. Being forced into quarantine and not having enough money to move out has forced me to have to stay home with my mother. She always takes out her anger and frustrations on me since im the only one at home. Everything that goes wrong in her life is my fault. Oh I tried to kill myself in the past? How could I do this to my mother? How could I ruin her life like that? I'm such a selfish and mean person. Oh we don't have enough money to buy this thing? I cost too much to feed and house. I didn't get a good grade? I'm stupid and lazy and I don't try hard enough in school. I'm depressed and suicidal? Can't talk about that or else i'll get in trouble because I live such a good life and I have nothing to be sad about. Try to leave the house to escape this? Nope, get body slammed against the wall and pinned to the floor (she's heavy and hard to escape) and have your phone taken out of your hand because obviously it's the source of all my problems. I don't even bother fighting back because it's useless, i'm the disappointment, im the useless person who only uses up ressources and does nothing productive. I'm only 17 and I can't afford an apartment yet but even when I can, I know that guilt that i'm ruining everything good in her life will follow me around. I don't want to live like that and there's no escape...I really can't stay here any longer, I can't handle it. I can't keep letting down every single person around me like this, no matter how hard I try, I can never get anything right. I want to bash my head through a wall, I want to bash my head through a wall till I bleed out...I can't fucking do this anymore.
