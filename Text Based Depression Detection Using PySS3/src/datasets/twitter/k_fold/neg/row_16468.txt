I cant stand being alive.I started getting depressed again around September I think. I made this Reddit account to talk about my problems so I can get better. I went back to therapy and I thought I was going to get better. And I was, only for a bit. I started getting more suicidal and doing less and less work. I smoked weed only once or twice a week and now I spend all the money I can get on it. I wanted to die later in life. 18 or 20. Now I want to right now. Every day I feel this constant urge to kill myself or harm myself. But is that bad? No. I don't need attention for my bullshit. I don't need therapy anymore. That's just gonna make people give me attention and I don't want it. I'm not important and I never was. I wish I would fall asleep and never wake up.
