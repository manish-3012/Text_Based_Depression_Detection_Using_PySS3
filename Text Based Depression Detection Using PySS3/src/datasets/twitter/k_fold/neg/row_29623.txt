I would rather kill myself than take this examI haven't studied and honestly don't care that I'll fail. The amount of work that goes into taking an online exam is too much for me to handle right now. I contacted my school's crisis line last week and they basically sent me away so I'm really at a loss. I already missed a different exam last week. I'm sucidal anyways but this exam is making it a lot worse.
