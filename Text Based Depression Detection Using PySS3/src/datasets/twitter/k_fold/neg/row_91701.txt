This is pretty much it.I have no reasons whatsoever left to linger about.  In too much pain to go on and the future is dead.

Now I play the waiting game on how much courage I can gather and how long before I throw in the towel and join my ancestors.

Hey, if I said it was fun I'd be lying.  Toodaloo.
