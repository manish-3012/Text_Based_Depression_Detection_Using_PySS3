My life is going nowhere, I have no motivation and no talent.I'm getting older and less attractive every year. It's becoming clearer that I'll never live up to any potential it was once thought I might have.

I'm afraid of dying old and unremarkable but time seems to be slipping between my fingers. I'm not doing anything or achieving anything. I'm consumed by anxiety and I don't know how to be a real person.

I desperately want to exist - to be attractive and interesting and confident and to do more than sit on this website all day. But for some reason that's not possible for me?  I need to just get through this transitory period and face the fact that things are never going to get better and I should summon up the courage to kill myself while I still have my dignity and the illusion of potential is still somewhat intact.
