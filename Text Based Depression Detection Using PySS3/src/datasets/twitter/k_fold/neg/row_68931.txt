trying to alleviate the inevitable pain as much as possible. thoughts welcome. thanks.fake name - 8/13/17

The clock has expired. I'm not sure how I've lasted this long. Life has become something I 
never anticipated. More accurately, I've been unable to appreciate anything life has to offer.

I've been pulled in every direction and every time I've disappointed.

I'm weak. Most people could handle this. I cannot.

I've always thought of myself as somewhat intelligent. I still do I suppose (not to be a cocky shithead, just being real),
but that doesn't make up for my failings.

I'm not sure if it's guilt, liability, or something else entirely that I've been living with. I just know that I have an inability to handle
past and current circumstances and almost certainly any circumstances that would arise in the future.

I am certainly at fault for far too many things...most recently and importantly, for
wasting years of a completely innocent soul just because I couldn't determine if life was worth living.

M., I hope you understand that this is absolutely no reflection of you. You've been a a candlelight in a dark
tunnel that I've resided in for as long as I can remember. I've kept chasing the candlelights in my life thinking
I will crawl out of the tunnel.  It's proven to be a fruitless task.  I've given up.  I lose.  I know this will
scar you.  Please forgive me. I know that this is the easy way out, but please be stronger than me.  Know that this is no
reflection of you.

C.H.: You've been nothing short of a perfect mother.  Please be rest assured, and I mean this, that no blame lies with you, or anyone who
would bother reading this for that matter. This situation is entirely internal and I've deemed it irreconcilable. 

I don't know what most people expect out of this life, but I was unable to find it.

I love you all.  More than you'll ever know.

L.W.

P.S.  Fuck Dreyer

P.S.S. Go Fuck Yourself L.V. :)


In short: Life sucks, fuck this I'm out.
