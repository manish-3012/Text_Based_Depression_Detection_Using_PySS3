Nobody caresI can't do this anymore. When i was young I used to fantasize about my mom realizing how my dad treated me when drunk and angry. How she'd hug me and tell me that I don't deserve to have things thrown at me, or to be called the things he called me, or the threats to hurt me, or the way he would eavesdrop and spy on me to make sure I wasn't funding help from friends. But she didn't. She's probably known all her life, and i was too dumb to notice. She didn't care.

I'm just so fucking alone. This was going to be my summer, no self-harm. I was more than a year clean. I don't want to continue another summer here. I don't want to continue another summer.
