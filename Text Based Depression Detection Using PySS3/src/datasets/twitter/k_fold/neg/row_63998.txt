Seasonal depressionDoes the spring and summer ever make anyone more depressed? I like winter because it validates my depression and makes me feel normal.......Sunlight does make me feel better, but I'm so fucking low that it reminds me of the hell I need to climb out of. I'm curious if anyone else feels like this.......regardless of this, I'm gonna try my fucking hardest to embrace the warm weather and "positive vibes"......I cant afford to feel like this any longer
