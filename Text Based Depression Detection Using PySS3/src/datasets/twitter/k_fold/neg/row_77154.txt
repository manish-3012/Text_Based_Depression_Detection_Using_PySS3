I don't know what to name this.I am not sure if this belongs here or maybe it belongs in /r/depressed.
I ve been depressed approximately five years now, i ve managed to fuck up every single thing i ve tried to do.
Managed to fuck up school aswell i ve been thinking of well... Killing myself over the past three years but i never really had the balls to do it.
I can't get into school again to fix my grades i see no future in any jobs fuck i barely know how to function anymore or do anything really,
i have difficult even waking up to do stuff, to talking to girls to anything and sometimes i just wanna crawl into a corner and cry.
I know there is worse post here that might need more help than me but thank you for reading this i suppose.
Anyone have some kind of advice to me? 
Greatly appreciated.
