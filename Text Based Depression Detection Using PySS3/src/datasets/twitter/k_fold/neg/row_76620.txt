Instead of choosing to end it all, I choose to stop living insteadFirstly, yâ€™all can go through my post history, thereâ€™s a long-ish post I made about seven months ago which details all my problems. Iâ€™m 18M and honestly, I thought 2020 will be the year I change everything bad about my life. Instead, what do I realise? I hate myself with a passion unrivalled.

I canâ€™t even look at myself in the mirror without self loathing. I just wake up every morning and tell myself how lucky I am to have not killed myself the previous day. Iâ€™m perfectly happy to give others advice and cheer them on but when it comes to myself? I canâ€™t even stand myself and I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m chugging on knowing I despise myself so much. 

Today morning I decided to stop living instead. Not suicide, but to not be truly alive either. Iâ€™ll still do my college work and upskill myself enough to make a living and probably treat myself to some material possessions and thatâ€™s it. I wish to be this emotionless person because I canâ€™t take this pain anymore. I will no longer expect anything from anyone or even from fate or whatever, which is messed anyways. 

One day I wonâ€™t wake up and maybe Iâ€™ll be happier then. Or I wonâ€™t feel anything at worst. I canâ€™t stand the pain of being alive each day. Itâ€™s more of a burden than a blessing and honestly itâ€™s not like my life is meaningful anyways. 

I attempted suicide three years ago and nearly succeeded and I know dying will reduce the chance of anything remotely good happening to zero. But I donâ€™t have any motivation to live either. I like writing code and learning programming but these days I canâ€™t even focus on it.

Sorry if this sounds like rambling, I hope Iâ€™ll make it through 2020.
