I was 10 the first timeWhen I was ten, I learned that you could kill you self. My mother was very depressed and would have panic attacks about ways she would hurt or kill herself. She would tell me everything.

I never remember feeling mentally okay, and when I learned this, I tried taking a lot of Tylenol. It didnâ€™t work, but it is really the thought that counts.

When I was 16, it all became too much. The trauma of my childhood along with current burdens. I tired again. It didnâ€™t work.

To this day, I wish it did. However, my survival to today has shown me so much.  My best friend tried to kill himself last week. The rope broke. My other friends brother committed suicide. It worked. Heâ€™s gone forever.

And Iâ€™m just here thinking about how unfair it all is. Both my best friend and I got that second change, the brother? Heâ€™s just gone... forever.

And I hate myself for regretting the fact I am alive so much. Cause I got my second chance.  I guess I just wish it was me who died and someone else who got that second chance. 

Sorry for this nonsense, I just had to let it all out.
