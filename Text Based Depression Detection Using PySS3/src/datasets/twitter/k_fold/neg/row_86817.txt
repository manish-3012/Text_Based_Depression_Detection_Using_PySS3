I almost walked into the roadI.. last night i almost walked into the street because i just.. i cant take it anymore. This is the closest ive ever gotten, and i feel like a coward because i couldnt do it even though i know i shouldnt do it. I feel bad bc i scared my girlfriend... and my friends... but i cant freaking afford to go to a therapist or get help and i just dont know what to do especially with my gf bc shes got a lot of problems herself and i want to help but its her battle not mine.
