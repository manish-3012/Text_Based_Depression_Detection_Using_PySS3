what do i have left to live for?i feel like iâ€™m letting everyone around me down. my mother keeps telling me that everyone has sacrificed so much for me to be able to attend college but iâ€™m selfish and donâ€™t do anything in return. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. iâ€™ve hated myself and have put myself last for years and when i finally feel happy with myself and want to actually start putting me and my mental health first i get called selfish. i donâ€™t know how to please anyone, not even myself. iâ€™m a fucking burden. iâ€™m sitting here clutching a bottle of pills trying to decide if me dying would be for better or for worse.
