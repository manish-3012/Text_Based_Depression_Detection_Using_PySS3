test post please ignoreFailed my drivers test

Feel like shit

Don't know what to do

Realizing I'm kind of lost in life

Stressed to the point of nausea

Have to go to work tomorrow early

Can't sleep, heart racing

Hurts

Gonna be tired tomorrow but not as acutely sad

Probably very irritable
 
Gonna have to tell a lot of people I failed

Ask my boss for more time off to fix it

Don't know what date I will

Don't know if I will

Kind of want to kill myself

Don't have anything to look forward to


Family not feeling well

I don't have any happiness

First time I've felt anything in weeks

It's not nice
