I need some advice.So I drank a lot. I had a great life and almost completed a college degree and had amazing friends and girlfriends but started to drink a lot for whatever reason. I was sober for a long while until a few days ago when my alcoholic mother got drunk once more and at 6 in the morning woke me up, cursed me out, beat me up physically and kicked me out of the house. It was a disgusting urge but I succumbed to it. I drank, and have been drinking since. I just don't know what I am going to do tomorrow, or the day after. The way I see it every day following this is going to be a repetition of sadness and depression. I'm back at home now but I really cannot picture a life that ends up in happiness, in any way possible. Can someone just throw a few words my way? Please?
