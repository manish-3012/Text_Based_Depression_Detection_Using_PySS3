Letting it outHi :( Not a good start to today, especially since it's my 21st birthday.. And I woke up to an argument with my mum and it ended with me breaking a door in rage and ignoring everything/everyone for the rest of the day.
Everyone's gone whereever and I'm home alone now. I just came back online from being in the toilet alone crying in the dark.. haha....
I think about today and reflect on the past and I think I've always hated being alive. Don't get me wrong, I've had a pretty good life in comparison to many, but I don't think anyone has really understood me (and I don't expect you to either) hence [this](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/126/314/3cd8a33a.png?1306264975). 
This isn't just a one off thing, every once in awhile I have a breakdown by myself lololol.... :( but I do keep living, not for myself but for others (sadly)
I don't know what to do anymore or why I even bother, so tired of everything but there's always that nagging "they will be sad if you do that" feeling.. :(
Sorry to bother with you having read this but I just wanted to take some stuff off my chest before I head into work. I won't/can't do anything drastic, so don't worry (lol if you do..) about that, have too many promises to make before I do anything..
