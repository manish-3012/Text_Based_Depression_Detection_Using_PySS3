sick of being told to find hobbieswhenever I talk about being unhappy with life people tell me to find hobbies and iâ€™m so sick of it. first off, i have zero interests. nothing holds my attention for very long and iâ€™m ultimately left feeling worse once I lose interest. second, iâ€™m broke as shit and canâ€™t afford to invest in anything I may be interested in. 

do people really think i choose not to be interested in shit?? I wish I could find something to enjoy but nothing makes me happy and it ends up making me feel so much worse.
