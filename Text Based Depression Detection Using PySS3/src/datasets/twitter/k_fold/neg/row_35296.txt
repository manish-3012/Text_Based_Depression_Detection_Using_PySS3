I took a bottle of my ADHD meds and sleeping pillsIâ€™m so stupid. I feel so horrible. Why would I do this if itâ€™s just gonna make me really sick? I just want out of this pain and things have continued going downhill. I feel like I had no choice but to take these pills. I guess if I fail this will just be a cry for help. I hope this is successful in killing me (I know itâ€™s unlikely), but if I end up awake in a psychward, I hope I can find peace. That is all I want is to be free of this misery.
