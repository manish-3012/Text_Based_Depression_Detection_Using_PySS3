Sex/porn addictionI'm 23 years old and restarting my whole life and finally going back to college. Used to be addicted to Adderall and alcohol but I'm clean now, I smoke the occasional joint though. 

I've came to realize how much I need sex. I've been single for 8months and all I've been doing is masturbating 3-4 times a day and paying for escorts whenever I can. I've put myself into 6k of credit card debt, i live at home and have to hide my debt and addiction from my family.

 When my hypomania episodes kick in (I'm bipolar type 2), I go into overdrive. I make about 1000 a month and put $300 towards my credit card and bills, $200 for therapy and then the rest for escorts (also get more money from credit card cash advances and/or selling stuff I own). Sometimes I'll skip therapy just to have more money for escorts. I hate myself, I always tell myself this is it, I'm not paying for sex anymore. 

When I abstain from escorts I basically hide in my room and masturbate all day. I don't have any friends because I neglected them, I just want to have sex. I haven't had sex with someone who wasn't a sex worker since I was in my last relationship. 

If I go a week or so without sex I lose it. I can't do anything, everything puts me into a fit of rage. I need sex, I need it often and it's always on my mind. I look at porn almost all day, in public, on the bus, doesn't matter.

 I hate myself and I can't live like this anymore. I have so much shame but I just can't fucking stop. What's wrong with me? When I'm on my way to see an escort I just feel AWFUL, but I know I'll feel worse if I don't.  This has taken over my life. It is who I am now and I can't live like this anymore. I don't want to keep going through this.

I don't know what to do, the only solution I see is death.
