ScaredI've been going to counseling for depression and anxiety for two years. Was immediately prescribed lexapro by my first counselor. Now I'm taking the generic of celexa. I feel like nothing has helped. I've tried four different counselors. Suicidal thoughts are getting worse. In high school, I vaguely had the plan to kill myself after I graduated college... which happens next month. I fantasize about being terminally sick or dead as I fall asleep. It's both comforting and absolutely terrifying. I feel like the only reason I haven't done it already is because I know it would destroy my mom. I'm really scared. I can't stop crying. My parents have hinted at in-patient mental treatment centers, but I do not want that. I have no friends, live alone, and can hardly make myself get up in the morning. I don't know what to do. Help.
