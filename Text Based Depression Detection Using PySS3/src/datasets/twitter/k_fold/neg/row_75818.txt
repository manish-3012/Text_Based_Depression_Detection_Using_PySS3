Just what's going through my mindWith the exception of one day, I've been in constant pain for over 9 years now. More &amp; more of my body is breaking. I don't remember what it feels like to not feel as though my foot is on fire. Pain medication doesn't help me. The last 2 times I saw the pain specialist I was told that there's nothing more I can try. 

I'm likely to be losing the funding for a weekly cleaner within the next month or two. My psychologist is being transferred soon, so I only have one more appointment with her before she has to refer me to someone else. My sister &amp; her kids will be moving 5 hours away in early January, &amp; I don't see myself being physically able to go visit them, &amp; I probably couldn't get the money for it either. (I'm on a disability pension)

I've fought so hard to keep going for as long as I have, but it just keeps getting harder. I've kept going mainly because of my sister, &amp; my nieces &amp; nephews, but I can't stop wondering, "when have I suffered enough?"

I guess what I'm asking is, is there a reason to keep fighting the suicidal thoughts? It seems like everything is pointing to January or so being a suitable time for me to die.

I know that it'd be sad for my family, but I just don't feel like I can cope with this much longer
