I canâ€™t make a decent title to save my lifeRecently Iâ€™ve been realizing that though I hate myself I donâ€™t rlly know why ? Like there are some things that are apparent but I just donâ€™t understand. And the feeling of self hatred is getting worse and worse. Idk where itâ€™s coming from and it hurts so fucking much. I just donâ€™t know. Iâ€™ve been contemplating the afterlife a lot recently too. I just sit here wondering how heâ€™ll is gonna be. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because Iâ€™m scared of surviving and having to face my parents. I donâ€™t want that at all. That fear is starting to be overpowered by the self hatred and Iâ€™m scared. What if I do survive and end up in an even worse situation. 

Sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense itâ€™s just incoherent rambling
