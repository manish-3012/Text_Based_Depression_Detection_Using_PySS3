God I can really do it this timeI'm not sad, I'm so pissed. 

I just got into a HUGE argument with my long distance ex-boyfriend who broke up with me because I have the misconception that most white people have racist views. And instead of talking about the issue with me, showing me what I'm thinking wrong, and understanding for a fucking MINUTE that my views extend from all my self-loathing and anxieties all he cared about was telling me how wrong I am until he basically said he told me to fuck off.

I'm very far from a perfect fucking person. But when you tell someone you never loved anyone like you love them, would never leave them EVER, talk about how devastated you would be without them then tell them to screw off because they a fucking social outcast that has a malinformed and maladjusted way to dealing rejection that's a new fucking low.

I can't trust ANYONE. And I will never trust another motherfucker. All I want to do is bleed and get out of this piece of shit world where everyone is a LIAR and user. I used to think I hated myself but I really just hate being here SO MUCH. I can't stand people. God how I fucking hate this world that's given me nothing but shit.

I won't miss it. None of you.
