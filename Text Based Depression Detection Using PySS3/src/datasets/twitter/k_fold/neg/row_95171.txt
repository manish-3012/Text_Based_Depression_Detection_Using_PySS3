I attempted suicide 3 times and no one knowsLast time I tried to end myself was 11 days ago, I felt so overwhelmed by my thoughts and the voices again.
No one knows that and it makes me feel so sad but happy as well because I don't want to explain how I feel because I don't know how to explain it or why I've done that. Anyways I don't have any friend to talk with, I don't want some and I'm so so confused: everyday is a battle between my depressed ass and my big ego, slowly my ego is winning and all the darkness I've hidden is taking the place of who I was and at this point I don't mind it.
