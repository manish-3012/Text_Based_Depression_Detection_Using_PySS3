Iâ€™m always thrown back into rock bottomMy life will never get better. Iâ€™ll never find love, Iâ€™ll never succeed in anything, I just want a way to kill myself fast and easy. I hate being 17 and always depending on my parents for everything because I feel worthless. I canâ€™t move out at 18 because Iâ€™m broke. Iâ€™m always left on read and ignored by everyone and Iâ€™m teased at school. I donâ€™t want to deal with all this I just want to die
