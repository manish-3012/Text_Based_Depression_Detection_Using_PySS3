TiredI have been so tired of being awake. I am tired of eating everyday, working, showering, being alive. I feel so exhausted. the thought of doing this dumbass shit for another year makes me so anxious and upset. i donâ€™t want to live another day much less another year or another decade. too tired to live, to pussy to die.
