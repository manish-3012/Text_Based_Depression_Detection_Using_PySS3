Depression is hitting me deeper than I thought, trying to stay strong but I want to die so badI canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™ve been suffering for years. None of my friends and family know it. Heck, some of them would always talk about their other friends or family members with mental health problems but little did they know Iâ€™m suffering. Due to severe bullying in the past I was put into a mental hospital during highschool and university. My parents donâ€™t know. They thought I went on vacation with friends. When reality was, I was trying to keep my mental health in tact.

Iâ€™m hiding it. No one knows. Outside surface Iâ€™m pretty happy. At times, I want to commit suicide. Jump off a bridge again or drown myself again. 

I just want to end it all. I know life is a blessing but I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™ve made some pretty wrong decisions. We all learn from our mistakes. But all I think about is death. When death comes, life is over. I canâ€™t find my fucking purpose. Iâ€™m trying but I really fucking canâ€™t. 

Finnancially, my parents donâ€™t help me. I work myself to the bone. I have no time for social life. Only occasionally. Iâ€™ve given up my dreams and flew back here thinking my Dad was dying. Now, Iâ€™ve lost hope. Everytime I start thinking positive again, life slaps me right back. I just want to fucking cry endlessly. I canâ€™t take it anymore. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore. I canâ€™t even control my mind. I just want it all to end.
