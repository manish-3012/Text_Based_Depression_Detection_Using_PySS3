I was in a car accident 3 weeks ago...I've never been suicidal but I lost my hand.  I don't give a damn about my other injuries but losing my hand made me lose it.  I can't play sports, video games, or do simple things anymore.  I've been crying everyday saying "this shouldn't have happened" etc.  Don't tell me to adjust, it's fucking terrible having one hand, I broke my wrist before so I had that experience but I still played pingpong, videogames, wrote, and ate with it.   All I've done is scream and yell at the hospital and at home.  I've grinded my teeth, twisted my neck, and banged my head against the wall.  I've kicked holes into walls, kicked the door off, and kicked a car window back to where wind blows through it.  I've done even more dumb shit like spit in my mom's face, I've completely lost it in just 2 weeks.  I stopped showering and brushing my teeth.  All I do is look down and cry all day then later stare at the night sky hoping some aliens would come and fix me with their technology.  If only we were given second chances to go back in time or have a wish because I can't live being disabled
