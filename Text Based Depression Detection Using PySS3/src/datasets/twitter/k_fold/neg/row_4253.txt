I'm fucking tiredI want to die. I've been holding in all the pain that my mom caused me, and I'm to scared to talk back to her when she yells at me, she gave me severe anxiety which makes it even scarier to talk back, I'm scared, in all argument she says that she is the victim and no one else is, in reality I'm the victim, and my last straw was pulled today, I was asking my little sister if she wanted sunflower seeds with her lunch and then my mom starts yelling at my for asking my little sister for something else with her lunch, I was just trying to be nice, I what I always get in return for trying to be nice is getting yelled at like I did something wrong. I fucking cut myself today in the first time in a year. I just want this to FUCKING END. All I do is get yelled at like I'm a fucking bitch. I want to be dead so I don't have to feel pain anymore.
