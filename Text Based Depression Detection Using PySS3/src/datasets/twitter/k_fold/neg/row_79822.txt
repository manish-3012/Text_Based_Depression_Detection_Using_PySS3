16yo - attacksMy whole life never been gold, bad parents, kids in school bullying me because of â€œdisfunctionâ€( to the point when once 6 dudes attacked me on brake and i got my bone broken, since then i never been in school. Months) sometimes i tried to fight back, sometimes i failed. 1.5 week ago failed attempt, since then nearly every nighttime is nightmare, the later it gets, the bigger problem i have to sleep, Iâ€™m starting to stress as hell, Iâ€™m getting paranoid, self-harm, its like anxiety attack but way way longer , for whole nighttime. It keeps getting worse and i really need someone to be there with me when it happens , because Iâ€™m scared ill do something... what i couldnâ€™t be able to come back from. Anyone willing to chat, be friends and help me at night times, id be really grateful.
