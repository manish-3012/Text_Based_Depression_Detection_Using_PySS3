So I wrote a note, what now?If anyone cares to check my post history, just went through a really rough breakup.  Been feeling depressed and cant even breathe.  I cried all through writing the note to my ex and the note to my parents.  Ive been on hold for suicide prevention for almost 2 hours now.   I just dont even know what to do.
