Death is so temptingJust thinking about dying makes me smile a little, don't get me wrong I've wanted to have a wonderful life but my anxiety and depression are deep within me. Iam so tired i just wanna laid down and fall asleep to then never awake again, just feeling peaceful is what i imagine dying is.
