I try so hard but even I know that's a lie.I don't know what's wrong with me anymore, I pissed away so many good things in my life because of what I feel was one persons fault and I've been dragging that ball and chain behind me for years now.

I can't find the motivation to change who I am or the situation I've put myself into. Been homeless, lived in the bed of my truck, kicked out of countless houses because I'm a terrible employee and can't keep a job. I quit my tractor trailer driving job because I didn't want to be away from my family but now that I'm home, I can't muster the strength to look them in the face anymore.

I was always late on rent because I just can't control my money and now I'm squatting in a run down house with holes in the roof, walls and ceiling, no plumbing and the only electricity is a drop cord from the neighbors house. It's just been me and my cats for years, going from town to town, job to job, house to house. 

I feel like I'm at the point where I've become such a burden on everyone around me that I can't ask for help because it seems like I'm always leeching off everyone. I sleep until I absolutely have to wake up for work because I don't even want to be awake anymore. But I'm writing this now because I had a thought to myself that if I were to just off myself now, no one would notice for weeks, maybe months despite everyone knows where I am, because no one cares to visit, to call or just acknowledge my existence. And I don't blame them.
