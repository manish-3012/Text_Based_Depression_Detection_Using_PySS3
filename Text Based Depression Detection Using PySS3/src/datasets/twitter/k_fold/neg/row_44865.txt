I want to die. I know my life is never going to be better.Honestly I think hope is the cruelest thing there is. If it wasn't for some vain hope I would have killed myself by now. 

My mum and I argue every few days or so and it is a rollercoaster of hope and pain that I don't think I can handle anymore. 

I feel like I don't know what is real anymore. One moment my mum is saying it's her fault and she loves me and next she's upset again and telling me that I'm patronizing, that I talk down to her and that she's afraid to say anything around me.  

I try to listen to her, but she's always so negative (she may have depression) that I get frustrated when I have to explain for the thousandth time that she is loved and supported, but all I get from her is that all she wants is a bit of kindness. She never explains what that kindness is. I give her hugs and listen to her rant for hours about the latest problem, but I can't do it anymore. I'm probably just being selfish. 

I know I'm going to kill myself, I just don't know when. After every argument I think about ways to kill myself and it gets easier every time, to the point I can easily hurt myself now. I need to punish myself for the horrible thing I am.
