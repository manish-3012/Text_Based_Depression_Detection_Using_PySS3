Why do all the articles that show up when you google "reasons to live" absolutely make me want to kill myself even more?I'm looking for reasons to live and I come across shit that says "because of puppy kisses and a home cooked meal" like what in the entire fuck.   


There is no science to support that life will get better. It will absolutely get worse so I think it's rational to want to kill yourself now.   
Please someone talk me out of it.   
But miss me with saying shit like "your friends and family will miss you"... they'll be sad for two months and then move on juuuusttt fiiine.
