I don't knowI like the idea of being able to stay alive, but I don't think I have it in me, and I don't think I deserve to. My partner of 4 years has decided to leave me and move across the country. We understand each other better than anyone, we are soulmates. We've also had our share of problems, we've abused each other. She insists she's never done anything to hurt me, and yet I feel emotionally abused. But I'm the monster. And I know I am. I hurt her and didn't treat her right and freaked out over little things like her not picking her clothes up off the floor and now I am going to look around an empty room and wish her clothes were there. I live in a city I hate for graduate school, and can only move if I want to give up my career. I don't have any friends who I feel close to here, my best friends live in the city she is moving to. In over 100k of debt from undergrad and grad, my father is dead, my mother is dying, I'm transgender and can't come out to her. I'm not a good person. I don't understand how people go from there life being in the gutter, to their life not being simply worthless but actually HARMFUL to the world to living some sort of life where they can be at peace with themselves. There's just no way. I don't know what else to do.
