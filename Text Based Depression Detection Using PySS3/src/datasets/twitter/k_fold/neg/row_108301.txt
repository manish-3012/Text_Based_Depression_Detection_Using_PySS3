Why not?Someone talk to me. I am in my house alone with loads of pills and all I want to do is take all of them. I want to die. I can't deal with this back and forth anymore. I've only been out of treatment for 3 days and I am already triggered more than ever. I am really scared this time. All I wanted was to go uphill and I can't. It is heartbreaking.
