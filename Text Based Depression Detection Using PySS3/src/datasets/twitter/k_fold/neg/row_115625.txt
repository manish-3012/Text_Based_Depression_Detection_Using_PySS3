My wedding is on Saturday and I want to kill my self the night before.Title pretty much explains it all but I intend to ramble more. I first tried to commit suicide when I was twelve and the thoughts have never diminished. I am a 22 year old (female) now and this is the absolute worst I have ever felt.

Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed since I was 12 and ridden full of anxiety since before pre school. Iâ€™ve gone through some therapy but never quite found the right therapist so I would eventually quit going. I recently have became so paranoid to the point where I truly believe I am losing it. 

I have begun to hear footsteps, voices, people knocking on my door, things crawling in my hair, when none of these things are actually happening. not to mention I literally overthink every little thing. This has only been happening for about six months. 

I feel as if life is absolutely pointless and no matter what kind of good I come across, I am always left to be ultimately disappointed. Iâ€™m tired of the system, capitalism, humans, school, work, society, my family, and friends. Every little thing stresses me out and every single day itâ€™s something new. 

My wedding is this Saturday and I donâ€™t even want to go anymore. I want to go far, far away from here. I want to commit but I know both families will be left devastated and confused. I donâ€™t think I could do that to them, but I still donâ€™t want to go. 

I also donâ€™t know why I hope to gain from this, Iâ€™m kind of just venting as I feel I have no one else to talk to.. Thereâ€™s just something about typing something out and tapping â€œpost.â€ 

Whoever and wherever you are, I hope youâ€™re doing well, and I thank you for taking the time to read my stupid post.
