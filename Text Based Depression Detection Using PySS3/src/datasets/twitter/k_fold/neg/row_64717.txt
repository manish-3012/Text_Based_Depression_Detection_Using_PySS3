fighting to liveI realize that I donâ€™t truly want to die I just donâ€™t want to feel this pain. Iâ€™ve been sober and celibate for a few months now and healing from all my trauma and I just want to find joy in life. Iâ€™ve always been there for those who needed me but Iâ€™ve realized that people only text me every few months when they need something so I stopped responding to them. I try to meet all my needs on my own so I donâ€™t have to be that person that only comes around when they want something. I know how much it hurts so I donâ€™t do it to others, especially if I wouldnâ€™t text them otherwise. I want someone to love and support me unconditionally because Iâ€™ve never felt that and I want a home where I feel safe and I try to be grateful for what I have but Iâ€™m so unhappy and it makes me feel ungrateful. I feel like people would care if I died but no one talks to me and I stopped reaching out to people because I get dry responses as if Iâ€™m annoying them and thatâ€™s okay because maybe one day Iâ€™ll find someone who enjoys talking to me. I see the end goal of having a home and feeling loved but I donâ€™t know what to do in the moment. I donâ€™t want to die I just wish I could fast forward to when I stop getting overwhelming suicidal thoughts and stop feeling anhedonic. nothing I used to enjoy brings me joy anymore. Iâ€™ve been thrown around (referred) by therapists and one told me â€œsomehow youâ€™re both hopeful and hopeless at the same timeâ€. Iâ€™ve been taking different medications for almost a decade and Iâ€™m not on anything right now because the six different medications Iâ€™ve tried have done nothing but make me gain/lose weight and feel numb or worse than I did. they say keep trying with medication until you find something that works for you but I feel like this depression is environmental and I just need to regulate my emotions until I get to somewhere I can call home. medication and weed make me feel numb Iâ€™d rather feel numb right now than feel everything so hard but i know both arenâ€™t for me. Getting out of bed has been a struggle every morning and I canâ€™t see the light at the end of the tunnel. I want to live and Iâ€™m trying so hard but I just want to give up. whenever something goes wrong I think about how suicide is always an option and I donâ€™t want to think like that anymore. Iâ€™ve tried doing my hobbies, journaling, meditating, and being mindful but Iâ€™m tired of this phase of my life and I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. I cry daily and I feel the pain physically and I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
