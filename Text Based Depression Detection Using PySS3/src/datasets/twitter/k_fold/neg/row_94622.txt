A big shout out to those people trying to help others todayI know this sub is about those people who are at their lowest place, and quite rightly so, the attention should be on them and my thoughts are with them at this time of year.

However, I personally just wanted to show appreciation to all those people that are helping others on Xmas day (and other days). I find it so humbling.

Itâ€™s not easy to say the right words, or get the right vibe from someone, but these nice people are willing to give up their time in order to try and help someone in a bad place, often with no thanks or knowledge of what goes on afterwards. Also, the person helping often will have mental health problems of their own to contend with.

I know you could say, â€œwell itâ€™s just a chat, itâ€™s no bother.â€ But, these chats could put people on the right track and could mean so much.

So, good on you all and have a merry Xmas ðŸŽ„
