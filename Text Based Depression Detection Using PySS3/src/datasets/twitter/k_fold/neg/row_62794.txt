I'm tired of everythingThings are stagnating. I don't have anyone who wants me around, people just blatantly lie to me about that not being true. I'm not really needed for anything anyway, and I don't think anyone is gonna notice if I stopped this nasty living habit.

I'm tired of getting up every morning to deal with the same shit, get the same results, and keep failing at being happy. I think that today might be my last day going through the motions. 

Y'all don't need to comment and try stopping it, its not like anyone's gonna care or miss me, I just wanted to tell someone how I feel.
