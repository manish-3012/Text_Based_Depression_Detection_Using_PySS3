I want to throw upIdk what to do I feel so sick with stress
Over the summer i didnt do any of my english homework because I was too depressed to do anything. I caught up with all the other subjects I missed but i didnt with english because we had to read a book and rn im just not in my right mind. I have to correct the work tommorow. I want to tell my mum to let me stay at home tomorrow so I can catch up so I dont have to tell my teacher that I didnt finish. I only have a half day tomorrow. Idk I just to shoot myself. I feel like im going crazy. Idk but I just cant do this.
I just want everything to disappear.
