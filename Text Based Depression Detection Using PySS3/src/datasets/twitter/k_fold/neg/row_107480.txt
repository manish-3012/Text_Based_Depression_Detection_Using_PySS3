I envy people who have Clinical depression.I know that I am probably offending people with depression, but frankly, I don't care. I want depression. Or more specifically, I want to be depressed to the point where it beats my fear of dying. Wanting to kill myself but being too scared to die is too hard to live with. I just want the fear gone. 

And honestly, depression seems much better than anxiety. Being scared to die vs wanting to die? I'd take the latter every time. If I die everything will be easier.
