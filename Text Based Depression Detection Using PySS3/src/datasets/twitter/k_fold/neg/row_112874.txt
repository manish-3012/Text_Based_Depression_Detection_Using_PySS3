Soon but not todayI've made plans to leave this world because honestly I'm one of those annoying edgy people you don't want to hang out with for a long period of time but you're stuck with because of some random inconvenience. I haven't done anything productive in this world. Just annoy people and break bonds. I've been so annoying that I've been beat up, almost robbed, (3x) and humiliated more times than I could count and I honestly deserve it because of my douchebag actions.  I have a couple more people I need to fully apologize to and pay some people that I owe before I do it. But soon this world will have one less piece of shit living on it so that'll be the greatest thing I can do for the human race.  That brings me joy at least.
