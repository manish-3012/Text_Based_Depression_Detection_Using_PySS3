I keep having terrible dreamsFor some reason, I keep on having dreams where I attempt suicide. And it all feels way too real. I can feel the panic and the numbness that I felt when I attempted the two other times in real life.

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because of my PTSD or what exactly. But I know I canâ€™t sleep as well lately, besides my regular nightmares. 

And my therapist is out of town until next week, and I honestly donâ€™t know who to talk with. I normally am the happy, positive one in my friend group and I just donâ€™t want to be a Debby downer. 

I had to share this somewhere. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
