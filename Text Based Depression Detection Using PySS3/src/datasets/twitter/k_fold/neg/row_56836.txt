Can someone please help me?I saw someone post about "accountability buddies" here and it sounded like a good idea. If anyone wants to just text or snap making sure we get stuff done, I need help getting up in the morning, eating enough, going to job interviews, and finishing up some work. I'd really appreciate it since I feel like I'm in a dark place right now.
