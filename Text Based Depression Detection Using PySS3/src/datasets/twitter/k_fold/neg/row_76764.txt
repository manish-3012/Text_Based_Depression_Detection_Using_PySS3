For the first timeJust need a little rant here, and also posting on depression 

I just actually googled how many meds to take to do it. Iâ€™m feeling so hopeless, Iâ€™ve asked my SO to give me more time, that I need him, but all that happens is We end up fighting because building our house is more of a priority than me. And he is not seeing how desperately I need him. Or maybe he doesnâ€™t care? I mean I did find him on a couple adult networking sites so perhaps he has someone else lined up. That was only three months after my mom died. Which was only 6 months ago and Iâ€™m so torn up inside. 

What do you do when youâ€™re reaching out to those who â€œlove youâ€ and youâ€™re being ignored? You find yourself googling ways to kill yourself. 

Unfortunately for the world, I need to rethink my strategy because I found nothing helpful. I do have an appointment with my physician, and I am on three different anti-anxiety / depression meds so I know I got issues, but fuck. I need emotional support. Not a fucking house.
