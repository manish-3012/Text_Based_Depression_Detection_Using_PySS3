What is actually wrong with suicide?Aside from what itâ€™d do to my family, of course. People canâ€™t help but be disturbed by death and suicide and it devastated me to think of the pain it could cause others. 

But other than that, why live if I donâ€™t want to? Life is a constant struggle; itâ€™s not just difficult to be fulfilled, itâ€™s an uphill battle just to be alive on a day-to-day basis. 

I have some extreme mental illnesses. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d be diagnosed as but therapy hasnâ€™t helped so far. I carry myself relatively well so my therapist doesnâ€™t really investigate or ask the difficult questions. I donâ€™t think she thinks thereâ€™s anything wrong. 

But there is, objectively something wrong with me. Iâ€™m not a happy person, Iâ€™m in constant pain. And Iâ€™m not a pleasant person to be around. I am irritable and moody. I am often in a terrible mood. I have a resting bitch face from all hell. I can have a short fuse with people. I donâ€™t keep plans.

But I care about people. So much. I just have the hardest time showing it, I struggle to express my pain in a way that people can understand. 

And itâ€™s getting worse. And I just donâ€™t think I want to continue a life where I will never be a normal, healthy, happy person. Because I never have been.
