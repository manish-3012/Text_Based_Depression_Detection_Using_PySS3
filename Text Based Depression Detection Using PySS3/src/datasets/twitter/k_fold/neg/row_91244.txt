Never had a job, can't find one. Haven't finished a semester of school in years. I'm a loser. Should I just kill myself?I'm sitting here debating on whether or not to jump off the nearest bridge. I really think the world, and my family, would be better off without me. I cost my mother a lot of time and money. I haven't spoken to my dad in years but I doubt he cares. I'm probably the biggest disappointment in both of their lives. It's probably better if I kill myself.
