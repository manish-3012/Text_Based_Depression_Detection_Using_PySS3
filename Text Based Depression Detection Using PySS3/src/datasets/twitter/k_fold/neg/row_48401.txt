Hospitalized for suicidal thoughts..I just got out of the hospital this morning.  I discharged against medical advice because I knew I wanted to get high. I was so out of it Sunday when I was taken to the ER. I had done a crap load of drugs hoping it would do something. Had other plans, but a friend showed up.  20 hours in the ER because they couldnâ€™t medically release me. Then went to a psych unit. 

Tonight/this morning sit here pretty numb because I got high after my discharge.  Iâ€™m tired as most of what feels like an endless cycle.   

I slap on a smile and pretend all is ok.
