Well, this is it.This is my final open letter to everyone reading this. I'm currently 18, have multiple medical conditions that cannot be fixed, have ass grades, no friends, family has turned against me and my girlfriend of 3 years cheated on me last night. I've decided today is the final fix to it all. Best wishes to everyone and take care.

Kindest Regards,
Ben
