There's no solution for me26 now. Started balding at 17. Tried rogaine for a couple years, rogaine + finasteride + ketoconazole for 5 years, rogaine + dutasteride + ketoconazole for 2 years. Nothing has helped.  
Just shave it right? Wrong. I was born with craniosynostosis. I have probably the world's biggest, oblong, bumpy head. This condition is usually fixed in infancy but wasn't for me (fuck my parents). Have had 3 surgeries as an adult which have helped in a very minor way, but just left me with several scalp scars and no real improvement (once the skull is set there's no going back).  
Get a wig? Nope. Had 3 different wig people tell me my head is too bumpy and large to get any reasonable coverage with a wig, even a full wig.  
Transplant? No. Not only can I not afford it, I do n't have the hair density to cover my NW6 self.  
Wear a hat? Can't do it at work. Not only that but I have literally only ever found 1 hat that fits me. 1. Because it was custom made for me. I have tried size 8 1/4 hats at the hat store, they don't fit.  
I'm fucking sick of my family and friends making fun of me, I'm sick of the people staring at me at the grocery store, I'm sick of the social anxiety and depression. Tried meds, counseling, etc. so don't bring that up.    
So its over for me. I just want to say thanks for this community. It gave me some hope in the beginning at least.  
Bye
