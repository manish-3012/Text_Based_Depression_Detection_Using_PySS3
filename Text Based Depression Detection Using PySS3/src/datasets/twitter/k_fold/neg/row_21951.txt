I don't want to be here anymore.I feel so hopeless. I have seen 6 doctors in the past 6 months and things have only gotten worse. I've been on 2 antidepressants that did not help at all and only made my depression worse. I have been seeing a therapist at school, which hasn't been very helpful but doesn't matter since I can't see her anymore once school is finished next week anyway. 

The last doctor I saw, who I was referred to by the doctor my family doctor referred me to, and who I waited months to get an appointment with talked to me for 15 minutes. He insisted that I try another antidepressant despite my protests with how terrible the last ones made me feel. He answered the phone in the middle of asking me if I had suicidal thoughts and then forgot where he left off after hanging up. 

Every doctor keeps asking me why I am depressed and I don't know what to tell them. I am supposed to be graduating this semester but I doubt I will since I am unable to complete my work that is all due in less than one week. I feel like a complete failure, I hate who I am, and I feel like there is no hope for ever getting better. 

I have been having suicidal thoughts on and off for years but lately it's been happening several times a week. I just don't want to be here anymore. I just want to take all of the pills I have and let it be over.
