I give upI donâ€™t know whats happening but every time I get in a relationship they leave me, is it my fault is it them or is it everyone around us. I want to tell someone how much pain Iâ€™m in but I canâ€™t because Iâ€™m scared if I tell someone theyâ€™ll judge me. Itâ€™s like no one wants me around them I stay locked in my room I want to just leave but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m sorry
