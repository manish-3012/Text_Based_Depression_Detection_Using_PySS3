Meaninglessness creeping upI keep getting the "just pull through" and "keep trying" speech. I had an accounting class this quarter where attendance was graded, and she would sit there for two hours and not answer questions, just shit on my generation, and tell people who didn't understand that they're stupid. So myself and several other people tried to pull together in a study group but we can't teach ourselves this shit and have no idea what's on the test or what the format is. So I've failed that class and wasted a shit load of my money. The depression of that has caused me to pretty much skid out and fail my math class, that I was retaking this quarter because I had to drop it last one (knee surgery and appointments). 

I hate college, i hate this degree, and I just want to go to cosmetology school. But I don't want to be stuck living lower middle class for the rest of my life. I hate this. I hate all of it. I want out. I've wasted an entire year and several thousand dollars on this shit.
