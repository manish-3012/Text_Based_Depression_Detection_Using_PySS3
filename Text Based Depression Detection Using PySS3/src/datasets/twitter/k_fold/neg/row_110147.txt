My timeIm tired but Iâ€™m not , in education right now and all I hear is laughter but itâ€™s irritating , I donâ€™t know how to feel I donâ€™t know how to communicate with others â€œare u okay you seem upsetâ€ my eyes tear up as I say â€œIâ€™m okay Iâ€™m just really tiredâ€ quickly look away to avoid any sort of conversation with anyone , so they donâ€™t realise that Iâ€™m about to start crying.

I donâ€™t want to ruin anyoneâ€™s happiness, Iâ€™m tired af and I just want to be okay
