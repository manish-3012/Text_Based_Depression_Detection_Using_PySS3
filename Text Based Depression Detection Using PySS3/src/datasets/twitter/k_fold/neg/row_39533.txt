Ive been feeling suicidal.For the past 3 months, ive been treated like shit by my mother and my brothers. I've recently tried to get away from them, but mom locked the door, thinking i was going to run away from them, which was my intention. 

What happens next? I get in my room, see them laugh and call me a faggot, and proceed to go. My parents are muslim (i am not) and they keep telling me Satan has taken over you, and right now, i can hear my little brother telling me; you just made a devil, you should take him away to Somalia, which are where my parents are from.

Ive been suicidal now. Been thinking of killing myself and stop living. Why should i live, when i can kill myself and not be a nuisance? I've also been thinking of going to my aunties house and living there instead.

My dad is coming in 15 minutes, i am probably going to get yellled at and then hit me with a shoe, which hurts immensly.

Why do i live? Why am i born in a familiy which literally wants me dead? Please help me.
