I wasnâ€™t invited to a party, which all of my friends were and now Iâ€™m just fucking doneIâ€™m sorry if this comes over as cringe and sorry itâ€™s pretty long. 

Iâ€™m a 19 year old male and a girl that I was going to high school with is having a 20th birthday day party. Every single person in my friends group was invited but me, which didnâ€™t really worry me a first because of how shy I am , but with the medication and seeing professionals I was slowly coming over that. 

I have met her on a few occasions and had small conversations so itâ€™s not like she doesnâ€™t know who I am. One of my friends messages her asking if I can be invited and after taking like 3 fucking days to respond she comes back with â€œoh there is to many people alreadyâ€ which is the biggest load of bullshit I have ever heard in my fucking life. 

Like i would understand if it was a group of people but one fucking person? And to invite my entire friend group apart from me? 

I stared crying because I realised, no matter what I do I will not be accepted in this life, all of the fucking effort I put in to feel better, seeing professionals, going to the gym, eating healthy, taking my medication and I even was managing to stop cutting myself, all for fucking nothing 

My sadness turn into anger and I stared really no giving a fuck anymore, Iâ€™ve stopped taking my meds and Iâ€™ve been really fucking up thighs because why should I try to be better if it will not make any fucking difference, I will still be treated like a piece of shit.

I stared having plans on how I want to end it all. My first plan was to get a gun and go to her party and blow my head off in front of everyone, like a big fuck you to everyone but being in Australia makes getting a gun really hard. 

I mean I seriously thought I was going to have a better life, but itâ€™s like no one wants me to, and to be honest, I seriously do not give a fuck anymore.
