Tell me about it: The Suicide Catch 22Coronavirus, loss, social decay, lack of forgiveness, money, lack of community. We are experiencing a great awakening in people, realizing the true and depressing nature of the world.

I Feel that one of the biggest things holding back a lot of people from talking about it is the fact that every single time I, or a friend opens up about suicide, the immediate response is "oh dear.  here's a phone number. you better become happy or else we're going to lock you up"

Any discussion about the matter of suicide, the meaning of life, instantly becomes poisoned by an urgent rat race to dope up the person who dares to just sit back and ask a few questions.

I'm tired of it, and frankly I feel that it does more harm than good. If you really want people to "open up" and "end stigma" why are we treating suicidal people like a loaded gun every single time? without any regards to the specific nuances of their situation. That's why we have people here who post here, the same things over and over again. the same cliches 

"I wish i could give my life to someone else"

"People only care when you kill yourself"

I feel we'd have genuine discussions if we stopped acting so horrible about this. People say they want to talk about it, but they really don't. They want to throw suicidal people into a small box and say "oh deal with it". At least be honest if you want to do that. and stop bullying us into feeling happy.

I know how difficult it is: 

What do you do? Do you let everyone talk about suicide and risk some people coming to a logical conclusion that it is valid, defeating the purpose of any prevention, or do you suppress it, and no REAL conversation ever happens? I feel like I'm living in some kind of agnostic theocracy that shrieks whenever someone dares to bring up any heresys to the anti-suicde dogma
