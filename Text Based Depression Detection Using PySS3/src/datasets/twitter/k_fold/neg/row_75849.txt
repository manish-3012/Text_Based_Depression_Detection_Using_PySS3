You guys are the only people I feel a connection to anymore.Suicide has just come to dominate my life too much.  I can't even relate to normal depressed people anymore.  The only kinds of music I seem to be able to enjoy anymore are death metal and black metal.  Every once in awhile I can get into gangster rap.   But basically, anything that's not about death and suicide just doesn't work for me.
