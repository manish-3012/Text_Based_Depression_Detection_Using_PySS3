I cannot be alone tonight.I am half thinking of checking myself in.

I cannot be alone tonight.

I cannot be alone tonight.

I CANNOT BE ALONE TONIGHT. but I am.

I chased your car down the road, barefoot, I don't give a shit about glass shards, about cuts on my feet. You sped away.

He's gone and I cannot be alone tonight.

It was a mistake. I got angry, I went to grab the collar of your shirt and I guess my hand or knuckles or something grazed your face. I didn't even know, I didn't even know why you were holding your face, I didn't even know that I hit you. I didn't even know.

I hate myself. I accidentally hit the most important person in my life.

And if I hurt myself to punish myself, it will upset him more. but I want to die, I want to die. 

I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm scared I'm so so so so very scare dI'm sso scared of being alone tonight I'm so scared of being tonight at the tone pleae record I'm so scared I'm so scared.

I'm so fucking scared. you're speeding home in the rain I'm scared you're going to get hurt. I'm scared. I could never believe you that loved me or that you thought I was beautiful. It would be just my luck if I lost you. Because you transcend beyond anyone I know. I had something fragile in my hands and I threw it. And it's my fault.

And I'm scared. I'M FUCKING SCAREd. I want to hurt myself so badly, i watnt to cut deeper and more than ever I don't wknow what to do I AM SO FUCKING SCARED
