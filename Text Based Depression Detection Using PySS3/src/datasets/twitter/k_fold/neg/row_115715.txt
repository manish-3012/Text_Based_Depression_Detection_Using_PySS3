xpost r/drugs, throwaway - I tried to end my life via Valium, Codeine, Endone and bourbon 3 days ago. Today my moods and emotions are beyond erratic. Does anyone know if these swings are fallout from what I tried, or chemicals rolling through my system?I was told by a user in r/drugs to post here. I hope that's okay?

Wordy title explains most of it. By "fallout", I mean an emotional fallout. Ive read people in this situation can experience an emotional drop and Im trying to ascertain if that's what I'm feeling or if it's potentially a side effect of the substances leaving my body

Im asking so I know if I need to be further mindful of my mental state, or if I can just wait for it to roll through
