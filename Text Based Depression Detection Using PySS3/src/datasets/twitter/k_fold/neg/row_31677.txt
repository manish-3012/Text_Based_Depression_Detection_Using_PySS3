No motivation, no life23 year old male with no goals or motivation. I feel like my mind is slowly deteriorating every day from not being stimulated enough. I have no job, a degree but I haven't found a job in my field (therefore I lack experience), I have almost 0 money, no relationship, no goals. All my friends are moving on with their life to do great things while I'm just sitting on my computer wasting my life. It's really difficult to find motivation these days; especially now that my social and professional life is failing on me. I have anxiety issues but I never thought it would affect me this much.. I can't take it anymore. What's the point of living? Are the poor and depressed supposed to disappear (aka kill themselves) from society while everyone else continues on to be happy and successful? Yeah, it probably works that way in the grand scheme of things. I don't know what to do anymore. I guess I'm having trouble dealing with reality, or growing up, or perhaps I just have the worst luck in the world. I don't know what it is. Living is hard work.. I wish I could just become a ghost and observe everyone as they move on with their lives.
