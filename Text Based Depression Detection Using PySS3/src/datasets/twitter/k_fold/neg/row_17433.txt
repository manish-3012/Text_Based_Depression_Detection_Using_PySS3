Depression and my feelings.Hi, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder over a year ago, and through my psychiatrist and therapist, I still haven't gotten better. I will be changing both of them next week to see if I do better but lately I have made a very big mistake. I have been bored so much with my life and being unable to enjoy anything, that I regretfully turned to porn. Now I feel even worse because I feel even guiltier for looking at those types of things and my condition has only gotten worse. This has made it so bad that before I was having suicidal thoughts but now I feel absolutely disgusted with myself while having these thoughts which is increasing the frequency of them. Any advice on what I should now? Thanks
