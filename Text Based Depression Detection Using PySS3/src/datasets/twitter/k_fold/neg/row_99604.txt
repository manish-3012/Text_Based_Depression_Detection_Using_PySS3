Not suicidal, but am suicidal. Just need some comfort, I suppose.I've been suicidal for probably 12 or so years, on and off. I don't really know why, aside from just feeling, very alone. Alone without really any hope to be not alone in the future. And I have family. 

Briefly, I had been in relationships for almost 14 years straight. My parents I think neglected me as a child and I developed attachment disorders, seeking caregivers. Obviously a 14 year old boy can not do this. But a 12 year old girl should not be expected to know any better either. 

I was recently engaged to be married with really a wonderful person, and out of insanity, I broke the relationship (okay, it was mutual, I had already been in abusive relationships already, there were issues mostly coming from my end, but I hope not what I went through myself). 

So, I had a really good life set up, was supposed to get married, get my PhD, and just build a happy life. And it's all trashed. I have nothing left, except for the perception of failure writ across my family member's faces every time I communicate with them. 

My sister did cry, or at least tear up, when I asked her if she knew what if felt like to feel like one is obligated to live. No one has been able to empathize with me on that, ever, or at least feel sorrow for me, so I can accept it too, as I suppose the right associated feeling. 

I just keep telling myself to be stronger, tougher, feel less, do more. But in that route, I seem to be pursuing some kind of mental state of sociopathy. Whereas right now, the only people I feel like I can empathize with are those who have experienced extreme depression, loss, and pain throughout their lives. And I don't really understand how I am expected to navigate through society and just get over my self victimization mentality, internally, when it really is not understood, those feelings, by many people. If my therapists and doctors, my family, my friends, do not understand what it is like to just want every single moment of existence to be the last moment of existence so the weight of existing is finally lifted, but also clutching to life because it is all one truly has, I just, I just want to cry, all the time. 

And I just hide it, and I've only recently realized that because I hid tears and sadness so long, I have given people a completely warped perspective on who I am when no one is looking. My father came downstairs the other day, I was playing music and crying under it, if I do that often. That is the only way I cry. For the past whatever years, I cover it up with music and a pillow, and I do it almost daily. And to him, that was not normal that I did it once, in 26 years. And it just makes me realize that, no one really even has a clue. They just do not, and the more I try to ask for understanding the more abusive I feel towards them. I ask the wrong people for understanding. I make up deluded systems of belief using rationalizations such as just world theory, to suggest that one day someone will understand and I will meet that someone, or theories like every person I meet is exactly like me, I just have to talk to them more to realize I am not alone.

But it's not true, it is very rare for people to have such frequent bouts of soul crushing pain throughout most of their existence. And I am on psychiatric medication, and I have a therapist I do not see very often. It doesn't make all the memories go away. It doesn't make the clinging to the neurotic need to be accepted and loved by everyone, or specific people, go away. 

I just, I do not think really, there is anyone better I am going to find in life. I really am trying hard to define that person as myself, as the best person, instead, but I find that next to impossible to do. The only things I remember about myself are things I hate and despise, the guilt and criticism seems to wipe away all the good memories I have, and replace them with warped and twisted views on myself, that irrationally direct me down the spiral of self destruction. Even when I know I am doing better and am trying better, I still feel like I am in that spiral, I can no longer tell when I have gotten out of it, unless someone else says I have. 

This is long, rambling. It's honest. That's all really. I can't fix this. I really can't. The best thing I need is a therapist who can help me make my own life, but I could do that if I really wanted to, by searching for jobs online and applying. Right now I would rather just volunteer for charities, that seems most ideal, but then I have student loans, bills, not to mention not getting to see any kind of doctors besides psychs for the past 8 or so years, when often, I am in physical pain. 

I just do not know what to do anymore. I cycle very rapidly to these extreme lows and then I kick myself in the ass and tell myself to get over it, and just eat, and do a little more each day. But I just find it very hard to have any hope at all, at all, for my future. And I know I need some, because I know I am actually intelligent and have a lot going for me, and as usual, I am just at a low. I am just so tired at how many times I have experienced these lows, and that as the years go on, they just keep getting worse. And I have no idea why they happen, aside from clinging to people and relationships, and ideas and memories of relationships that have long since past.

I have not attempted anything this time, but my mind has gone there into methods as usual, many times. Sometimes I can't even really stop it from happening, it's like intrusive thoughts. It's hard to fight against those. Just so many years of negative thinking, abuse and clinging to abuse and self victimization and self abuse and romanticism of death and just new ways every time to describe each new emotional state. Like total numbness, I describe as in such despair the weight of it is worse than the hardest tears I have cried, which is not true. It's just numbness. It is very sad to me that I can not cry over things I feel I should be sad over, but that is also, ridiculous in thinking. Numbness should mean that I have already cried the tears I need to. I just never feel like there are enough for me to have, for a problem I do not even understand, which is mainly, why do I feel this way, all the time? Why can I not just accept what is, and move on and do well for myself? Why has most of my life been this way? I just can't stop asking those questions, and I can not convince my brain that it is likely better to not.  But then I can, temporarily. But it just comes back again. And I don't even know where those thoughts began, either. 

I don't know. Thanks for reading, if you did.
