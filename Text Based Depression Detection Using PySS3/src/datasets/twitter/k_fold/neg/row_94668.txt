i hate being subtly shamed for having to EAT like a THING that LIVEStw: binge eating disorder mention  
the overwhelming feeling of guilt and anxiety just make me want to paradoxically binge even more. yes i'm fucking ashamed of the fact i have binge problem goddamnit. i have no other way to cope with anything. every slight is so overwhelming and intense and im so fucking exhausted all the time from having to mask my reaction for the sake of other people. the only other way to cope i have is to entertain my suicidal thoughts like rolling a shiny rock i found around in my hand, then abandon it because i'm too much of a coward to kill myself. and then i do it all over again. this is my life.
