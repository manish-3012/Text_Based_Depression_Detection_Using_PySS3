Failing highschool, family is poor, mother is stressedthrowaway
Small introduction about me. I grew up pretty average, but my parents kept a lot of things hidden from me. They dumped a load of information onto me suddenly during the 7th grade and it's always been in the back of my brain bugging me. My family is poor, it hurts to watch my mom work long hours and it hurts even more to watch my dad struggle finding a job. My sister wasn't the best student and attends a community college and I know it hurts my parents that i'm doing poorly. Having a talk about my grades with my mom is horrid. She told me she hates me, she wanted to kill herself because I was making her life so hard, and she constantly asks why I can't meet her expectations. I've lost all motivation since Freshman year of HS and I think ending my life right now would be healthier for my family and for me. Sorry if this was worded awkwardly, i'm just throwing up my thoughts onto this post. You don't need to worry, i'm sure I won't be able to end my life so easily.
