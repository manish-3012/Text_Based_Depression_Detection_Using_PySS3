stuck, desperate, and hopeless.i haven't wanted to be here for a little while now.  i always used to say "i would never do it but it would just be easier."  i used to say "i couldn't do it because i would rather suffer everyday than to hurt my family like that."  my thoughts have been transforming to "my parents put me down every morning so wouldn't their day be better if that step was eliminated?"  i can't afford to move out again at the moment and i can't stay at my boyfriends house every night, so what else am i going to do?  i'm too mentally drained to work more shifts right now, which would be the only way i could afford a place sooner.  my boyfriend is just as broke as i am so moving together isn't possible too soon, and if i was to be admitted anywhere to get better financially i'd be in an even worse position than i am already.  i would rather get better, feel better, be better, but even that seems unattainable right now.  i can't remember to take my meds, i lie to the therapist about how i'm really feeling or situations that have happened because i don't want to look stupid.  i can't even confide in a therapist because i'm too scared to look "crazy".  i just don't know what to do anymore.
