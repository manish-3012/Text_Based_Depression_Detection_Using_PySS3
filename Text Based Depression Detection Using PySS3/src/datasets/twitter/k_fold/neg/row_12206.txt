I will always want to kill myself, but Iâ€™ll never do it, how can I live without continuing to be this miserable?Therapy doesnâ€™t help, it makes it worse. I feel better when Iâ€™m manic and feel worse when Iâ€™m suicidal.

Iâ€™ll feel happy soon, I just want to stay sad. Iâ€™m tired of the ups and down.
