New job. New clothes. New start. Same shit.I really am done. I am so miserable. I was so excited for a fresh start with a new great job. A job with great pay and opportunities. But for this past month Iâ€™ve been continuously shit on. 

Week 1: some creep hit on me, then made me basically come up with excuses to why I said no. 

Week 2: creep still doing creepy things.

Week 3: I finally tell my boss about the creep just to let someone know things feel weird and uncomfortable. They fire the creep because he had a history of being creepy to women. His friends hate me and the air is dense. 

Week 4 (this week) A individual came up to me and apologize that he had spread rumors about me in the office. I didnâ€™t know this had happened. But to be â€œthe bigger personâ€ I thanked him for apologizing. I thanked him... why? Iâ€™m so pissed. 

I try so hard and still this life shits on me. I donâ€™t like life. I donâ€™t want to be live. I donâ€™t want to feel happy I have no hope. Iâ€™m just trying to make everyone else happy. I just work so hard so my dad doesnâ€™t worry but I just canâ€™t anymore. 

I left work early today. My dad told me I canâ€™t do stuff like this. It canâ€™t be like my last job where
I suffered major panic attacks and deep depression. He told me I need tougher skin. 

I thought I was tough. I guess Iâ€™m not. I donâ€™t want to pretend to be anymore. 

The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll fail and need up in the hospital as just another failed example. 

Iâ€™ve been praying for God to just kill me. I really donâ€™t want this life to continue.
