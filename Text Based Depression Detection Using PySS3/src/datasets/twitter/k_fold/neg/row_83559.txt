I canâ€™t find a way out of the painIâ€™ve tried therapy/medication/self-care for years but it just wonâ€™t work. I had multiple abusive psychiatrists and I was forced to take adult doses of multiple medications for long periods of time that made me feel worse because my psychiatrist said I was lying when I insisted that it wasnâ€™t working. I always take care of myself and pursue hobbies and stuff but nothing helps. Sometimes people suggest potential treatments but theyâ€™re out of reach because Iâ€™m a minor and I donâ€™t have any supportive/safe adults in my life. Usually nobody has any advice for me. At this point suicide feels more within reach than recovery, I just want the pain to go away
