"Getting affairs in order?"I will be committing suicide on New Years Eve. 

I've made up my mind and I am dead set on moving forward. This is not negotiable. 

I need advice on how to sufficiently leave my life with no loose ends. Should I bother with my bills? Should I go out on a killing spree? Should I just get really fucked up on drugs and do things I'd never do because I'll never do them again? 


If you were planning on killing yourself, what would you do from now until December?
