I can't do this anymoreI'm 30, married, I have an overall good life, but I feel so alone right now. I keep failing at what I do, my boss hates me, I try so hard to be a good wife, friend, sibling, anything but I feel so alone. I contemplated killing myself today while everyone is out of the house. I just feel like everyone would be better off without and away from me. I recently had my birth control removed (nexplannon) and I feel like I am losing my fucking mind. I feel overwhelming sadness/despair and I just need help. I called the suicide hotline and the person acted like I was also a burden to them. I just need someone to listen. I just need help.
