Suicide PrepTried to practice cutting myself and have been hitting myself to build up the courage to stop this i don't even feel depressed and empty anymore. I'm just slowly filling myself and convincing myself and planning how and when to do this. I feel sick and this is the only way out. I'm so confused. It'd be easier to die, the only way i can open up is by sending this off into nothing that cant help me in my surroundings. One time a therapist told me when i was mourning my friends suicide "sometimes people who really want to kill themselves will." All that did was give me hope that someday i could finally do it. It sits on my mind almost every day. I don't want to feel this anymore and bring it on any one else only to hurt them.
