One mistake ruined my lifeMonday night I got caught shoplifting and the police were called. Iâ€™m only 17 years old but in North Carolina anyone over 16 gets charged as an adult. I received a ticket for a class 1 misdemeanor and my court date isnâ€™t until October 9th. This wasnâ€™t my first time stealing but this habit didnâ€™t form until 2 weeks ago and I just did it to take a risk. I told the cops everything because I was scared and didnâ€™t know that it would all be used against me. All my savings over the past two years are now gonna be used towards a lawyer and various fees. Iâ€™m a senior in high school and now itâ€™s highly likely that I wonâ€™t get into the colleges I want to and receive financial aid. If by chance this gets expunged I still wonâ€™t get to apply to these colleges by the deadline because expungements take over 6 months. Iâ€™ve done everything right my whole life, good grades, trustworthy actions, 32 on the ACT, member of multiple honor societies, etc. I know that what I did was wrong and I feel disgusting every time I think about it. I messed up my whole future - I might not be able to get a nursing license or a good job in the future with a record. Iâ€™m so scared and I canâ€™t just wait around not knowing whatâ€™s gonna happen. Iâ€™ve been depressed for years but this just put me into the darkest place Iâ€™ve ever been. At least before I had a future to look forward to. I havenâ€™t stopped crying since Monday night, my eyes have been swollen constantly I look like Iâ€™m having an allergic reaction. My home isnâ€™t a place where Iâ€™m comfortable anymore because everyone is upset and disappointed in me. I honestly donâ€™t see a way out. There really is only one way out, I just want this to stop
