I hope he gets a goood homeI want to killl myself. But Iâ€™m scared, of what? Who the fuck knows. Anything is better than this life.

Through the power of Reddit I was able to save my cat, but thatâ€™s not enough to save myself. I was selfish for thinking that it would be. Merlen is still at the vets office and  told them someone besides myself will contact them.I donâ€™t plan to be here through the night.

I have nothing. I want nothing. But nothing isnâ€™t ever enough.. 

I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever felt a waterfall of tears pouring from your face, but itâ€™s creates  a paper towel mess. I canâ€™t even save my cat, I canâ€™t save myself. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. Life shouldnâ€™t be this hard. 

But FFS it is.
