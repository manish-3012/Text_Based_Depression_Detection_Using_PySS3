Yeah, I do come here only when I feel low.Yep you well read it, I'm feeling bad âœŒðŸ»
I don't exactly know why.. I don't even know if d'oÃ¹ g what I do is Okey for this community.
I'm lost. I feel like I have no friend, no one cares about me. I'm nothing, I'm.. Empty.. Alone.. I feel like my "friends" are juste characters who stay with me at school. That's all.. And I don't like school too.

I feel bad about my body too. I'm not pretty. I'm not skinny enough, and I know the risks, I know it's bad to think like that. I know I have ed tendencies. I don't know how to get out of this. At school I often only eat one entry and a yoghourt, that's all. I do take snacks bc I'm hungry before and after. But I'm not hungry for midday. I think my" friends " would be asking questions one day. (I said I don't eat a lot, they think I eat barely nothing. That's not the reality)
I want to die often. I'm sad. I want to tell no one now. I'll bother my best friend. I think he doesn't like me anymore.. I looked at my wrists, draw a vertical line with my finger, wondering if I do that or not. I'm so lost this days.. I can spend minutes looking at nothing. Doing nothing. I want to be alone too. I'm so confused at myself. I don't want to be alone but I want to too. I hate myself. I'm ugly. Annoying. Please kill me..
