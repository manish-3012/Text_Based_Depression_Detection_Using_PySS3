I can't do this anymoreWhat's the point in living anymore, I'm hurting everyday just being alive, I've tried keeping my head up, I've said "everything's going to get better" to myself over 1000 times, I'm tired of forcing a smile on my face everyday. I want to be happy, I really do, why can't I be happy anymore!? I could have the best day of my life and all it takes is just one thought to ruin it all. Why can't I feel like I want to be alive, it fucking sucks, pardon my language, but it really does suck. I have a great family (except for my drug addict father, I haven't contacted him in 4 years). I have great friends that know what i'm going through and they've tried helping me but I don't need help, I'm already broken, nothings going to change how I'm feeling. I love them all but it's like I'm placing a burden on them and it makes me hate myself a lot more than I already do. I don't want to do this anymore, it's best that I'm not around so everyone can live without worrying about me, everything is pointless, I've had a great life... But I don't want to live another day enduring this pain. I'm sorry
