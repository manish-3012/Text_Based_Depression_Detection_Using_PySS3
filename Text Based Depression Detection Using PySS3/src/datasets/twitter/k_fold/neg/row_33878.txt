I feel like I have nothing to live for...I'm 21, almost 22, and a college student about to graduate at the end of this school-year. I have almost no one, I live 150 miles away from my family, my only support group. I had a pretty good group of friends for a few months after I transferred to this school, but they've completely abandoned me. They know how incredibly suicidal I am, but they don't care. They brush it off and give me worthless platitudes. All I want is to feel wanted by somebody, and I have no one who makes me feel wanted. I'm in a school club (actually a prominent member) and I know that if I killed myself, I'd be missed more for my duties than for my personal presence. They all seem to be close but I'm never let into the group, like it's nothing but a big party that I'm not invited to. I've gone through counseling, therapy, even anti-depressants. Nothing gets better for me no matter what I do. I let my shyness take over, I stay in and I'm miserable. I overcome my shyness and try to connect with someone, I'm eventually abandoned and I feel miserable. The sad thing is that this is probably the best I'll ever have it, in college, not too much of a monetary burden (not yet, anyway), and surrounded by people my own age. After I graduate I know it'll all go to shit (degree in European history does not equal a job). If it weren't for my family I wouldn't be struggling with this, I would have killed myself months ago. I want to be dead, and the only tie I have preventing me from taking my own life is my family. And I feel like that can't last me forever. I just want want to be content, but no matter what I do, I can't be.
