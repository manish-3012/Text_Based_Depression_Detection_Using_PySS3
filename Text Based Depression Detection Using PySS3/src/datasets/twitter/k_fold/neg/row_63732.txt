I think I might kill myself soonThe past few months have been really rough and I canâ€™t fucking stand it. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to stay alive for my girlfriend and my family.  sometimes i feel so much pain and sometimes i feel almost numb. and sometimes i feel like itâ€™ll get better, although iâ€™ve thought that less and less. This is just a stupid vent and iâ€™m really sorry to whoever read it.
