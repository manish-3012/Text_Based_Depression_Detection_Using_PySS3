I am drowningI canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m here, but here I am. Iâ€™m drowning. The person I thought would always be by my
Side has drifted away and is no longer interested. The only thing keeping me here is my boys. I love them
So much, and I canâ€™t imagine the hurt they would
Feel if I wasnâ€™t here anymore, since their mother has expressed how much she doesnâ€™t want to be a part f our lives anymore. I donâ€™t actually WANT to die, but I canâ€™t escape from
The thoughts that it would just be easier, and that I m sinking further and further from
Rational thoughts...I feel so alone and isolated, even though I still have friends who are trying
To help from afar...
