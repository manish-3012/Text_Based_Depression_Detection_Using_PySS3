There is only one question left.to die a hero, or to live long enough to see yourself become a monster?

to end it all right now, while i'm still decent.
or to live with certain reassurances, such as inescapable pain.
dread, slowly dying.

so many opportunities in life,
so many wonderous adventures beyond death.
get busy living?
or get busy drowning in your own shame?
being a coward is such a terrible thing.
