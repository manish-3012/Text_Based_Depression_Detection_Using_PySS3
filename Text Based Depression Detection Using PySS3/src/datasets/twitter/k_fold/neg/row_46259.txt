I wanna kill myself after using my ex girlfriendI told my ex I was with her because of loneliness and broke up with her due to anxiety and depression after we did it a 2nd time. Now I feel nothing but guilt and feel like suicide is the only solution, I've been checking suicide by hanging with a doorknob. I ruined my own life
