The light in my life has gone outI feel so alone. I can't tell anyone what happened. Even if they believed me they wouldn't be able to do anything about it. 

I was literally one mile away from my apartment. I was so close. They ended up driving me to a hotel almost ten miles away. I search everywhere for the video they took. All day. I search every title and website I can think of. I'm sick with terror at the thought of finding it. 

I'm so ashamed. I shouldn't have told my boyfriend. I shouldn't have burdened him with that. I have so many regrets.. I could never live with this shame. This guilt.

If only I knew how to ease this pain, because I can hardly live with it anymore.
