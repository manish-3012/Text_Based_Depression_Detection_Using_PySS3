After graduationMy only big goal in life has been to graduate from the University I'm in with a Bachelor's degree. I started in August 2018 as a returning adult student and in a couple of months it will all be over. Beyond that I really have no ambitions,.plans, or goals on top of being generally  indifferent towards life and spiteful towards myself. I've made some good friends along the way but I doubt they'd be too upset. I fear that after we graduate, we'll go our separate ways and I'll be back to where I was before. Alone. They have wonderful careers lined out and beautiful significant others but I see neither of those happening for me. I'm happy for them. They'll be successful in life and I'll soon be forgotten and no longer a burden. I just have to make it through May.
