I am an American Indian close to ending myself. Happy ThanksgivingI almost made it out. I was so close to being able to leave this terrible toxic town behind again, hopefully this time for good, to stop living with my terrible abusive mother, and to stop living in the closet (I'm a trans woman). I found a job in another town, and I was going to move there. Then my car died, stopping me from being able to move, or get to work if I made it to the town. Then at the last minute the job offer is about to be revoked anyway.

I can't stand to be here anymore. In this place. With these people. In the closet. No money. No way out.

One way out. A very final way out.
