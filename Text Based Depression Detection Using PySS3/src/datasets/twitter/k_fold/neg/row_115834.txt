I am all alone.I wake up feeling sad, go to sleep feeling sad, and then repeat. In between I try to do things. I take my medication like I should. Some days I go out and do social things, some days I go to Dr. or therapist... but my days always start and end the same way.

I have no friends. It's just me alone in my apartment. I probably ruined college. I ruined my relationships. I am just alone. I am tired of building myself up again and then having it all crash. I think this time I fell to far because I think about killing myself almost constantly.
