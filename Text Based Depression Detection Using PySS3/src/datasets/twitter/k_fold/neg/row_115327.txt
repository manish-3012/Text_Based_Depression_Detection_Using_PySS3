I don't knowI don't know if I want to die.  I can't stand living anymore, but does that mean I want to die?  I have tried to take my life, but my attempts are absolutely useless.  Is this a sign I'm not ready to go?  Every time I write my note, it seems so...anticlimactic.  This note explains everything, and it's so wimpy.  I really don't have much to live, or die for.  One time I tried bleeding myself out in the kitchen sink.  Yep.  The kitchen sink.  As soon as I got home from school, I turned the tap on, rolled up my sleeves and started.  About an hour later, with no sign of it working, I heard my dad start to open the door.  I pulled the drain plug, turned off the tap, rolled down my sleeves, and shoved the razors into my pocket.  Right as he walked up, the last bit of red disappeared.  Down the drain went all that sorrow, and no one in real life will know.  I don't know any of you, but reading these posts really bring tears to my eyes.  I wish we could all be happy.  I wish we knew how life worked.  I really do.
