Someone please calm me downLast night i was  seconds away from necking myself, the overwhelming guilt of leaving my mother, father and sisters to suffer stopped me as i was shaking uncontrollably. I walked back home and went to bed.

This morning i woke up riddled with anxiety as my parents question me about where i went last night. i began to breakdown, feeling like im at the lowest of my lows which is no strange feeling to me, i uncontrollably start shaking and go into a panic attack not knowing what to do with myself, my mum brings up that $20 has gone missing from her wallet and they both assume im going through some drug induced attack, which made me feel so much worse. After this i run to my room feeling the most helpless i have been before as i listen to my mum scream at my dad for not bringing her and my sisters home food.

After collecting myself enough my dad walks in my room, takes me to his office to talk in private and i ball my eyes out to him telling him how much i cant cope with existing anymore, He knows i have anxiety and depression but never understands what its like at all. He gets a realization that what's happening with me is serious and starts to tell me about how he could just leave my mum and sisters and be happy and rich instead of being abused(my mum has bipolar, depression, anxiety) but the reason he stays is because he loves his kids and he knows what will happen to us if he leaves. For the first time i felt comfortable opening up to him.

During this conversation he has been doing work on his laptop and as he noticed me calming down he paid more attention to his work. As i asked him do you want to know where i went last night he ignored me because he was typing an email, 20 seconds later he asked where i went and i told him. for about a minute i was opening up to my dad until i realized he had not been listening to anything i was saying. The look on his face showed me he had talked enough and just wanted to focus on his work, so i walk away.

Now im back in my room typing this. this overwhelming feeling of guilt is really getting to me i don't know what to do anymore. Theres an imaginary brick wall holding me back from the finish line and i cant seem to break it.
