No one can help me.I'm 18 y/o kissless virgin. I've been on tinder and other apps but nothings working. I can't enjoy activities on my own like music, movies, or tv. I have no friends. I've been to a therapist, on meds, and been to mental hospital twice nothing working. Don't give me that "you matter" "somebody loves you" "it'll get better" because that is bullshit. I'm going to cut tonight, watch porn, and cry myself to sleep. One day I'll get in a car crash on the inserstate going into a huge concrete pole.
