What should I expect? (female, 18)I have a doctor's appointment soon, and it's for my mental health. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for many years due to trauma and the like, but I've never really opened up or talked about with my doctor or counselors/therapists. They are aware I have depression and anxiety, just not suicidal thoughts.

I want to talk about it with my doctor, as these thoughts have gotten worse and more frequent. I've only self-harmed before but with no intent to kill myself. I don't know what to expect. Will they throw me in a hospital? I've been on antidepressants for a year, but stopped about 6 months ago.
