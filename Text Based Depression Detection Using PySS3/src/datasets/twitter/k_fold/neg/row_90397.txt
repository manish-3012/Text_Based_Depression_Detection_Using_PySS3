I used to be so attractive (not in a vein way) I was healthy. My mental illness has made me look terrible. Just talking to the internet again :(My skin is dull, I have permanent bags under my eyes. I have a fuck it eating habit and eat only when I have the munchies so I have a beer belly and a skinny body, like the kids from Africa. I lost my retainer so my teeth are spacing again and my hairline is receding. Stress and depression has destroyed me appearance wise as well.
