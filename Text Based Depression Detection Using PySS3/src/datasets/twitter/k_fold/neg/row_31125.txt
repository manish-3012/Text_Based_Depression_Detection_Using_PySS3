I kind of wish I just had a â€œgive upâ€ buttonI dunno, my lifeâ€™s fine, and itâ€™s not like I have the means to kill myself anyway, but sometimes, I just kind of give up, knowing that, eventually, nothing I do is really going to matter. The idea of death isnâ€™t really that comfortable for me. My family still cares about me, and no matter what, itâ€™s not like thereâ€™s a completely painless way to die anyway. Iâ€™m fine for now, though. I just kind of wish there was just a button I could push, and then suddenly I donâ€™t have to worry about anything anymore, and Iâ€™m just lying down, not worrying about school, my friends, depression, anything. Again, Iâ€™m not suicidal, just a guy whoâ€™s kind of given up.
