Tonight is the night, I think.I've made so many mistakes and hurt so many people. I feel useless and trapped. My family doesn't really want me, I lost all my friends out of my irrationality, I'm sick of it. I'm fucking exhausted with my mental health issues hurting those around me. 

I didn't ask to be this way. I never asked to be born. I never asked for any of this. Why was I forced into a world where my family couldn't care less about me, and didn't take me to a psychologist before it was too late? Why didn't they believe me when I told them something was wrong? Why did they let me get this bad before showing any care or support? Even now, they don't truly believe me.

My BPD has caused horrible amounts of pain. My depression, anxiety, everything. Why couldn't I have been normal? I never asked for much out of life. All I wanted was to be loved and understood. Instead, I'm alone, despised, and unwanted. I don't want this. I never wanted this. 

I'm sorry. I don't know if I should write a letter or not, because I don't know if anyone would fucking care either way. I'd be called selfish, mocked, and spat upon even after death. I think I'm gonna go quietly.

I'm sorry. If this is ever found, I'm just so sorry. I didn't mean to be such a disappointment. Since it appears that this is the only thing the script of life has left for me, I'm going to exit the stage before it gets worse.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please, don't hate me. I tried my hardest to be strong. It wasn't enough. I'm so sorry.
