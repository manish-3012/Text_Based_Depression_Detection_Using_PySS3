I just want to be with my dad :( ðŸ’”ðŸ‘¼ðŸ»I miss my dad ðŸ’”

Is it fucked up of me to say that nothing could ever make me as happy as my dad use to make me?? 

I can physically feel it. 

I know I will have my happy moments through life... 

But I also know and feel like nothing could ever top being with my dad. 

He was my best friend... 

And he killed himself... 

I still live in the house where it happened.... 

I canâ€™t move because this house was given to me when he died and I donâ€™t have the money... 

Iâ€™ve been having flashbacks of finding him after he did it.... 

I just want to be with my dad 

These 3 years have felt like 30 :( 

Should I go back to therapy? 

I donâ€™t wanna bother people with my problems or make anyone scared :(( 

But to be honest I just wanna be with my dad. 

I donâ€™t care about anything I have here. 

That makes me sound so ungrateful when Iâ€™m not. 
Iâ€™m so thankful for what I have. 

But this ache is too much ðŸ˜”
