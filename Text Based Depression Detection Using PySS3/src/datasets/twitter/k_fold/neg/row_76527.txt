I don't want to be brave.Yesterday my psychiatry professor stood on the podium and said in the most sympathetic voice "I think people struggling with mental illness are incredibly brave".

Now I know it sounds like a completely innocus statement. But I'm sick of hearing it. It's all bullshit. These people don't actually understand the experience of living through it/ with it. They feel so satisfied with themseves after saying these empty words, so smug that they understand mental illness and those living with it. Just admit it: you are too normal to understand.

There are no positives of mental illness. If I could choose being normal over "brave", I would do so in a heartbeat. Being "brave" all day exhausts me. I'm at war with my own self in my head all day. There is no glory in this battle. Don't romanticize my struggle.

You can't make a mentallly ill person feel better by telling them they are brave. I don't want to be brave, I want to leave.
