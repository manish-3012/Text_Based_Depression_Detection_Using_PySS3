An in depth look to prove that no one really cares about you, even when theyâ€™re paid to do it.The reason why I am suicidal is I want to control my death, thatâ€™s why we pick certain painless, quick , desirable methods for going about the act. Right? We want to control the outcome of our lives for a change, we canâ€™t control the happiness that we lack, yet we need. So we feel something inside us that makes us want to control how we go it. Iâ€™ll start from the beginning, I am 22 years old , since I was 17 I have had numerous mental issues, disorders if you will, stacked on top sleeping disorders that no one can seem to figure out other than â€œyour brain doesnâ€™t produce the sleep drug like normal peoples do. When I was 18 I got arrested for a DWI (driving while intoxicated for those who arenâ€™t familiar), a simple mistake made my young, dumb kids across the globe, no one was hurt and I ultimately ended up with no being able to smoke pot and having to do community service for a year, no problem right? A lesson was learned and my life was still in tact, fast forward through those 3-4 years to get up to about 6 months ago, my girlfriend had recently broken up with me, I had lost a friend through a disagreement about his handling of his so called â€œfriendsâ€. I went out with another friend to have some drinks and clear my head, started at a bar where I didnâ€™t have much to drink and we decided to go bowling (she could tell something wasnâ€™t right with me so she suggested something we could physically do to keep my mind on something other than my innate sadness). We bowled for a while and I drank, hell did I drink, I took a shot for me, a shot for my ex, and shot for shitty friendships, then multiply that by 2 and you get to where I was at along with quite a few pitchers of beer. I lost my mind, I had a mental breakdown, I went out to my car where I sat for a moment , then decided I needed to tell my mom what was going on before I truly lost it, long story short I got arrested for my second DWI. The following months I was ushered into a program for â€œalcoholicsâ€ or what they considered to be alcoholics, basically if you drank more than 5 drinks in your life youâ€™re an alcoholic to these people. They tell me this program will last 15 months and they outline the basics of the program. Sure, shit seems easy enough right? First few months fly by, no issues, nothing to write home about , everythingâ€™s normal. Just miserable from having things to do daily that are quite literally unbearable. Over the past few months however, everything has been spiraling out of control . I have lost any and all motivation to get out of bed everyday, I canâ€™t sleep, I have no appetite. So I have been violating this so called probation, not for drinking when I shouldnâ€™t be or using drugs or anything of that nature. Just little things. I tell the therapist I am court ordered to see about my loss of will to live and my feelings toward the program, I have informed my probation officer of my sleeping disorders and problems, no one cares. They keep using the term â€œprogram rulesâ€. Well do program rules list anything about what to do if a probationer is on the brink of leaving the state to take a cross country trip only to end on the other side of the country in a body bag? These people are paid to â€œrehabilitateâ€ me. Well sorry to break it to ya, but 6 therapists and countless psychiatrists and 5 page word document of prescribed pills couldnâ€™t â€œrehabilitate â€œ me. At what point does punishing someone being punished by their own livelihood and mind become redundant? Is the breaking point for them to see what this is doing to me end up in me with a shotgun in my mouth and a slug barricaded in my skull? They canâ€™t see or feel what I do, but they think they have the answers and the proper protocols in place. But little do they know Iâ€™ve wanted to end my life for years, and theyâ€™re just slowly nudging me from the bridge as I stand there. But hey, as long as justice is served right?
