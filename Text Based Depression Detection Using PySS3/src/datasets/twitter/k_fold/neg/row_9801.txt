Tired of being a failure ...24 year old college student.  Father passed away late 2009 and seriously derailed my life.  Ended up losing motivation for anything and everything.  Neck high in student loans, GPA so low it could fail a breathalyzer, no chance for grad schools, 1 year left on current degree then graduate to what?  Nothing.  Life is meaningless.

Just want to end it all, every day is a struggle and at times I just lay in bed hoping I'll starve to death.
