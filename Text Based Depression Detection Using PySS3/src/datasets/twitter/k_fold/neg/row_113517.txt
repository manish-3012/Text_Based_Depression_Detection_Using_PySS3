I'm sure this topic has been brought before does anyone ever with to have a terminal illness?There are often times when I wish I had a terminal illness so I that I can end this life I hate without leaving my family with the feeling of guilt and the horrible question of if there was anything they could have been done. I also feel tremendous guilty for those who are suffering and still have the will to live.
I just want to get that off my chest. I and wonder how many of you feel the same after learning someone full of life gets taken away from them the thing I wish I never had.
