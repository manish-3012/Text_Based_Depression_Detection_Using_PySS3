I'm signing offAbout three and a half years ago I walked out of my job. My boss shoved me to the ground when I told him I quit. I got into a fight with him and spent 14 months in jail for assault. I quit because I was sick of dealing with people. I've never liked being around people and I'm not good at verbally communicating with people. Because of that I've been unsuccessful at getting the help I need and I've been unemployed ever since. I've been staying with a friend of my uncles since I got out of jail. I had no where else to go and since my last family member died a few years ago this guy is all I have left. He's kicking me out because he started dating this new girl and she doesn't like me being around her. I would rather die than go out into the world and deal with people. Almost every time I've interacted with someone it's been negative. I get nothing pleasurable out of interacting with others. It's impossible for me to interact with people anyway now. I never had any good social skills but now that I've been isolated for as long as I have I've lost almost all of them. I don't want to be homeless or living off the land. Since I quit my job I've lost all interest in advancing my life in anyway. I don't want to be in this life anymore. I'm going to go kill myself. It's comforting to know I can die and I don't have to exist in this world anymore. I don't like interacting with people and this world is full of them. There is no where I can go and just be left alone.
