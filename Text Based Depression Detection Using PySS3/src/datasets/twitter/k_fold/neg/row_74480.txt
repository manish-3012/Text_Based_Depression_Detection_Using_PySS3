I'm not sure to understand why I'm still aliveIt's been three years since I started High-school and I just don't understand why people like their life so much.

I'm not saying that i want to kill myself or something similar but I just can't understand, every day of my life is the same and I don't have complain but sometimes when i think about it, I neither sad or happy.

And this feeling, to be neither really sad or happy, follows me every day and make me wonder why I am still alive.
