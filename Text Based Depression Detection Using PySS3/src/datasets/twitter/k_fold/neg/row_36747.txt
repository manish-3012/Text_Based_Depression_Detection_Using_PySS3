If social norms would support the fact that I'm ready to be done, it would be great.I keep fixating on the wish of euthanasia as something widely accepted and accessible.

I wouldn't traumatize anybody by them finding me, it would be guaranteed painless and effective, I could stop feeling like a net drain, people would know it was a thought out decision and not just impulsiveness, etc.

But that's not going to happen anytime soon.
