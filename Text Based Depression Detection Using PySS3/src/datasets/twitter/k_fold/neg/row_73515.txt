Whats the fucking point?Why do I keep going on when I don't want to? I hate myself. I HATE feeling this way. I am my own worst enemy. I wish I had the courage to end myself. I just want to be gone. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I can't take this anymore. I wasn't meant for this world. I am too fragile. I take everything to heart and I hate not getting the same amount of love I give out in return. I truly don't think I belong here. I don't want to be here anymore. What's even the point of going on when I know I'll always feel like this. I'll always be this person. I'll always be fucked up. I just want out.
