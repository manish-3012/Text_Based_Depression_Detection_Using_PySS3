Writing a note?Just curious to hear peoples thoughts for/against leaving a note.

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d write one. Thereâ€™s nothing I could say that would quite sum up my experience. Nor would I be able to say something that would make it easier for my family. Plus I worry people are gonna make judgements based on my note. Theyâ€™ll use whatever I say as evidence Iâ€™m weak/ungrateful/selfish. Iâ€™m not super fussed about how people perceive me after I die but I donâ€™t want people thinking I did this for anything other than myself. 

Idk thatâ€™s just my own opinion on the whole thing.
