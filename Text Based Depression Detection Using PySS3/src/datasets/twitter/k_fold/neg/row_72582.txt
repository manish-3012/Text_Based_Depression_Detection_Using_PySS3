My reasons for breakingIncapability and impatience regarding pure and long logical synthesis and understanding things in the depth I desire. Constant unproductive repetition. Brain fog, lack of understanding and lot of mental roadblocks.

Ego to not be able to handle not being exceptional and going through the pain of being the fool before the master. Serves the ego more than the process.

Highly undisciplined and sub-par work ethic and follow-up to accomplish goals. No asset to society and cannot function in it at a level higher than a cog in the system.

Relative accomplishment and drive is substantially far behind due to long stagnation and abominable work ethic.

An irrational mind and ludicrous immediate prioritisation.

Pretense of the desired self-image and incapable of defending it and no reality to support grandiose self-worth.

Inability to mingle, socialize, connect and empathize. Socially inadept and general partially unreasonable disdain for most people, biological and genetic wiring of activity and potential activity.

Severe body image issues and horrid appearance including lack of stature which require surgical measures to be able to live with myself or find a partner and not feel out of place and inability to find confidence despite.

General depression, lack of motivation/energy despite desire and incapable of achieving goals.
