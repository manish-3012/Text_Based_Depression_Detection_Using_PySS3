I wish Iâ€™d go to sleep and never wake upMy mother killed herself almost two years ago. It has destroyed me and my grief doesnâ€™t seem to get better. Iâ€™ve tried to see five or six therapists since my mother died and I canâ€™t trust any of them. I donâ€™t want to talk about things. But the things I canâ€™t talk about are eating me up inside. I just wish I would go to sleep and never wake up. 

Last year I lost my mother, my grandmother (cancer), and my dog (old age). I also got a divorce. Itâ€™s too much for one person to handle and Iâ€™m sick of dealing with it every day. I feel like nobody wants to deal with me or my grief so I try to keep it to myself. But it eats me up. My ex husband wonâ€™t talk to me anymore. I was stupid to think we would remain friends. Especially since I came out to him as a gay woman and initiated the divorce. 

I am such a stupid person and I fucking hate myself. Iâ€™ll be 40 next year. I just donâ€™t see the point in going on. Nobody would miss me. People would probably be glad I was gone. Iâ€™m alone in the world. My father is alive but useless and we are estranged. All my grandparents are gone. My mother is gone. I have nobody. Iâ€™m an only child. I wish Iâ€™d never been born. 

Fuck living.
