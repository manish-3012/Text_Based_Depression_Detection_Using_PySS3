I'd like to conduct a poll about a particular method of assisting our friends in need in this subreddit!I recently engaged in a conversation regarding a spectrum of methods we use here. [Here's our conversation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/15ziie/i_want_to_die_now/c7ra65i) I think I clarified my point in my last few posts, especially [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/15ziie/i_want_to_die_now/c8cvlbw) because my colleague stopped responding (either that, or he gave up on me! :P).

Here's a relevant thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dtyiy/to_all_the_well_intentioned_yet_ill_informed/ My opinion rests with the top comment in that thread (the poster is deleted). I think that in extreme / emergency cases (i.e. people about to kill themselves - appropriate in this subreddit), it's OK to use slightly 'stronger' methods than would be used when talking to a depressed person who is OK with life. I believe that our jobs here are to bring people away from the edge of suicide - to give them inspiration - nothing more. The rest of their lives are up to them.

So I'd like to see what you guys think. Which side do you agree with more? [I think both sides have valid points]

A majority opinion would be rather useful here, so we could establish some 'ground rules.'

I trust you guys to make the right decision. I'll try my best to follow along with the decision in the future.

All the best to all of you. Thanks for all the help you give everybody! :)
