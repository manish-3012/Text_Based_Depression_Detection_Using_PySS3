Tonight.Tonight.

Tonight, I had a few friends over. They are close country neighbors and one is a very good friend from work. They brought the food and I cooked it. We were all have a hell of a good time. Lately the past few months Iâ€™ve had breakdowns and attacks. Tonight was not a day like that. I actually had fun. I made a big fire that actually took and I didnâ€™t drink as much. Now theyâ€™ve left and my wife has went to bed. And honestly I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d do without her. Regardless Iâ€™m left alone outside finishing my fire and whiskey and finally enjoying my life. I thanked them and I thank myself for finally having a good time. Now I look up and just stare at the stars and realize why I shouldnâ€™t be sad.
