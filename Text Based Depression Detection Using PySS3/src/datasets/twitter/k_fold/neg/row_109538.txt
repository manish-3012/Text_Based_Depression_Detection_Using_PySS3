Everything wants me to quit. My whole life has been one obstacle after another. Things just rising up to ruin me. Every wall closing. I've tried making it work. I've done everything I could. I'm left with options that are not sustainable. Like I'm supposed to have a terrible, pitiful, slow, painful decline until nothingness. Why should I live through that? Why is it that when my life is crumbling, the only thing I get are words to soften the unending torture? Here's a sum. I'm 25, transgender, my family was bigoted growing up. Forced out of the house about 5 years ago. Had to drop out of college. Family declared bankruptcy, so I can't take out loans. Had to get fulltime job in order to pay rent. Nothing but high school diploma, stuck in retail. No money. Completely alone, rejected because trans. Doctor rejects me. Running out of hormones. Try calling new doctor. Needs a therapist note. Can't afford a therapist. Even if I could, I wouldn't be able to get the pills in time. Looking at self medication. Costs. Through other circumstances, costs going up 100 dollars a month. I don't have it. I can't do this anymore. I have no options. Nothing. I want it to end. I don't want to keep suffering for nothing.
