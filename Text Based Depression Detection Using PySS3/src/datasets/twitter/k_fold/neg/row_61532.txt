Cheated onSo before I go into detail about my current situation I want to talk about what it was like before, I was born beautiful as a baby and was mistaken for a girl but at the age of about 12 had to start wearing glasses because of watching tv and now I think I look ugly I used to be attractive about 2 years ago but now I think Im ugly from a distance.

I only ever dated a girl in real life once and she asked me out first thats when I was about 9 so nothing serious but 1.6 years ago in september 2014 I started dating someone I first knew as a friend from a mmorpg game I feel like such a loser to admit, I didnt take online dating seriously but grew attatched to her and now she broke up with me and I found out she was seeing another guy only about 2 weeks after she broke up, I asked what she was doing with him and she said I dont want to know I assumed they were having sex and I was devastated but she said stopped and didnt continue to have sex because she didnt know I was against it, I now keep thinking of her having sex with other guys around her and I cant do anything I have panic attacks waking up thinking about her we both never had sex before and we agreed to have sex together when we meet like it was something special and we wrote each other letters and sent gifts, Im in my 20s and shes 20.

I was so used to being with her she gave me a chance to think someone actually finds me attractive now I am stuck to being a loser because I am ugly irl and cant ask girls on a dates, I have suicidal thoughts and idk how to carry on like this idk if any girl will like me.
