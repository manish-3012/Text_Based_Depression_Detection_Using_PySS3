I'm just over it all.I finally confessed to all of those around me that I'm suicidal after so many years of having this battle with myself and the first thing I get called is a selfish attention seeking liar because if I was truly suicidal I wouldn't of opened up about it.
And I just don't know if I will be able to get help from professionals if this is all they see being suicidal as.
