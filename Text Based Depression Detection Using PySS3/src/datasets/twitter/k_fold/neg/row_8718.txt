Numbness.Iâ€™m way past the point of crying. Iâ€™ve never hurt myself, or taken drugs. But mid terms for school is coming up, and Iâ€™m failing my classes that I used to work so hard for, Iâ€™m slowly watching everything leading up to this crumble, all that hard work and effort gone. I want to die and Iâ€™ve made plans for when my report card comes back.
