I'm getting discharged on November 11 :DI'm much better now, I went to therapy and got put on medications. I don't have any more hallucinations. self-harm thoughts. suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, no more depression, I eat normally, I sleep normally, I'm happy and I'm just doing great. It's been a hard year for me, especially being so young without the services to help me cope and get better. Just know, there is hope, no matter what you're going through. I was in the darkest place and had no hope to get out and look where I am now :) Don't give up. I truly believe in you :D
