I don't think I can last much longerI've been battling depression since I was 13, and suicidal thoughts since I was 15. I have been in 2 mental hospitals. I am in therapy since I was 14.
My condition doesn't change much, and I think about death every day. It always gets harder to forget about it. There is never any solution.
I just wish I could kill myself instead of fighting, I don't want to deal with this anymore.
