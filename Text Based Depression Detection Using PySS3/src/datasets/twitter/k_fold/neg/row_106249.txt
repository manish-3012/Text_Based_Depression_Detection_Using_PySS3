EnoughPlease life just stop it already. I'm so sick of being shit on. I can't keep this up. I can't keep up anymore. It's taking everything in my power to not walk out the door and do it. I have a plan and I'm not afraid of it. So long as he doesn't have to wake up and find my body. I can't learn on him. It's not fair to him.

I can't take things at my own pace. People  just get mad when I try and say my needs. My needs aren't worth it. I'm not worth it. One last cuddle. He heads out tomorrow or during the weekend. I could do it then. I'll figure it out.

I have so much emotion. And I can't do anything about it. Trying to fix things only makes it worse. I can't keep up. One sleep...tomorrow i can get it over with.

Why am I even posting this...I don't even know. Maybe just so some record of this outburst exists. Maybe so I feel like something I say matters tonight. Something I feel matters at all.

I know it's not fair. He's still grieving. I'm such a selfish ass for this. And for that I'm sorry. I'm just too weak. I need to bed...this is too much
