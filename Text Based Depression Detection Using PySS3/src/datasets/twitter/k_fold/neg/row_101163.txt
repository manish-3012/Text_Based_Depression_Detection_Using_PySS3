My Brother commited suicide and now I think about it, tooHi, you lovely people. I'm 28 years old and have quite a history with mental health. I always thought about death and when  my first love broke up with me the horror circle started: I was thinking about ending my life a lot. I had two serious relationships after that but when that went wrong I started to think about it again (and I didn't even think about it, I also tried somehow).
I've made a lot of unhealthy decisions afterwards and there was one night when I took a lot of pills (don't name what it was) It  made me having a really bad trip instead of just sleeping. After that I thought I was healed ( somehow I had a NDE) and never thought about doing something like that again. But just 2 month later my brother commited suicide. I was ok for a long time, so I thought. But now it's almost been 2 years and I wish I would be by his side. He meant so much to me. I feel hopeless, and useless. And I don't know what to do anymore. Because I promised him I would live for us two together. But now I don't know if I can keep this promise.
