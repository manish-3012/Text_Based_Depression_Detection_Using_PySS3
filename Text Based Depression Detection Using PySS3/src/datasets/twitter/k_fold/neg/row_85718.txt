Nothing I do is ever good enoughI don't plan on harming/killing myself or anyone, in fact I don't like physical pain. If there was a way I can switch my soul with someone who died unwillingly, to let them live their life to their fullest in my body, then I'd do so in a heartbeat. But unfortunately life's not like that.

Anyways, I'm 26, Filipina, and for the most part I'm a NEET. I graduated from art college 4-5 years ago with no thorough career goals and ambitions still, although my program was aimed to work in the film, animation, and/or game industry. I was diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder as a little kid (I'm on the autism spectrum), and it wasn't until 2017 that I was assessed at a hospital for anxiety and depression. The anxiety didn't surprise me, but I didn't even know that I had depression until that year.

Sorry if this gets too long, I'll try to make it short as possible, but it feels like nothing I do is ever good enough. I do take responsibility in the fact that my eating habits, sleeping habits, lack of physical activity, overuse of computer/phone time, procrastination, PMO, bad time management, etc. has contributed a lot to my current situation. I don't blame anyone at all with why I am the way I am. I try to be optimistic and tell myself that it's realistically going to take some time after developing these bad habits for like 10+ years, but even then... it feels like nothing I do or think is good enough.

I went to CBT group therapy in 2017. I had some part time and volunteer jobs like an art instructor, retail (cashier, seasonal Christmas work), receptionist/office admin. I'm currently volunteering at my church's tech team. I'm part of a small group, go talk to and hang out with friends occassionally, and am currently seeing a counselor at my church on a weekly basis. I tried taking antidepressants (Zoloft) at the beginning of this month for 2 days, out of the guilt that I wasn't doing enough to get better (back in 2017 I rejected getting on meds), but Zoloft, even on 50mg, was personally too much for me that I had to stop on the 2nd day. Never in my life have I experienced restlessness, insomnia, loss of apetite, shaking/tremors that was starting to get difficult to control at times (as in, just lying in bed but your teeth start chattering when you relax, or your arms moving at its own will when you relax them), and cooler body temperature change (hypothermia?). It was like experiencing the physical symptoms of anxiety when I never really had that before taking the meds. Reading upon the prolonged use of Zoloft terrified me so bad that I wanted to go to the ER. And it wasn't until recently that I started to become more open about my problems to my parents and a few friends and the people in another women's small group church event that I'm part of, but even then, I feel like a burden and am wasting so much of everyone's time. I cried all day today and my parents say that I'm not a burden and prayed for me, even though I told them I hate myself and think that my existence is a waste.

I try to be positive and optimistic about my future, but I just feel like it's all a mask and I'm just trying to think of these things when really, I think I'm lying to myself. I feel like a burden when I used to work at the mall because I couldn't calculate cash fast enough in my mind and felt incapable compared to my other coworkers. I know for sure I can't have a job that's reliant on the phone 'cause I have a difficult time retaining information verbally/am forgetful and had a hard time manging multiple phone calls. I'm a bit physically slow and my motor skills aren't the greatest (I'm slower at washing the dishes, so imagine me being so slow when the sink is full at home). I even feel guilty about even claiming I have autism despite the diagnosis 'cause I don't look or act like it in real life, but then I would look dumb trying to complete the same physical task in comparison to someone not on the spectrum. I'm even so tempted to delete this entire post right now because I'm probably being dramatic, seeking attention, can't suck it up and move on.

I'm trying to figure out my career direction, but I'm so fixated on the problem no matter how much I research and try out a bunch of different things. I feel like I'm always on someone's watch and have to fill people's expectations in a certain timeframe. To live on my own by now, to drive and have my own car by now, to have a career with full benefits by now. People say that it's good to go out, but I dread having family, friends, and even my hairstylist ask the "are you working?" question. That in order to not disappoint others, I tell them I'm planning to do this or do that, when really, I'm depressed behind the scenes, knowing not everyone is going to take the mental illness answer seriously. And at this point, I don't want to take up a random job just for the sake of a job. I did that already, most of them weren't great fits for me, in fact the teaching one is why I wanted to go to anxiety therapy in the first place since I feared going back there each week and sparked my anxiety up so high. If I'm unemployed and tried taking the meds and am seeing a church counselor, I'm still not doing enough. If I'm volunteering or doing a part time/contract job, I'm still not good enough 'cause it's not a full time job. What the hell am I supposed to do?! Am I complaining too much?! Am I making too many excuses?! Am I self pitying, even though people tell you not to keep it all in?!?! I overthink so much that I seriously cannot tell anymore.

I haven't even really created art in more than a year, but even back in elementary school, I cried about how imperfect my art was. It's easier when I'm in school, but usually I don't know what it's like to simply create art without the negative thoughts. It's like it's something I can do, but am never happy with. I'm just so behind in life compared to others... I don't have much to show for in the past 4-5 years and it's humiliating and degrading. I hate being thin skinned and wish I was less affected emotionally by the people and environment around me. Most of the time, it feels like I don't live in my body. I don't usually know what it's like to live in the present 'cause I'm so stuck inside my head.

I don't want to die, but sometimes I wonder if someone like me will be able to live independently and get married and be better. I'm absolutely terrified that one of these days, it'll get so bad that even when I say I won't and don't plan to, I'll actually end up hurting myself.
