RantI'm sorry this is long but I'm just going to rant here because my friend is mad at me because I've told her about how I feel about life.

Im a sophomore and I'm kinda introverted. I have about 3 friends/acquaintances  I talk to, but I can think back to when I was little and i used to be so outgoing. I can vividly remember in kindergarten going down to the principles office on 3 separate occasions and always talking and actually having friends and going to other people's houses and having people come over to my house. I have had 1 friend over to my house in the past 4 years. And that was because I was her ride to a event later in the day. I used to be so outgoing and when I was little my parents never really told me no, and I would do what I wanted. Around the 5th grade I came to a realization that I was a fat, too tall for my age, ugly, and overall annoyance to everyone around me. And I guess sometime around there I stoped talking to people. In 7th grade I had 1 friend and it was more like an aquaintance. In 8th grade I forced myself to talk to people and I had 4 friends. I kept most of these people as acquaintances in 9th grade but I realized here that I have no one. Now I'm in the 10th grade. My "best friend" is such an amazing person but her best friend told me to stop talking to my friend because everytime I would vent to her she would cry, which my best friend never told me. I've been sent to the school councelor 3 times now because of her. Now all we do is snapchat a few times a day to keep our streak and it hurts because she will never snapchat me first. She doesn't care about me anymore I must of pushed her away because she doesn't even want to talk to me I need to stop snapchatting her. Back when I used to talk to her about things she would tell me before that i just need time to figure things out and that everything will work out and that if I killed myself my family and "friends" will be devastated. 

Well. I'm tired and I'm sad. I'm a pathetic human being. My family might be sad but honestly they should've seen it coming. My "friends", they will be fine. None of them even knew me anyways I never hung out with them. I hate my body, I wish I was short and not 6 feet tall, I wish that I wasn't a size 12 in shoes, and I wish I wouldn't have to buy everything in large because of my height. im never going to amount to anything. I'll never have real friends. 

If I kill myself (which would not be tonight) I wouldn't have to deal with anything or anyone and I could just be done. I will kill myself eventually. If it's not in high school then it will be in college. 

I miss talking to my friend. But I cant upset her anymore.
