What to do..I feel so alone. I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore, I am trying to find hobbies that I like, I like them for a while and then my depression &amp; mental illnesses ruin them for me. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I just feel like life isnâ€™t for me, like everyone I know is doing so well in life and here I am, working in an awful job which I hate every second (i never used to hate it either) I sleep in the day when I am off work to stop the horrible thoughts, I just want a way out..
