"tAlK tO a tHErApIsT!"No, I can't. Here are some reasons why:

1. I don't have the time or the energy to go to one.

2. Even if I did have time, something else would eventually show up and I would need to do that instead, otherwise I can kiss any future career goodbye.

3. I will just be given medications for it. It's not a permanent solution to anything, it's just suppressants that doesn't help with anything and I will explain it in number 4.

4. I'm currently emotionally numb so I almost don't feel anything. The only thing I feel is worthlessness and guilt. I guess this happened because I felt too much pain and sadness that my body automatically blocked out my emotions. This has happened many times before over these past 3 years. My energy (and libido) has gone down drastically, I'm constantly tired and my body is weak even though I eat a good amount of food and sleep for about 6-8 hours a day depending on how tired I am.

5. I'm paranoid that they will laugh or deny that I have problems because I don't know why I am the way that I am. Or the fact that something has been bothering me for a while which I want to discuss. I hate therapists without having any experience with them. Can't help it.

Not a day goes by where I don't think about death and suicide. My mind have had this fog for over 2 years now. More so, it's gotten so bad that I have been viewing myself as a powerless God who is trapped here for eternity. No memories. Nothing. I'm just here to witness humanity and its failures including a failure such as myself.

Where's my energy to commit suicide? Nowhere to be found, that's what. I just want to die in my sleep.
