Going to off myself after I graduateLike the title says Iâ€™m probably going to kill myself soon after I graduate. I want to feel like Iâ€™ve accomplished at least one major thing before I die, something that wasnâ€™t given to me out of pity or whatever. I guess I just want to prove that Iâ€™m not completely useless, but other than that I have no desire to live. I feel bad though bc my parents are paying my tuition (so technically Iâ€™m not even doing everything myself anyway lmao) so Iâ€™m just wasting their money at this point. Iâ€™ve been trying to get them to stop paying for all my shit so I can die knowing I donâ€™t need them. I love them a lot so I want them to stop wasting their money.
