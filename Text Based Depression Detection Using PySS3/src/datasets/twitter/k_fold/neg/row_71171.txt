What's the point?I'm sure this is a very common question here. I don't wanna kill myself, but I find my lack of answers depressing. Everyone rushes to wake up, and to go to work, or to exercise, or fill their time somehow. What's the point? Why are all these activities useful? I thought about it the last few weeks. What would I do if I won the lottery? I honestly don't know. I would buy a bunch of shit I guess and go to a bunch of places. But the actual seconds of my day would be occupied the same way many would spend a luxurious vacation. By walking around in between meals. I used to drink. That would make me happy. But it's not good for me and I get hangovers now. Sustainable happiness; how? I don't believe there is anything for me at this point. If I had the world in the palm of my hand, I would probably still just watch tv and want to eat and fuck and sleep. And that's all. So what's the point anymore. I'm 28 and I've seen as much of the world as I think I want to see, and the more I see the more I realize that I don't want to live. Or at least that I don't care about living. It's the same shit composted and recycled and it just keeps getting more and more refined. I don't wanna die but I've lost my will to live, and I'm afraid that I'm gonna get scared and do something impulsive.
