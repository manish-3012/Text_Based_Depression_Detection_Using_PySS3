7-12-19 or sooner.I don't like this. I don't want this loss and futility I feel. Every day  and then another day .. Im weak, lost 30 lbs. Barely eat. Insomnia. Raped. Bipolar. Addict-mind. Isolated. Afraid all the time. Dying. But oddly it's like I died already and I have to cut myself and hang before I can believe I was ever alive to begin with. Claustrophobia triggered by being alive. Foreign to my world and my body. My body unloved and untouched. Hands unheld. Mind and emotions throwaway. Am i real? Is this real?
