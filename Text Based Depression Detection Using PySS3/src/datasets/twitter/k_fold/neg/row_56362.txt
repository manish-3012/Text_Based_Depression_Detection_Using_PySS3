Why the fuck do I feel like this?I have a great fucking life yet I feel like shit all the time. I'm a 16 year old male now and it feels like all of the happiness has just drained out of my life. I don't enjoy anything anymore... for example I used to love video games but now I can't play one for more than 15 minutes. Hanging out with friends is a chore but so is staying at my house. My grades are in the shitter even though I was an A student last year. I don't mean to sounds like an over confident douchebag but I usually don't have problems with getting with girls... I'm pretty athletic though this year i pretty much don't care anymore. My life seems pretty okay and I don't have any problems at home(though I rarely speak with my parents). I feel like such a piece of shit for even considering suicide... but still.. I get so unhappy sometimes that I feel like puking. I don't cut myself and I never will. Also something that has been bothering me is that I don't think I can feel love. I don't love my parents or my siblings. I don't feel much of anything anymore.
Any ideas of what I could to do change things? this is a bit of a last resort :P
