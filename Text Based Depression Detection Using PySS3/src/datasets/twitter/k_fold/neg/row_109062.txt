Itâ€™s over...I canâ€™t go on anymore, I hurt my best friend and the only girl Iâ€™ve loved and she cut me off about 3 months ago, Iâ€™ve spent the 3 months apologizing and trying to talk to her, and Iâ€™ve been left on read every time. 

I just canâ€™t do it anymore, everyday I live with this on my conscience, itâ€™s like a black cloud over my head, I deserve death for how I treated her, thank you and goodbye.
