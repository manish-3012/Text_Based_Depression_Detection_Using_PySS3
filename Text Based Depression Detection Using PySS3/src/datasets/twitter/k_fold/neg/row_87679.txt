Sorry Iâ€™m drunk so This will probably be ramble. I wrote this in notes because I didnâ€™t want to burden my friend with it but it became clear that I should post it here.So I was trolling through r/suicidewatch as I do, passively taking in the pain and quietly hoping for my own death, and in the process of stalking the profiles of the people posting here I came to realize just how many of the posts here were from other trans people and it made me feel some type of way and I felt an anger and a great deep burning sadness that was unshakable and I knew then as I know now that I am here for the same reasons all of you are here. The same reason we all exist. That what we feel and experience is real. Yes even the things that donâ€™t make sense from an outside perspective. And that itâ€™s not going away.  That we exist and are valid. And that we deserve to exist. I love you.
