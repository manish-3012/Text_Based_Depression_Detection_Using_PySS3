My brother attempted suicide yesterdayHe hung himself and was pretty much dead when all the ambulances and police arrived because he was completely unconscious with no pulse, heartbeat, breathing. They took him to hospital last, they managed to bring back a weak pulse but he was breathing through a machine. He was in a really bad condition and we were pretty much ready to accept he was gone.

The hospital rang this morning to say thereâ€™s been a SLIGHT improvement. He slept well and theyâ€™re going to try and get him out of the coma. Of course Iâ€™m happy but Iâ€™m also terrified. Iâ€™m so scared that even if gets better and comes home, heâ€™ll attempt again. He left a short note and did what he did, so he obviously wanted/wants to die and Iâ€™m just so scared. Any advice or similar experiences? Thank you
