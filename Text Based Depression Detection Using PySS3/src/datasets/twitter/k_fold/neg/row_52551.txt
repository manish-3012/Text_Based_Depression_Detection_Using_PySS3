I spoke to someone on here and I think they may have killed themselves.I never got a name or any information like that. I tried my best to help and I'm so sorry if I failed you. I only got to talk for maybe 30 minutes but I know they are special and theres a place in this world for them and I would have done anything to help. I've never been in a situation like this so I have no idea what to do.
