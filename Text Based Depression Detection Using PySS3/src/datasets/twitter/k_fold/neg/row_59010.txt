I just want to die so muchI fantasize about an earthquake, or a hurricane, or anything that will let me die without it being my fault.

Anything. I'm the weakest person in the world, hateful, fearful, shameful, full of nothing but cheap lies and cheaper wit. If I could die at this instance without my brother blaming himself, I would. I hate this world, I hate myself, so much. No matter what I try to do. No mater what I try to do. I'm scum. Waste. Slag. Entropy.
