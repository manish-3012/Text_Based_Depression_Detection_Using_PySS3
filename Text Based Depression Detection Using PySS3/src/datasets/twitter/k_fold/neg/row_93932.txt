I want to talk to someoneI want to talk to someone about my plans. I am not a secretive person and itâ€™s making me anxious not being able to tell people what Iâ€™m planning and feeling. I want it to be private, not shared and I want someone to not bullshit me about it getting better.  I just need to get it out of my head and ease my anxiety of being secretive. 
Is this against rules? I donâ€™t want to give people ideas and be responsible for someone elseâ€™s death.
