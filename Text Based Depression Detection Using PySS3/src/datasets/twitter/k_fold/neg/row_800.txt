No one cares about me. I just want to stop existing.Iâ€™ve been crying in my dark room for 6 hours. I havenâ€™t eaten anything for a day. Iâ€™m not even home alone. Iâ€™ve been living with my retired parents for 3 months since Iâ€™m too depressed to go to work but they donâ€™t care. They donâ€™t even ask how I am doing or anything of sorts. We donâ€™t talk and I donâ€™t feel I can connect with them. I donâ€™t have any friends I feel I can talk to about my depression and it feels incredibly lonely. Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide each day. I know exactly how to do it pain free and I know I would succeed. I feel itâ€™s only a matter of when Iâ€™m gonna snap and finally do it.
