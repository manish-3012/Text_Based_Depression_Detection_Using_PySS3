I see no point in being alive anymoreHi, i'm Dori and i'm 18 years old. 
All my life I struggled aith anxiety and not being able to make friends. I have always been alone and it's really taking a toll on me now. I'm also studying in a university for a major I don't even care about so i'm already destined to live a miserable life. I work a dead end job at a fast food restaurant. I work with a lor of young and happy people. No one likes me there and they all make fun of me for being quiet and socially awkward. My manager yells at me because I "never smile" and customers complain about my awkward demeanor too. I can't even make eye contact with people.
I have no friends and my only family is my mother. My day consists of going to school, work, then going home to play video games and cry myself to sleep. 
I'm just some deadbeat lowlife who has no future. I see no point in being here. I want to end it all but i'm too scared. I've been crying all morning reminiscing about how much I hate myself and I'm contemplating. I probably won't do anything because i'm too much of a loser to do anything right. 
I know I sound like some whiny woman but this means a lot to me.
