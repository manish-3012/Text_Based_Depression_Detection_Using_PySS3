Things are not going well for me.18 this year. Just started college and I have to live in a dorm.I am in a completely new place with no friends. My old friends seem to be busy with their respective lives, my girlfriend doesnt seem to be there for me when I need her the most. After going home during the weekends, I go home to a family that always quarrels with each other. I am so done with life, I donâ€™t think I can take it anymore :(
