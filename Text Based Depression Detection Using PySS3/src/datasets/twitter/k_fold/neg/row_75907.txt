Want to kill myself but afraid of pain.My life is awful and I want to die to get away from it, but I'm afraid of pain. I don't have access to a gun and am barred from buying one due to state law regarding my previous suicide attempts. I have access to sharp objects and hanging but I have heard those methods are relatively unsuccessful and painful, which is why I am incredibly reluctant to use such methods against myself. I developed a phobia of blood when I turned 20 after I injured myself alot and lost some blood which caused me to develop a great fear of becoming cut thipus ending my cutting behavior because if I even see blood I will faint. I am not afraid of such things happening from hanging but I have attempted through hanging and the choking and not being able to breathe is the most painful physical thing I have felt. Please help me, I don't want to be in pain but I don't want to be alive either. I need a solution. I'm absolutely begging anyone who reads this for help. Please help me. I cannot stop crying and my soul is on fire
