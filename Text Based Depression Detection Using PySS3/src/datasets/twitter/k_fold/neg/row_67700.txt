Lowest Thing in SocietyI always figured I would die before 40 and at this point I'm 6 months from turning 30 and I doubt I'll survive these next few months.  I have accepted that I'm not desirable enough to be in a relationship. I'm looked down upon in society, because I am black, female and overweight.  How I survived up until this point is beyond me, I have no goals and nothing to live for.  I'm just going through the motions, but I'm tired and done.  So whatever happens in the next few months is unknown.
