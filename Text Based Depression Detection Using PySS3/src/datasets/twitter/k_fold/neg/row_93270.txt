Opinion: Assisted suicide should be made legal in all countries.Life isn't valuable, especially not human life. No amount of whining will change that fact. Hundreds die everyday, and it doesn't hurt *this* world in any way.




That being said, I actually expect humans to actually start behaving like humans once people have easy, cheap and reliable way to end their life. Too many people only know how to spew fake concern out of their gutter mouths to make themselves stand out as a good person, but in reality, they are far too busy hating on someone for stupid reasons.




Once all humans realize that their actions may have a harsh and cruel impact on others, they will stop being hateful. That's exactly why we need assisted suicide.
