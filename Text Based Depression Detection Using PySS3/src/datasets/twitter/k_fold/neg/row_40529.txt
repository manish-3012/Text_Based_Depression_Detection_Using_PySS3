VentAnyone want to vent their depression or problems to me? I feel alone and need some reassurance Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™ve never really talked about my problems to people but I feel I could to a stranger and I hope someone might feel the same. I have childhood abuse trauma (emotional, sexual and verbal) abandonment issues, anxiety, and just feel like a general outcast. I have played with death a few times but only attempted once, and it was the thought of my two kids that stopped me. Pm is welcome to all
