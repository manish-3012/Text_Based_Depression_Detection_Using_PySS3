The only thing that's keeping me from killing myself is my incomplete last wish.I don't even know if I want to complete it anymore. It'd be better in the grand scheme of things, but my mind cannot comprehend either of the outcomes. Only thing I know is that I'm holding back on it for now because its something that once done, will leave me completely and utterly purposeless.
