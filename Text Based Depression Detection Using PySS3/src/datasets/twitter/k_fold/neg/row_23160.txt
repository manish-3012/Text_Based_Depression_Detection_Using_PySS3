I have done this to myselfI donâ€™t deserve sympathy because Iâ€™m feeling how I am because of my self. I had an upbringing that so many people dream of and I ruined it. I had two parents who made decent money and took me on trips and love me and my siblings, they were perfect role models and Iâ€™ve failed them. Iâ€™ve done nothing but lie to them for the last couple of years. In a Fortnight I turn 18 and they will probably kick me out of the house, and I deserve that. I had one job and that was to pass school. We moved to a different fucking state because they believed in me that I would do great things and I would study hard and get a big degree, and now Iâ€™ve got us stuck in this city that they hate because I was to lazy to just go to school and get at least average. No I had to completely fucking fail because of my own stupidity and retardation. They have spent so much to help me and I completely failed them. Now they can see me for the pathetic piece of shit that I truly am and they are punishing me accordingly for al the lying I have constantly been doing. I donâ€™t have a job, friends a car, and will probably just end up on the street. I donâ€™t know why I did this. I could have told them that I wasnâ€™t cut out for academics. But no I kept lying and saying that I would get better, and that my failing grades would turn around. I donâ€™t know how I ended up like this but I feel like shit everyday. All I do is avoid my parents mindlessly scroll on my phone, eat myself into the obese piece of garbage that I am and play games. I deserve this because of what I have done to everyone.  I donâ€™t know how I ended up this way. Even now while writing this crying in my room after my parents yelled at me again I somehow and trying to convince myself that it was not my fault, when it absolutely was. I canâ€™t even think about tomorrow without bursting into tears. I cry like a baby when even slightly questioned. I canâ€™t talk to anyone about anything without crying. I donâ€™t talk to anyone at school because no one notices me and I donâ€™t know how to even hold a basic fucking conversation. How dare I end up like this after all that my parents have sacrificed for me. 18 years of love and labour and I fucking failed at everything. I donâ€™t own anything, even the clothes on my back belong to someone else because I sure as hell didnâ€™t buy it. I steal money and food to fuel my addictions like the disgusting worm I am. I feel like my mum cheated on my dad with a Neanderthal, because my brother and sister have turned out fucking perfect. One is making 6 figures a year as a tradie and the other is working on a doctorate. And here I fucking sit as the black sheep, no a god damn leech of everyone around me. I donâ€™t have enough time left to redeem myself. That train left years ago.
