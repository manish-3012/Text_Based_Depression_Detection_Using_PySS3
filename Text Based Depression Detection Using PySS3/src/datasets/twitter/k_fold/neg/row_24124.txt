"you have no future""You have no future" is what my mom just told me and that's cuz I didn't graduate high school on time. I'm 18 almost 19 and For awhile I've been having "thoughts" and that phrase brought them back. I think I've been having these thoughts for about 2 years maybe... Yeah about 2 years now cuz I'm sure they started when I realized I wasn't graduating, then it worsened when I further proved my worth when I was caught shoplifting (it didn't go on my permanent record). I'm usually good at fighting away these thoughts but for the past 2 weeks they've grown more... Louder. If you're still reading this I don't wanna try a prevention hotline. Anyways, I say they've grown louder cuz just the other day I find myself searching up how to tie a noose and after that I searched up for suicide note ideas and to top it all off I grabbed one of our small kitchen knifes and hid it in my room. TBH I'm only writing this cuz I need to get it off my chest and then I think I'll be ok... For now that is. Thank you for reading this and pls don't comment saying to call a prevention.

Edit: I forgot to Menton that when my mom told me that my only thought was "you're right that I have no future, cuz I might just kill myself to where you won't have to deal with me, your only embarrassment, anymore"
