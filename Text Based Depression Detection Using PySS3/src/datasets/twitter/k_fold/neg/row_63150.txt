For the first time in my life I though about it and it actually sounded like a relief.Iâ€™ve lost my family my wife moved out 3 weeks ago and I get to see my kids 2 days a week. I have zero friends if the court doesnâ€™t agree with me and my wife I will have to pay her 1000 a month in support Iâ€™m giving her 400 a month right now and only have 14 dollars to my name after my bills. I will lose my kids completely. My wife says she will think about calling off the divorce but wonâ€™t end it now. For the first time tonight I said to my self if she ends it I will end me my family is everything to me. I have no purpose outside of them. Iâ€™ve had thoughts of driving into the median before but didnâ€™t think anything of it just thought it was subcontous tonightâ€™s was different it felt right like a relief. I was a idiot I reached out to her tonight said things trying to ask for help without asking for help hopping she would hear the cry without saying it aloud because Iâ€™m ashamed I failed my family I hate myself. I say I am strong in God but then I think like this I hate myself I am to weak i donâ€™t deserve my family I donâ€™t deserve anything. I wish God would have ended me long ago I ruined everything i asked her if I could keep some money this week to go to the counselor I donâ€™t care anymore she can have it itâ€™s for the kids I donâ€™t need it I donâ€™t need anything I donâ€™t deserve anything I ruined my kids lives all I wanted was a happy family and I ruined it. Iâ€™m a fucking failure.
