I fucked it up again, a rant of sorts.Ive been depressed as fuck for like ages now. I had a week of normal me and then i went back to being the sad sack i usually am and it hit me like a tonne of bricks because I genuinely thought i was recovering for that week. 
Then suddenly brain was like "ha, you actually thought you were safe? You thought you could be happy? Give me a break, your life is SHIT, YOU ARE SHIT". 
Then everything collapsed. 
I lost my job, my best friend, my boyfriend and my will to live in such a short space of time. 

Anyway two nights ago I tried to kill myself but i was too much of a pussy to cut deeper so now i have a load of cuts on my arm that look and feel awful and I think my dad's getting suspicious of the long sleeves so thats gonna be a problem. 
I saw a shrink and he said i should go on anti's but my doctor wont prescribe me them because hes a prick that keeps basically passing my depression off for something else to probably save NHS money. 
I hate it so much. 
I feel so empty. Even my suicide note was shit. Now I aint as actively suicidal as I was the other night, I looked it over and its shit. So many mistakes. I writ two, one for family and one for my best friend, what a load of toss. 
I dont wanna die and I dont wanna live, my life is torture and I have no fucking way out. Its a living hell. 
Anyway I got that off my chest. 
Now I guess im gonna go to sleep for a bit.
