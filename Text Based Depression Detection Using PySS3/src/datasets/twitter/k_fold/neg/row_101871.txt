I'm so drained and tired...I don't care if nobody reads this. I have nobody who will help me, but I am responsible for so many people around me. My parents expect me to spend a lot of time with them and support them financially. My brother always look down on me and everything I say he just answers "I have it more rough".  My girlfriend is always depressed and have suicidal tendency.  My job requires physical labour and I have to morally support my client who are going through tough days (im a massage therapist).  Every fucking day I go by with fake smiles to everyone around me, and my only source of escape is through alcohol (I drink about 300ml of gin every night).  And even while im drunk, I have to somehow pretend everything is alright and i'm not going through depression and anxiety in front of my family and girlfriend.  Im going through so much pain, but I am so fucking afraid of making people around me go through what I've been going through, so I stay silent. I always tell myself others have it worse, but every night I ask myself what is the point of living anymore.  I tried to kill myself by overdosing on antidepressant, but ended up having a huge spike to my blood pressure, causing me to lose about two cups worth of blood through nosebleed (I lied to my parents I was just picking my nose and it happened).  Im so fucking tired and drained.. I wished for once there was someone who can help me the same way I am there for everyone around me...
