Feel like Iâ€™m just useless and unloved. Iâ€™m planning on ending it all for a easy fix.It just seems like Iâ€™m seriously unloved

I have no family who love me. I got no friends.

I once had a crush on this girl for around 3 years. I was in a good mood and thought Iâ€™ll explain how I feel. She was the nicest person ever to me until I told her how I felt. She shouted No, then called me ugly, a waste of space, fat, short, poor ( Iâ€™m actually not ) and Iâ€™m weird also that Iâ€™m unlovable and never will be and Iâ€™ll probably grow up to be a killer.

It really made me cry.

I get blackmailed a lot.

People look at me like Iâ€™m a pile of ðŸ’©

I have messed up my education and career.

All of this doesnâ€™t help with my anxiety. I have never actually been in a relationship, never even touched someone else.

When I message people or try to make friends I get ignored.

Iâ€™ve only ever had 2 friends and it turns out they where just with me for what I have rather than what I am.

Iâ€™m pretty ugly and people make fun of my appearance.

People make fun of my voice.

I have just been diagnosed with a uncureable disease

Lastly it just seems like Iâ€™m totally worthless at this point.
