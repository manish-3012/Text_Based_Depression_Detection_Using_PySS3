Everyone hates meMy mom laughs and says I get no sympathy from her when I donâ€™t do anything because Iâ€™m depressed and my dad yelled at me to move out since I was to depressed to talk to him. Everyone who gets close to me or who has ever loved me ends up hating me. My parents, my ex, my friends, and almost an entire Discord server hate me now because Iâ€™m the worst. I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I just hope I can end it soon before I hurt someone in my stupid downward spiral
