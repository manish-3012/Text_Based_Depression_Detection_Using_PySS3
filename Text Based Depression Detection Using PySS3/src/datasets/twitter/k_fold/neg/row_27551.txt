There's nothing left for meHi. Today I went to my first psychiatrist appointment. It went ok.
She gave me my diagnosis, depression, prescribed some meds and agreed to let me go and try to finish up my exams. Urged me to come back and get hospitalised for a few weeks after that.
I didn't tell her I'm suicidal, got scared she wouldnt let me go.

The idea of killing myself sounds like the most reasonable thing right now. I'm 24, still in uni, recently broke up with an ex and I'm not sure I can even function on my own.
I don't want to be a burden to anybody.
I don't want to be home with my family and I don't want to be alone.
I failed myself and everybody failed me, I just don't want to be here anymore.
I have no support, my ex was the only one i could trust with my feelings and he broke that trust so I'm left alone.
Tried reaching out to friends but it all seems fake.
My family is not supportive, even my dad thinks this isn't so bad.

I guess I just want someone to tell me it's going to be okay. My thoughts are scaring me, but not as much as before.
I feel like im so close to losing it.
I really do want to be happy, but I can't, I tried writing in a diary, stop myself when I'm having ugly thoughts.

Please tell me your succes stories, if you have any. Do things get better? I'm feeling so hopeless and lost.
