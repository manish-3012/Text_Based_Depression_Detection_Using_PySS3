BDD will kill me.Itâ€™s going to happen. I know it will. BDD is a vile mental illness, and itâ€™s taken away everything I had and worked hard for. I can barely handle being around my own mother anymore Iâ€™m so ashamed of my appearance. 

No, I do not look normal. I look odd. I look horrible. I cannot even look in the mirror. And when I do, I canâ€™t stop starting at my flaws. Is it vain to kill yourself because you feel too ugly to even be seen by anyone? Even your own family? Maybe. I donâ€™t really care. I just want the pain to stop. Nobody cares about you unless youâ€™re smart, beautiful, talented, or charismatic. Iâ€™m none of those things.

I donâ€™t even want to share what Iâ€™m so self conscious about because it sounds so fucking stupid whenever I actually try to explain. Which is why nobody knows. Nobody will probably ever know because no one will ever fucking understand. Every time Iâ€™m around someone all I can think about is how disgusted and ashamed they must be by me. How stupid they must think I am. How weird. How odd. How unlovable. How absolutely hideous. 

Yes, I know people arenâ€™t constantly thinking and looking at me. But when they do, thatâ€™s what crosses their mind. It may be for only a few seconds, but itâ€™s there. And it kills me. Why canâ€™t I just be normal? 

Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where I think my own mother feels this way about me. Iâ€™m 17 so I still live at home with her. She tells me she loves me no matter what. She does so much for me. But I know deep down, Iâ€™m just a burden. Iâ€™m the weird child. She wishes I was more like my older brother, who is talented, smart, good-looking, and loved by so many people. Iâ€™m just a huge disappointment. Why did I have to be so different?

People tell me they love me. That they care about me. But thereâ€™s no way I could ever believe that. No one could ever love me. Thereâ€™s nothing to love! Absolutely nothing! Theyâ€™re probably just lying. And if they arenâ€™t, they will realize Iâ€™m worthless sooner or later. 

The bottom line is I really have no reason to go on. The question is should I go on until everyone finally leaves me and stops caring about me, or should I just end it now to avoid anymore pain?
