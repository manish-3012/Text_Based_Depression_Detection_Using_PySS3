I keep trying to hold everything in and today I failed.Well I usually hold this shit in, but today I just snapped.   


I told the guy everything and he got pissed at me.   
Always happens, they tell me I'm just doing it for attention and I dismiss it as a joke.  


Posting here naturally means it isn't a joke.   


I don't like it here anymore.   
I lost everything that kept me afloat and now I'm just waiting for nothing. I'm lost.
