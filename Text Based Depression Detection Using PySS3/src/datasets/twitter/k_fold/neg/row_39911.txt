Fucked in the headI killed myself internally years ago as my coping mechanism or giving up on my life I hated and had no support group to even care or try to help. Raised to be absolute degenerates. When I realised too late I wanted to not be that I've had such irreparable damage I'm not sure I want to work so hard to get to a place I doubt I'll be content with. Everyday is a struggle in a body I despise and a living situation I resent and brings misery that I don't know how to escape or survive alone.

I just don't want to be me, I don't want to die but why even when with this internal struggle of hating myself is such an exhausting thing to fight and maintain everyday
