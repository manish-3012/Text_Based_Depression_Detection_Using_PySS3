Failed hanging a few hours ago, taking pills until i fall asleep.If that doesn't work I'll try again tomorrow.

Rope wasn't tight enough and hook was too low. It was the closest I've been to success so far. Called the hotline and had no idea what to say to them.

Not looking for positive words or reaching out. I guess I'm just posting here for the sake of my personal record of events.

Fuck this world that only values the wasted efforts of those killing themselves working 100 hour weeks moving backwards. I'd rather skip to the ending.

Peace out.

Edit: holy shit. Thank you all for the kind words. I'm still here but in a state of shock. My brother came to try wake me up and took me to the hospital. Turns out some kid jumped off his balcony in my building and the police wanted to evacuate everyone (what a fucking weird coincidence). I'm in hospital getting the help I need right now. Thank you again for all your kind words. I will post updates.
