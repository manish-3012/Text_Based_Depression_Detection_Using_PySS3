I took an overdose last Friday night.Needless to say it didn't fucking work because I'm still here. 

I don't even really know why I did it. I just felt like I was a shitty person and that I deserved it. It was so spur of the moment that I didn't even see it coming. I was sorting through some of my old medication at the time and I emptied one of the jars into my hand to see how many tablets were left. I was thinking about how I don't deserve my boyfriend and that he would be better off without me. Then I just took them all. 

The weirdest thing was I didn't feel anything. I wasn't scared or upset. I wasn't even happy. I was just empty. Even when my boyfriend saw what I had done and started shouting at me and forcing me to throw them back up. All I did was laugh. I didn't care. My boyfriend looked up the medication to see if I took enough to die. It's a very obscure medication so there was little to no information about overdosing. He came to the conclusion that I wouldn't die but that he would keep an eye on me all night. 

About two hours later I started to violently throw up. I couldn't even keep a sip of water down. I had a splitting headache and I could barely see straight. I ended up falling asleep in the floor because my bed was too warm. The next day was pretty much the same and my boyfriend took me to A&amp;E. They gave me the steroid injection I'm supposed to take when I'm sick and an injection to stop me throwing up and then sent me on my way. I was surprised they didn't want to keep me in to keep an eye on me but to be fair it was Saturday night so they were going to get busy later. 

I've been feeling like shit ever since then. I'm able to keep a little food down now but my stomach is always in agony and my head is constantly throbbing. My boyfriend made me promise not to do anything like that again.

The worst thing is that even after all the pain I've been in all weekend, I would probably do it again.
