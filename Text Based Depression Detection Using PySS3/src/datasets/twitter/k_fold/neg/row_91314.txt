Im not ready for collegeLong story short, ive been homeschooled all my life, never had to work hard for anything. Got a full ride to college. Realized all at once that i mentally and socially cant handle college.

I have stayed up late venting. Classes start tomorrow. They told me to get sleep. Here i am. I have 3 lectures tomorrow. I dont care. Ive built up horrible laziness for the past 3 years. I have the dicsipline and responsibility level of a 12 year old. I have had religious anxeity for months.  My dorm is at the top floor. I could fit through my window flap. I could get it over with in about 25 seconds.
