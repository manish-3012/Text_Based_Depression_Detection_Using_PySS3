I wish something would just kill me and end this already.Reading othersâ€™ posts in here and in r/depression about seemingly having a nice life and lots of love and support but still feeling so dead inside and broken helps me feel not alone in this darkness. 

I had an infection starting in my leg from a pretty bad burn I accidentally got and while I seemingly was concerned with others who were very concerned for my life, internally I wanted it to be bad enough to put me in shock and die. Unfortunately, itâ€™s healing and doing better now. 

I just want something to smite me and not have to do it by my own hand. Or if I could somehow just donate my life in years to others, that would be nice. I have no reasons to want to keep living. I just havenâ€™t reached my self-promised goal where I will end my own life, so I wish something along the way would just get it over with for me constantly.
