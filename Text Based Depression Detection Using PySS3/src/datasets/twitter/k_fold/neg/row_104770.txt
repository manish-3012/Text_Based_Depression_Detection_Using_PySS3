Rant: Everyday I am scared to death that I have already lived the best times of my life.And that was my senior year. I'm 23M.

Being raised and indoctrinated to be super-ultra religious, I diligently avoided being too "of this world" or "worldly", so I avoided being too close to non-religious kids my age. I have no outside-of-school memories from highschool. It'd didn't bother me in the LEAST back then.

I had always assumed that I did not need to feel validated by my peers because I had God.

Then a girl started talking to me, and it BLEW MY MIND. I has always assumed that girls would NEVER EVER wanted anything to do with me. I had resigned my life to it.

Unlike this God, she was a real person who cared about me. It was so unreal and euphoric!

Long story short, Christianity and anxiety got the better of me and I broke up with her. It was the biggest mistake of my life.

I think about her all the time. I have never felt such passion, before or since.

Longer story short, I'm an atheist now and I'm not sure what I want out of life. I think about her all the time. I think I may never have the same feeling again. And it scares me. Makes me want to not live.
