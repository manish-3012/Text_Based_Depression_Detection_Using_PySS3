Not that anyone will care...My grandma died a few days ago and Iâ€™m thinking of joining her. I just waiting for the right time to off myself. Iâ€™m thinking of ODing on my meds and just sit in a running shower while I go crazy with self harm on my arms and legs. I cant wait to finally feel free. I wrote out my suicide note and everything. Iâ€™m so excited, I finally get to be happy. No more having to please anyone by covering my arms up and acting like someone Iâ€™m not. Finally :))))
