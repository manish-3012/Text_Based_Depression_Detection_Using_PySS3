Life - not for losers like meI'm the biggest loser you can ever possibly imagine. My heart is in pain every day and I can't do anything to stop it.

My loneliness is on a whole new level, my anxiety destroyed every hope of a chance for anything with the person I love, and I can't cope with it.

Nobody even acknowledges my existence. Nobody cares. Nobody would even notice if I were to just dissapear.
