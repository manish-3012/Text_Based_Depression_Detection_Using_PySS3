Maybe suicide isn't the horrible thing it is made out to be.I've been hated all my life.  I was excluded from everything.  I never had a friend, never went to a party, never had someone be interested in me, never had a complete stranger walk up to me and say I'm handsome or cute, never had a relationship.  I've been made fun of all my life.  

I can't think of any positive aspects of me.  I can come up with a 100 negatives at the drop of a hat, but it takes me an hour of deep concentration to come up with something positive, which is usually that I don't annoy people.  That's really it.  That's all I can come up with that is positive.  

When your life is shit and you know it's not going to get better, why delay the inevitable?  Oh sure, you usually have the privileged and the happy say never do such a thing.  That's only because they never went through any shit like I have.  If they went through the same shit I have, they would have killed themselves a long time ago.  

Maybe it isn't that bad.  Maybe it is actually the answer, because at least all the pain and worthlessness goes away for good.
