This is itThis is it. I have said these words so many times I cant even count them. I am strongly keeping myself alive every day pretending nothing is wrong with me, but I feel tired of it last couple of weeks. I cant find joy in anything. Before I would at least pretend I am enjoying things. Gosh I just cant go on. What does it all matter that I am smart and my university course goes well so far. No point. Literally no point. No real life, no real interests, no one that truly loves me besides my idiotic parents. I feel like I am doing it sooner or later. Its just a matter of time. I am pathetic, even writing it down here feels pathetic right now.
