tired....Been going to college, classes are relatively easy, the social anxiety and depression are hard.

I am a bright ray of sunshine happy and jolly 75% of the time, or at least I was. Even when I was having a bad day I normally could keep the social facade of being happy up. Lately though, or more accurately the last few months have been baring down on me, ever so hard. Having dealt with depression and varying levels of anxiety throughout my life, I have gotten accustomed to dealing with the occasional suicidal thought, the occasional sink hole. Thinking of the good times, of tomorrow has always pulled me through, but alas I fear I have sunken too deep. 

I am tired of this roller coaster of highs than lows than highs than lows. 
I am tired of telling myself that things will get better.
I am tired of trying to get myself to care about something enough to simply get by.

I feel beat down, I am practically bagging myself to just kill myself. I came so close to deleting this txt just telling myself" I will push through, I will get over it." But truth be told this is the first time I am honestly not sure if I can make myself continue on, I am not entirely sure if I really want to. 
TLDR: Please someone out there just tell me that things can get better... I guess that is the reason for posting this, have things turned around for you?
