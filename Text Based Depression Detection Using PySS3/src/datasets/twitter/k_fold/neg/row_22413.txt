Why?Why did this happen? The only person I ever talked to just stopped talking to me. May not seem bad I guess but... Fuck. Why?? Was I just to much of a burden? Did she actually just not care? Agh I've been dealing with this for to long I finally opened up and now she won't talk to me... She even knows this that I have trouble talking to people.... Agh. I can't even begin to explain the immense sorrow I feel... I thought I could trust her. Now she knows everything about me... This is bad... What if she told someone about when I was molested??? That will ruin my life.. Everyone will want to know who it is but I wouldn't tell... I just couldn't she used to be my friend... AHH I'm so afraid of what will happen now... Oh did I mention I will be seeing her tomorrow?? Agh she knows EVERYTHING ABOUT ME! No one else does... Sorry for this rant... I'm just.... I dont know.. tired.. Done.
