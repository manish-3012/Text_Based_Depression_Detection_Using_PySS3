Help Me?!?!No friends, Never had a relationship, Only have my mum who is severely mentally ill.

No Skills, No Hobbies, Failed GCSEs. Can't get into a clubs or activities or education . 

I am bad and a failure at everything i do. I try to do video games, i fail. 

Recovering BDD sufferer 
Recovered from Near Suicidal Attempts (near jumping in front of train)

My life is so boring, i wake up, watch TV all day and go sleep.

I have nothing and nobody.

Tried reaching out to counsellors but just get passed around or messed about. So no use there. 

If i died today, only my mum would be there.

I am so sick and tired of life I am so bored of breathing and doing nothing. 



Male : 17
