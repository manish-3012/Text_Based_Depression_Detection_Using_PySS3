Can't find a reason to stay in this miseryWhat do you do when you have no one to talk to and even when you try to talk to god it feels like he doesn't listen.  I feel like I have been battling this depression/dysthymia for over thirty years now with no relief.  I have no real friends as when it changed from just mild dysthymia to full blown depression I can no longer help them with their problems/be the clown so they disappear.  And I don't have a close relationship with my family as my family has never been really close anyway and according to them I should just "pray and get over it".  I feel like I have tried everything: therapists, affirmations, meds, getting a pet (whom I feel doesn't like me either right now so I am trying to find a new loving home versus just dropping off at the pound). Tried watching the oprah life series thing; calling up various inpatient places just to be told that the beds are full or to get transferred continuously from one person to the other, callling the hotline to be put on hold forever just to end up speaking to the same guy who seems to be rushing me off the phone (I work in a helping field, so I realize that it can be demanding at times so I don't fault him and mental health sucks in this area, I know from trying to help others get help).  I have spent the last few days in my home or car thinking trying to find a purpose and reason for me to just stick around to feel miserable all the time.  I don't have any kids that I would be leaving behind or a significant other.  I just don't know what to do anymore
