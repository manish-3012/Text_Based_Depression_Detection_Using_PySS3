Last DayMy last day on this small speck of a planet, sounds weird after you say it out loud, hm? Anyways, this is what I have planned -

* A bottle of vodka
* Tons of junk food
* Watching my favorite show on Netflix or Hulu

I have to say, thanks for everything that everyone has done for me. The thought that people even contemplated speaking with me is a spectacle, in of itself. I must be apologetic of the wasted posts, considering I'm going through with it. I **better not fail.** However, If I do somehow, improbably fail; I will update you all. 

Goodbye everyone.
