I feel awful today,,Today i barely got any presents which i can kinda understand cause my mom lives alone with me and her and my lil bro when heâ€™s not at our stepdads. but it feels awful. My stepdad spent at least 300+ on my little brother and he only got me something when i ASKED him. and my mom only really got me a few pieces of clothing and other small stuff. It makes me feel awful cause my little brother got so much and i got very little.. especially from my stepdad. like i knew he didnâ€™t like me cause how he used to treat me but this gave me even more confirmation that he hates me.. i should be happy... itâ€™s christmas... idk i just feel so awful and feel like they both love him more than me...
