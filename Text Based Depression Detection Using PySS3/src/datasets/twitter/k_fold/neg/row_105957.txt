My boyfriend wants to kill himself and I donâ€™t know how to help him see that his life is worth living.I am in desperate need of advice or help in some way. I think my boyfriend is depressed, he hasnâ€™t been diagnosed or seen a doctor, but he has constant thoughts of killing himself. He has it planned out. He knows how he wants to do it and heâ€™s researched it and Iâ€™m just at a loss at this point. I donâ€™t know how to help him or what to do. Nothing I say or do is helping him, Iâ€™m panicking at this point. He has nightmares almost every night of himself or someone he knows dying. 
I want to tell his parents or his siblings but Iâ€™m afraid they wonâ€™t take me seriously. They arenâ€™t the supportive type. I think theyâ€™d make fun of him, or give him the tough love treatment rather than the love and support he needs and in the end, it might do more damage than help. I just donâ€™t know what else to do! He told me how he wants to do it, he said itâ€™s not my fault that heâ€™s just unhappy with the way his life is, how he is, how things are. Heâ€™s asked me which way would be easiest for me, heâ€™s told me he doesnâ€™t see his life getting any better and that heâ€™s just not going to get better. - I thought we were in a good place, things were okay with us, I donâ€™t know why he feels this way- 
I want him to see a doctor but he wonâ€™t go. He doesnâ€™t want the help, he doesnâ€™t want to live. Iâ€™m scared to lose him. I canâ€™t leave him alone. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
