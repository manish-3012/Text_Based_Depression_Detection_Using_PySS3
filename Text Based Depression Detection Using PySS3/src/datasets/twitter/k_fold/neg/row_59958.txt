If I followed through, I want you to know this.Iâ€™m so sorry to put you all through this. I never wanted to hurt anyone. The chaos inside my head has become too much to handle. Everything feels overwhelming and heavy and I have been so tired. This feels like the rest and peace I have always been searching for. This is nobodyâ€™s fault but my own. I have made too many wrong decisions that have led to my depression. Every decision I make has been wrong and I canâ€™t handle having to make anymore wrong choices. I know that is ironic but this is the only idea that doesnâ€™t give me anxiety, it gives me relief. 

I love all of you so much. I hope you find peace knowing Iâ€™m in a better place and I will always be in your hearts.
