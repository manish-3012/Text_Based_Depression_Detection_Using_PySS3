Don't Want to Reach Old AgeI don't want to live when getting around my house is a chore, when falling over can put me in the hospital for a month, when each seasonal flu warrants intensive care, when I have as much metal as bone in my body, when I can't drive, and when my cognitive ability deteriorates. 

I don't want to live to an old age. In fact, I wonder if I shouldn't just kill myself at the onset of arthritis or something.
