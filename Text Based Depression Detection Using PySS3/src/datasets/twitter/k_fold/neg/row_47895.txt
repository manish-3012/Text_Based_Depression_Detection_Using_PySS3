Dealing with a loss, not sure what I should do?Reddit, today I just found out that a girl I've had many classes with had taken her life last night. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this.
I personally, was never very close to the girl. In fact, she wasn't very nice to me in the encounters we had. But thats besides the point. Many, almost all, of my close friends were very close with her. I'm not good at dealing with these types of situations, and I'm wondering how I can help those close to me?
