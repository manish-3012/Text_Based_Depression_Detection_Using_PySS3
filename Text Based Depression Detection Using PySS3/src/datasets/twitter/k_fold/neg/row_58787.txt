BrokenI don't really know how to put this. I don't know what to say. What I do know, is that this isn't healthy. I'm broken. Something inside me has broken in the last week. I've been down before, Everyone has the slumps, I know. But this is more than that. I'm bored. I'm apathetic, I have not been able to feel anything the past week. I'd been depressed for a long time, I've been diagnosed with Avoidant personality disorder. As such, I have never had a romantic relationship get to the point of sex, because of my issues. I have no one, no friends or family that truly understands what it's like to be stuck in this body, with my life passing me by, knowing that my dreams are already out of reach because of mistakes I made in my past, and the fact that I have been called ugly/useless/all my life. As I was saying... until this past week, I felt something at least. But around Thursday of last week, something just broke, and I don't know what to say other than I felt it. And ever since... I've felt nothing really. I can look at my life, and it's not a bad life. I should be happy. I should grateful. But.. I'm just not. The only dreams I have ever had are out of reach, and I feel like that there is no point anymore.  I've tried to distract myself. I've tried to cheer myself up, to make myself sad, but all that happens, is I'm just bored, so bored, and I don't even care what comes next. I just want out. Life doesn't seem worth living. It just seems dull. I know this is probably a selfish sounding post, but I don't care. I have to find something to give me meaning again, or I'll be leaving, because I just don't want to stick around and deal with nothingness for the rest of my life.
