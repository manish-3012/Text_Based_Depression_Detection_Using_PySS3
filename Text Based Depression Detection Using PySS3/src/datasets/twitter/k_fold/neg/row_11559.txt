Itâ€™s just a passing thought.
Donâ€™t even think about it.
Itâ€™s just a passing thought.
One that just glistens with burden.
Those are the ones that are worthless.
Thereâ€™s much more important bubbles,
Those not to leave open to wonder.
The choices youâ€™ve left open to thought. 
Though youâ€™ve no reason to sought.
What is that to you? They really must be pensive too, at the same time pay no attention to.
Itâ€™s not like it was always meant to....be?
Was it?  
Wishful thinking for the the lustful and weak. 
A concept left only to think... of, but not desire. 
Is this really the result? Nothing left to gain and no hopes of anything to acquire. 
This is the conclusion, and Iâ€™ve sufficed myself of these deceptive lies.... I tell myself.
Can self corrupt really be a personality? A subconscious decision made by our own self hate and deception.
Are you something else entirely? 
Your own entity.
With your own way of being, seeing, deciding and living.
Lifeâ€™s perfect manifestation of an incarnate tragedy?
Left, abandoned, forsaken and left to decide our own reason to be.
We are not what theyâ€™ve said and spoken of so casually.
We are the ones who are meant to reach those feats. Leave behind those who weâ€™ve concluded as weak. Emotionally, charismatically and mentally.
Those who have never actually understood our dreams.
Brushed it off as something so fictionally, nothing more than a childâ€™s dream.
They will never look down from these heights weâ€™ve all reached.
