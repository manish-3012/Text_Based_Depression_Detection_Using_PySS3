I feel like Iâ€™m on the verge of attempting suicide.I canâ€™t take it anymore. I know itâ€™s me, Iâ€™m the sensitive one. Itâ€™s my fault everything hurts, that I take it all the wrong way. I hate myself, and I hate my life. I canâ€™t bring myself to trust others enough I feel this way; nobody. Not even someone I thought I could tell. There is no point. Theyâ€™d tell me to go to the hospital, or theyâ€™d call the police. Last time I told, I had the police called on me. Thatâ€™s left me in a state where I have minor panic attacks when the doorbell rings or the phone rings; it reminds me. I donâ€™t want the police or hospital involved as I do Not under any circumstances want my mother involved with my mental health again. I donâ€™t give a shit how much she â€œcaresâ€; she did Not help last time. And she will once again manipulate me into therapy, and as Iâ€™m underage still (only a few months to go though), safeguarding rules apply and either theyâ€™d tell mother anything concerning I said, or theyâ€™d force me to. Not to mention my mothers habit of asking what I did/spoke about during my session. So no. No hospitals. 

Iâ€™m trying to hang on, I really am. I keep going to cry or scream but I just canâ€™t. I cannot see a future for myself, I cannot see myself passing my mock exams. I donâ€™t find any enjoyment in anything anymore. I feel so shit all the time, and I feel like Iâ€™m just whining any time i try to open up to someone. I fucking hate the paranoia I have to live with, trying to make sure my mother doesnâ€™t find out how badly Iâ€™m struggling, while still trying to survive long enough to finally get the help I needed years ago. Iâ€™m honestly just a pathetic mess and I canâ€™t see myself getting any better. 

If itâ€™s even relevant, I have these extremely violent thoughts. I donâ€™t have control over them; and I obsess over them. All the time. It is so vivid when I have said thoughts, I can hear and feel and taste and smell and all that jazz. Shit like chewing through my own wrist, and smashing my head so hard against a wall I cave my skull in, and tearing into my own chest with my bare hands, but also dumb stupid shit like chopping my fingers off when say, chopping vegetables. I also obsess over cutting myself but considering I self harm itâ€™s no surprise I do that. But thatâ€™s how it is right now with slitting my wrists. 

I should try to sleep. Thatâ€™s what I think Iâ€™ll go and do. Iâ€™m getting sleepier typing this now. Iâ€™m hoping I can sleep the bad thoughts off, you know?
