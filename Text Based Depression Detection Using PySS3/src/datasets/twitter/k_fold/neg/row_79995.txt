Checking out soonProbably before the end of the year.

Most likely gonna' be a hanging.

Looking forward to no longer being immensely bored, one way or the other. Kinda' bummed that I never amounted to anything, but shit's gotta' land on someone I suppose. It is what it is.

To anyone in the same boat; I understand completely.

To anyone deciding to stick around just to see how the whole thing plays out; I don't really get it, but it's your choice.
