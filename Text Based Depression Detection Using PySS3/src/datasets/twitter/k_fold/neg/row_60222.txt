I want to kill myself......I just need to find a painless way to do it in a short amount of time. I looked up heavy narcotics to OD on peacefully, but they look very difficult to get a hold of.  There is a bridge called Tower Drive bridge a few minutes away and it is told if you fall from there you won't survive. I walk past it everyday and I get a stronger urge each time.

I'm a young male about 27 in age and have been married to the same woman for 6 years now. She ended up cheating on me numerous times a year into our marriage and ended up miscarrying. I feel she cares far more about herself and her friends than me. I've been depressed most of my life but recently I've been getting up after a full 8 hours of sleep completely exhausted. I can barely keep the house clean as I don't really have the energy to do anything.

Everyone in my life seems to be happier when I'm not around. Including my wife who usually stays out until 1 or 2 in the morning with her friends on a routine basis. At first I simply just cut into my arm, the endorphins seemed to calm me when I was feeling very anxious and depressed. My wife asked what was going on with my arm, I had about 6 long cuts in it and I told her my cat was being temperamental. She believed the excuse completely and now I'm up to 15 cuts but it seems they do less to ease my pain now. I think I'm just an error and wasn't meant to be.

I wrote a suicide note a couple days ago and stashed it away. There was something calming that overtook it when I wrote it. I even smiled a little. It was the first smile in awhile. My wife had left on Thursday to go hang out with her friends across state and was supposed to come back tonight. When I asked when she was going to come back she said around midnight. Drawing out the time she has to come back because she's a lot happier without me.

Never has she complimented me in recent years, looked at me as if I was attractive nor given me any time of day. I feel like she thinks I'm a worthless individual but doesn't want to divorce me because the cost of lawyers is out of our budget. I'm convinced she'd be happier if she was a widow and could find someone else to actually show love for. Thank you everyone for the posts that you have put out on this thread over the last couple months letting me know I'm not alone but I think I just don't want to be around anymore. Tomorrow, Next week, next month, i'll still feel the same way. Maybe this will serve as one of the very few records of my existence.
