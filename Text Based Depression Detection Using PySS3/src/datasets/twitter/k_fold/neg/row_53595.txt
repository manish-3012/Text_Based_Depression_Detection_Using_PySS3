My family can't afford another visit to the hospital, but if I don't go, I will lose my best friendMy best friend just gave me an ultimatum. He said that if I don't go to the hospital and get help, we can't be friends anymore. I've already been to the hospital recently, so I can't afford another visit, but I don't want to lose my best friend.
