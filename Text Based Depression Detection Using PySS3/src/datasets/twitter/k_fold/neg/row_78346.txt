I strangled myself yesterdayI strangled myself yesterday with my tights because I get my tie taken off of me. My face started going discoloured, I heard ringing noises, my eyes started going really puffy and other stuff. I searched up what strangling yourself can do and I saw that you can get brain damage or whatever. I read the symptoms that tell you you should go to the doctors and it said bruises on your neck, sore throat, struggling to swallow etc. The ones. I listed are the ones I have. Iâ€™m not too sure if itâ€™s true or not but it also said that you could die a few weeks after the strangling so I donâ€™t know if I should go to the doctors or not.
