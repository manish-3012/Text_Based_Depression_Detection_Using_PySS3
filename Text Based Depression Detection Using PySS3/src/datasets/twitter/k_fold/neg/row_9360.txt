Is this normal?I find that I'm thinking about suicide usually at least once every few days. This morning rather than getting up and getting on with my day, I spent 3-4 hours in bed fantasising about jumping off a bridge and what people passing by would react after I jumped. Is this normal or do I need to get help?
