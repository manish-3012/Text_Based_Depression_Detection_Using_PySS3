Low point - me and my familyagain, for the 3rd time in my life, I was made redundant and at 48 I do not have many options. I fear that there is little to no chance of getting another job. My life insurance, that would support my young family runs out in the next 3 months.

Maybe the best option for my family is that I take the option so they have the financial protection I can't provide? I know my young daughters will/would disagree but the alternative of losing the house and going on welfare is pretty frightening.
