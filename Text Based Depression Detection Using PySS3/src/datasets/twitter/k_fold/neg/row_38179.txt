Iâ€™m unable to get over the ideas that people are trying to covertly harm meIâ€™m always paranoid people are trying to ruin my life to advance their own agenda. 

My parents, friends, doctors, lovers, coworkers. E V E R Y O N E

Iâ€™m isolating my self to the point Iâ€™m forgetting how to behave myself. 

Even if I eventually make a lot of money  no matter how many objects I purchase, anyone at any given moment has the potential do the most venomous things to me. 

Im sensing multiple groups of people are following my every digital footprint for malicious intent.

What if I just drop my worries and enjoy what i can you might suggest? Then I put myself in positions to be harmed and I look oblivious for not being vigilant enough to see it coming in the first place.

Sure i got plans for monetary success. Whatâ€™s the point with following through with them if I know I was not raised to be the kind of person who is respected amongst a community?

I want it to STOP. As far as I can tell thereâ€™s only one solution.
