Its so exhaustingit feels like I can never get ahead in life whenever I think a good thing is gonna happen for me it always ends up bad because I  end up sabotaging myself I try to better myself and the attempts never work I'm never enough for anything I only disappoint people that are close to me and sometimes it feels like my friends only stay around because they know I'm sad and useless and don't want to hurt my feelings more It's just so exhausting to be standing in the same place all your life I'm tired of living if that's what you call this
