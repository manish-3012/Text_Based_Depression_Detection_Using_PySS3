All bad choicesI know my situation isn't as bad as other's, but I'm just fucking miserable. I told myself that when I left high school I would start uni to pursue a legal career, then I got cold feet at the last minute and did nothing. That was the worst year of my life, working 2 shifty jobs that didn't respect me, one with a manager that didn't value the work I put in and another that sexually assaulted me. I took a year to work and save but all I did was work for 3 months and left never wanting to work a job again. I spent months laying inside just rotting.

Then something happened, I got some energy back, I decided I wanted to continue the legal career idea but at a smaller level, but I just did it all over again. At the last minute I got cold feet and chose no. Then a friend suggest I swap enrollment to something else and use that explore. 

I hate it. I'm 2 weeks behind because of my cold feet, I hate every piece of work in the course, and it's too late to refund the tuition I put down. I'm stuck here being miserable and I'm back to wanting to kill myself again. Why do I always dig my own pit?
