A list of all my problems1. Growing up I was heavily sheltered
2. Fucked up teeth (really fucked up)
3. Fucked up penis (I have phimosis and it is really bent)
4. Im really depressed because of lack of relationships, never had a gf, I don't know how to talk to girls, fuck this shit it would be nice to at least have some friends
5. I don't really have any chance of getting a job (having a job would make solving my problems so much easy)
6. I hate this fucking country, I hate my home country, I basically hate all the world (probably because Im frustrated).
7. I don't feel like a man and it sucks
8. Im really sick of feeling like this

Im thinking about taking a lot of xanax, why not?
