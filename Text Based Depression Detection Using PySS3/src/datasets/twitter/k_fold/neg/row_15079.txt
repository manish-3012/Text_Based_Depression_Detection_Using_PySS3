I'm Broke and I don't know what to do.After coming out of the depression I finally gathered my courage to go find a job. I was ready to go when I had an anxiety attack. I even vomited which never happened before. All my energy seem to have left my body. I lay in bed for half an hour just to even. Now all my confidence is shattered. 

I don't know what to do. I am in debt and broke. Please help me I am lost. I just want a way out of it.
