R.I.P. Kylemy brother was in intnse care because he slit his wrist. we just got a call that he passed on.

**Kyle was adopted and when my mom and step-dad got a divorce he went back to roaming from place to place. When he was a kid he ran away from his moms house, then child services took him away becasue she beat him alot. When my mom adopted him he was doing drugs and some other stupid stuff. After the divorce the rest of the family stopped talking to him and I am the only one who kept in touch. He was in and out of jail alot again before one day he just kinda had enough I guess and broke down.
