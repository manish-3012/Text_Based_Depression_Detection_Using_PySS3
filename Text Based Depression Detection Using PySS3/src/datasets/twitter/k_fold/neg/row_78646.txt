Iâ€™m done and I know itNo matter how many times I try to make myself happy itâ€™s only temporary. Iâ€™m 30 years old and fed up with everything. Failed relationships, regret, stupid choices, thereâ€™s only so much one can take

I lost my joy over the past year and you know what, the thought of finally being dead is bringing me peace 

They say it gets better but when Iâ€™ve been hearing that since my early 20s. They say find you a girlfriend but why, if my happiness has to rest on the hands of a woman and keeping her happy, I donâ€™t want to deal with it
