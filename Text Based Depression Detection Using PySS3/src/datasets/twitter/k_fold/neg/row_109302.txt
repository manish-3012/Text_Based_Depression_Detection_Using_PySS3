Suicidal friend likes an LGBT? what now?Without revealing too much, it's come to my attention that my friend who is depressed and suicidal and lacks a lot of social skills, has actually befriended a girl who he likes. This girl though, through the grapevine, i've heard is 100 percent lesbian. How the hell do I go about this? Do I tell him? Do I let him find out on his own? This could be the final straw with him.
