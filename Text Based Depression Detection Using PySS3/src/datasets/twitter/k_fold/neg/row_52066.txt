No, it doesnt get betterIm a 16 year old male. Ever since i first went to school, i was unable to make a single friend. Still havent been able to after so many years. i've been told "hey, it gets better" but i really dont feel like thats whats gonna happen. Ive always been studying hard, reading books, being quiet, looking forward to the time i get out of school. how stupid of me that was. i dont have the money to go pursue my studies abroad as i wanted to. in all these years i have never felt like i belong anywhere. i absolutely hate what i am, but i cannot change it. its way too late for me. there's not a single day i dont think of killing myself. today is my birthday. im going to spend it alone. thats what i hate, you see. i see everyone my age having fun socialising, doing stupid stuff, drinking, smoking etc and i am so fucking jealous of them. i want to have fun too, but i cant. nothing fulfils me anymore. all happiness in my life lasts for 10 fucking seconds, and there is a great amount of sorrow waiting for me im not willing to experience. at least i am not a coward, and i know i have to end it for my own sake. so, at least tell me, is drowning a good way to go? at least i always liked the sea
