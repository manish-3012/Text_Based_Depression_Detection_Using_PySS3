People who kill themselves deserve respectIt takes so much courage to pick up a gun and shoot yourself with it, or jump off of a bridge, or take an overdose, knowing that youâ€™ll either never wake up again or wake up never being the same and living with regret.  I donâ€™t know where that strength comes from, and I wish I had it. It sounds wrong, but I sort of envy those who were able to take their own lives successfully. They had a plan, they were strong, they met their goal. 
Sometimes I feel like the only way Iâ€™ll get respect is at my funeral, and even then, who knows.
