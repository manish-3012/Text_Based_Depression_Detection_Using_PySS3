I don't want any part of lifeI don't want to be here. The only reason I'm still here is because it would hurt my family. How am I meant to keep on living when there is nothing in this world for me. I just have to keep living and suffer every second of every day because i dont want to hurt them like that. I just want release. Why is it not acceptable that I cannot and do not want to live in this world. Why can't it just be okay for me to die
