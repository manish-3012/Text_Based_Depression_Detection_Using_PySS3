Bored of life. But the end will be anything but boring.I'm going to go out in a blazing glory. I'm going to crucify myself with fire and brimstone for all to see. This will serve as a testament to the human condition and how far into the depths of darkness one can go. The eternal black is what I long for. Not to exist, as I was before, as I will be after. This is a moment. The next, another torturous one. It will get better. Then it will get worse, until every day is a lifetime of hell. Wake up, go to work, go to bed. Repeat. Eventually you will become old and it will get worse. If you unlucky, you will get dementia, a fate worse than death. If there is a God, he will let me die.
