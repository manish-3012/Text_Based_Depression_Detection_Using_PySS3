aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaFamily is the only thing stopping me. I get worse every day. Deeper into the abyss. Further detached. My funeral would be a joke. Here we gather to laugh at this useless sack of shit. Ugly. Weak. Lazy. No friends. No social skills. No ambitions. Stuff a funeral. Just chuck me off a cliff like the piece of trash I am. Make fun of me, feed me to animals, who even cares? Every day is hell. I don't want help or any of this other bullshit. Are you okay? Yeah, all good. No. It's a lie. It's all a big fucking lie. I don't look happy? Sorry for ruining your day. Allow me to put on a smile. Just to make YOU and others feel good. Wow, I've got an endless list of flaws. Cool, I know. No wonder everyone fucked off out of my life. Good on them. I don't even give a shit. I have no reason to be alive. I hate it. It has been so long since I felt genuine happiness or anything half decent. All I want is to stop existing. Soon enough that will happen. I'm sick of this dragging on forever. Like, it's not that hard. I know I want it, badly. It's stupid to fight against what I want. Fuck how other people will feel. I hate myself. But also for not doing this properly so long ago. I have to soon. No more excuses. No more anything. Blah blah blah. Fuck this shit. I hate myself so much. I hate all of this. Even this post is a joke. Nothing I say or do fucking matters. I'm so far gone it's not even funny. I don't post this shit for attention. Not for help. Not for anything like that. The last thing I want is help. Honestly. No bullshit. I owe it to myself to kill myself already. This post represents a wall. A promise to myself. No going back anymore. No doubt I'll lean against the wall for a bit. The only option in the end is clear though. It is all I want. Push away from the wall. End myself. End my hellish. Worthless. Piece of shit existence. End it all. When the light goes out. The fight will be over. A win easily forgotten.
