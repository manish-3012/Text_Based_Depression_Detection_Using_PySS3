Iâ€™m out of options.I have tried everything I can to get the kind of life that would be worth living but I am running out of options, fast. A lot of it is my fault really, wasting time and focusing on things I shouldnâ€™t have. But then, like most, Iâ€™m only one person. There are so many things I canâ€™t control and I am getting close to the point where the only thing in my control in when and how I die. It is kinda liberating. Exhilarating even. Knowing that I can always kill myself. Itâ€™s settling and it makes things simpler. Now it is only just a matter of finding what I need to get it over and done with.

Alright yâ€™all. Peace.
