I might kill myself tonight. I have the pills. I am ready to overdose, or hang myself.I have too much stress in my life. I just got done cutting both my wrist from top to bottom on both sides. I have no where else to cut on my arms, and I am moving to my legs. I have no one to talk to tonight. I am going insane. Every day of my life, I lay in bed waiting to die. I have no enjoyment. I am tired of living. Life sucks, and I can't do it anymore. I have the pills right next to me. I am ready to die. Death no longer seems scary to me. I find the thought of death relaxing. I don't feel selfish about those I hurt anymore. The only thing I can think about is the peace that I will feel when I die. I no longer belong in this universe. I never have. I am like a cancer cell of the human race. It is time I die. I can't stand living anymore.
