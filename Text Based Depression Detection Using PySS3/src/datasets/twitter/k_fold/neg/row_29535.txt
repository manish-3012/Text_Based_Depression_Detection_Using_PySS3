I can't do this anymore.My life has been riddled with tragedy after tragedy.

I got fired from my job because of gross incompetence; and you know what?  I deserve it. I shouldn't have given that piece of shit bad marks for actually studying. I shouldn't have insulted her in class because she's a bitch, I shouldn't have let my hatred get the best of me.

I don't know what to do anymore. I don't even want to look around for different school districts, because I'm fed up. I'd rather starve to death than go through this trouble agai.n and shit, I don't want to continue going through life too. I have gotten so close to leaving this mortal coil, I am convinced I might actually fucking do it this time
