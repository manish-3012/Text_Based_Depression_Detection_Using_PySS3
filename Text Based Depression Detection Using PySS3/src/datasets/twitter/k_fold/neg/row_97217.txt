Feeling conflicted, tired of livingThought this month was going to be better, but here I am on a familiar path towards dissociating and not giving a shit about anything anymore. There is a fraction of me that still cares about my life, but whatâ€™s the point when I plan on ending it? I tried to be productive this evening to distract myself but itâ€™s now three in the morning and Iâ€™ve accomplished nothing. Nothing except pace around my room fixated on the idea of killing myself. Iâ€™ve been suicidal on-and-off since I was 14 years old, but always had a few reasons not to follow through. Things change, though. I have nothing to look forward to or use as motivation. My self esteem is non existent, and my anxiety and anger issues have worsened. My parents have left me spending every day being jumpy and on edge. My graduation is on the 28th, but that just equates to a few more weeks until my friends wonâ€™t have to deal with me anymore. I feel absolutely worthless and like a complete fool for keeping myself alive just to keep falling down the same hole again and again.
