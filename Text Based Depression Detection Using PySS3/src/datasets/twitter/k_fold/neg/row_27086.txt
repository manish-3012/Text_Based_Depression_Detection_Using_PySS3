Dying just seems really good right nowI donâ€™t want to wake up. Never again do I want that. Iâ€™d rather sleep until my eyes stick to my eyelids than get up and deal with life.

I donâ€™t have any causes to fight for. Nobody to protect. And thatâ€™s how I feel whole. Girlfriend is gone. So Iâ€™m alone.

I am worthless, I obsess from one thing, to another. Itâ€™s like a switch, itâ€™s off for however long. But I get set off and I just start obsessing over things. Like one single thing I will obsess over for months. Itâ€™s not healthy heh, but then again, if I want to sleep forever then who am I to talk about healthy?

Every time I leave the house Iâ€™m secretly wishing that a car swerves and runs me over. Sometimes my thoughts tell me to walk in front of a busy lane. Most times Iâ€™m tempted.

You wanna know whatâ€™s fucking weird? Iâ€™m the happiest Iâ€™ve been in my life. But I still want to hang myself with barbed wire. 

I started cutting myself even though I havenâ€™t for 2 years. Itâ€™s just, I needed to feel it again.

I canâ€™t talk to anybody

I am alone

Iâ€™ll always be alone

Love hurts me because my obsessive personality fucks my relationships

I donâ€™t want to love again, even though itâ€™s like a high

I canâ€™t take it, I canâ€™t take anymore heartbreak

I wish someone would squeeze my heart until it burst in their hand.. then at least someone would hold me...

Iâ€™m done
