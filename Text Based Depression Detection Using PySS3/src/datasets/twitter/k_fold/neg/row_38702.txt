Why shouldn't I?I don't want this to seem like one of those posts made after a shit day, I want someone to explain to me why killing myself isn't the most logical option I have.

It's not just that my current situation is bad, I feel broken, like everyone else has this innate ability to connect to one another that I lack. The only people who care about me only care because thousands of years of evolution forces them to, and even then it seems like they can't stand me.

Also, I wish I had a more eloquent way to phrase this, I'm just stupid and lazy. Not just uneducated or naive, but sincerely unintelligent. I just failed university, because I am stupid and lazy.

It just seems to me that if I continue, i am going to spend the rest of my life on my own, never achieving anything or doing anything meaningful or worthwhile.

Thanks for reading and sorry about the long post.
