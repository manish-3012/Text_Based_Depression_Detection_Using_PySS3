I am reaching a breaking point. It's too much and I only have myself, thinking of dying, help.I cry on the inside because the shit is nbreable and too hard to express. My parents don't take me or my feelings seriously, I am done with their selfishness, being in the closet, doing work on summer, social anxiety and awful insecurity.

I tell how I truly feel and they either punish me or worse. I want to kill myself, bullshit is too much for a teenage boy.
