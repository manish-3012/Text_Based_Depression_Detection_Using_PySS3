Would I be able to hang myself with this?  So well....I found this tv cable in my patio.  Idk exactly how long but about 2-3 meters.  Its kinda rigid but I managed to make a small (simple) knot.  Do you think it would hold well during my final moments or would it snap?  Also, I'm not of legal age, so idk if I can opt out of funeral if anyone discovers my body.  I kinda just wanna decompose in the woods without a trace left.  Fortunately, now I live near a forest (a bunch of branches) so I might succeed, maybe in the middle of the night so I don't wake up my family.
