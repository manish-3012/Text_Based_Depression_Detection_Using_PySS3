Iâ€™m placing my whole life on one decision and I donâ€™t know how to not.âš ï¸TRIGGER WARNINGâš ï¸ stop reading of talk of suicidal ideation and stuff triggers you. Sorry




-

Iâ€™ve been in an abusive household my whole life. Iâ€™ve tried to OD three times but I only count the one time that I took 38 pills. Iâ€™m with social care and on Monday they are going to decide whether or not Iâ€™ll get placed into care or get taken back home. Iâ€™m staying with my aunt currently but I cannot live with her full time. No one in my family can have me full time. Iâ€™m 16 and itâ€™s the biggest decision that will affect my life. 

On Monday the Panel will decide whether or not Iâ€™m going to be in care. Iâ€™m scared and anxious about the results. 

I know that if I get rejected from care, I WILL end up attempting again. Iâ€™m so scared because I canâ€™t live with my father anymore. He hits me, screams at me. Last week on Monday (I was still at home) he shoved me over my beside table- causing loads of bruises- and then hit me with a piece of wood. He tells me to kill myself constantly and Iâ€™m scared. 

Honestly, I would rather be dead, in hospital, or in prison than going back. School is the only thing I have in my life but itâ€™s half term at the moment. 

I donâ€™t know how to stop thinking like this. I donâ€™t want to die. I just do want to go home and if I get rejected then suicide seems like the only option. 

Please help.
