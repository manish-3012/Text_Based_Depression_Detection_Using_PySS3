I think Iâ€™m going to finally do it soon.Iâ€™m not really looking for anything in response to this, I just want to get it out of my head for a moment. 

Iâ€™ve had a long battle with depression, one that seemed to clear up a bit last year, and Iâ€™ve had many lows with it, ones that I wish to never returned to. I finally just moved out of a town that I spent most of my life in, which was also a place where most of these issues grew in the first place. Iâ€™m in a city, where I always wanted to be, and I thought that maybe things would change and I could start to heal for once.

I either feel like that is wrong or maybe my mental state is what really causes most of the issues. Iâ€™ve returned to feeling very low, Iâ€™ve contemplated suicide while I was restless for the past two nights. I feel like my life is just moment after moment of getting caught up in other peopleâ€™s lives and business too much. I feel have no control over it, I donâ€™t know what I can even do anymore. 

The thing is that I know Iâ€™m worth keeping around, even if I donâ€™t feel it. I just donâ€™t think I could honestly cope with life going forward. Sometimes I think maybe I just came down here so I could finally be separated from most of the things that were stopping me from doing this for the longest time so I could let it happen for once and be no more. I know my loved ones donâ€™t deserve this. Iâ€™m not angry about this like I used to be. I just donâ€™t have a superego thatâ€™s particularly kind to me and it makes moments like this hard to endure. 

Iâ€™m just tired. I canâ€™t deal with this level of shit anymore. I donâ€™t want to tell anyone about this.
