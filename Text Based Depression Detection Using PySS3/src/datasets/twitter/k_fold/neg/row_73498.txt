Hi; I really need helpI was in a seven and a half year relationship. Admitted by my S/O things were not my fault (to a point, of course all relationship ends have mutual problems). I am 26 years old and a military veteran and I don't know what to do. I am pretty drunk at the moment so I can elaborate more tomorrow morning because I have school stuff to take care of. I am ruining my college GPA because of what's happening. I don't know what to do. I have no future and the one person I need to be with me is gone. Please help. I've never felt this way before. I also found out 2 days ago my mom has a form of breast cancer. It's apparently non-invasive but she might have to lose her breast due to prior problems.  I'm so tired of being alone, I go to a private college away from everyone I know because it has a good reputation. I'm older than everyone so it's hard to meet people. I have friends in the veterans group but i have no time to go anymore because all of my time is spent in school, doing school work or in work. I don't know what to do anymore. I;ve never felt the urge to not be here anymore until now. I don't know what to do. All I want is my ex back and she doesn't want the same. I just want everything to be the way that it was. I have never thought about doing anything harmful to myself until now. Please help.
