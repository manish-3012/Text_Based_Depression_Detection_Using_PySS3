I honestly don't know how to make it till old age so I die of natural causesI dont want to die. But I have so many issues regarding mental health that sometimes pain just becomes too much. 

And honestly Im not even living for myself anymore, I simply exist so ppl would not suffer due to me killing myself. I dont want to cause any problems to my family.

I had a reaally bad day and would like to hug someone who understands, because nobody in my life does understand. I feel so lonely.

When I was younger I could distract myself with tv, games...nowdays nothing works. I just don't want to be in pain, I don't think that I ask for too much.
