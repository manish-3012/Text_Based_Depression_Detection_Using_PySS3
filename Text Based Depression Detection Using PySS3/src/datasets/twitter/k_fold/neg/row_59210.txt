Others need more help than meI donâ€™t want to go day by day with this same feeling in me. I wake up every morning wanting to just lay there and never get up. It would be the same outcome if i got up ainâ€™t nobody gonna notice if Iâ€™m gone . I hate the life that i live day by day. I feel nothing i am emotionless Iï¸ am manipulative i am selfish i care about only my well being . Iï¸ wish Iï¸ was a different person than the one Iï¸ am right now. I wish i could feel something once again . I hate that Iâ€™m being used by the girl i love and i canâ€™t leave cause i love her. Iï¸ hate that Iâ€™m too much of a Pussy to pull the trigger of the gun that is to my head.Iï¸ just wish Iï¸ could end it nobody would care , over time they will notice there is no longer a dark cloud hovering over their heads . I want to feel something yet all i feel is pain and sadness. I want to end my suffering yet i canâ€™t seem to pull it. soon.
