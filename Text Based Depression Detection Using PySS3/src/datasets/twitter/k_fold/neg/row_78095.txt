I just want to die, if I had the courage I'd finish everything nowI don't know much to say. I'm too mentally fucked up, I'm done. Life is shit, this planet is shit, it's not worth it. It's just pain and happiness is pretending everything is fine when it isn't. Everyday, I look at people's faces it's all fake and bullshit.

I'm a failure, I have no future, I can't be independent, my friends left me, I have Social Anxiety, I just want to die. I'm done. They ruined me. Bullying ruined me. Those imbecile kids done it. Society done it. Nobody ever cared and here I am, absolutely destroyed. I'm a nobody just failing. All the opportunities and I'm wasting them and time. 

You try to pretend it's fine but it's not, and then you try to get stuff sorted out but nothing works. Fuck this.

Also, nobody ever cares, not even your "best friends". They just don't. They can't fix my life anyway, why the fuck would they care. Then when I fucking pay attention to what they're saying I'm an idiot. Because I care and they don't. 

No wonder. Nobody contacts me anymore. Fucking assholes too. If one day I kill myself I hope they feel guilty as shit. It's their fucking fault too.
