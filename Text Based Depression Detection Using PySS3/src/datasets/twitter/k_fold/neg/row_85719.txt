Can't deal with the abuse anymoreI live with an abusive mother who has been emotionally abusing me for nearly 30 years. She has her golden child, my sister, who could never do any wrong, even if she was angering me to the point of retaliation.

I just escaped an abusive marriage, and was forced to move back home, even though I knew it meant going back to my abusive mother. I hoped she'd changed. She hasn't. I was here for a week before the abuse started all over again. And now, she's actually trained as a bodyguard, and can use the threat of real violence to abuse me.

I don't have anywhere else to go, so there's no escaping it. The two people who were the reasons I haven't yet tried to kill myself are becoming less of an incentive not to. They haven't changed - I have, and I can't tell them how I feel - I don't want to burden them with that knowledge. They have their own problems, and one is emotionally fragile too right now. I know if I tell the other one, he will tell my mother. My mother didn't believe me in my teenage years when I was diagnosed with depression. She'll say I'm just being melodramatic and trying to manipulate her - the world is all about her, and damn everyone else who ever disagrees with her.

I can't go to a psychiatrist - because if they do talk me out of suicide this time, it's going to impact my transition from female assigned at birth to male later.

I don't know what to do.
