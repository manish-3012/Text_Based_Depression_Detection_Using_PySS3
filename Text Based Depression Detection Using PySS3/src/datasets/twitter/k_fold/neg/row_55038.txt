I hope someone kills me.I want someone to shoot me in the back of the head, or someone to run me over with a truck, or some psycho pushes me in front of a high speed train.

Or a vessel pops in my head and ends it instantly. 

My existence is joyless. The only reason I am not dead is because the process of suicide hurts more than life. 

If I had a gun I would pull the trigger.
