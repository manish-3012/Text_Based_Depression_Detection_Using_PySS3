I wish I was a child. I F*CKING HATE THIS SYSTEM. I feel like I don't belong anywhere here.Life were so easy when I was a child living with my parents. My room was so chill, I was feeling so happy literally everyday. I miss the old days. I miss my parents home. I miss being a child again. Once I became 18 , whole world turned against me. Im 20 right now and I don't want to keep doing this. I'm sorry. 

I want to visit my parents for just one more time. Sleep in my room in peace. Have breakfast with them for a week . And than I'll end it.

God damn it I'm going to cry so bad .
