Bittersweet SymphonySo today I had a date to meet a guy that I thought was yet another promising potential mate. This is about the 10th time so far this year, and I'm not exaggerating when I say this. I don't handle rejection well at all. It's obvious that I'm ugly, or otherwise unattractive to other guys. Every time I do get to have a first date, the guy simply stops talking to me. I've taken it for too long. I can only take so much before I reach my breaking point. So about 30 minutes ago, I took a mix of 60mg temazepam, two 5/325 hydrocodone tablets, 1mg of alprazolam, and a fair bit of alcohol. I've talked to more therapists than I can care to count, none of whom offer helpful advice, just repeating the same information that's been going through my head for the past 24 years. Antidepressants/anxiolytics don't work because I'm so sensitive to the side effects that the therapuetic effect is negated by the amount of sleep I lose or whatever other side effect my body chooses to torture me with. 

I believe today I have reached my breaking point. I have no willpower left, I feel so drained from putting myself out there, only to be rejected by the community of people I belong to, who ironically take such a firm stance against bullying and ostracism. It's hard enough that mainstream society rejects who I am, it's even harder to be constantly rejected by people that 'just want to be friends' or 'don't feel any fireworks'
