Spent most of the night wondering why I shouldnâ€™t just end itI lay in bed for a lot of the day, and when it comes down to it, I can never really fall asleep. I keep thinking to myself that I really could just end it all for good. I already cut my legs, if I just so happened to put the knife to my throat instead of my thigh, it could all be over. If I took the entire bottle of my pills instead of just one, I could just lay down and never have to get up again. College starts this week and I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to make it. I really donâ€™t know why I keep trying. I guess the only reason I donâ€™t do it is that Iâ€™m afraid it wonâ€™t work, and then my parents will have to take me to the hospital and theyâ€™ll be mad as hell, and they just wouldnâ€™t understand because they donâ€™t know how to. I really want this life to be over....NOW
