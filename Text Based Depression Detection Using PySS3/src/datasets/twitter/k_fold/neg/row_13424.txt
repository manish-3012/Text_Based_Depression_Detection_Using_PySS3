i want to die, but i dont want to leave my friend.okay so long story short i wanna kill myself, i mean thats why this sub exists right?
incase anyone wants to know im nineteen and ive pretty much felt this way since i was thirteen or fourteen. ive been browsing this sub for a while but finally thought i would post.

i moved to university this September and i found some amazing friends who i am truly greatful for, honestly they are the reason why im here now and they somewhat know my issues in life which some of them share with me this is good because i have some people to relate too but i also dont wanna make them worse mentally by talking about how shit i am all the time. 
honestly im rambling but the reason why im still alive is because i honestly feel like my friend would kill himself if i did and i feel like i would if he did.
