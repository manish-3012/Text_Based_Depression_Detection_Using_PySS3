My Parents Ok'd It.I told my parents that despite my anti-depressants, I'm feeling suicidal. 

I'm in law school in a town I hate for another year, up to my ears in debt, no support from the school or anyone when it comes to preparing me to be a competitive applicant for the job I want... it's just all really overwhelming. 

My parents said today that clearly I'm not that dedicated to being a lawyer and if I'm not strong enough to handle this, suicide might be the best option for me because I'm not strong enough to handle life. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this.
