at a point where I don't know what to dofor a long time I've felt as if my destiny ends somewhere in my early adult life where I've ended my life. I'm at college right now studying film (I want to be a filmmaker in life and make art that I've kept sitting around in files full of ideas I want to bring to life), but I just feel like I have no direction. My grades are lackluster by my standards (even though I'm studying something I really love and care about), and I'm at a point in my freshman year where the friends I've made are making plans about where to live next year and essentially leaving me out. I honestly don't know what I want out of my life for the next few years, and I keep thinking about ending my life in hopelessness. I just wish I could take a plane to some rural village in Nepal or something and live as a nomad until I figure out my place in the world. Every time I spend another day here in society without knowing who I am or how I'm going to get where I want to be (I probably won't even get there in the end), I feel like I'm one day closer to me ending it all. With each day, I feel like I'm closer and closer to my imminent death by my own hands.
