Told my partner I wanted to Die, he went to workIâ€™m not sure how to feel.

Iâ€™ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years. 

This past month has been hard on me emotionally. 
Iâ€™ve fallen into a deep depression that has stirred up thoughts of suicide...thought I havenâ€™t had in a decade or so. Iâ€™m 37, my last real attempt was in my 20s 

So my BF has always been physically and emotionally distant and I thought if I shared in how I was feeling heâ€™d make an attempt to at least take time off work to be there for me. But heâ€™s not. And Iâ€™m not sure what to do. 

He tells me he wants me to rely on him physically and emotionally but when I do want to rely on him with something serious, like my mental health he becomes a bit avoidant. 

But when heâ€™s having bad days I need to be there for him physically to hold him and emotionally to tell him it will be ok. 

I donâ€™t normally ask for help so when I finally opened up to him, It felt as if I was dismissed. 

Iâ€™ve been in crying fits for two days now, and I just feel alone...even tho Iâ€™m being told Iâ€™m not and thatâ€™s heâ€™s here for me. 

Yet Iâ€™m still crying this morning by myself in an empty apt, just me.
