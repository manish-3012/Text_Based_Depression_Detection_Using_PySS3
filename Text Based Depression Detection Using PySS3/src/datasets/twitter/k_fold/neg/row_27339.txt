I don't have the courage to change my life so I should just kill myselfYes I know I'm an adult and I need to just do whatever I have to to take responsibility for my life, but I can't. I'm too much of a coward. I don't want to do anything with my life. I don't want to out myself out there. I am a coward. I cannot accept that there is no straight path to success in life and so I need to pass away. I just don't have the courage to even try to get my shit together, not do I have the inclination to do anything to improve myself or to contribute to society. I don't want anything from anybody. I just want to die and be completely absolved of the responsibility to change my life, because I sure as shit don't have the courage to live.
