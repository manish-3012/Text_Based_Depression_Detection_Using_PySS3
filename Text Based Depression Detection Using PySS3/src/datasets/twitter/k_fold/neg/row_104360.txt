Anger lost controlHey guys, I've lost all feeling. I broke up with my girlfriend because I lashed out her little sister out of anger. I feel like a monster, my pent up anger taken out on someone that didn't deserve it. I've got nothing to live for now. I am gonna drive away on Saturday and just end everything there. No one has to deal with me anymore after that. I'm a mess. Yeah. I'm messed up in the head.
