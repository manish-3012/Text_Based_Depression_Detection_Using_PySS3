A really good friend told me she has a specific date she plans to commit suicide, what can I do?She's had depression on and off for awhile, but now it seems something has happened to make her decide she has a month to live. I tried asking her about it and getting her to open up about what's wrong, but she doesn't say anything beyond insinuations of her having a month left. 

Obviously I'm extremely concerned, but her cavalier attitude makes me uncertain what to do. Also, I'd be lying if I said it doesn't make me really upset and fairly angry with the position I'm in. Seems like there's no way for me to help, and I'm just supposed to chat with her like everything is normal when she has assigned this countdown to herself. 

I have said things like "what can I do" "did anything happen to make you feel this way" "I'm always available if you need to talk" but she rarely responds when I say things like that, only when it's normal conversation. If she does respond, it's short broad answers that aren't at all personal--basically shrugging them off. 

Is there anything I should/can do? She says maybe she'll change her mind depending how the month goes. It's possible she wants attention, but there's seriousness in the tone so the attention may just be a pro to her 'plan' that she actually does intend to carry out.

Any advice would be appreciated; thank you.
