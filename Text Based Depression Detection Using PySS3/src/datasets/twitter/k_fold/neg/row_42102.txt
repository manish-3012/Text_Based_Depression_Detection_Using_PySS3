Ever just wonder: what the fuck is wrong with my brain?I don't know what's really wrong with me. Why can't I be someone who's strong and resilient, who could brushoff negative thoughts immediately? Why am I built like this? How can I be too sensitive sometimes yet super numb the next day? Most importantly, why the fuck do suicide comes up in my brain every 5 minutes even when there's nothing to be deeply sad about? I just want to end this. The fact that it's also a stupid reason to kill yourself over it makes me want to kill myself more. Why am I like this? what the fuck is wrong with me?
