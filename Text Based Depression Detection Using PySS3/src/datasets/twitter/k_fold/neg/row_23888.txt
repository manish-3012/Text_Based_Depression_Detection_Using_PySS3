I want to dieI don't think I'll ever kill myself but I keep thinking about it. Coming up with ways to do it. I'm really done. I want my mind to shut the fuck up and I hate myself so much. I'm just a failure and I'm not worth it. I can't do anything right and I fuck everything up. I wish somebody would kill me. Or a car to hit me. I want to leave. This world sucks and everything is meaningless.
