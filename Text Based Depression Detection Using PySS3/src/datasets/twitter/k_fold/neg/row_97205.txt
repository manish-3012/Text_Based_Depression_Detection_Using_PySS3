Iâ€™m so tired.I wrote my note today. I have a date set. I donâ€™t know how to find the help I need, I donâ€™t think I want the help anyway. I donâ€™t know what I even hope to accomplish by posting this Iâ€™m just sick of feeling like Iâ€™m just screaming into the void. 
I feel empty and too full. I feel misty grey and numb. I feel like Iâ€™ve spent my life clinging on by my fingernails while one by one they snap off. I just donâ€™t feel cut out for this anymore.
