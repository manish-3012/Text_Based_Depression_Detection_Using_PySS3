If your reading this, then I finally did it.This is about how I feel right now.
Tired of it all... every day... so..

If you're reading this

Then I finally did it

I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye

There was no time

Understand I was stressed

Living day to day was hard

And I gave it my best

But there was nothing left

For me in this world

To convince me to stay

Now I'm long gone away

Don't you do that

Don't you start your tears

Just remember all the time we spent over the years

Never cry

Never think bad to me

What's done is done and that's the way it had to be

I need you to be strong for me

Say your prayer everyday in my memory

I'm sure it's helping me

To earn my feathers

To get some wings

And a halo and a harp and angelic things

And even though I'm gone And outta sight

Never worry about me

I'm alright


Pretty much sums up how I have felt for last couple weeks.
Don't know what to do anymore, Cant ask my family for help.... they have enough trouble as it is.
I just wish I could vanish and never be seen or heard from again... sure people would wonder for awhile, where did i go... but eventually they would just forget about me and move on.
I don't want to sound all emo but I have accepted a lot of things recently and started making arrangements...
Gonna miss you Reddit :*(
