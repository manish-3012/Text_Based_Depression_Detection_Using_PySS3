Jail or hospitalization?To set the context I don't have health insurance and I live in United States. The way I've chosen to commit suicide will land me in jail if I try it. But at the same time I kinda want to go to jail because I know they get health care. If I'm hospitalized I'll be in debt for the rest of my life. I'm considering taking a permanent record over debt if I'm unsuccessful.
