The worst couple months of my lifeI have been coming to this group?? (idk how reddit works tbh) a lot over the past few months and just reading reasons to stay alive and other peoples stories to help me and realize my self worth so i thought i would share a recent story. 
a couple of weeks ago everything in my life just got too wild and hectic and crazy and i was planning on ending my life on a friday night (oct 24) . that night i hung out with my friends and went home and cried and contemplated for hours. i didnt end up going through with it and the next day (saturday oct 25) my older sister passed away in a car accident. im not sure why all this stuff has been happening to me. a month ago my grandpa died and a day before that i found my dad cheating again. people say it gets better and i hope it does although it doesnâ€™t seem like that. i still have hope though. and so should you. which is why i decided to post this. your life matters!! people care about you!! even if it doesnâ€™t seem like it push and power through because you are strong enough to do so.



if you are contemplating, i highly advise you to think about it for a little longer and try to stay a little longer. you werent put on this earth for nothing.
