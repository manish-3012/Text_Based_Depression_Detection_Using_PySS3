I lost my best friend and now Im all lonely and shit &gt;.&gt;There's a long story behind this. But I had this one friend who was the most amazing person, and we talked all the time and all that good stuff. We both have depression and a lot of issues in our lives and they were always there for me to talk to and help me through all these shitty times. Its hard to type up the whole story. But I was really stressed. And have bad anxiety/am also a lot insecure. And I started really pressuring them later on, and making all these shitty mistakes that made our friendship decline. Eventually I really messed up and they stopped contact with me, and I have no way to actually talk to them now that I'm out of school. They didn't have a phone so we used Skype, and they had removed me from that. It's been months now and I'm going through really shitty times again and I just really miss them. I know people might think it's stupid to be super saddened by this, saying things like "just move on" or "they weren't a true friend" but I know for a fact it was MY fault everything got fucked up, and I pretty much deserve this. Now I have no friends, hate myself for screwing things up with my best friend, and have a ton of other issues and I'm just REALLY close to giving up and I hate it v.v.

Well that's my rant, hopefully someone can give good advice I am thankful for any help
