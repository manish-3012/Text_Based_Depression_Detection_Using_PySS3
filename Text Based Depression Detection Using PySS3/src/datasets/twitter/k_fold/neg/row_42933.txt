Help me save a friend please?A friend of mine recently tried to commit suicide, aside from that she also thinks very negatively about herself and I'm afraid she might try to commit suicide again if this keeps going.

Right now she has made a poll to check what people think of her and she's convinced she's trash.

It might not be a lot, but it would mean a lot to me if you could vote for her NOT being trash, since right now there's 1 vote saying she is and I know that vote will weigh on her heavier than the currently 9 votes saying she isn't.

Any help would be appreciated.
