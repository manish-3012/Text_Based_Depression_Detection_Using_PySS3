Idk if iâ€™m happy or sadI live my life the same always everyday.
Wake up, go to school, come home and lay in bed for the rest of the day. 
I donâ€™t feel sad, I feel happy and optimistic most of the time but I also feel like I do nothing with my life and that I donâ€™t really have anything to live for. 

I donâ€™t have any real friends outside of school so I usually stay inside because I have nothing to do outside. 
I canâ€™t make friends easy because iâ€™m a bit autistic and people my age are judgemental and think iâ€™m weird, theyâ€™re not wrong though. 

I want my life to change somehow but I donâ€™t know how, Iâ€™ve tried playing different instruments and picking up other interests but it doesnâ€™t change anything. 

Idk what iâ€™m talking about to be honest, I just want to get it out.
