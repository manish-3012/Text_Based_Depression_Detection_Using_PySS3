what goes up, must come down(idk how to do it on mobile, but this is nsfw)

things were really good for a while. 

i moved in with my SO, we got engaged, everything has been happy and rosy and for the first time in years i didn't want it to end, i felt so good about the future instead of dreading it.

but, see title.

earlier we were fooling around. i was trying so hard to make him feel good, and i felt like i was doing a good job, even though he kept looking at his phone. he fell asleep after and i picked up his phone to see if his mom had texted him about our plans tonight. it was open to his browser. he had been looking at hentai while i was giving him attention...

it's been an off and on issue for us. but this really hurt. he got angry that i saw. 

it's so hard to feel pretty. i feel so secondary. i feel so second rate. i can see my reflection in my phone now and i think it would look better six feet under. then he could find something closer to the pictures he looks at. i'm an organ donor, maybe she could take my heart so i could still be with him. I'm not very smart or very skilled... I don't think there's any hope for me if I'm not pretty enough to keep his attention while I'm working so hard to perform for him.

it just feels like I'm crashing. this is what i get for feeling better.
