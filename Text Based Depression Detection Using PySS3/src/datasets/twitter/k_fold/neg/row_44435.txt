I don't feel like I am ever going to get better...I am always depressed. 37 and have been battling it for the last 25 years. It ebbs and flows but right now is one of the worst times. I've made lists of the people I am going to write goodbye notes to. I've decided on a method and today I checked out that exact spot while driving. I was drawn to it. 

I'm too chicken and I know that but I also feel so incredibly tired. I can't do this forever. I feel frozen and distraught.

I read posts on here and people talk about their parents messing them up. I am messing up my kids. Today I called my kids and my husband assholes to their faces (twice!) And then left for a few hours. My husband didn't even call or text to see if I was ok or where I was. I could've killed myself then and been done.
