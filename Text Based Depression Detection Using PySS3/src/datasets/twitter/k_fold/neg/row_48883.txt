Pressure is a bitch. Fuck it. My brain is a bitch.I can hardly do this anymore. The pressure is just to fucking much. What do I mean by that? Oh, just being ranted on by friends, parents, school, and myself. That kind of pressure on a **middle schooler** is just messed up. It kills me everyday. 

Combined with my dunce of a brain ( I say that and I have practically straight A's and am in Honors Language Arts ), with all of the thoughts I have, just getting up is a struggle. 

I already ranted and typed for like 20 minutes on YouTube so I might keep this short. Who fucking knows. 

I feel like a terrible friend for the things I do. I donâ€™t realize it in the moment, but I think Iâ€™m hurting them. I would never fucking do that. Hell no. Is there something wrong with me? Am I a literal psychopath? I mean, I do make jokes about killing people...shit. Anyways, back to my brain being a fucking piece of suicidal shit. 

Pressure. Expectations. People. School ( some parts. Yeah Iâ€™m a nerd ).  All things I absolutely hate. 

Expectations and school: Hello? Itâ€™s called everyoneâ€™s brain works differently and you have "expectations" for all of us? Just because it is expected that I turn in homework on time doesn't mean Iâ€™m always going to do it. Just because Iâ€™m expected to do something at home without reminder every 20 minutes, doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m going to. Why? Because my brain is an overly stressed piece of shit and I canâ€™t get anything together because of it. God damn I need a whole new brain. But I canâ€™t since thatâ€™s impossible. Fuck my life. 

Pressure: Fuck pressure. I hate it. Itâ€™s the goth teen of stress ( no offense to any actual goth teens out there ). Basically runs along the lines of what was said above. 

People: Fuck people. Weâ€™ve ruined our home. What can I do about it? Fucking nothing because aim to busy dealing with others problems, then my own, and I donâ€™t have the brain power to actually focus on belonging the planet back. 

God damn this turned into a rant. Okay. 

This is to fucking much. Just end my life while Iâ€™m not in a relationship and wonâ€™t give a fuck about if Iâ€™m gone or not. 'Cause Iâ€™m certain many of my friends will not notice at fucking all. They could care less if I just died. And Iâ€™m fine with that. Less people to think about that could possibly miss me. More of a reason to just die now. 

Back to my brain being fucking stupid. It wonâ€™t shut up. Either Iâ€™m thinking nothing, thinking horrible thoughts, or a song is playing full blast ( note: I never have music playing when this happens ) in my head and it wonâ€™t shut the fuck up. Like, I just had a mental breakdown about this. What the actual fuck. Also, how am I supposed to focus on school when all of my choir songs, and all the others I listen to in my free time, playing full-ear-drum-shattering-loud?

I guess Iâ€™ll have to cut this way shorter than I wanted it to be because itâ€™s a school night and itâ€™s 10:11 currently. But I probably wonâ€™t be falling asleep 'till like midnight.
