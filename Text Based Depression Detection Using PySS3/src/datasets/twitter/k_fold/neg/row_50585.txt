..At the moment im pretty good. Iâ€™ve been having really weird mood swings sometimes though, like for a solid 20 minutes Iâ€™ll be like super happy/hopeful and ride that wave for a couple minutes after I hit like a peak. Then I go into a overwhelming phase of self doubt and spiral of anxiety. Which is super weird to me because my moods has been changing kind of quickly depending on what im doing throughout the day. I mean Iâ€™m smart enough to know that mental health is over all this other shit but I also know that if I donâ€™t get over all this shit everything would be seem to spiral and I would be in a worse of place than I am rn ya know. Like the highs and lows are kind of concerning but I canâ€™t imagine everyone isnâ€™t having those through out the day. And like I said, Iâ€™m able to multitask fairly okay so I can like just change what im doing to change my mood or get my mind off something without getting stuck......is this something anyone can relate to? I know this thread has more serious stories but Iâ€™ve youâ€™ve taken the time to read through this, thank you!!! And feel free to shoot me a comment with your thoughts
