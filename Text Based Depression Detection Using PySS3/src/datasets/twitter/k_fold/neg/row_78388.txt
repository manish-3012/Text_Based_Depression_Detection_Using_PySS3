Anyone ever feel like killing themselves as a fuck you to the people who supposedly care about you?I do. I just got let down by a girl I'd arranged a date with on Saturday. She blocked me on facebook and POF for no reason. I thought we had a genuine connection so it hurts that much more.

I'm honestly tempted to just throw myself in the river on Valentines Day as a fuck you to my friends and family because apparently I'm selfish. I might as well prove them right by doing it on a day that would normally be happy for them. But each year on Valentines Day they'd be reminded of what I'd done. Not that anyone would really care.

I mean people in general make you feel like shit, but your friends and family make you feel a hundred times worse than lets say the bus driver who had a go at you for accidentally having the wrong date on your bus pass (which actually happened to me).

But when your family and friends give you shit it just makes you sink lower. You feel genuinely worthless. I know that people would say they only want the best for you, but that's a load of shit. They want the best for themselves, they don't wanna be ''upset'' at our passing. Basically they want us to be miserable forever so they can be ''happy'' forever.
