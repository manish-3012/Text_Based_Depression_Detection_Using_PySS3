This makes me feel like an attention whore.I haven't been happy for what seems a very long time.  I can't even tell you how long it's been I have no sense of time anymore.

I've read this subreddit for many months, nothing you say will make me feel any better, and I'll follow no advice you give me.  I've felt this way before, but never for this long, I think I'm nearing a year now.  

I've od'd on copius amounts of alcohol and tylenol pm twice now in the past two weeks, not specifically to die, just because I didn't care and wanted something bad to happen.  Instead I just woke up and went to my shitty job stoned out of my mind.

  Tonight I hung myself with a belt on my doorknob until I started to become confused and fear took over, I couldn't stand having my wonderful dog watch me.  He's all I have.

My friends are gone, I've pushed everyone away.  I've had no ambition or purpose, or even ability to focus for years.  I don't want to be your friend, I don't want to tell you my story.  If I'm committed to a hospital that will only cement in my mind what must happen.  I just want to fucking die already.  Why can't I have peace?  I wish I could just take a pill and go to sleep, and never wake up.
