Never been closer to ending itI am really close to just fucking ending it. I hate my mom so much because she doesnâ€™t believe that Iâ€™m depressed. I went to a therapist and they said that I probably have depression, but my mom insists that â€œitâ€™s just a vitamin deficiency or somethingâ€. She literally doesnâ€™t believe me or a therapist that I have depression and itâ€™s fucking up my life. Also my mom takes it personally and thinks that Iâ€™m trying to insult her. Iâ€™m so fucking mad right now and am seriously thinking about killing myself. My parents are so incredibly blind to how I feel and when I tell them they just get offended or think Iâ€™m selfish. I hate my fucking life.
