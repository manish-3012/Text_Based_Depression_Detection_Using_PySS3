Dead endsSeems like every aspect of my life is going to dead ends. Situations where I only have two or few options and any single one of them is a bad one. Everything is falling apart.

The last one I just noticed last week. I fell in love with a friend, the only person that I can be myself, the only one who I can really call a friend in this world. But now I see myself between two options, keep as a friend like nothing has changed and get myself hurt really bad when she finds someone; or I can put an end to the friendship, lost the most important person of my life, but save myself from future doom.

And that kind of shit is going on every single aspect of my life.
I don't know what to do, I'm tired, I wanna die.
