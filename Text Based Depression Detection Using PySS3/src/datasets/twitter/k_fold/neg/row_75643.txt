I have screwed upSo I committed fraud at work and stole money. I havenâ€™t been arrested or anything but I was fired 2 weeks ago and I know the truth of what Iâ€™ve done is going to come out and Iâ€™m going to lose everything. 

My husband and I have been married for 20+ years and we have four girls. Our youngest is just 12. Iâ€™m going to lose everyone I love and care about. 

Suicide seems the only way out. I donâ€™t want to hurt my children and family but this is the only answer.
