how to make it as easy as possible from a logistical standpoint?i'm aware of the great pain that suicide inflicts on loved ones, but that aside, i'm wondering if you guys could provide some tips on how to make it as logistically easy as possible, ranging from prep, to the actual act, and what goes down after. also, regarding debts and finances, if i'm in debt $20k, what happens to the debt once i off myself? does it go away or get taken on by someone near to me? i'm single btw. and no, this has nothing to do with the debt (or being single)- i could sell something off and cover it no problem. is it possible to organize your own funeral while you're still alive? i mean pay for it so someone else isn't left footing the bill? 

would appreciate a brief list of things to do before moving forward. 

and about suicide notes... is it mandatory to leave one? or if your life's been 29 years of lows, people are able to piece things together and add it up, no? 

thanks in advance.
