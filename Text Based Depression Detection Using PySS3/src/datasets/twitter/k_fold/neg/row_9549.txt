What do I do?Hello everyone. This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. My friend is suicide and depressed. Her parents beat her, and I offered to let her stay at my place. The thing is, we're both minors and I don't know what to do. I can't call the cops, the stress with the government can only end in a bloody mess, and the parents could call the cops if she runs off. Could I be taken in for kidnapping if I were to take her in for a few days? She needs to get away from home. The stress from home is slowly killing her. It's heartbreaking seeing her like this, but I'm running out of ideas.
