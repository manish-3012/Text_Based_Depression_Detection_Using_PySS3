17 years old and I hate fucking hate myselfI'm a f17 years old, I graduate highschool in a week and I"m a fucking loser. I have no friends, never been in a relationship and I'm not going into college. I'm stuck an alcoholic mother who loves to remind me what a loser I am and today she's threatened suicide because I'm such a disappointment. I hate myself. I

I'm thinking of upping my suicide date now tbh. I was planning for sometime in August (mainly because summer is my favorite season) but I don't know how much longer I can take knowing I'm going no where and listening to mother bitch at me about it.  I'm thinking about  doing it June.

I feel like such an asshole doing it too because I don't want to ruin my mom and brother's birthday since the new dates are so close to their birthdays...
