The struggle is so hardHey reddit.
As you could have guessed I'm depressed and feeling suicidal. I believe I have OCD. The symptoms keep getting worse and worse, especially over the last few years. I am at a point now where even the slightest interruption in my routine sets me off in a spiral of panic attacks and depression.

Knowing these things I have been trying to seek help. I can't afford it myself so I went through the county for aid. It took me three months just to get that done, obsessing over the paperwork to make sure every minute detail was correct. I finally get accepted and I panic to try and make an appointment. That took another few months to become brave enough.

Finally two months ago I recieved a call for an over the phone evaluation. That person submits it to the county psychiatrist office where I wait another month for yet another evaluation where they only confirm what I did on the phone. The social worker who did it says it will take another month or two to see an actual doctor... but by then my county medical will be up and I won't be able to afford to go, the thought of more paperwork and waiting has me in a panic.

I can't enjoy anything anymore, the depression and suicidal thoughts are worsened by my obsessive brain, I have anxiety attacks nearly everyday now and I feel like my mind isn't even my own anymore with all the thoughts that I can't push away.

I don't know what to do... I don't think I can wait for help anymore. I need it now and I can't last much longer.

The only thing keeping me from killing myself right this moment is that I keep making plans in advance so I can tell myself that 'Oh, you can't kill yourself. You need to do that thing!'. The last plan I have set out is a convention in August... after that I don't know if I have the strength to resist any longer.
