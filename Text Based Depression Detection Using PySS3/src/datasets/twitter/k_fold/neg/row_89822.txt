13 year old girl telling me she is extremely unhappy with her lifeHey,

a friend of mine (f,13) has just confessed to me (m,16) that she is very unhappy with her life in generel and doesn't see the sense of living. She didn't mention suicide yet but I'm sure she will bring it up soon.

I don't want to say, 'every teenager feels like that at some point' or 'everything will turn out fine eventually' so can you guys help me out with some stuff that might cheer her up and get her back on track? I asked her if there are any particular reasons for it and she said it's a general thing.

Every form of help is much appreciated, thank you. 

Edit: She just told me that she cuts herself.
