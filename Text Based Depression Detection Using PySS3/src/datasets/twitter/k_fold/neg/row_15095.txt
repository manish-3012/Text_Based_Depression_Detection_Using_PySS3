I Don't Understand My ExistanceSo today a guy gave me the definitive decision to only be friends after only knowing each other for a few weeks.

This has been one of many times this has happened over the last year and every time they tell me how great of a person I am, how well we get along, how much they appreciate my thoughts.  Though, despite all this positivity about myself as a person, they always say that they just don't see anything for us, which always makes me question what romantic chemistry is to them.

I'm also doing quite well in my freelance art career, I have a large social media following and I've survived a long period of time doing my own thing.  People like what I do and it had given me so much self worth the moment I got a lot of attention for what I do.

I just don't know why I exist, everyday I'm forcing myself to do things when I'd rather just lay in bed.  The only times I really interact with people is when I go out clubbing, and when I ask people to hang, they always misinterpret what I say as a sexual offer or an approach for a relationship.

I always try to reflect on why things are the way they are, but the more I think about it the more I realise there is no point on trying to understand myself because for all this stress, anxiety and emotions, it can all be for nothing, I can just be gone tomorrow.

I always try to appreciate my own company, but theres only so much time you can spend with yourself. When no one else is asking to hang out, you wonder what it is about you that makes people not just want to be in your company as much as you want to be in theirs. I always feel like I just need that one person who I can rely on but sadly I haven't found that person, and as much as I can lie to myself and say I don't need them, I really do.

I just don't understand how I can be this all existing 'good' and successful person, when I feel awful all the time and no one seems to know or care.
