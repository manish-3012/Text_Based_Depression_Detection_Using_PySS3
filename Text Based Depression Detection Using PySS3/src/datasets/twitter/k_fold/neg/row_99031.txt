Goodbye &amp; Thank youMy ex girlfriend of 5 years left me a few hours ago. I watched her leave knowing she will never come back, knowing I will never see or feel her again. I always knew this day would come however I would deny it deep down inside. I am not prepared for what is about to happen next in my life, therefore, I have decided that it is time to finish my adventure here. 

I would like to thank my ex girlfriend for not just being my girlfriend, but for being my best friend. For being such an amazing person and supporting me, accepting me for who I am and following me all around the world. I truly did not deserve such an amazing person in my life. We travelled, we played video games, we suffered and we achieved so many things together. We planned our whole future together and we were both so excited. Unfortunately something changed, something flipped a switch in your head and you decided that I was no longer going to be a part of your future. The love you once felt for me was now gone and there was no chance to try and fix it. You made your decision and you left so quickly that there was no time to react.

I always knew that if I ever lost her I would no longer be able to live my life and carry on. I knew I would be completely dead inside and not have the energy or motivation to continue and move on. She was the one person that really helped me through life and gave me a reason to get up every morning and work. I love her so much and she is the only person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Now she's gone. So thank you for sharing 5 years of your life with me, travelling and creating some amazing memories together. I could not have asked for a better person to be with me and nobody will ever be able to replace you. 

I would also like to thank my father for allowing me to have such an amazing childhood and for allowing me to have such an amazing relationship with my ex. You helped us to go out and explore the world. You encouraged us to follow our dreams no matter what. I am so thankful for having a father that cared so much and invested so much time into making sure that my life was as great as it was.

The last person I would like to thank is my sister for giving me somewhere to stay and looking after me during the tough moments in my life. I never got to tell you how much of an amazing sister you really are. I know this will really hurt you but please understand that this is what I need to do. I know this will cause you a lot of pain but I can no longer live like this.

My ex was my true love and the only person I could really talk to. She was there when I had something funny to show her and she was there when I was going through some tough times. We both fought hard to get to where we were. Our love was different. Everyday was so special and just waking up next to her and seeing her face gave me so much happiness. I could write so much about how I feel but I want to get to finish what I need to say quickly.

Life is unfair. One moment you can be flying above the clouds and then the next your struggling to get out of bed, make breakfast or even shower. Feeling this way is killing me. I've never felt so sad in my life and I just know it will not get any better no matter how much I try. I no longer have the love of my life giving me energy so I have decided that the time is right to pull the plug and just accept that some people handle it better than others. Over 20 years on this planet and the last 5 spent with her have been the best years of my life. I really had fun. I just can no longer accept the fact that it is over between us and all the other things building up are causing so much pain. I can't face my family and tell then what has happened. I can't open my phone without seeing all of our pictures and videos together. 
Every 5 seconds a memory pops into my head and makes me cry instantly. The time has come for me to just leave this awful place. I have no job, I don't have a place of my own, I have no money. Now is the perfect time to leave.

Thank you Reddit for always giving me something to do when times were tough. I'm sure you understand why I have to do this.

In 24 hours I will no longer be here and I am honestly excited about seeing what there is after this. 

Good luck to anyone that is strong enough to still go on with their lives. Thank you for your time.

See you on the other side!
