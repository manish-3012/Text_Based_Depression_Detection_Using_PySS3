No more tears.I'm not crying anymore. I'm not sad. I'm not happy. I'm not really anything. I feel like I've been crying for years and my brain has just been fighting and fighting and confused and I've finally given up. Nothing matters anymore. I'm not even sad about what I want to do. I don't feel any remorse or guilt like I used to feel when I wanted to kill myself, now it's the only solution. There's nothing for me. There's billions of humans on the planet. Hundreds to thousands of those people are going to be important and cause significant change, but I might as well just be another lemming. My immediate family would be sad but they're all very depressive as well (and more of a detriment than help) and they clearly haven't been able to help me in my life nor me them. Sometimes people are worth saving; my life is inconsequential. It truly doesn't matter. I don't have the means to kill myself, and I'm under pretty heavy supervision right now. I've stopped eating altogether (no motivation, couldn't shove food down my mouth if I tried) and I've given up entirely on any and all medications or talking it out. Really I'm not sure why I'm even posting here, as I'm really far too negative to be open to suggestion now. I guess I'm just saying that everyone has a point of no return, and I'm well past mine. My life will be ended by misery and anxiety whether I kill myself or not.
