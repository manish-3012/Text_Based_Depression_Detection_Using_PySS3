I failed again, I've been trying to be better but something bad always happens and takes my will to liveToday I got the results for my final exam, and of course I failed. I won't be able to go to college and don't have the money it takes to start it all over.
I lied to my mom, I said I went well because I am too afraid she will scream or hit me if she knows the truth. I am a big disappointment.
Tried killing myself last year and it didn't work, I just want to try it again to see if I will finally be at peace.

I am constanly feeling worthless and tired, I am not a good company to my friends or bf anymore, I always fail at everything
