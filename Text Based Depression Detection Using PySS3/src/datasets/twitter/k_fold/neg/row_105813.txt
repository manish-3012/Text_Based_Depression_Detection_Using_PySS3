The fight against depression isn't going my way today.Have you ever just been sad?  Been so enormously sad that you think that there really is no fixing it? Yeah you can breathe and calm down. Stop the tears, stop the yelling and punching.things. But after you've calmed.its still there. (sorry there will be grammar errors I just don't feel like correcting it).  Its like, I have been doing so good, and it creeps on me.  The sadness slowly oozes in and it just gets more and more until I explode with rage.  self soothing.can only go so far, and as much as I need to be alone, I need to talk and not to myself. This is basically talking to.myself I guess. I just, I don't know what'sgoing on with me, I think I am losing it. The only thing.keeping me for hurting myself in more serious ways is hope, but hope doesn't make the sadness stop. Its still here and I am still alone.
