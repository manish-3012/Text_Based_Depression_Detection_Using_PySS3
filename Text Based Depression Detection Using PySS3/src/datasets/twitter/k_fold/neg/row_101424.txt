Social exclusionHi

We often say, social exclusion for mentally ill is a problem, it shouldn't happen, etc, but at the end where is the problem ? Isn't it at the end normal ? 


I mean, I'm "somewhat successfull" in music so it let me able to experience "normal society" sometime (happy people, ppl who do stuff, able to work 5/7 and stuff lol). 
I just stopped a relationship with a recent friend (my fault), and what happened is like what happened everytime, ppl can't take negativity (I bet this message sweat negativity too lol but now I don't give a fuck Ive tried 28y to change), or various problem posed by any illness. 

But is there really a problem with that ? I mean, Ive immagined myself in the head of my ex-friend, at his place I would be like him... There is no superior empathy to have to a group of ppl, in a way this is idiot


What I mean is that perhaps for one time we should take this as a fact, and not a "should be like that", and working from that. For example in my life Ive already had relationship with girl in the past (when less ill), Ive easier time now to say "it's not for me anymore" or imagine a life alone... Ive had good friend (acutally the better relationship was the first), etc.... Perhaps now I need another thing
