I am lostSorry this is ny first reddit post and if the format  is horrible. I stumbled upon this while looking for ways to suicide. I genuinely  believe that I am destructive as a human being. It seems like i ruin everything im associated with and the world is better off without me. I would say im more of logical than emotional and very emotionally dull and have very bad mood swings. I could be very happy but as soon as something happens that would not normally make me angry i suddenly snap and become very hostile and agressive. This goes on for a day or 2 and sometimes even a week. Talking it out with my girlfriend really helps but it just  seems like im becoming a burden and shes getting busier by the day and its really hard. This also makes me believe that she too will give up on me and leave me very soon . Lately all i could think about is killing myself and its getting worse and worse by day. Tldr i feel like a burden to society and everyone i love and cherish.
