I am a terrible person.In middle school there was a girl who liked me and I was always mean to her. I tell myself that it was my way of venting or dealing with what was happening since I had no outlet but I know I could have done something else. In highschool I had a friend who I swear had cuts on his wrists like he was cutting himself and later he had a noose around his neck at school in a storage room. He didn't commit suicide and he says he was just joking around. I feel awful since I never mentioned either thing to him. I feel guilty and ashamed I never tried to help him or ask about what was happening and that I was to awful to the girl in middle school. I constantly feel like a drain and a burden to everyone I am near. I just wish I was less selfish. I wish I didn't fantasize about dying whenever I'm not distracted. But I know that I deserve to suffer.
