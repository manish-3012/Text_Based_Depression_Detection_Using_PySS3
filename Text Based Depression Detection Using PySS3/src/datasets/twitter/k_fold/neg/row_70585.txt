I'm trying to kill myself by dehydrationWell i decided that i won't drink anything anymore. I drank last time yesterday evening (now it's afternoon 15:30) plus because i'm weak i drank this afternoon 1 glass (~200 ml) of cola. But that's all. It's strange because after the cola i regret it and felt that it was a mistake and i'm a piece of shit because i drank it and i started feeling this with food (again... (i felt it a lot with food in the past)).

so yea, i know that probably it won't kill me because i'll faint and hospital will save me but actually it's a good method because noone would think that i tried to kill myself so i can do it anytime and one time my kidneys/other organs will give up or there'll be time when i have noone to call the emergency. so sooner or later it'll kill me. and it's pretty neat because i already started slowly loosing my sense of reality (i can't focus, i'm dizzy etc) and that's exactly what i want!! 

i'm 18
