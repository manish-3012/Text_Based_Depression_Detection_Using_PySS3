At the end of my ropeI no longer know how to cope. Im failing out of college, ive alienated myself from my friends, im struggling with the death of my brother, and the girl I was going to marry has left me for another man. I feel I have nothing left. I cant keep food down, I cant sleep, im shaking, I cant see straight....ive reached out to counselors but they just dont click with me. Before this, ive always been able to cope with my depression. I dont know why I cant anymore. My hobbies no longer comfort or interest me. Im exhausted. Im tired of looking for relief. Id rather feel nothing.
