I'm about to go broke and homeless. I've lost hope in humanity.I'm sick and tired of reading stories about people with disposable income or making money that last me a year in a month.

I can't work. My parents hate me. My girlfriend hates me. I have a rare ass panic disorder and nothing helps it.

I've asked for help time and time again  and everybody is perfectly okay watching me and millions of others wither away. We arent fucking animals.

I drew the worst ticket in the lottery of life. Fuck it I'm out. I've tried. Hard. I've fought to make my way in the world and I fucking lost. Bye.
