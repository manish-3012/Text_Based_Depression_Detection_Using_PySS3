I will be killing myself.So. After a pretty bad incident that broke the camel's back, uh, I reached that point where you are just....weirdly calm and happy about dying.

I lost who was most valuable to me. On the planet. For the most bullshit reason. And that broke the camel's back.

I'm planning on buying a dagger tomorrow. Gonna do a livestream of it. Maybe I'll invite some of you guys, depending on why.

It was nice knowing you. Cheers.


Update: Have begun cutting myself...will share photos in DMs.
