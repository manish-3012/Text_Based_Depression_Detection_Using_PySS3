i don't have very thick skin.hello. i'm making this because i don't think people where i work like me very much. we had peer reviews and both my peers and those above me agree that i'm in the bottom one third amongst everyone. in addition, my "normal" reddit account got banned and I'm not sure why. I assume it's because I'm an asshole, I don't know why else. in addition, i'm so lonely i've turned to the internet to meet girls because i can't meet them in real life. initially it worked since a lot of the girls i talked to think i'm really nice, but it only served to make the pain worse since no one in life thinks so and likely never will. 

I know i'm not a very likable person. i try to keep my distance from people so i don't bother anyone. most people don't really want me around conversations and stuff anyway so i try to keep my distance so they'll like me but it makes everyone end up disliking me more. i don't know what to do to make friends or get people to like me. 

i don't want to commit suicide, but i do want to die. i'm the most unsure person i know. i don't want to go to work tomorrow and try to avoid everyone's gaze and ignore the fact that i'm pretty much a loser and everyone else agrees. i just want to go to bed and not wake up. 

i know i'm a loser and i don't have a lot of pride or care for myself left to speak of. but even i can't stand everyone thinking i'm pretty much worthless. i've got friends, i've got family, but most people don't seem to like me much and i don't make friends very often or very well. i don't know what to do or what i'm getting at, but i just wish i were dead because i'm tired of being so lonely.
