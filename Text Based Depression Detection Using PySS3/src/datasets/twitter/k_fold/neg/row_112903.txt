In 24/7 physical pain with no relief.Iâ€™ve developed severe allergies to nearly every common everyday chemical out there. My skin itches severely all over my body and my throat and nasal passages feel like theyâ€™re burning away from acid. Doctors canâ€™t help me, antihistamines donâ€™t help me, I cannot imagine going even another month in this sort of shape. My family says Iâ€™m making it up because doctors wont diagnose me with anything. This is the final blow to my sanity on top of a divorce, bankruptcy, and being abandoned by family. Iâ€™m buying rope this weekend and fading away.
