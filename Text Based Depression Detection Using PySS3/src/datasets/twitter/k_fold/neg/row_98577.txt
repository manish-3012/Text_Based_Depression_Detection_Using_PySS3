i'm disgustingit's remarkable how much i dont fucking matter. to everyone in real life. i surround myself with people that think im useless. i get mocked for being myself. i get constant anger, attitude and insults from my 'friends'. i thought things were going right.

 im riddled with abuse trauma. i was sexually assaulted as a kid and i still have the active abuser, my mother, in my life. i dont want to live with myself. i feel beyond disgusting. i feel worthless. people remind me of that on a daily basis.

my mother used to beat me up until i could barely register anything anymore. im out of that household, but shes still in my life. i fucking hate it. im such a useless cunt

im obese from binge eating. im unhealthy. i just wish i died from a fucking heart attack already. i wanted to hang myself but i would decapitate myself in the process. 

so i'd love for someone to give me a reason to stay on this earth. really.
