trying to come to peace w my decisioniâ€™ve been planning to kms dec 6th for a long time but iâ€™m honestly scared i will pussy out. my life is meant to end i genuinely think this is my fate and if i do not do it then i know i will live a miserable life. i fantasize about my death all day and i feel like the universe is giving me signs of approval to leave this place. i donâ€™t want to write a note but i feel like it will make it easier on my family. i have been isolating myself from them for awhile though so i think that will make it easier anyways. the thought of staying alive terrifies me. i am taking the easy way out.
