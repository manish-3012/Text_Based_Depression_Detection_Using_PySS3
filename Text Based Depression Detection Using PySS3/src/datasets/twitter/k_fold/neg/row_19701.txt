I donâ€™t knowMy dad bought me an expensive car and said it was for me to not smoke anymore around New Years. After that I got depressed lost everyone in my life except my girlfriend and didnâ€™t give a fuck about anything and lost it and had to earn it back, he works out of state and I moved with him to work with him. He found out I smoked from a drug test for work. I left my girlfriend behind 1000 miles away and came here to work 7 days a week, more than double my hours and barely get any free time just to come home and get cussed at every night. I earned it back, but because of everything I drank vodka that was sitting on top of the fridge to cope with it, he just found out today about it and I lost it all, my car, donâ€™t have anyone, all I do is work and am never happy and never will be. I donâ€™t see the fucking point anymore idk what to do I give up.
