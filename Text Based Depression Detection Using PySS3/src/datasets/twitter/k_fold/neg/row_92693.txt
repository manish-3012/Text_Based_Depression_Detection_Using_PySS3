?I don't know if i'm depressed i feel like i'm just sad. I was depressed for almost 5 years, i went to a psychlogist bc i was cutting myself. I feel a lot better. But suicide seems a logical choice bc life is to hard especialy anxiety and stress it's just to run away from difficulties like if life was just a big problem i can't handle
