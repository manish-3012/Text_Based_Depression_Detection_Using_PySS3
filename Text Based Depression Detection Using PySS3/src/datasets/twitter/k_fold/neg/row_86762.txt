I hate what happened and I cannot bare it no more.I'm 22 years old and I'm done living. I've lived 2 decades but it feels like 500. I cannot bare my past. I cannot accept what happened nor do I want to confront it. I've been smoking weed getting high daily for 2 years just to numb the fucking pain. I hate being pilled up, I hate the feelings of being overheated cooked from the inside, I hate loneliness, I hate literally everything. Idk why I dont kill myself now, I want to but I dont want to put my parents through it. I just want to die, I do not find pleasure in living at all, I dont know what to do anymore and I'm ready to die.
