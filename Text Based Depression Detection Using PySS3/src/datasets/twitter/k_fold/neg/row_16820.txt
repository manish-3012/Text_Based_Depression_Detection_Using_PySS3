Feels like a cycleI've lived to my mid-twenties, which is way longer than I ever thought I would make it. A lot of things in my life are better than I ever thought they would be. But I feel suicidal 24/7. 

Part of it is the pandemic, being stuck inside for three months, watching the world go to shit and feeling completely helpless to do anything good. Part of it is just who I've always been, and I don't know how much longer I can deal with feeling like this.
