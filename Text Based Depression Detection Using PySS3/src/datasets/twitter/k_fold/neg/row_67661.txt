It relaxes me think on my suicideI know for sure Iâ€™m not planning it do it, not since my previous attempt years ago, and I even stopped self harming almost completely (even when I feel way worse now than before). But when I feel anxious, or canâ€™t sleep at nights I like to close my eyes and think about it, it truly relaxes me to the point I fell asleep easily and in peace. 

Does that mean Iâ€™m on risk of doing it in the future?
