I have been crying for five and a half hours, straight, and I just fucking want this to be over.I have three hours to finish a project in class. If I don't finish it, I'm going to fail the class. You can have an A+ in this class, but still drop your grade down to an F if you don't finish this project. I've been working on trying to finish this all week, the last three days were Hell. Wednesday I stayed up until 1 am trying to finish it, and was sleep deprived for the entire school day, Thursday I spent like three hours crying, and nearly hung myself... Twice. And now here I am crying again.

Whoever thought that putting this kind of shit and stress onto a highschool freshman was okay, all I have to say is fuck you. 

I swear to god, if I wasn't over my aunt's house right now, I would kill myself. She doesn't have anything I can kill myself with. Fucking hell I want this to end. So much. Make it stop, make it stop, please make it fucking stop.
