Are there any subs where I could ask what it means if I anticipate dying of suicide in my 60s (maybe 70s)?(and not get some BS answer that says it will get better...because thatâ€™s not what I need, but thanks...no really tho, no suicide prevention BS...pls)

(but of course Iâ€™m going to get suicide prevention shit on here...and asking other suicidal people is probably going to get me BS answers...but Iâ€™m still curious if something...intelligent is said...I donâ€™t expect it tho)

Ok, for context, I am 26 now.  Female.  White Hispanic.

None of that really matters tho.

Oh, and I want to be a psychiatrist and am in school for it (because of course).

Iâ€™ve been chronically suicidal since childhood...and tbh I donâ€™t know that there is any type of treatment that can help that...

Psychiatry tells us they have the answers, but they want to get paid.  

(Iâ€™ve been going to one for years...in talk therapy atm but I am still getting a feel for this therapist)

Basically I know I will get to a point where I am actually tired of life...and I will probably end it.

I am hoping I can put this off until my late 60s...however if Iâ€™m honest there are no guarantees.

I do anticipate my life ending in Europe (in the US now) in a room with someone giving me a sleeping elixer after having paid them a fuck ton of money (at best...maybe our laws will change in the US...however tbh I have the fantasy of dying in this country due to a documentary I saw as a teen, so letâ€™s go with it).

What do you make of this?

Again, if you must do your suicide prevention talk fine I guess...whatever makes YOU feel better.
