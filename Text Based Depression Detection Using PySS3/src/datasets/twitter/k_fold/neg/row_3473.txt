I'm going to do it...I have often times contemplated suicide. I suffer from depression and find a lot of things hard to deal with. Obviously I've never gone through with it, I'm not some kind of computer ghost. I think it stems a lot from my years in middle school. It was right after my parents had gotten divorced, my dog had died, and I gained enough weight from emotional eating to be considered "clinically obese," something that the doctor decided to withhold from me for a few years, for some reason. I got bullied a lot in this time and felt a real sense of distance between myself, my friends, and my family. Kind of like I was alone in the world. I'm doing a lot better now. I lost pretty much all of the weight, learned better social skills, and have gone on to be a mostly happy person. In a lot of ways, that struggle really did help me become a better person. It helped me really develop a sense of humor, since I had to learn to laugh at a lot of shit. It helped me grow a thicker skin, since I had to learn to deal with other peoples' bullshit. I'm ready to go...
