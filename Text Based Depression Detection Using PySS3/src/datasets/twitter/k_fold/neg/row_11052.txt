Slowly descending and realizing my shit life.My mental health has been deteriorating badly these past few months. I try to make my life better but every try gets met with a failure. Now I have erectile dysfunction and the thoughts of dying get progressively worse. 

Didnâ€™t have a good family growing up. Dad was drunk or high off some drug most of the time and caused a lot of anguish. He just stayed at home all day and caused terror, then talked nonstop throughout the night. Mom brought in the money for our family, but she had her own flaws with heavy gambling and eventually left us all alone to live with Mr. Psycho. 

The past didnâ€™t bother me but now its coming crashing down because I have nothing to look forward to the future. My dick doesnâ€™t work anymore and I never got to use it. My life was fucked up for the first 19 years and now its carried over to my adulthood because Im awkward and donâ€™t know how to do seemingly basic shit at 23. 

Im getting to the point where I donâ€™t care how others will feel if Im gone. I keep thinking of buying a mustang GT and flooring the pedal till I crash into a wall.
