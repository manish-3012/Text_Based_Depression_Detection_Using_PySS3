i dont have joy anymoreim a pretty young person that just hates everything, school, work, parents, noises while im home, but theres one thing that keeps me living, that is music  
im pretty good with it, i play 6 instruments, and i know about the musical theory, even tho i wish i didnt so i would be a ignorant fucker that likes lady gaga or smth  
anyway, lately, ive been starting to play some really hard songs, from eruption from van halen to fantaisie impromptu from chopin, and i just dont know what to do with my life, it looks like theres no reason for me to live anymore...  
i cant even live of music because i live in brazil, and theres really no way to make money out of high quality music, like metal or orchestras, the only popular stuff that might get me money here are some retarded pop and funk songs(brazilian funk, not like the american one), just google about them  
everyday i hear it, and it makes me want to die  
my parents arent buying a new instrument for me in a while because its just expensive as fuck  
some times i try to compose but i just dont have the high quality recording equipment i need to make high quality stuff like i want  
and i dont have any friends, also i play dota 2, im a 5k mmr player that just plays one match, then uninstalls, then a week later i reinstall it, play another match, and uninstall  
i just dont know what to do, this probably feels stupid but idk
