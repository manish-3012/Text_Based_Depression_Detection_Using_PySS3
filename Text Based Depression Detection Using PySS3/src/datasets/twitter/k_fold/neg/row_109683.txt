Thoughts are driving me to be suicidalMy gf broke up with me 2 months ago. It sucked. But what caused it is that she mentioned a previous boyfriend's large endowment, and described him and it in detail, and I freaked. I have OCD and a vivid imagination. Now I can't get the image of her with him out of my mind. It's been two months, and no mindfulness exercise, no meditation, no willpower is erasing those images. They are always in my mind. I'm not sure why, because we are through so there's no reason for me to feel insecure, but I don't know how to stop. If this keeps up I'll never survive.
