Iâ€™m ready.Iâ€™ve been ready for 11 years. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™ve never been protected by those meant to do so. Iâ€™ve never been safe. Why canâ€™t my suicide be as easy as when they ignored my pain, called me a liar, beat me, raped me, abused me, left me on my own as a child to protect myself. Almost killed me and my brother because they were a fucking drug addict. Narrowly avoided someone discovered to be planning my murder. Being raped and contracting an incurable STI. Being chronically ill and denied disability permanently. Being infertile to have the family I dreamed of.

How much more do people have to see me endure before theyâ€™ll let me go? How much more will they stand by as voyeurs to and watch me have to fight alone like I always have, but wretch and moan when I feel like ending this cycle?

Then telling me they love me fixes nothing. Their love didnâ€™t fix stop any of this. Their love is actually panic that Iâ€™ll do what Iâ€™ve been wanting to do.

Theyâ€™ll cry as if they didnâ€™t hear my cries for years on end. Theyâ€™ll cry as if they didnâ€™t make jokes about me reaching out for help. Theyâ€™ll cry as if they helped me.

None of them did. Theyâ€™re all liars.
