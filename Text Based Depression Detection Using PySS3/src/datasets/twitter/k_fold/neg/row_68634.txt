anyone else take the different path to life?Typical life, graduate hs, graduate college, get a job, get married, have kids

me, drop out of hs, doing shit jobs, moving in and out of my parents house in my 20s, friends drifting apart, 30s is still the same. 

I am soooo behind everyone but I am so depressed I"m unable to make any progress or changes to my life. I literally spend all day feeling depressed. im stressed all the time cause now i lost my job and I need to make big decisions quick. I just want to die but it's so hard to kill urself. when i think about the future, there's nothing there for me. I just want to die and end all this suffering.

how is it that most ppl are able to follow the normal path to life but im not? clearly i have mental illness but I can't even get on welfare. what the fuck am i suppose to do?

what makes me feel shitty is that, I don't run into ppl like me. I don't run into losers in mid 30s. I met a few in my 20s but not in my 30s. did they all kill themselves?
