I don't know what to doI can't stop feeling used and gross and I hate that this happened. 


I don't know why he made me do that when he could have had so many people who would have wanted to do it. I feel so sad and angry and tired. I didn't go in to work today  and I still can't make myself leave bed. I just want to stop feeling like this and thinking about it
