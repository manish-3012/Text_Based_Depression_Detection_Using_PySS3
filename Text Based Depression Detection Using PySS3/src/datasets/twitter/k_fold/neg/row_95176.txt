What if someone commits suicide yet exhibited no signs or red flags right up till their death?I see the risk assessment guide and it provides many useful tips on assessing whether someone is at risk for suicide.

A friend of a friend just committed suicide this morning. I didn't know much about them but my friend said they was regularly posting on social media, was attempting to become a bus driver, never once directly or indirectly displayed signs of suicidal thoughts/behaviour, but then just today the news came out that they hung themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

My initial reasoning was that if someone was suicidal but was extremely private about it and managed to not let anyone suspect it, they would at least not actively strive towards getting a job. At a minimum their life would be stagnant. But now that this person killed themselves after no telltales and in fact looked forward to life, I'm not sure how one would accurately assess everyone's risk of suicide?

Is this common? And why do some people seemingly just snap like this?
