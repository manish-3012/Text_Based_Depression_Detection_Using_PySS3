'It hurts.' 'Sorry.' 'I'm a fuck-up.''Fuck up.' 'Failure.' 'Dumb.' 'Soft.' 
All words I would use to describe myself.

Never think I would catch myself posting here again... It's come down to it and I feel ashamed for everything I am contemplating.

I am a complete failure. Constantly saying 'It hurts.' to myself. No job, no SO, no money, nothing. Struggling in college as well. People starting to get pissed at me because I can't seem to do much right. Can't talk to people. Can't land a job. Can't do 'learning' right. Can't do a thing right. Probably can't even make a coherent post.

I don't have much hobbies outside of playing games and music, and they do not bring much joy anymore. If at all. Classes just finished. Probably failed the majority because shit just does not click in my head. I want anything else but to flip hamburgers for a living. God forbid that shit.

I didn't get out of bed at all today because I just did not want to face the world. Don't want the constant reminder I'm a massive fuck-up and failure to everyone I've met.

Tried to go out drinking copious amounts of alcohol last week. Too much to remember. Doesn't matter anyway, didn't work, and completely out of alcohol for now.

I refuse medication, I do not want therapy. I do not want to drugs to alter me, if I'm going to beat these urges, I need to do it myself. I have seen what they have done to people, especially those in my family. And it scares me. 

The urges are becoming really hard to resist.

This post probably doesn't even make sense.

Sorry.
