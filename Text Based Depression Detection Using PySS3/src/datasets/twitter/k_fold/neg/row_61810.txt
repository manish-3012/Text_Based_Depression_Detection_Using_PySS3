Iâ€™m an idiotThe only reason Iâ€™m staying alive is because of my mum, otherwise I donâ€™t see a reason to live. 

I just feel like my whole life is silly.

I cut myself for the first time yesterday. 

This is the first time in 2 ish years that Iâ€™ve had suicidal feelings pop up again, despite going through counselling and therapy. 

I just feel like a hopeless case and I canâ€™t stop crying lately at random moments; listening to music and exercising, showering, watching a movie, cleaning. 

I just feel so lonely as well. 

I donâ€™t even know how to word my feelings properly but I feel so hurt by everything that has happened lately and now I just feel like giving up; I donâ€™t have the energy for anything anymore and just feel empty. 

I feel so used and stupid.
