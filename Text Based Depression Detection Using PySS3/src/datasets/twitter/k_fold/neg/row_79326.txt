I'm gunna die young.I've always know I'd die young, I'm really thinking about just taking a bunch of my sertraline and overdosing. The only thing holding me back is my family, but I feel like death is the key to truly being happy. I hate myself. I hate my situation, I just hate everything. I want to be put out of my misery. Please.
