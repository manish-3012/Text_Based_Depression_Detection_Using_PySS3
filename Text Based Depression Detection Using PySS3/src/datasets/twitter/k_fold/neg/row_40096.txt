Can I call suicide hotline if I'm not doing it immediately?On second thought, that's probably not what I need. Would waste their time.

I have no finalized plans. I expect that I will die by suicide but I don't know when. I haven't acquired the means yet and there are still things I look forward to in my less-depressed moments. But I daydream about suicide 4 or 5 times a week.

Therapy didn't help so far. I'm on meds. 

Fuck you know what? I'm not actually expecting any advice. I'm just posting this because I want to talk about suicide.
