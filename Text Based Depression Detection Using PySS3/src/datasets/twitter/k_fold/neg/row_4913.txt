I can't any more.So uhh idk how this works.

I feel like shit, I'm a piece of shit, everything I do makes me feel so much worse than I already feel, and I want to kill myself.

I'm scared of being alone with my thoughts because then the voices get louder and this time they're all mean to me.

I feel worthless and helpless and I'm a shitty person.

I'm trying to leave a mutually toxic marriage but I guess 1400 miles isn't far enough

I'm afraid of what I'm becoming. I've had so few things work in my favor lately, I just can't fucking handle all of this stress.

I wanna go home. I want a hug from my best friend. I want to talk to my therapist. I want to have a job and be useful in the one singualr thing I am capable of not fucking up.

Being here is easily the worst decision I've made in my life.

I got a tattoo before coming here and I want it gone. I got it for my soon to be ex spouse, and I regret it so fucking much. I just wanna cut it off but I can't because then people will worry.

I just wanna feel safe.
