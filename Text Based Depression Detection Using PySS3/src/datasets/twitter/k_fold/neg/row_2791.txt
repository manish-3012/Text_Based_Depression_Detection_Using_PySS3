I don't just want to die to stop hurting. I want to die to punish everyone around me. Including you.I want my dad to find my asphyxiated corpse in the garage after he gets home from the Christmas party.  That's what he gets for constantly calling me ungrateful, criticizing me and telling me that I can't do anything right.

Then I want him to call my ex-wife, who left me and took my children, right when I needed them most.  When I hit rock bottom, she had a responsibility to help me through it.  Instead she bailed, and encouraged my kids to stop talking to me.  When she calls she lumps on shitty platitude after shitty platitude about why I should keep going, then she proceeds to ignore me or engage me in any meaningful conversation about us, or what she's done to hurt me over 15 years of our sham of a marriage.

I want to punish my gossipy neighbors for spreading rumors about me.  Let them be the eons who now have to spend years consoling my dad over this, and let them know why.

And I also want to punish this shitty sub.  You assholes are awful.  Rallying around one post while ignoring another?  Posting half-assed "aw don't do it u r lived" bullshit.  Ever wonder how many posts here are from people who are now dead because they chose *this* shithole as their last hope?

Fuck my family.  Fuck this town.  Fuck this world, and fuck you.
