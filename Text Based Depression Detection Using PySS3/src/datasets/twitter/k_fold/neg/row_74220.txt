I just want somebody to try to help meI know there are other people who have it worse and I probably shouldn't be complaining, but this is the lowest I've ever felt. My girlfriend of 4 years just broke up with me, which wouldn't be so bad in itself, if she wasn't also the only person I talked to aside from my parents. Unfortunately, they're not the best or even good at emotional support.
We both just moved to a new town to go to the same new college (not the same apartment) and after a little over a week broke up with me out of nowhere. This had been my longest relationship ever and we were even going back and forth with all the lovey 'love you more' stuff a couple days before. I was completely blindsided. The only thing that's worse is that she is the only person I would ever talk to about something like this. She was the best thing I had in my life, and now I have nothing. She was the thing that kept me from thinking too dark, now all I have is the fact that a life of suffering is better than an eternal void of nothing. I was told we could still be friends and to text her if I needed anything, and after a few days it turned into no responses, and then a few responses basically saying we couldn't be friends for a while and I shouldn't talk to her until we're both completely over it. 
I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this, or how anybody can help.  The last time I called the suicide hotline, the guy was shit and just kept telling me that therapy is the solution I need, even after I tried that and it didn't work.  Right now I just want somebody to understand how I feel because I don't have anybody left who will honestly care.
