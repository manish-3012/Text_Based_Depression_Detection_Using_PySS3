As A Redditor Who Attempted Suicide...I wanted to share my experience. 

\*\*\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\*\*\*

History: I've had major depression for over 25 years. I've been on almost every medication there is and it's still hard. I still get lonely. I still get sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was diagnosed at 15. Make that MIS-diagnosed. They were treating me for bipolar disorder. Twenty years later I find out I have anxiety and MDD. Things looked up for a minute because now I didn't have to take 13 medications. Sometimes I felt good. But when I felt bad I felt bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

So one night, I was sad again. Had been for about a week. Hadn't showered. Had called into work all week and was terrified I was going to lose yet another job due to depression. I drank and I drank a lot. Then I got super emotional cause I got into a fight with a friend. It felt hopeless and death felt right. After all the suicide notes I had written in the past I felt like everyone else was selfish. I wasn't selfish for wanting to die, they were selfish for wanting me to STAY here like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried with a knife first and couldn't do it. It hurt too bad. So I found a razor and was able to cut both wrists successfully. I'm on blood thinners so I took the whole bottle of those so I would bleed out. I was very very woozy. I wanted it to end faster so I kept going to the kitchen to get more medicine. I ended up taking a LOT of Lamictal.  Lamictal is extremely dangerous is large doses. 

I don't know what time it was but I had to pee at one point. So I tried to get up and I literally had no legs. My legs fell from under me. I couldn't walk. I was poisoned severely. I tried to pull myself up with my arms. I couldn't. I just kept flipping over furniture in the attempt to get back on the bed. There was vomit all over my pillow. I slept with my face in it. 

Then the hallucinations started. The morning alarm started to go off. I was screaming at my mom (who wasn't there cause I'm an adult and live alone.) To turn off the alarm. I was screaming such obscenities to her for torturing me with the alarm. 

Shortly after I was able to crawl to my bedroom door and open it and realized my mom wasn't there. It was my computer alarm and then I realized I was blind. I couldn't see anything. It was like one of those backgrounds you see on a mac thats just a bunch of fuzzy colors. 

I crawled to the computer and unplugged it so it would stop and I collapsed. I couldn't see. I couldn't walk and I was alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day my mom DID come over and find me. She thought I had been attacked due to the disarray in my bedroom. When I told her what happened I begged her not to take me back to the pysch ward and just stay with me and help me heal so I could go to work Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Slowly over that weekend after a lot of oatmeal, bread, and water - some electrolytes I could walk again. Eventually, I could see again too. Monday came and I couldn't go back to work. I took a leave of absence from work because I knew it would just happen again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called my psych doc and left a message about what had happened... and well... he couldn't see me for two months so fuck him. I found a closer doctor - better doctor. She RXed something called TMS.

&amp;#x200B;

This saved my life. My work insurance covered it. I did the treatment. I am now on three psych meds (as opposed to 13) and haven't had a thought of suicide since. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read your stories and I see what all of you are going through. I hope you, too find a way before its too late. I just wanted to share my story for two reasons. 1. It was terrifying being blind and unable to walk and 2. I am doing much MUCH better. My thoughts are clear. My depression is minimal and the anxiety is gone. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is hope. If you ever do feel like committing suicide. Feel free to reach out to me. I'm here to listen to your story, as you just did mine.
