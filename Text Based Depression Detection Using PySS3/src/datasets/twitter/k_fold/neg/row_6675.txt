Iâ€™ve Tried Everything, No More AdviceRanging from the good old generic advice, all the way to philosophical and biblical passages about how to help, or where to look to.
Doctors, therapists, pills, the whole medical field, has not helped me at all. 
Nothing has helped me.
I havenâ€™t had a single good MOMENT. A moment, not one instance have I been happy or felt good now. 
I tried everything.
I hate generic advice or when someone acts like they have the answer. They donâ€™t.
I looked everywhere for the answer, everywhere, no luck. Tired of this exhaustion and misery every single living moment. Itâ€™s just time to let go. I am done.
Doing the tried and true 3 method. Tons of pills, slit the wrist, shoot the head, no chance of survival.
Thatâ€™s my only fear is being alive after trying to end it. Being stuck as a vegetable rest of the miserable life. Not able to talk or do anything just seeing with the eyes, the misery still inside.
Fuckkk Iâ€™m tired of it all.
