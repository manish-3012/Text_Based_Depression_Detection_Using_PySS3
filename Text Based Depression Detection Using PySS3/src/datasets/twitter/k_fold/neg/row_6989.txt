I'm done.Hey,

So I've been depressed for most of my life. I've been suicidal longer than I can remember. I've been in and out of counselling for the past 7 years and I feel I've finally reached the end of my tether. I'm going to kill myself next weekend.

I know my family will be destroyed, I know it's a dick move, but I just cannot live like this anymore, I have no desire to participate in life.

I don't even know why I'm writing this here. I'd like to tell you all the full story of why I want to die but I have no desire to even explain it at this point. I'm just done.

Thanks and goodbye.
