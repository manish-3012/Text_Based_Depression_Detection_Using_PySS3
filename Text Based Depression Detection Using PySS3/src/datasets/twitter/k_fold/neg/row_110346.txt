Thinking of killing myself because my thoughts wonâ€™t stopI canâ€™t with these thoughts telling me Iâ€™m worthless and that I shouldnâ€™t be with my boyfriend and how terrible of a person he is and how Iâ€™m fucked up for staying with him. Reddit doesnâ€™t help because i spend hours trying to fulfil my obsessions and end up feeling more damage in the process. The thoughts of feeling increasingly depressed and hopeless and feeling like my life will never amount to anything has grown tremendously. Iâ€™ve never wanted to stop the thoughts so bad Iâ€™d think of killing my self but it seems like itâ€™s the only thing that works. I canâ€™t relax for a minute without these things. If no one fucking cared for me I would kill my self I really would.
