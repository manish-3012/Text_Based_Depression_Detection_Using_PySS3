I want to get rid of a specific thoughtI used to constantly think about dying and I was one of those people online who say stuff like "I want to die" over and over not knowing the effect those words had on the people who loved me.

And I have people who love me, friends, family and a girlfriend. The thought that plagues me to this day is "I know it'll hurt them, but they'll find someone else and it'll be better for everyone in the long run".

The more I think about this thought, the more it makes sense to me, the more I start thinking I really should sacrifice myself for everyone's good
