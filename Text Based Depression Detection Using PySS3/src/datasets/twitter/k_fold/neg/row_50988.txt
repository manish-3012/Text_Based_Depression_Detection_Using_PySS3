im honestly patheticive lived a completely average life by all means. my parents loved me, my brothers... i guess loved me, i dont know. anyway, im not really sure where it all started. i used to get bullied by this girl across the street, but im easily manipulated, so she'd be nice to me and i'd just be her friend again. that went on for, maybe 4, 5 years? she was younger than me, but i was a really delicate kid, despite my size. she'd call me names and beat me up when i was just trying ti have fun with my friend. so, after i moved away k think that all stuck with me. i dont have trust issues or anything, but i dont see things past face value. if somebody is nice to me to my face i think "wow, thet were nice! ive made a friend" only to find out they hate me, and then repeat the cycle because, well, people are fake. well, i've got this group of friends (my only friends) who essentially do the same thing. they don't really hate me or anything, they just don't actively want to be around me. and that hurts. i'm really bad at making new friends and all, so i haven't tried making new friends. i'm currently sitting alone in my room, painfully sober and bawling my eyes out over people who want nothing to do with me. it makes me feel worthless, and i feel like im overreacting. i just get the general idea that i have no right to feel like this because so many people have it so much worse, and im just being a stupid girl and throwing a fit about some high school friends. but i've come very close to opening up a pill bottle, and ive run my fingers over the key of the gun cabinet far too many times to not talk about this at least somewhere.
