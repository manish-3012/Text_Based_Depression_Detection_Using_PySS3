I might have a problem.I feel like a waste of space, time and money.  I really having a tough time finding purpose. I don't care for a career, a degree or a family. I really don't see why I should go one my life, I just don't have a goal (Jezus, can I sound any more cliche). 

I had a bucket list, with stupid teenagers stuff like: get high once(Done), lose virginity, visit another continent (done), visit a big festival (done), See all time music heroes (seen most of them, only Rammstein left) But most of these are done. For the once that are left I don't really care any more, I feel I can skip these.

 I always had the deal with myself to at least out life my parents. But that is just becoming harder and harder. They shouldn't have to see that they raised a failure. 

My frist step was to ruin the last friendship I had. I just did it. We had a small argument, I ignored her during that argument for some time and got asked what was wrong. Told her I was childish but couldn't think of a normal and decent way to deal with her so I shouldn't deal with her any more. Just to make sure she would be mad at me, and wouldn't care if I wasn't there any more. 

I know I should call or talk to some one. But fuck me, I hate talking. I don't want to deal with some one else, and waste their time. I'm not even sure why I bothered to make this post, there are probably better cases to help. Maybe I just wrote this to waste some of my time. I am sorry.
