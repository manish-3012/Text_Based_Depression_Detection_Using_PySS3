I feel like I dont deserve friendsMy depression and anxiety had caused me to distance myself from my closest friends. As a result they dont hit me up anymore because they think I dont like them anymore even tho I wanna hangout w them bad. I did it because I feel I deserve to be lonely and I deserve to eventually die. I logically know I deserve friendship and love but I'm afraid my emotions are gonna take over and I'm gonna isolate to the point where I commit suicide. I dont know what to do
