How to get help when you can't?I'm having a major depressive episode for the first time in a few months that I'm worried is gonna last a long time. I'm already consumed with suicidal thoughts and really want help. But i work as a bus driver and even though I would never put anyone else in danger I could lose my job for even seeking help. A diagnosis of bp or depression would make me ineligible for pretty much any cdl job and most medication can't be taken while driving a bus. What can I possibly do
