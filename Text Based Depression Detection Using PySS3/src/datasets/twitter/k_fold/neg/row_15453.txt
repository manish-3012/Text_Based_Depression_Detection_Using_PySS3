Not sureI had been dating this boy for almost a year, he gets me so well and we would always bond and have the best time, but he just broke up with me 2 days ago. I love him so much he said he loves me a lot but just can't figure out what is wrong with him he hasn't been himself and I have noticed. We did take a break a few months ago for the same reason but it hurts more this time I cant stop crying. He kept apologizing and pointing out he wont ever find anyone as amazing as me. We cried and hugged for hours I've never seen him cry so much. Hes been the only guy who's been genuinely super kind and caring for me he still says I love you to me but I just want him to be my boyfriend again. Being bestfriend hurts but I know hes been down. We always talked about getting married even last week he brought it up. I just feel so depressed I want him to be my boyfriend again and treat me how he did before he lost himself. I really love him and I know he loves me too. I just dont know.
