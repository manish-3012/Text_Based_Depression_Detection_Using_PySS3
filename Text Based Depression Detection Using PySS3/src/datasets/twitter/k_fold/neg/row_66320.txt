Monsters are not born, they are made.I need someone to talk to about this. It's eating me up inside and this isn't the first time I've wanted to kill myself over it. I'm seriously losing my trust in women, so if you are one, and are willing to offer the metaphorical shoulder to cry on I'm asking for, you have to promise not to abandon me.
