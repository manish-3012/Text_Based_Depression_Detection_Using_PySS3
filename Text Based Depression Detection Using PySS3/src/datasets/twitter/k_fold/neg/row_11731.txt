I want help, people are laughing at me because Man City are winning against my team Liverpool.For years I waited for Liverpool to win. Ever since the Gerrard Slip, my life drastically changed, I got picked on, harassed and embarrassed because I am a Liverpool fan. Nothing is going right for me in my life, even my friends have been doing this to me. I'm about to slit my wrist, friends think of me as a joke, at campus or at work. I want to talk to somebody please!
