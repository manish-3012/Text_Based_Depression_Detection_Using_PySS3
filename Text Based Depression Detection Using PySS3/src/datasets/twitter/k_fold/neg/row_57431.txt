I can't stand CTL right nowI'm training for crisis text line and I'm hating some of their rules for helping texters.  They're trying to make me talk like a robot instead of an actual person someone could relate to.  Like you can't talk about yourself even if the texter asks (which makes no sense since we're trying to make them feel less alone).  And you're supposed to mirror back to them how they feel "instead of parroting" but it's still pretty much just parroting in the examples they give because they say how the texter feels right after they do which doesn't add anything.  And you have to give complements that are true but the examples feel so ingenuine ex.:Your willingness to reach out for help is truly inspiring.  I had to watch a  video of an actual CTL conversation and if I was that texter I wouldn't have felt uplifted at all (but that texter did feel better at the end so maybe the people who use CTL are the easiest to help I don't know).  Has anyone used CTL or anything like it and what do you like/not like about it because I want to get them to change their rules.
