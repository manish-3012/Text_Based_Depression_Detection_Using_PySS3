Passively suicidal?Ok so Iâ€™m not really suicidal, as in I donâ€™t have a strong desire to die. But equally, I donâ€™t have a strong desire to live. If thereâ€™s any kind of minor inconvenience I just think oh Iâ€™ll go and off myself then and I find train tracks/roads oddly alluring. I feel like maybe others feel this way? Like not actively trying to die but it feels like a valid option/life path?
