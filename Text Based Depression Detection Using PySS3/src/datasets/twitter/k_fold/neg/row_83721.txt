I want to end my lifeIâ€™m feeling too overwhelm, thereâ€™s a lot of shit in my mind I canâ€™t deal with. I recently got diagnosed with a bunch of mental crap and itâ€™s driving me insane. I donâ€™t want to have that shit, I donâ€™t want to live with this and like this for the rest of my life. I feel like Iâ€™m doomed to be like this forever and it kills me. 
I want to do it, to kill myself, to end all of my suffering, because I fucking canâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™m a burden to everyone around and I just canâ€™t deal with myself, is too tiring. I hate myself way too much. 
I cut myself and took some pills but not enough to kill me, I just need a stronger impulse and take some more and end it now and Iâ€™m afraid I wonâ€™t do it because Iâ€™m a coward.
