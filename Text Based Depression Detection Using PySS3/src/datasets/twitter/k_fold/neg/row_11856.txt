lingering thoughts of suicide.i'm 22 male. i attempted suicide earlier this year by suffocation[being in a air tight room] w/sleeping pills. needless to say i couldn't fall asleep after drinking half a fifth of vodka, handful of klonpin, zyperxa and generic sleeping pills. i don't know how i didn't pass out honestly.

the reason i choose commit suicide is i'm ashamed of my sexual fetish. i have a incest fetish. i'm not attracted to my family at all, it's all porn. the shame then and now is killing me. every time after orgasm, i see the porn as disgusting.

i want to think of myself as not a pervert, but the shame kills me. it's the reason i dream of suicide. 
i've been trying to quit masterbation for years but i always relapse. i don't know how to live with my self. i'm not who i want to be. so i'm considering hanging myself.

any thoughts or help always appreciated
