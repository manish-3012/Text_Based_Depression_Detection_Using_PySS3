I was very close...I looked down at the bottle of Lexapro and wanted to take them all...

My dadâ€™s mom committed suicide when he was young and Iâ€™m now Iâ€™m tied to a life I just donâ€™t want because I would never do that to my dad, but I really wish I was never born. 

My birthday is on Tuesday and I really hope it just stays far away as possible. Life is killing me internally lately and I think Iâ€™m very close to snapping...
