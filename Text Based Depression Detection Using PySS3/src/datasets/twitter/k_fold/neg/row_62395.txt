Bullies are getting to me F14People are blaming and hating on me for no reason. Thereâ€™s a catfish account on instagram with a girl from the US, and iâ€™m from NZ. Theyâ€™re saying that I made the account to get attention and I didnâ€™t. Over the years iâ€™ve made a few internet friends that I really care for and iâ€™m scared that if it spreads more iâ€™m going to have no friends. A lot of people are reposting it in their stories saying â€œTrus a catfishâ€ Iâ€™m really scared, and they said that they have proof. I donâ€™t know how because I wasnâ€™t involved with this at all. I donâ€™t have any proof to show iâ€™m innocent, theyâ€™re just all against me for no reason. I wonâ€™t even be able to use instagram soon. I want to end my life. I have no friends and iâ€™m finding it harder to breathe because of this. Itâ€™s stressing me out
