I'm so fucking tired of feeling like no one is there when I need them.I'm 17. I've got OCD. My parents know I have OCD. They make fun of me for it. They yell at me if I do any of my compulsions because they see it as me being disobedient. They don't see why just telling me not to do them doesn't make me stop.

I'm struggling in school. I can hardly read a page, I never know what's going on, I can't sit still. This is because I have untreated ADHD. Several teachers, doctors, and other people with OCD have told them that I clearly have ADHD, but they won't do anything because they don't want me medicated.

When I need someone there for me most, my best friend starts fucking my ex of a week. They never shut the fuck up about each other. I resent myself because though I love him I just want to see the relationship crash and burn.

I get yelled at for having self esteem issues, after I was bullied for the entirety of my time in primary school.

On the outside I've got it made. I've never had to fear going hungry, or homeless. But sometimes it looks like we might lose everything we've got. And I can't tell anyone or I look ungrateful.

One grandmother is a narcissist, the other has been dead for 19 years. One grandfather is dead but he didn't just fucking die before we could find out he had a secret family. The grandfather I have I love, but how do I tell him I don't feel happy are loved in his sons home.

I'm so fucking tired. I just want to feel loved. It's been so long since I've felt like anyone is there for me. My escape methods don't work anymore. It only gets worse. I can't see it ever getting better. I just want to die, but I'm a fucking coward. I've sat on the edge of about a dozen suicide methods before. Hardly a step or flinch away from ending it. But I'm a massive fucking pussy. I'm afraid it won't work, or I get paranoid that I'll be caught. I just want it to be  over. No one has my back. I'm so fucking tired.
