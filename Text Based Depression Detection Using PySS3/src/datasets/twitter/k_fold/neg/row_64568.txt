cant live with or without herin love with a girl from the internet we've been texting for 8 years never been as close with anyone. Shes loved me on and off in the past. Not anymore according to her.

Ive been so depressed for so long. suicidal forever. but just passively. truth is only reason i havent done it is im a pussy. Anyway long story short i literally dont care or think about anything except being with this girl, but i end up suicidal every few days when she mentions her bf or doesnt say good night to me or tells me to move on. I dont work and i failed school and idk what im doing now except waiting for time to run out. 

tried everything, therapy, meds, drugs, coping skills. more time goes on the worse things get. But i also refuse to stop talking to her. thats even worse. 

cant believe this is my existence. cant believe im not meant for anything after all. so helpless. all i can do is lay here and try not to cry. just chatted with suicide hotline for 2nd time and it made me feel worse. whats the last resort after that
