Iâ€™m tired.Iâ€™m tired of hurting myself and others. Whether it be physically or mentally Iâ€™m just tired of it. Iâ€™m tired of the inevitability that is you canâ€™t live without hurting. Ceasing to exist is the only solution I can muster up. Obviously I donâ€™t want to or else I wouldnâ€™t be here. I know things will get better and blah blah blah. But they will get worse again too. I donâ€™t like the cycle. I donâ€™t like the game. I know ending my life wouldnâ€™t do anything but hurt people far beyond what I can comprehend... so why canâ€™t I get past the idea. The thoughts feel like a song stuck in my head except thereâ€™s no music and no lyrics. Thereâ€™s nothing and itâ€™s on repeat. Fuck Iâ€™m going too deep.
