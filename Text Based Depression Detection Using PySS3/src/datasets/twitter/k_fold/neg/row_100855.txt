Tired of living, afraid of dying. For the past two years I've been having suicidal thoughts due to going through some hard times. The thought of going through with killing myself both comforts and terrifies me at the same time. Has anyone ever felt this way before? I guess I'm just looking for some support, I can't do this on my own anymore. If anyone's willing to lend an ear I'd appreciate it a lot. I'd just rather talk in private messages so that the details aren't out for everyone to see. Thanks for reading 
EDIT: Thank you everyone for the replies; I only expected one or two at most. Even if I didn't pm you (its hard to keep that many conversations going on such a hard topic), your concern and willingness to listen has helped me a great deal.
