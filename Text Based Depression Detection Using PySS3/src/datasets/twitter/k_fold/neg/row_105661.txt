My last words.I have the knife right next to me, and I'm in the bathtub. I should be out of this miserable life in just a few minutes now! I'm going to slit my wrists and let myself bleed out of this sick world. This is it, this is finally it. All the pain has finally come to an end. I hope you all live a better life than I did.


 Goodbye everyone!
