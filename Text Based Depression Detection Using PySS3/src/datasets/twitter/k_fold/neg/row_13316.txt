I feel so out of place.I'm 21. I have no friends and have never been in a relationship. I've tried putting myself out there, but I'm too awkward and idiotic for anyone to want to be around me. I'm constantly embarrassing myself at my job too and it's just exhausting. I know I'm not smart or likeable. I know I'm weird. But feeling endlessly judged and ostracized is just soul crushing.

I make mistakes, I'm human. And I'm sorry. I wish people could just understand. See past my stupidity and see that I'm a good person. I try to be supportive. I try and try to help as much as I can. And go above and beyond to make sure everyone is happy. No matter how hard I try to be good though, I just get fucked endlessly in the end. I'm so tired of hurting and having no one care. I really think I'm done.
