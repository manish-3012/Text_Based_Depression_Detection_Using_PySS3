Terrified of the future. Feeling trapped, hopeless and suicidal.This is going to be a long post, but Iâ€™m in a really bad place. I wonâ€™t go too into the details of my health problems, but for the last 5 and a half years Iâ€™ve dealt with chronic, constant 24/7 ear symptoms, face symptoms and headaches that have turned me into a wreck. I canâ€™t hear things properly. My ears are always blocked and they crackle like broken glass each swallow without fail 24/7. They also frequently hurt immensely with deep earache. Each day is a struggle, but luckily I have always been somewhat of a positive person and have been able to keep myself going with a positive hope that someday, someone will be able to help. 

So far, all the specialists and doctors I have seen have been useless. None have been able to help and I have seen countless and paid thousands. I just completed 8 months of invasive tests and appointments as they thought I had the auto immune disease Vasculitis as a blood test seemed to indicate I could have. After months and months of believing that is what I had, I was finally discharged after being lost on the NHS system for 5 months and not having a follow up appointment. People around me were relieved when I was told that wasnâ€™t what I had before I was discharged, but it was hard to hide my feelings of more despair. I didnâ€™t want anything serious to be wrong, but on the other hand, I just want my life back and felt as though at least I had a diagnosis and a chance of recovery. 

Around the beginning of 2018, around three and a quarter years after the health problems with me flared up in 2014, after a terrible 2017 that had a failed operation that left me crushed and hopeless and a lot of loss in my social life with my friends, I gave into a very strong urge for the first time to have a shower to stop myself from sinking into a deep depression. After that, the showers became my way of coping and OCD has taken hold. Sometimes, I will take 4-5 showers per day and wash my hands countless times just to keep my mental state buoyant as I deal with the constant physical symptoms. It was manageable at first as it focused on my physical symptoms, but around the end of 2018 it shifted to a deep mental trauma from my past and relentlessly focused on that. 

The OCD got worse and the combination of that and the physical symptoms left me extremely low. The last three days have been hell as I have finally, for the first time ever, opened up to people about this trauma. It has been eating me up, but I know I need to get it out in the open. However, this has just made the OCD even worse and has convinced me history is going to repeat itself and now it happening again is inevitable. 

In all, things are extremely, extremely tough right now and Iâ€™m just looking for guidance from anyone, or even a friendly soul to help me through.
