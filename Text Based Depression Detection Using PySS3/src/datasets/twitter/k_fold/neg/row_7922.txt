Speaking honestlyI feel like I canâ€™t tell anyone what goes on in my head. I always have to edit myself before I speak. Iâ€™ve tried being honest before and I lost those friends. I even lost a therapist. My friends always tell me I can talk to them if I need to, but I am too scared to do that. Nobody knows how to handle me. Thatâ€™s what my mom told me tonight, though I already knew that. And she said that everyone is in over their heads with me. And when people I love â€œgo quietâ€ itâ€™s because they donâ€™t know how to respond to what Iâ€™m going through. Yeah. I know. They go quiet because theyâ€™re getting ready to leave. I am tired of being abandoned. It seems that reddit is the only place I can speak my mind these days. Even then, itâ€™s not like anyone actually reads the shit I post. Iâ€™m ready for it all to be over.
