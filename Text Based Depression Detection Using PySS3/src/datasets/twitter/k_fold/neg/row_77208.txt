I feel like I am drowning and I just don't have the strength to fight it anymore.Long story, shortened version: I've been staying with friends for the last six months after I broke up with my ex-fiancee. Pretty much lost everything after that breakup. Finally found a job, did that for three months. Got fired last week for something stupid. Boyfriend of 5 months has given up on me completely, now won't even return my texts, and he was pretty much the only person I could talk to or spend time with. My roommates are now going their separate ways, so I have to leave here soon, but I have nowhere else to go/turn to (parents are dead, what other friends I have don't understand at all). 

I'm 31 and have absolutely nothing to show for myself. Not a dumb job, a relationship, nothing. I have nothing left to hope for or strive for. I am so tired of being in pain and struggling for nothing. And I keep wishing I owned a gun so I could end this bullshit once and for all. I am drowning and I can't even bring myself to fight it.
