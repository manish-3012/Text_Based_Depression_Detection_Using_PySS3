My girlfriend is seriously contemplating suicideIâ€™m just afraid itâ€™s too late. She has to babysit 3 kids that arenâ€™t even hers, she is recovering from an eating disorder which is causing a lot of depression, mood swings, binge eating (which of course lowers her self-confidence) and school on top of that. Most of these are all at the same time. Her suicidal thoughts come in waves, sometimes sheâ€™s happy but every once in awhile she gets suicidal again. It used to be once every few days, then once a day, and now itâ€™s a few times every day. She thinks of sleep as an escape from life, but at night she doesnâ€™t want to go to sleep because sheâ€™s afraid of waking up the next day and having to be alive. Iâ€™ve also suffered from suicidal thoughts and have tried to commit suicide before but I surprisingly canâ€™t help her with these thoughts, itâ€™s like anything I do is just useless. She goes on Omegle sometimes trying to find people that can make her feel better, and sometimes it works, but Iâ€™m so scared that nothings going to be able to change her mind eventually. She told me that sheâ€™s not afraid of dying anymore and it scares me, sheâ€™s the only one I have and I canâ€™t imagine her not being here anymore. I just want to be able to comfort her again
