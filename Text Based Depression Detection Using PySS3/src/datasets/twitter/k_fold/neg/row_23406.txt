I dont have anyone to talk toIm slowly cutting people off of my life.
I just broke up with my bf. No conversation. I just sent a goodbye message and blocked him in every platform.
I left a groupchat of highschool bestfriends.
I rarely talk to college friends.
And with the pandemic, im not allowed to go outside so that helps with not meeting or talking to other people besides my aunt who i live with and with my dad who visits.

Im cutting off the people in my life because they keep getting in the way of my suicide plans. I know they love me. So its hard to just disappear. But im really tired.

I tried opening up to my aunt about how I feel. But what she said was true but hurts me because i asked for help but instead i felt worse. She said that I have to count my blessings. Think of the other people who are poor and have nothing. Now i feel like its selfish to be sad. I have no right to be sad. She means well. But i guess she just doesnt understand. 

Im just feel like a heavy burden on everybodys life. Ive tried so many times to kill myself. But i just couldnt do it. But now im taking the right steps. Im so tired. I just want my life to end.
