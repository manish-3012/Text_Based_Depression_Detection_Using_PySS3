I'm really sick of life and want to die butI can't convince myself to kill myself I don't know why I can't do it I keep trying but I can't do it I'm really sick of living but something is stopping me from killing myself. I just want to die. I'm sick of being a waster of space and life. Please just let me die why can't I do it?
