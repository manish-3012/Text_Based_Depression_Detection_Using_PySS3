First time thinking of plans, my brain is starting to scare meI don't know what to do anymore. There's so many terrible things going on in the world, and on top of that, I see some of the first friendships among my college friends dissolving, and just. I don't know. I don't want to die. I'm scared of dying. But I don't know what else can stop this pain. I didn't even think, "alright, time to come up with some plans", they were just intrusive thoughts. I'm not including any details because 1) The last thing I could possibly want is to act on any of them. It hurts so fucking bad, but I still wanna live, and I don't think that's going to ever change, and 2) I don't wanna be identified and 302'd 

In any case, if any of you could point me in the direction of a good clinic/counseling center near Philly, Pennsylvania, I would seriously appreciate it. Fly safe, and come home soon, cosmonauts
