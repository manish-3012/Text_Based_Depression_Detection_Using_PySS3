Not really sure what my deal is.I don't think I'm depressed. Not really sure how it works, but I'm kind of done If that makes any sense. 

This past semester of school has just been, weird, any time I get an assignment I feel overwhelmed, even though it's no different from any previous semester. I failed my first math test, I haven't started my senior project, behind in everything else. I want to get caught up, but I just have no desire to do anything. I live at home (community college) and have a life I'm sure many others would kill for, but still. 

As cringe as it sounds, I've been pointing our .357 at my skull and dry firing it. I hate the idea of my family and friends having to deal with the fallout, but I really can't see a future for myself. 

I'm not going to do anything but I thought I post because why not.
