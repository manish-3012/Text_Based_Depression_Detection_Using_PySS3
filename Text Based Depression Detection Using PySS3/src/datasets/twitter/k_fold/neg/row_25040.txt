why should i go on?give me a single reason why i shouldnâ€™t lay on the train tracks right now and let myself be torn apart.

i donâ€™t care about love. i prefer being alone. the thought of someone loving me makes me sick to my stomach.

i donâ€™t care about success. iâ€™ve never accomplished anything. iâ€™ve only ever failed. i have no talent, no worth.

i donâ€™t care about my family. iâ€™ve only been hurt by them. iâ€™ve been called ugly and a failure by my own father more times than i can count.

all i have is empathy and that has hurt me again and again and again because i canâ€™t say â€œno.â€ 

i canâ€™t say anything that has a chance to upset anyone so i lie and make up excuses and reasons because i donâ€™t want to hurt anyoneâ€™s feelings.

but iâ€™m done with it. i canâ€™t take it anymore. iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts and urges since i was 6. 

12 years of wanting to kill myself every single day. iâ€™m tired. i want to die.
