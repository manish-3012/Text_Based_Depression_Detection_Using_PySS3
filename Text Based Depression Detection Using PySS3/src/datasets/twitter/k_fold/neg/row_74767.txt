I'm done with collegeI can't have a major. The only majors worth anything these days are stem. I'm fucked. I'm destined to be in a job I hate because I can't make any money doing anything humanities related. It's like a bad dream that I'm realizing now. The truth is I'll never be an actualizrd person. Why suffer through the rest of college or the rest of my life like this ?
