Nobody gives a dammn if I'm alive or deadit just hurts to see people avoiding contact with me, I have an example from today: so yesterday the person that I care the most about and is the biggest between me and suicide sent me a text asking if I'm free to talk at 9am. Now I usually wake up at 11 so I asked if 9:30 could also work, she said "what difference does 30 min has? It's like you have something to do during the quarantine, So I said ok 9am. So I wake early for the first time in a while and at 8:55 I sent her a text "your there?".
She replied at 11am "ohh I just woke up"...
Like wtf am I supposed to answer that?? 
And I've been thinking, if this is how the closest person to me treats me, then nobody gives a fuck if I'm dead or not.
