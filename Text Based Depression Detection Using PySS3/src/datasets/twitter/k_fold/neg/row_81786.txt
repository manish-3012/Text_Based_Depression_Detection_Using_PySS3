I dont know what to do anymoreHello, new user here, just came in to say that i just dont know what to do with my life anymore.

Im a 18 years old white guy born, raised and currently living in Venezuela, and i think i cant escape from here, i have poor health, no money, physically weak, no skills whatsoever and everybody i met tells me that im essensialy an unmanly good for nothing that only leeches off my family, right now all i want is to be alone, at ease, just wanna rest and never wake up, dont even care about all the hate im gonna get.

But i want to live, i want to work, fight, play, love, learn, do something. But i cant, not where i live, not in my state and surely not surrounded by people who obviously consider me less than a vermin.

What i should do ? I wanna live but i think there is just no more chances
