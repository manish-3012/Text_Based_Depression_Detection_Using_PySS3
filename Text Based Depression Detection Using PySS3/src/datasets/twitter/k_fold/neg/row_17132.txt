I really need somebody to talk to right nowI'm lonely as fuck and desperate for anybody to talk to. Struggling big time tonight. 

I think I'm in an abusive relationship which I entered way to early after ending the previous one lasting 14 years. I have big troubles communication with my current partner which result in him storming out, leaving me for hours and even days without contact. It makes me  suicidal  and unable to think about anything else. I'm in a therapy for two months, but it's not really working (at all or yet). I'm out of ideas what to do. Tonight feels like end of that relationship, I feel defeated. 

I tried calling some mental help hotlines but I can't reach anybody there. I don't know if I'm not breaking any rules by posting this here and I'm sorry if I am. I just really need somebody to talk to I guess. I don't even know exactly what I'm expecting. This is very out of character for me...  I've never posted on reddit before, even tho I've been lurking for like 7 years or so. This is obviously a throwaway.
