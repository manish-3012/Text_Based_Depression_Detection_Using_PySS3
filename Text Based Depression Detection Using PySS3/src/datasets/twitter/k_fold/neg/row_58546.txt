I honestly think I'm going to kill myself if I don't pass my finalsI have had finals in my college like two weeks ago which will decide wether or not I'm going to graduate or drop out and fail depending on my grades. And I honestly think that If I fail and have to drop out that I'm going to commit suicide. If I fail it's honestly basically over for me. I won't find a good job because no one wants to employ some college drop out slob job, which means I'm going to have to slave away at some profession that I'm guaranteed to fucking hate. I have made some research and literally every job that is avaible around here has crushing working hours, is ass and pays like shit.
Not to speak of that my parents are going to be dissappointed as fuck, which I'm honestly most afraid of. I can't bare to have them look at me like that any longer.
