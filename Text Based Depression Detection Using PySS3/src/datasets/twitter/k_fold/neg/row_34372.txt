A voice no one wants to hearI fear I have nothing left. Maybe it's just cowardice keeping me alive, too frightened of the process of committing suicide to carry it out. But... it's becoming all I can think of. I just spent 30 minutes inside my own head, assaulting a pharmacist to get sleeping pills. I'm miserable, and I can't keep going on this way.

I was a victim of abuse by my father, hidden under a layer of "discipline". I was a victim of bullying and violence in school, from the first grade all the way to the last. (Being a nerdy, introverted, shy little boy made me an extremely easy target.) I was also a victim of sexual assault as an adult, in the workplace. Rather than believe me, I was shunned, my rights trodden, and made to feel like a leper until I quit. Since then I haven't been able to hold down a job (eight years and counting). I have never had a relationship with a woman beyond the myriad friend zones, and a total of two sexual encounters (both with the same woman, who was married and only wanted me because her husband was not interested in sex). When I reached out to the only person I thought I could trust, I was told that if I didn't want to "pull up your socks and help yourself, there's nothing I can do for you" (my mother's words).

When I went to the Depression subreddit to pour my heart out, thinking someone might just care enough to say something. Even if it's "I understand"... but no one did.

I don't want to do this any more. It hurts so much to drag all this weight around with me, and be told that it's me to blame. I guess I have to choose between living in agony or dying in agony.
