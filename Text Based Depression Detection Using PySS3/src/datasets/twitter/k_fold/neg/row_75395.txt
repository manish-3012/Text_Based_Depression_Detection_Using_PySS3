I feel like my life is wasted potential.Unlike many people here(don't mean to brag or bully) I have some opportunities to be happy and get a healthy relationship and make new friends and enjoy life but I have been so traumatized by a previous experience of love that I have no desire to even try it again.

Yesterday a girl said to me that I'm lovely, I almost took it as an insult and just said haha and went away. Another girl tried to be my friend but I don't want to because I'm too scared to make any new friends. 

I have been suicidal for almost a year now and my life is literally an inside joke. 

Also my grades are going to shit, I was 2 years ago almost a straight A student but I don't any motivation to care about my future because I honestly don't think I'll ever have one. 

This isn't even a cry for help but I don't want to scrap this because I took like 5 minutes to write this. I don't even want to be saved and when I'm going to kill myself I will not tell anybody.
