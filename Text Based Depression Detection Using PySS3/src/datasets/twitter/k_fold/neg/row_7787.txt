It's time to goI'm not a good person and I have a tendency to hurt the people I care about without noticing. I'm done with life now it's too hard I gave it my best shot and it's just not going to work out. I just don't feel like I have the strength to live a full life and maybe Im just not cut out for life.
Oh well
