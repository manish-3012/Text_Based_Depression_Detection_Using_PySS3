Suicide has become a recurring thought but I'm honestly afraid of ruining my family forever by taking my own life. My nephew is almost 3 and would wonder about me one day, everyone else would just blame themselves for every little thing until they die. But I don't know how much longer I can go on.I am a mess right now, an alcoholic and pothead that can't keep a job or escape poverty. I feel haunted by my past, a life full of trouble and dishonesty with a facade of decency and kindness. I don't want to drink or smoke anymore, tired of feeling intoxicated just to get by day-to-day.

I know some part of me is genuinely remorseful for all the damage I've caused others though. I want to feed that part of me and starve the rest. I am tired of feeling like two different people, one around people and one when no one is around. 

I've had a 'wake up call' and know that I either change at the root level to become an honest human being in every way or I will only make a bigger and bigger mess out of my already overwhelming life situation.

Please help me by taking a few minutes of your time. I haven't struggled this much in my life in a long time, maybe ever. As I get older, I feel more and more hopeless every time I crash and burn and have to start over. I am tired of hurting people who love me because I can't for the life of me just be a normal and functional adult.
