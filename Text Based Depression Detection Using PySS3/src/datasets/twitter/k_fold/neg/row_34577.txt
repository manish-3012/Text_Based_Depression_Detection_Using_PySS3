My note, this is my last stop before sending itI donâ€™t know why you never loved me. I donâ€™t know why you get crazy after every couple of weeks. I donâ€™t know why you canâ€™t treat me and xxxx the same. Iâ€™m old. Iâ€™m tired. I hate my life for what you and daddy did to it. When I was little I used to think I could run away from it as I got older, but now I know the damage youâ€™ve done will shape me for the rest of my life. I will know I wasnâ€™t even special to my parents. I was your first born, but that was never enough to love me. Iâ€™ve lived my life so you two would one day treat me well, but now that Iâ€™m at the end of the journey I see there never was an end to my struggle. So Iâ€™m choosing to end it. Now. Whatâ€™s the point of suffering at my new job to make you proud when Iâ€™m so twisted and hurt on the inside? I canâ€™t make it better and I canâ€™t get away.

By the time you read this, Iâ€™ll be dead.
