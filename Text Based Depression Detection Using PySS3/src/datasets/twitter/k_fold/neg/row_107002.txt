Help for friend in Sweden who is contemplating suicide, and refuses to get help.I have been friends with him for over five years on Steam, and he has seemed to get more and more  depressed. I've asked him to get help many times, but he keeps refusing, citing his mistrust of people. He mentioned commiting suicide within two weeks, and I'm not sure if he actually will, but I can't just let him live like this, I have to do something. I know his name, and the name of his brother, but I can't seem to contact anyone in Sweden, and I am not sure who to call.
