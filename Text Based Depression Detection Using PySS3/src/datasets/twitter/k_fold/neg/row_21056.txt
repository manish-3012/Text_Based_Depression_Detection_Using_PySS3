Well, I've successfully estranged and insulted all but two people in my life, but I can sense them starting to pull away. I do not enjoy life.I really do try every day to be nice and courteous and thoughtful in every way I can, and people just look at me like I have three heads. I scare people, I always have. Every person in my middle school class admitted thinking that I was going to bring a gun or something to kill people, but the only thing I try to hate is hate itself. 

I feel no sense of purpose, I feel no justification for consuming precious resources. My greatest fear is being normal or mediocre or average at the end of my life; I want to be celebrated someday for something worthwhile long after I am dead. Unfortunately I seemed destined for just that which I fear, for my talents are lacking in important fields. 

I feel that I should simply die. I have felt this way almost every single day, for the last 12 years. It gets worse everyday. Nothing eases the longing for death, and I've tried almost everything. I literally thirst for suicide about every thirty minutes. I'll find myself going into a thousand yard stare, enveloped in thoughts of death and despair. I just don't see a point in life unless you're doing something great, but even then life seems like a void people try to fill with things to make their lives seem full, but really we all know that's silly and pointless regardless of your faith. 

Life has never, and will never be good for me, yet I can't bring myself to kill myself... I loath myself deeply for my hesitance. I just hate the fact that my father's sperm met my mother's egg. 

Is there a way to be put under an induced coma for a very long time? I cannot kill myself, but I cannot bear to experience life any further.
