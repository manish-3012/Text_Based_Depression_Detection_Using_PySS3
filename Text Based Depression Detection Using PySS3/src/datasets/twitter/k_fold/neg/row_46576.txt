Iâ€™m terrified of the futureI donâ€™t have much to complain about in my current life.  Thereâ€™s some things about it that I wish were better, like having more friends. But the state of the World seriously terrifies me.  I feel like, I just donâ€™t want to be around in 2030, 2040.  It feels like weâ€™re living during the collapse of human civilization.  And so I think about suicide constantly.
