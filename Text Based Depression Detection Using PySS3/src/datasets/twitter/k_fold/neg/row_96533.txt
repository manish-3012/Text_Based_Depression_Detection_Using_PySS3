sickI feel like the only way I can go through with all this therapy is to eliminate drugs from my life completely. I haven't had a sober day for almost 3 years now. the meds they keep giving me make me feel like something I'm not, while drugs help me hang on to who I am. I can't give drugs up because I'm scared of what is "real" and I'm scared of what my life will be like totally sober and hypnotized by meds. I don't want to lose ahold of myself because it's all I know. it's who i am.
