I wish I would stop failing.I have tried so hard for so long to get better. Nothing works, I go to therapy, I take medicine, I learn coping skills but it's never enough.

I tell everyone I'm struggling, my boyfriend tells me not to threaten him with suicide but I'm not threatening him, the thoughts would be there even if he wasn't in my life. I don't want him to leave me but I don't want him to feel like he is stuck with me.

Everyone is tired of me and doesn't want to deal with me anymore. My boyfriend doesn't think I am trying because I still have breakdowns. I'm never good enough. I'm trying so desperately to hold on but he's already let go, and I can't hold on anymore, and I know nobody is going to hold onto me, nobody wants to deal with me or this because it's ugly and turns me into a lonely miserable person. Why would anyone want to save something so horrible.



I don't deserve to be here. If I was significant people would care. I keep trying but I'm never able to finish it. I need to try harder. Last night I could even keep the bag on my head while I suffocated. I panicked and ripped it open when I couldn't unwrap the cord fast enough. I'm so sad it didn't work. I need to find better ways of stop being such a coward. I don't even know why I ripped it off. I still wanted to die after but I panicked.its only a few minutes so why can't I even manage that.

The only hope I have is that I can do it soon. People talk about realizing they don't want to die when they try to commit suicide but that didn't happen. I wish so badly that I had a gun, or some way for it to quickly happen. I don't want a way that gives people time to find out and change my mind, or stop me.
