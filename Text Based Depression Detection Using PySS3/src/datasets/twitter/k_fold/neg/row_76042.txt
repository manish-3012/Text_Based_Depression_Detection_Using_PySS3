people will ruin my life if I try to take my lifeAnytime i feel extremely suicidal, it's always the same threats with the police and hospitalizations. and fuck, I'm even ignored most of the time. what point is there in me being alive? im literally just wasting resources and feel miserable every day. I hate that my life turned into this. I hate my friends who tried to "fix" things and just made it worse then abandoned me. I just want to fucking die. 

I just need people to hang out with or talk to. It's the most effective thing for me since no one wants to help with my situation. Yet I can't even get that. I'm just alone.
