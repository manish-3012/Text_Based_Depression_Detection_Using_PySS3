Life doesn't work so I'm fixing the problem by killing myself. Life isn't something I signed up for. No one relies on me to be here. I'm just a problem that stands in everyone's way. If I was worth anything or special in anyway people would give me a chance to prove myself. That's not how life worked for me. I guess there had to be someone that was shoved to the ground and held there. There's not enough in this world to go around for all of us. I'm sorry I took up space. I'm sorry I even talked to you people. I know some of you pretend to care because you are socially obligated to do so but you don't have to fake it with me. I get it, it's loud and clear. 

I'm going to remove me from the equation tonight. Life is just not working for me anymore. Maybe one day it would have gotten better but the time required to get there is unsatisfactory. When a racehorse breaks it's leg you shoot it in the head to put it out of it's misery. I want the same thing done to me. I'm leaving this world one way or another tonight so good buy. I would just like that thank the people in r/depression for at least pretending to care. I just can't do this for one more day. It has to end now.
