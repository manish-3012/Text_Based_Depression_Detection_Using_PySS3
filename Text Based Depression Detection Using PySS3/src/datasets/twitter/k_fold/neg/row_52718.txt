I was really close to kill myself todayToday was pretty uneasy
I'm having suicidal thoughts since I'm ~10yo with some good and bad times and theses days I can't stop thinking about my death or cutting (1 month clean)

Today, I almost throw me and my car over a bridge
At the moment all I could feel was the need to be done
If my SO wasn't in the car with me I'll be dead right now
I needed to tell someone that I almost lost the few control I have

I don't know what to do, every time I'm trying to get help it's ending wrong
I'm stuck
