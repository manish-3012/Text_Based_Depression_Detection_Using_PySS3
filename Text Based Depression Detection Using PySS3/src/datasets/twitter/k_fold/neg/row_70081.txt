I pray I just sleep forever.Having surgery on Monday and I hope I don't wake up. I know chances are low, but I'd rather die than wake up in tremendous pain. I am so scared of the procedure and it feels like I have no choice in whether I go through with it. I have been bleeding and in pain for a long 21 months. I don't have much hope that this will even fix anything.
