adviceBarely finished high-school, lying to parents friends teachers that everything was okey, long discussions about deep self-problems. Got through that, went to college, dropped out after a month for reasons I still can't think were, lied to parents. Went again for a 2nd try, same thing - lied to parents for months, again, saying I'm doing good. 

Just told them I failed again, hardest part was the lies, they've said it repeatedly and said it again - they can't trust me, everything I say might be a lie. I have nothing besides home, I wake up, eat, surf net, do nothing, sleep, repeat (used to fake "going to school", actually hanging in malls / gym). No friends, no social activity outside internet/computer games.
I understand that I can change myself, but no matter what I try it's not enough, I just can't do anything, I don't know how, simply do not know how....

At first I didn't think about it, but the more time passes the more it comes into mind, several times a day lately. I don't know, there's nothing for me.
