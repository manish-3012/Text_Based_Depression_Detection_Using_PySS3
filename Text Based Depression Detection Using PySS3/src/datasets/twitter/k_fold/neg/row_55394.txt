It's all my faultIt's 8pm. I am laying in my bad. Just had a huge fight with my mom. Now I can hear her talking to my dad about just how dumb and useless I am. It's been a week since I got home from the hospital which I got into due to a drug overdose. They know I have anxiety. They don't understand. No one does.

I tought I had people I could lean on,people I could trust..But now,after just three weeks of me beign in the hospital,they found someone else.They don't take a couple minutes of their time to talk to me.

I got replaced,and hurt everyone around me..It hurts,and I can't take this anymore.

I don't see a point in this anymore..I am done.Everyone will be better off without me.

If you are reading this after what's about to happen,I am sorry for everything I did to you.

So sorry
