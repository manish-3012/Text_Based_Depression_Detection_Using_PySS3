I just don't want to be a part of this earth.I'm not sad, miserable or angry.

I live a pretty privileged life in the grand scheme of things. I have a great, supportive family. My mental health is so crippling though I just don't want to be a part of this world anymore. I've always felt like an alien, like I've lived before and I'm at the end of my road on earth. I am transgender. My family paid for my transition surgery. I have mental and physical issues but I've always been supported through it. But I am so scared of everything.

I had an awful acid trip at the beginning of this year and I haven't been the same since. I was diagnosed with PTSD because of it. It has made me completely aware of my own existence to a point where I'm just completely stuck in my own head. I have extreme, heart pounding anxiety every day. I had to get an ECG scan three times because I thought it was heart related. I feel like I'm in a simulation 24/7 and it's extremely terrifying. I feel like that experience ruined my life forever.

I don't want to live like this, having all this existential dread.. I don't want to be a part of this world, I didn't sign up to this. I don't want to die because I'm miserable with my life, I want to die because I don't want to operate within this world anymore. It's so hard to explain but I just wanted to let it out.
