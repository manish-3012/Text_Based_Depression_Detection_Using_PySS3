I'm not suicidal, but I think about it every day.I think about how I don't want to live everyday.  And every hour in the day.  The thing is i'm not particularly sad about anything.  Sometimes i'm happy as fuck, but I still wish I wasn't alive.  Other times I am really depressed, and I ask myself why I dont just go through with it.  I just don't see the point in living.  Even looking at it like "why not live".  I just don't care. 

 I don't want to exist and I didn't ask to.  I can't commit suicide because I don't want to hurt my family, but I feel like one day that won't stop me.  

But isn't it selfish of them to want me to stay alive even though I don't want too?  I have always had these thoughts in my head.  Even when I was really young. 

I don't even know what i'm looking for, maybe someone will see something I don't.   Also I don't do any drugs :D, don't even smoke.  Sometimes I drink, but who doesn't.  Life is a game, and I don't want to play.  I don't want to hit reset, I wan't to hit power, and just, stop, playing.
