I dont know what to do, I just want to end my life.Today I couldn't sleep again ( Insomnia ). I was thinking about my life, about my GF and this shitty situation in our relationship. I feel like I don't love her anymore, it's like first love when you are teenager, At first you can't see you'r life without her, but after amount of time, this feeling just goes away. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. But she is still love me and I dont want to hurt her, but I also cant lie her in the face that I love her too... I'm so depressed. I hate myself so much. Right now I sitting next to my brother's gun and I don't see any other way out except suicide.

P.S. I'm sorry for my awful English
