I will never be good enough.I will never be better than my siblings in my parents eyes, I will never be anyone's best friend, I will never be good enough for a girl to date. Even if one did, her ex's would all be superior to me. Taller, more attractive, bigger dick. All I can do is die, and let everyone who knows me forget about me. Someone like me should never have existed.
