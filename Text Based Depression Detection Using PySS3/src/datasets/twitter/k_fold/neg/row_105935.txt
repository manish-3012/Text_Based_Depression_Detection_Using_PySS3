How do you cope when it gets worse?It's strange how rapidly depression can pull you back from making any progress. Yesterday was the first time in a while that I felt not only normal,  but also content. Today, I feel I made a step foward just to take a leap back. I won't share details, but despite my efforts to 'improve' I am still struggling to get through the day. It seems only in utopia can a person find temporary solace.
