Carbon Monoxide SuicideIâ€™ve been wanting to kill my self since i was 12 never had the balls tho, i used to pray and wish a lot for god to kill me before i made it to 25, today iâ€™m 24 and things did got worse with time, i got nothing and no one, everyone has walked away from me everyone i ever help, everyone i ever supported, everyone who ever said that love me, they just left, i got no skills, no talent, no one who really loves me, i wish i knew why they all left me, why everyone avoids me like the plague.

I give up, i walked as far as i could i try but i guess some of us are just made to be numbers in a chart, i check the price for a garage exhaust hose and some thermal industrial duct tape, and i decided to buy it but i was wondering if its possible to die with a newer car i drive a nissan altima 2015 if it helps, i also though about hyperventilating and blocking the carotid veins with a belt, if someone could answer me would be nice, thank you for the time and sorry for the trouble.
