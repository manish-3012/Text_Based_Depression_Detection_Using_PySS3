I give up.Iâ€™m so... empty. I have a life that many would want and know that I would probably want too if I werenâ€™t in my position. Iâ€™m an immigrant who made it in America. I have a nice car, very good job, a loving husband and a dog. Iâ€™ve achieved all this through hard work and dedication. 
All my family is back in my home country. 

My childhood was never happy. I grew up with a military dad, everything was an order, everything had to be done his way, I was stupod, worthless, disrespected and my mom as well. Long story short, he killed the happy soul that I had and turned me into this bitter, sad and hopeless woman. I channel all my anger towards my husband who doesnâ€™t deserve it. When I think about my job I tell myself that I donâ€™t deserve it. When I look at my car Iâ€™m telling myself *who the hell was so fucking stupid to lend me money*. When I look my husband in the eyes I say to myself *i know Iâ€™m fucked up and I will never give you the happiness you deserve because I cannot get over my past. I am beyond repairable and I canâ€™t see any way out of it. Iâ€™m drowning.â€ 


I hate you dad. I hate you and I hope you suffer as much from my death as I did suffering fron your behavior all these years. I hope you will apologize to my husband and his family for me. I hope you will come to your senses and realize how fragile a child is and how easily you can fuck him up. 

Husband, please take care of the dogs and marry someone who is mentally stable and makes you happy. You donâ€™t deserve a sad soul next to you. 

Goodbye.
