Soon it'll be all overHere I go again well it's been a week since my parents told me that their getting a divorce after 35 years. It's kind of my fault that it's happening. My relatives have been suffering as for me I can't show any type of emotions at all. I've shut everyone off including my wife. As soon as the divorce is official I plan on going through with killing myself by either jumping off the Golden Gate bridge or killing myself with the Glock 19 I recently bought. My suicide notes have already been written as well as taking care of my life insurance policy to include suicide. I'm not afraid of dying as a matter of fact I'm embracing it with open arms.
