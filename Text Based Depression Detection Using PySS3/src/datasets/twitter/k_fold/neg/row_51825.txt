Last MessageThere's this one person I care a lot about.

I suppose you could call her a friend. We used to text every day for a long time but are currently no longer on speaking terms. It was my fault it ended like that. It's been a couple months since we've had contact but I still think about her every day. She was by far the most important person in my life for about two years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm torn on whether or not to send her a message. Not to engage in conversation, but just to give us both some form of closure before I kill myself. Intertwined friend circles mean she'd find out sooner rather than later. Contents of the message would include an apology and gratitude for everything she did.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want her to panic or even be aware of how I've been feeling lately, so I think the best way might be a delayed text or some kind of note/letter that gets delivered after I'm gone.

The only other people that'd be affected by my death are my parents. I've already come to grips with that and have a sealed envelope ready to go.

I assume some of you might've been on the other end of this, so I would love your ideas/advice on the friend situation. Try to talk? Delayed message? Nothing at all?
