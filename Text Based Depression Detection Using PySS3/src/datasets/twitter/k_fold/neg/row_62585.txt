It would be such a waste.Every time I think of giving up, as much as I want to, I just feel such pain at the thought of what a waste all this would be. Iâ€™ve been driving myself to exhaustion trying so hard to do my best. It feels premature to discard it all. But why am I even kidding myself? Itâ€™s not like this will result in anything later, either. Iâ€™ll be the same worthless person in a few years time. So maybe it isnâ€™t a waste at all to nip it in the bud and slip away from life now.
