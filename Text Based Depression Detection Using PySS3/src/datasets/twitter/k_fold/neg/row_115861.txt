Life crumbling. Want to die before I'm alone again.My life is absolutely falling apart at the moment. I thought everything was getting better, but then my dad, who has helped me in life more than i could ever say, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. It doesn't look good for him and now, my mother has some pre-cancerous cells as well. Now, my wonderful long term girlfriend is leaving me. She is the love of my life and I would not hesitate to call her my soul mate. I know for a fact I will NEVER find anyone like her. My social anxiety makes it miserable to go to class, let alone make friends. So I've gone from feeling optimistic about life to feeling like it's over. I don't want to be completely alone again. Soon I will have absolutely no one and I can't deal with that. Every reason I had to wake up is gone. Help.
