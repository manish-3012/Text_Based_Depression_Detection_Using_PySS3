I'm an over privileged "child"Long story short, I've already been given everything in my life. Great parents, opportunities, etc. Yet, I'm still subject to life. I feel like I'm a drama queen, but I'm not interested in attention. I just want the pain to stop, and I know I am the reason for all my problems. My negligence, stupidity, etc have facilitated my current situation. I'm just trying to stop the pain. I believe I am the source. No need for positive reinforcement. Just looking for a way out, optimally.
