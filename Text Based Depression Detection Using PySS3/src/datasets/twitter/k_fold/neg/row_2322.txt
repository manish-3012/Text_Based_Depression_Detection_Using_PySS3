Nobody ever gives me the chance to be their friend. Over and over.For the umpteenth time in a row, I've been ghosted while trying to make friends with someone. It sucks because all the time me and the other person will connect and bond easily only for them to flat out ignore and ghost me all the sudden. I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong? I respect boundaries and give them breathing room, ask them about themselves without being too personal, be friendly, funny, and not too depressing. 

I've got no friends as it is and each time this fucking happens its one step closer to the end for me. I'm trying to make it out of this social hellhole I'm in but noone can lets me a chance.
