Every day, I have to consciously decide not to kill myself.And every day, it gets harder and harder to make that decision. Every day, I have to find a reason not do it. And my reasons vanish every day.

I have nothing to show for my life, I'm cripplingly lonely, and my hopes and dreams will just be that. Dreams.

I don't know why I bother getting out of bed. I'll either accomplish nothing, accomplish something that might as well have been nothing because I'm too fucking lazy to maintain that accomplishment. I know I'm a lazy, incompetent fuck-up, and yet, everything I have/haven't done has suggested that I am unable or unwilling to fix that. And I've either failed everything I've ever tried, or I scraped by so closely that I didn't deserve to succeed at all.

And here I am. Another jerk who wants to off himself.
