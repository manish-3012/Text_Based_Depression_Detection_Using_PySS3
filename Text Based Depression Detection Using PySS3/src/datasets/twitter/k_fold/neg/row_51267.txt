what's stopping me from running off and finding a way to get myself killed tonightI've got nothing in life. my face is deformed I'm awkward and mentally ill I've pretty much dropped out of high school. I haven't had a friend in 8 years and it feels like my parents don't care about me. I have no future. 

it's a really warm December night. I could easily just run off and try to find a way to keep myself. train maybe. I wish I had a gun. there's nothing in life for me except suffering.
