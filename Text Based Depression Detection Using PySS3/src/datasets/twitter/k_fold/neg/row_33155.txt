Why is ending YOUR own life frowned upon?Idk, I just don't get it. If I'm only taking my own life and making that decision because I believe it's the best outcome for me, who's to tell me that's not okay?

I understand there is an emotional impact on those around me (at least the very few that would actually care). But if I'm always told "make yourself happy" or "do what's in your best interest" then why shouldn't I just end it?
