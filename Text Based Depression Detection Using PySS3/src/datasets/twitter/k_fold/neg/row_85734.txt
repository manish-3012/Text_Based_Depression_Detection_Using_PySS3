I drove 100 miles to a bridge, the closest one where there is absolutely zero chance of survival, I just need a push.Spout mindless platitudes about how life is worth living, because I'm literally the dumbest person on the planet who is completely unaware of the fact that people can be happy under the right circumstances. I think that will seal the deal.
