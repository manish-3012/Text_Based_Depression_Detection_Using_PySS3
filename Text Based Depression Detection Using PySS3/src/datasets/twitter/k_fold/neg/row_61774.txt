I don't really know anymoreI don't really know what I'm doing here but I don't have anywhere else to go. I'm a 20, almost 21 year old University student in England, in my normal life I'm outgoing, fairly confident and happy. As with most students, and where I am from I go drinking a fair amount. 

Right now I'm drunk, it's 4am and I've just gotten home, and to be honest I want to die. I get like this a lot when I have been drinking and sometimes when I'm not and I don't know what's going on. I feel incredibly lonely like I have no one to talk to and honestly it makes me not want to exist. I always present myself as being strong and self assured however when I get like this I just weep uncontrollably and don't want to be here.

I honestly don't know what to do, I have no one to talk to, I hate admitting I'm sad but at this point I have no choice. 

I'm told I have a lot to live for but at this rate I don't know wether I can reach my 21st. I don't have anything to continue for right now. I hope someone is here.
