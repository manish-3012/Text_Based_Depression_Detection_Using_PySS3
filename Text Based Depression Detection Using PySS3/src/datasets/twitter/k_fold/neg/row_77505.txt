I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore but Iâ€™m too much of a coward to kill myself.Iâ€™m not a good person. Iâ€™ve hurt too many people. People say that I can always get better. Become a better person. But I can always get worse. I donâ€™t want to risk hurting another person. I want it to end, and it just seems like the fastest way out. 

The only thing grounding me is my dog. I donâ€™t want to leave him alone. Heâ€™s getting old. Iâ€™ll wait for him to go first.
