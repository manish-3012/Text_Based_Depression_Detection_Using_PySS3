I'm so sick of living for others.For the last 13 years I've considered suicide but my fear of harming the lives of those I know care has stopped me. The last few months I've taken to daily breakdowns and sobbing, holding a shotgun in my lap, fits of rage and frustration. I'm spiraling and yet the idea of death comforts me. It's the easy way it the cowards method, but fuck it man why not do something easy when getting out of my house, my room, my bed are so fucking hard. My best friend from middle and high school (who I haven't talked to in maybe 8 years) killed himself on Tuesday seeing all the posts about it gets better make me ill. Its been 13 years of wanting to just be nothing with only one end in sight
