Over itI used to want to kill myself because I thought I deserved it and was a bad person yada yada. I don't care about that anymore. I'm sick of these crazy hairless apes. People are fucking insane and I dont want to deal with any of this shit anymore. Love and connection are a lie. I dont want to be a wage slave the rest of my life.
