Today's my birthday...I'm so uselessI'm not suicidal yet just I don't think I've done anything in this world to be worth anything.  I was the perfect child...TAG classes, all AP classes...automatic admittance into the state school ... then admittance into a certain professional school on the first try where most people go through a couple application cycles.  Now, I'm dropping out.  Yet there is nothing I regret there - I used every resource available to me, studied so very hard, was at school during the weekends to study.. and yet I failed two of my classes.  From high school to til now, I've only ever skipped 2 classes (one I had a 103 F fever, the other was an accident).  I'm back home now and I'm going to go take some assessment tests in a bit at the local community college.  I've tried so hard over the years to be a good person...on first glance I now seem "normal" and friendly from the silent shy ESL student that I was but social skills are so hard.  I'm scared of going out by myself ...I want my mom with me (how pathetic is that? 2X years old???) I wanted to go into the health professions because I felt like I was useless and that was a way I could be useful. I don't know...failure hits me especially hard...when I used to stress out, I caused myself to have incapacitating stomachaches and whole body muscle tremors because I felt like I deserved them and I was happy that I suffered for being inadequate.  There are so many people that have it worse than me...but I just feel horrible today...and only 2 people remembered :(
