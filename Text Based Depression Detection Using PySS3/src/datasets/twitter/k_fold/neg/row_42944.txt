I messed up.I feel like my entire life is spiraling out of control. I keep messing up at work, and I've been so angry at my friends and significant other for various (but legitimate) reasons that I end up being mean. I feel like all I keep doing is making mistakes, and I don't know how much longer anyone will put up with me, including myself. Please tell me it gets better.
