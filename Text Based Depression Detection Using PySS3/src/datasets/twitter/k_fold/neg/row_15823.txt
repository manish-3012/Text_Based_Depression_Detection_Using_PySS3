No reason for a POS like me to still be aliveI cheated on the best gf I had. Abandoned my best friends. Quit school/career. Maxed out credit cards on alcohol and food. Stole money from friends and family. Overall just a lazy, worthless, human being if I can call myself such. My feelings also have no validity from the self destructive behavior I chose to ruin me. Where do I go from here? Die now, soon, or suffer each day until my inevitable. There's no hope to be the person I was and it's almost as if I've truly killed myself but not yet physically.
