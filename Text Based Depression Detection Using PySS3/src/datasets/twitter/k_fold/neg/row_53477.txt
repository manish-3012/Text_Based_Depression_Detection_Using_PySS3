I don't see a point anymoreLately I have been thinking about how I would kill myself. To be honest I don't see a point in living another day. Everyday I wake up feeling like an empty husk and I keep trying to find meaning in my existence but when I think about it I just keep drawing blanks. My family is a mess and I have very little friends. In addition to that I recently broke up with my girlfriend because I honestly didn't feel a connection between us anymore. I can't see a positive future for myself and  so I've just been passing the days just drinking and abusing drugs to numb myself but even that doesn't work for me anymore. I think I might just end it all soon.
