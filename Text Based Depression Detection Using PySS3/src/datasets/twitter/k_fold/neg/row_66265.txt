Iâ€™m close to giving upEvery day is a struggle I wake up crying I go to sleep crying, most of the time I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m so fucking depressed, Iâ€™ve cut myself and have had suicidal thoughts.. I always do. The only thing stopping me from ending it all is my gorgeous girlfriend and family, I wouldnâ€™t want to break their hearts even though I feel like I do everyday. Itâ€™s been going on for 4 years now and honestly if I ever lose my girlfriend I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll live much longer she is keeping me alive sheâ€™s the only thing I look forward to everyday and sometimes not even she helps me.. I donâ€™t want to die, I just want to end the suffering
