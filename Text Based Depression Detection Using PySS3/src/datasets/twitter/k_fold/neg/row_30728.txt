Society causing feelings of invalidationWhen I'm alone I don't really worry about feeling insecure or weak or yknow generally thinking negative about myself

....get on social media....
Fuck my post has no likes, everyone else has thousands! Oh no, all the comments are criticisms! Oh no, no one on my friend list is online!

Should I just delete all my social media?

I do great in isolation I think, I sometimes get this retarded idea "Hey I'm an alright person I can communicate positively with other people" NOPE. There is something deeply wrong and rotten with me ACCORDING TO EVERYONE ELSE, when I'm alone I don't have to worry about it but as soon as I think about having "friends", sharing my opinions, attempting to reach out, thats where I fuck up. It annoys me and it wastes my time.
