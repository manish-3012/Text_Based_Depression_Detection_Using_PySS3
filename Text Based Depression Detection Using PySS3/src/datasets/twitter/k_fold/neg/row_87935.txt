I can't tell if I am okay or not [17F]I can't tell if my daily suicidal thoughts are normal or not. I'm don't think I am depressed or anxiety because I don't seem to fit in with any of the symptoms. But I think about it everyday, the way I would go and the routine. I think of it as an easy way out of my every day stresses in life, and there isn't a day that goes by  where I don't think about suiciding because I am so sick and tired of my everything in my life. I feel like every time I put effort into something, I gain nothing back and I am so sick and tired of feeling like a failure around everyone else. Is it possible to have these suicidal thoughts without being depressed? Is it normal to have suicidal thoughts in times of great stress where it feels too overwhelming?
