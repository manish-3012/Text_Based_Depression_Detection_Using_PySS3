I Can't Keep This UpEvery fucking day I put on my fake ass smile and walk out into the world. I can't do it anymore. I really can't. I just want it all to stop. I haven't been genuinely happy in over a year, every time something's "getting better", as people love to tell me, something goes wrong. I fuck up. Someone else fucks up. It doesn't happen. I just wish I was dead. I can't be expected to keep this up, right? No reasonable person could ask that of someone. No idea how I'd do it. Just want to. Tonight especially. Fortunately, I've got a couple good friends who kept me from drifting too far into the abyss. I can't expect them to do that every night, though, and I can't deal with this feeling anymore.
