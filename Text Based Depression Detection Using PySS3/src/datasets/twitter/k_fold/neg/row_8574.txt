I just made myself throw up 12 times, now I'm just sitting in blood and vomitI can't control this, I can't afford help of any kind nor would I accept it. What kind of a life is this? I do this every day and it hurts and it destroys my body and gets into all my cuts and ruins everything in my life but I can't stop. I want to bring it up with my girlfriend but I don't want to burden her with anything. Sometimes I wish she would find someone better so I wouldn't feel bad about slitting my throat
