I'm done.I'm always the one that helps others, I'm always the one to pick up the pieces of my broken friends. Yet when I feel down and when I feel I can't do it all, I turn to no one. I'm scared of giving my friends the burden of knowing of my troubles. I'm nothing but a nuisance. I'm the cause for my mother's nervous trips to the hospital. I'm of no use in this world.
