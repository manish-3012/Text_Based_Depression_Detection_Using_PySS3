Looking for some AdviceSo my depression has hit an all time high recently. I'm at the point where I feel like I'm barely functioning and came the closest I've ever come to killing myself last night. I would like to check myself in the hospital for some help that goes beyond what the therapist at college can offer me, but I'm a little nervous about the process. I've done some reading online, but was just wondering if anyone here can tell me what I might expect. Do I actually have to attempt something for them to take me seriously?
