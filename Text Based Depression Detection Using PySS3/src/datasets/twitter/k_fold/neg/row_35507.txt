I hate when people say â€œyou are lovedâ€ or â€œyou are enoughâ€ or similar phrases.You donâ€™t know me. You donâ€™t know how truly worthless I am. You know fuck all about who I am, who I am to other people, my place in the world (or lack thereof), etc.

Let me die and wipe my sorry existence from the universe. If only I had the courage to do it...
