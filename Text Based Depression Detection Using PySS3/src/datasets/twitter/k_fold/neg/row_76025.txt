I'm hopeless, pathetic and uselessI've had these thoughts for years now, everybody says that life will get better, but it's not; it's getting worse. I'm in a really bad situation right now and I feel as if it's better just to end it. I hate bothering friends for this type of stuff because I don't want to pressure them or make it feel like its their fault if I do end it. I have a note written atm with all my close family/friends in it, basically saying that I love them and that I'm better off dead. Thanks for reading, it really means a lot that some people are willing to help.
