I'm such a failureI had a very shitty first semester of college, and received an ultimatum from my parents that I must reach a certain GPA this semester or get pulled out of college.

I have busted my ass off this semester, seen slight improvements, and yet I just got back a terrible test grade that doomed one of the classes that I hoped to score well in.  It is now so near impossible for me to get the GPA that my parents demanded, that I can only see me getting pulled from college.

The way I see it, if I can't make it in college, my life is over.  I'm going to get kicked out of my house, and have no where to go this summer.  I'll have nothing.  This is weighing on me so heavily that I am unsure whether I should post this in /r/depression or /r/SuicideWatch  

Yeah I know, its weak.  My problems are so insignificant compared to others, and yet I'm thinking about suicide.  It started a month or so ago, and everyday I think about it more and more.  How I can just escape, and not have to listen to my parents compare me to my brothers and how I never could do anything right.

My future was given to me on a silver platter and I fucked it up.  and yet I can kill myself and release everyone of the burden that I have become.  I feel so worthless writing this message.
