Why shouldn't I kill myself?17m 
virgin
no girlfriend
no real friends
no dad
sister hates me
alcoholic mom who hates me
no passions or hobbies
no reason to live?
don't see what the purpose of living is
death seems like a very, very good idea. don't like being alive, might as well just hit the fast forward button.
Is there any real reason to live? Don't say God or you're a fucking moron.
