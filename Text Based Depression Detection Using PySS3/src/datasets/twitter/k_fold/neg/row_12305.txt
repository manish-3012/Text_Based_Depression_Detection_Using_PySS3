Does it get better?I feel like Iâ€™m not even half the person I use to be, I use to laugh at the dumbest things, Iâ€™d give the biggest hugs to people who complimented me/struck up conversations with them, I use to feel like this world was dark but there was so much good and now it doesnâ€™t really feel like any good matters. My mind just feels rotten because of my social anxiety, I thought painting again for the first time in a while would help me but I just looked at what I made and cried, I just donâ€™t feel like who I use to be and I hate it. I donâ€™t like who I am and I know our lives donâ€™t really â€œhave a path but we can create one for ourselvesâ€ but I just really feel like I have no clue who I am. It feels like thereâ€™s always that option to just stop all of this, even when things feel okay. Things are bad, just end it. Things are  going okay? It wonâ€™t get any better than this moment, end it. I ignore all my friends and families phone calls and messages, I donâ€™t talk to friends for weeks and i just feel like a horrible person, which I probably am. I try to hang out with them and I try to talk but itâ€™s just all hard. I want to feel better but itâ€™s been this way since October of 2018, a couple good times have happened since then but this really is the longest depression period Iâ€™ve ever had. I just feel all over the place and disconnected at the same time. It just feels like a cycle and Iâ€™m so exhausted of going through it again and again. This feels like itâ€™s never going to end.
