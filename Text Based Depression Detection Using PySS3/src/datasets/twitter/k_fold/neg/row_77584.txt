Can't do it anymoreGenuinley need to kill myself now, its gotten to the point where if i need help and message someone about it they always try "It'll get better" or "You are loved don't worry" but none of that shit helps, i don't see why I shouldn't commit suicide, its easy enough to find a way to do it,

also even if i message someone about it and they don't reply it just means i have no one to talk to about it, which usually leads to me burning and crying along with thinking of ways to die
