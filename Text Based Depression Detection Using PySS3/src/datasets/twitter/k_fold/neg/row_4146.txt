I just feel like it's not even worth it anymore.I just wrote out this long post about why I'm depressed and how I feel like no one cares about me, specific stories of people I thought were close to me cutting me out of their lives. Then my stupid phone hit back and erased it all. It just proves, what's the point? Even when I want help the universe silences me.
