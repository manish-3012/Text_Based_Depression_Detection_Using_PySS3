I do not want to go into 2021, and iâ€™m choosing not to.2020 was the happiest year of my life, despite all the bad. I started off very strong, but over the last 2 months every last bit of me has dwindled away. I look in the mirror and do not recognize myself anymore, i wake up everyday feeling like a shell. I wish i could fall backwards through my body and out of reality. Iâ€™m okay with life passing me by as mine stops here. I donâ€™t feel anything anymore expect the overwhelming amount of defeat. It feels like i have a constant body high now that iâ€™ve made the decision to die, itâ€™s peaceful. none of my things mean anything to me anymore, i wish i could give them all away. i want to delete my presence everywhere, i donâ€™t want to be remembered. I donâ€™t want my body found, i donâ€™t want to leave any notes, i want it to be forgotten i was even a person. iâ€™m done.
