I just need someone to talk toThis is going to be a mouthful but basically Iâ€™m struggling mentally and donâ€™t have much support so in the beginning of the year around January 28 me my mom and brother left our house and my parents are now getting divorced and itâ€™s just been really hard Iâ€™ve never been close with my dad so I didnâ€™t really care about that but ever since weâ€™ve left Iâ€™ve been stressed and my anxiety has been horrible just this year alone Iâ€™ve lived in 5 going on 6 places and itâ€™s so hard man the place weâ€™re staying at now is my momâ€™s friend house and me and my mom sleep on a full sized mattress but the friends are horrible and I canâ€™t stand to live here they are always fighting and arguing but like not the normal kind like theyâ€™re really bad and nasty and Iâ€™ve gotten panic and anxiety attacks from them I have literally no where to go at all I lay in a room all day and Iâ€™m fucking dying before this place we lived in a hotel and my mom was kinda being emotionally abusive but now that weâ€™re here she has to be phony so sheâ€™s only a bit nicer but tbh not really I feel so alone and sad all the time and a little while ago I accidentally told my mom I wanted to off myself and as soon as I said it I regretted it but a couple days later she wanted me to help her with something and she brought up what happened and was like (when you pulled your shit) all because I couldnâ€™t find something for her but after that she found a free therapist that goes through the state and sheâ€™s no fucking help at all I cant even tell her half the stuff thatâ€™s going on because my mom could get in trouble (her friends fighting) but itâ€™s so hard because they yell 25/8 and it gives me horrible anxiety and Iâ€™m only 14 but I feel guilty for feeling depressed or suicidal because I feel like Iâ€™m being shellfish but I just wish I could be happy to some point but I just literally have no support because even though my mom thinks I tell her everything I really donâ€™t I usually tell her about stuff my friend has said and some of my issues but I canâ€™t tell her how Iâ€™m constantly thinking about offing myself like all the time but Iâ€™m not going to do it because i canâ€™t im a fucking coward and pussy im to scared to do it and Iâ€™m so ashamed of myself because of that but I canâ€™t tell my mom all these things and I canâ€™t tell my therapist because guess what itâ€™s family therapy so sheâ€™s always with me I understand my moms trying I know but sometimes sheâ€™s just such a bitch and I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™ve done nothing to her before we left my dads she would get black out drunk throwing up everywhere and guess who was there for her me guess who walked her up the stairs because she was to fucked up me guess who checked on her in the middle of the night to see if she was ok me I donâ€™t think she sees the good I do at all she loves my brother more and I know because his girlfriend told me how she thinks heâ€™s smarter and how she likes him better and tbh Iâ€™ve known in my heart sheâ€™s always liked him more but itâ€™s whatever I just want my own space and just want to be happy but itâ€™s so hard too be and on top of my brother sheâ€™s dating a fucking dude in jail who knew me when I was like 4 and I canâ€™t fucking stand him and she gets mad at me because of that like bitch fuck your stupid ass jail bird heâ€™s not my fucking dad and he NEVER will be idc if heâ€™s trying heâ€™s not I donâ€™t need him or my dad fuck both of them Iâ€™m so sick of always considering everyone elseâ€™s feelings fuck that shit I always put my self in fucked situations to make others happy and what the fuck do I get Iâ€™ll tell you itâ€™s nothing fucking nothing Iâ€™m so sick of life and living because I know this shit is only going to get worse. Iâ€™m not sure what I expect you to say but say whatever.
