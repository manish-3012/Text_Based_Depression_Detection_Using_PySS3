Deleted all of my posts from before. Terrified of posting again but I'm not able to vent anywhere elseI was humiliated, called a liar, a troll, every mean name in the book. I've deleted everything but now I'm just numb. I don't know where to go, what to do, how to proceed, and I've been eating sleeping pills like candy.

But I can't tell anyone anything. I'm supposed to be the strong one, not this idiot of a woman that I am now.

I don't know what to do... I just want to sleep and never wake up...
