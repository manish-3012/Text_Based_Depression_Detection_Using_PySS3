I'm tired of trying so hard to stay alive.I'm so sick of working so goddamn hard to keep myself here. I'm completely shitting the bed with college, nothing is going right there, and then I can hardly get myself out of bed to go to work anymore, but I need to go so I can continue to pay the rent in my dark, dingy, boring apartment. I'm so tired of living. I'm so tired of waking up and everything is the same, and I'm so frustrated. No matter how much I want things to change, no matter how much I seem to do, I always seem to slip back down to where I am now. I don't think I can fight these thoughts forever, y'know? There's gotta be a point where I fall down and stay down. I'm almost constantly high just to try to get away from my own suicidal thoughts. The only reason I'm still around is because if I died, my roommates would have to find someone to help pay their rent, and I don't know if they could. I don't want them to be homeless. Plus, someone would have to find the body, right? And my friends would worry.
