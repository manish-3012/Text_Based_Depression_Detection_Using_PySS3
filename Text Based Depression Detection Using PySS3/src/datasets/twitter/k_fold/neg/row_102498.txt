Is there anyone out there I can talk to right now?Just figured out the root of my problems and I'm afraid there's no fixin' it. Unless I continue on the hunt of a therapist that will actually listen to me which doesn't make me feel any better.

EDIT: Btw I'm 22 years old I don't know if that matters at all.
