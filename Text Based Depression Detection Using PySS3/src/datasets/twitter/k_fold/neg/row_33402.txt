I journaled my suicide planI have always kept a journal in "attempt" to help with my mental health. The vision never leaves me, its what I see everyday. It was so detailed, I didn't even want to think about it, but somehow it always come back to me. I wrote down everything from what to do before, wht do I need and how/where to do it. I even drew the scene.

I just don't have enough courage to execute it.
