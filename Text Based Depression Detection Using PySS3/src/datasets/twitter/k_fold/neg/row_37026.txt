I can't afford to liveI recently retired due to medical issues from the army. If I don't get paid my retirement on the first I've about killing myself. 


My divorce drained my savings so now I live paycheck to paycheck even when I had a job. If I don't get paid I will have no way to afford my car payment, phone bill, or insurance. I will be of no ducking use to anyone because at this point I'm sitting around with my thumb up my ass waiting to hear back from any one of the 100s of applications I put in. 


I can't afford to take care of my cats, help my sister and brother in law with any of their expenses (they're letting me live with them until I get on my feet), or myself. I don't know what I will do if I don't get paid but I feel alone. I've spent all day thinking about suicide. 

It's the only answer I've come to. I don't know what to do...I've never felt this hopeless.
