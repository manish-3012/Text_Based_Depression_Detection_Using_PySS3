Didn't even get the virus, but I'm not gonna survive this pandemic anyway.Thanks for making the "cure" worse than the disease, entire world. I haven't seriously considered suicide since I was a teenager. Then quarantine happened. 

I'm giving myself and the world three weeks to get its shit together. It was two, but now I have to support a friend who's in a country that has it much worse than we do and they CLAIM his quarantine is only three weeks (watch them come up with some excuse to extend it). 

Everything I ever loved or cared about is gone because of this pandemic. Every single coping mechanism I've ever had. Everything that's ever made me happy, ever made me realize "Hey, the world isn't all bad. In fact it's actually really good, most of the time." Everything that's ever kept me alive. I might as well be dead. I've got no more reason to stay alive except for this friend...who I may have to tell in 3 weeks that I just can't justify being alive in a world where everything is gone and that I have to go. Somehow that's harder than the thought of dying. I've reached the point where I'm willing to take chances at an afterlife where COVID-19 doesn't exist and where I can hike my trails and go to carnivals again...
