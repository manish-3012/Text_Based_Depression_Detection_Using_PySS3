If I were to die would someone care?lHave I been loved? Has someone I have loved loved me back? Did I leave an impact? Was I good? Did I make more people to feel happy than sad? 

I don't know. But I have to end this one day. This ignorance, this pain. This feeling of not belonging. Do I have anyone? I don't know. Will anyone miss me? I doubt.

Was I useful? Was I wanted? 

Fuck this, life is too much
