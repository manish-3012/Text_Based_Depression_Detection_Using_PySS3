A living hellI fucking hate my life. I've wanted to be done with this life for so long now it seems like I can't even remember before that anymore. Like pretty much everything else in my life i'm alive only because it would hurt others if went through with it. I've never been good at anything. I'm socially awkward, have no coordination, I suck at driving I get lost in my hometown. On top of that i'm physically unattractive. Every morning I wake up and think about just taking off and driving until I run out of gas and spending all my money on drugs and hookers until I'm broke at which point i'll just off myself. Most of my friends are all living happy lives. Married and have children. They seem happy anyways. Where did I go wrong? I just don't get it. I have nothing to show for 35 years of living. I got 2000 bucks in my bank account and live at home with my parents. I'm a fucking loser. I'm gonna die an ugly loser all alone in my parents basement. I might as well just fucking do it and get it over with.
