I can't wait to be free from my pain. I know I will die within the next months, butwhat do I do about my parents and brother? 
No matter how our relationship is or has been, they will be devastated. It will ruin their lives.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
I can't keep living for them.
Knowing that they're there and that they'll have to deal with it is the worst. 
I will pass my pain on to them. They will remember it until they die themselves.
But I can't keep living for them. I'm unable to feel anything but pain and I know this will never change.
Whenever I realize what reality is I'm in tears.
I've cried so much already. .
I've had a lifetime of pain already, if not more.
I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of being in pain from when I wake up to when I fall asleep every day, without being able to experience any relief, ever.
I deserve to have died already.
I can't anymore

Serious question, how do I possibly prepare my parents for something like this?
They know that I have mental illnesses but they have not the slightest idea of how bad and unendurable it has really gotten..
