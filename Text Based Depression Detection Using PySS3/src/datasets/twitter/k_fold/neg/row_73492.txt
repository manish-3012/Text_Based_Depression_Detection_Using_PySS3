Everything Is So Confusing, Scary, Hard To Describe...I honestly have no idea how to describe my current situation other than everything seems to have gone to pieces around me and I fairly certain I might kill myself soon. The reasons are vast and numerous and I don't want to ramble on but all I have to say is that something happened ad now I honestly don't see anything good in my future if it keeps going this way.

I like so very few things in life and those that I do I could never come out and show to people, I could never do them with anybody. I don't really like a lot of people to be perfectly honest, modern society with all of it's emojis and hastags feels so cold and alien, those my age never talk about things that interest me. I like older people but you can't have older friends when you're my age or people think it's creepy and even then I don't like people in general. Even other furries, I don't really like them, I don't share their interests.

I have nothing I like and an uncertain future, all I know is that unless things go perfectly it's a future I don't want to live and see.
