If I can't make myself Straight/Bisexual I'm going to  hang myselfI need advice on gay conversion therapy in Ireland asap. I tried getting in contact with core issues but they have been of no help. I can only feel aroused by men and I don't like that. I do have a bf but we're long distance and he does know I want to try women but won't let me.

To me it's super important I love my real virginity before June when I turn 19. But getting off to girls is impossible for me. I need to know how to get turned on pussy and tits asap. I don't want to hear how 'oh it's ok to be gay and who you are''

If I cant cum for girls then I WILL KILL MYSELF. Just help me try to be straight is all I ask.
