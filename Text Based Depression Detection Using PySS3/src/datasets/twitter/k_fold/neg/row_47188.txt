I'd be okay with dying now, thank youIt's bullshit, isn't it? Being told that it would be selfish to attempt again when *so many people care*. Fuck off with that. Fuck off, I don't want to hear it coming from someone who doesn't even bother to check up on me. I fucking want to die, they don't know that. Do they only "care" to keep up appearances and because that's what is to be expected?.

I don't even care much for myself anyway. I fucking hate myself. I'm convinced it would have been better for me to die last attempt. Or the one before that. I'm fucking sick of this when I know I'm only going to continue being alone. I know that because I don't bother reaching out, and in turn, no one bothers keeping tabs with me. Fuck, I'm done.
