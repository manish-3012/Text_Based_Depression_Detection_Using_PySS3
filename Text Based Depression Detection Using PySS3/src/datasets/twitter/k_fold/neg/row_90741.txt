Suicide consumes my thoughts.I lost the one family member who stood up for me when I was being abused.  He passed away.  The world is quickly becoming a scarier place, and I don't mean just because of recent politics.  My mental health and physical health are both in the shitter and I have no way of getting help.   I don't wanna call a hotline because the last time I did I was 5150'd and that was one of the worst experiences I have had.
