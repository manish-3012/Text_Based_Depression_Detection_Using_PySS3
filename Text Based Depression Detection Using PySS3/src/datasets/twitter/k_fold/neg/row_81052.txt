Just got my 4th email in 1 year from the suicide prevention team at my universityItâ€™s kind of embarrassing how Iâ€™m a regular there because people always report me to them. And itâ€™s a reminder that I will never be normal. I will never get these issues resolved. My sophomore year someone fucked me up and gave me abandonment issues after I worked hard on my mental health for months and legit thought my depression was gone. I havenâ€™t been the same since. Iâ€™m always on the verge of death and sometimes I do dumb shit like posting a suicide note because nobody would care enough to check on me if I went randomly missing without that kind of warning. And the thing is that I really donâ€™t want to rot in my apartment because then my family wouldnâ€™t get to have an open casket funeral for me. And thatâ€™s how I always end up in good olâ€™ Robinâ€™s suicide prevention office.
