Haunted by my pastI canâ€™t move forward because my past wonâ€™t allow me to. 

Alcohol, grief and self hatred have destroyed me and Iâ€™m only 30 years old, 

Pathetic really. On the outside I have lots of mates, Iâ€™m blessed to have them but I canâ€™t talk to any of them about how I want to die and how much I donâ€™t deserve to live. 

Iâ€™ve confessed to God but even now I donâ€™t think I deserve his forgiveness.

Itâ€™s time to die. Hopefully I do soon.
