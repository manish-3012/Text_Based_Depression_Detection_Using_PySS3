Losing myselfI genuinely feel like i have little to live for now. I feel like Iâ€™m burden to those i surround. My girlfriend is the only one who truly knows about how Iâ€™ve been feeling but she tells me that itâ€™s draining her and that she feels like she needs to watch what she says around me without it triggering me to start feeling the way that Iâ€™ve already been. I just feel like Iâ€™m burdening her and others around me by being here. I donâ€™t do anything with my life and Iâ€™m constantly reminded by it. I had a bad situation lately. I just graduated from high school and Iâ€™m the only one who hasnâ€™t started college or own a car out of everyone who surrounds me. It makes me feel lesser than them simply because Iâ€™m constantly told that by others even if it is just as a joke. I met my girlfriends mother for the first time and she asked me if Iâ€™m in school, if i have a car, and if i have a job. The answer to all the questions was no. She looked at me as if i was disgusting. I know i donâ€™t deserve their daughter and my girlfriends mothers face afterwards was confirmation for that. My one of few reasons to live and I donâ€™t even deserve to have it. It hurts. Thatâ€™s only one occasion of just not being enough. I can be doing what would usually bring me joy in the past but i donâ€™t feel the same anymore. The slightest thing triggers me and reminds me that i have no reason to be here again. I found myself genuinely enjoying life last Sunday but the following day i was brought back to the reality of my life. Itâ€™s almost as if nothing brings me joy anymore and i feel empty inside. I want to end it. Iâ€™ve had it planned out for a while honestly. I want to do it in January after the holidays pass and my niece is born.
