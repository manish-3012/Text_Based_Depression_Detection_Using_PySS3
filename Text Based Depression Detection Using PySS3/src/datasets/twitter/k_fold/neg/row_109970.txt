I don't know what to do anymoreI made a commitment to myself to kill myself on tuesday of next week. really regretting not doing it sooner because i'm worried i'm going to chicken out like a coward. it would be so much easier for me to just end it all, and i know that my friends secretly want me to do it so by not doing it i'd be letting them down which makes it even worse.
