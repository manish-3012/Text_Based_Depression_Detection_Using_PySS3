This anxiety is a horrible nightmare, and I don't see any relief.I've been suicidal for a long time, and haven't had anxiety for most of it. But the past few days, the anxiety has come back en mass.

And now I'm scared that I won't be able to work up the nerve to kill myself. I'm terrified of it.

I want to go get some medication for it, like maybe xanax or ativan, but I can't really go to a doctor, because they'll probably ask me if I have depression or suicidal thoughts....and if I answer those, i doubt i'll get anything but a psych ward trip.

I am stupid and pathetic for all this, because i could be okay if I would just....care or do things. If i would just go out and do things i would probably sstop.

it's my fault for not caring or trying enough.
