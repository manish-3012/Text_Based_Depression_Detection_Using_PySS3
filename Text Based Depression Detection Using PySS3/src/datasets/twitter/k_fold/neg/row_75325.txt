SuicideI want to kill myself. I find myself very envious of my dead friends. I think of myself as a survivor and know I sound like a pussy. But, I just don't really understand what I'm doing anymore. I've been struggling with the loss of my significant other. We dated for ten years on and off and my life with him was the only normal life I've known. I've been through not one but several traumatic experiences which I've never received help for. And there's also a lot of pressure I'm dealing with in terms of success. I'm trapped in a job that I hate which earns me a great deal of money. However, my mom depends on me so I can't quit or get a normal job. I've never attempted suicide even though I've always thought about it. The problem is that Ive been thinking about it more and more frequently over the last year. I cry almost every day, I think about it everyday. I know there are people in worse situations. But are they just better equipped for those situations? I don't know. I just know how I feel.
