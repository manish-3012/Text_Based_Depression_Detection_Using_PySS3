Someone to talk to?Little background.

December I took a massive overdose and was put into an induced coma for 2 weeks while they sorted my body out. I was in ICU and on life support. I came round and was taken to a mental health unit for a couple of weeks over Christmas and new year. I was terrified and felt so alone. I basically lied to get out as soon as possible because I missed my home and my family and my dog. I was put into a day hospital where we had to check in and speak with a nurse every day. My medications were altered and my health checked. They said initially I would come out of this with mild to severe brain damage but thanks to the incredible nurses and doctors I have come out with minor blood pressure and heart issues and some imbalance in my blood. All being monitored and drug controlled, now by my GP

I was put back on long waiting lists for therapy ect but being the NHS (British healthcare system) everything is so slow and lists up to a year or more. I was given a care coordinator but she never made appointments and only saw me for a few moments. I requested I have another as I didn't we got along very well.

I was given a replacement a month later and oh my god i have never met a more rude, disrespectful and hurtful person. I saw her twice and she made me feel so so suicidal after every meeting. I initially thought it was my imagination and my fault. So I bought my mum into an appointment because I was too afraid to go alone and my mum, a very kind woman who see's the good in everyone, agreed that she was a bully and should not be in that position. I was too afraid to request another again so soon, for fear they would reject me for being picky or annoying or whatever. So I stopped going to appointments because I was so afraid of seeing her again. I then received a letter from her informing me that she was leaving her position to work elsewhere (going into unnecessary detail of how she was 'headhunted' and about her many qualifications and achievements. The letter continued ot insult me and my mum, to LIE about the treatment I am receiving, to tell me I am not mature enough to go to university and generally insulting me, my intelligence and my coping mechanisms. After all she made me feel this has tipped me over the edge, this has made me truly believe I must be an evil person, unfixable and immature and disgusting. Why else would a medical professional speak to me in this way? why else would she treat me like this unless I'm an evil child?

I had an appointment with a private psychiatrist today, as I feel the NHS has failed me, I might as well try the private sector. My initial appointment was very positive and I was happy with his approach. However, on this second appointment, I felt him to be a little colder towards me and made me feel uncomfortable. When I panic I disconnect from my body and this happened several times in this appointment because I was so scared and panicky. He said i need to decide if I am an evil horrible person or if these are just worries and thoughts. After the letter from the care coordinator, I am now believing that I am truly an evil person. and he said if I truly believe that then he cannot treat me. I said that he's asking me to choose between a) I AM evil and therefore must kill myself or b) am not evil and all my instincts and thoughts are false. This is tearing me apart inside as now I feel he's asking me to choose between life and death, between my own beliefs and what he's telling me

I feel like im seeing a totally different world to what everyone else is seeings. I'm so confused and conflicted. I feel like all my medical professionals want me dead. I'm fighting against my self-harming urges but its getting too much right now. It feels like the world is against me right now and trying to push me over the edge. 

I saw how much my previous attempt on my life hurt everyone around me and I really dont want to hurt everyone like that again. But this pain inside is growing every day. All my medical professionals are letting me down and it feels like they are sick of me. I'm so conflicted and I really don't know what to do now. 

There is a nearby train station i can walk to. Or tomorrow i pick up my medication. I could buy more blades tomorrow and cut myself apart again. 

They all seem like glowing options for freedom and peace. But I dont want to hurt the people I love. I feel so alone tonight and im so afraid. I guess I just want someone to talk to, someone to talk me out of it, someone to care about me and care how I feel

Sorry for wasting your time
