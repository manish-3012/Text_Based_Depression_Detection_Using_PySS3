Iâ€™m fucking stuck and embarrassed and evictedMy mom gambled away our rent money for the second month in a row, and now weâ€™re getting evicted, so now thereâ€™s that on my record at 20-years-old. Weâ€™re moving back in with a family member we used to live with when the recession hit in 2006-2012, and thatâ€™s when my depression was the worst and I went through a psychosis. 

My mom doesnâ€™t have a car or else Iâ€™d go live with someone else, but sheâ€™s fucking dependent on me now to drive her 15+ miles to and from work now while I have to babysit for my cousin during the day and also work a 30-40+ hour job at night. Todayâ€™s my first day off in awhile and I have to pack everything before we get locked out, and I donâ€™t have a day off until Wednesday. 

Iâ€™m more than 5k in debt with maxed out credit cards because of my mom, so sheâ€™s just fucking drained me of everything. 

I have a dog too, so I canâ€™t just go anywhere. 

I fucking just want to die so I canâ€™t just not have to do this right now.
