people are preventing me from killing myself 

The main reason is that we won't truly be free is that the establishment don't want that. They want to prop up people only to sell you as a product to the masses so you develop a life of dependence rather than Independence. These houses don't do anything but add to the suffering of life. Seriously, these high rise buildings/concrete buildings are making my mental health worse because they don't breathe.

I just wish that suicide pills were given by GPs and doctors just to end this bullshit game that we are all in. I don't want kids, I certainly am bored of life and I certainly don't care anymore. Who in their right mind would want to bring kids to this sick world? You would be doing everyone a dis-service.

I am not scared of dying. I just wish that people wouldn't stop me from killing myself or leaving the house on my own. I have attempted it multiple times but people have stopped me. I don't care about having a narcissist title next to my name. 

People only pretend to care because they can keep a track of me in case I go out of line or they don't want to pick up my disgusting remains but in the end life is meaningless anyway. You are a slave and will always remain a slave to these sickos that sold themselves to money and religion the two destructive forces of humanity. There are 8 billion people on this planet and growing, I rather not be around when the whole system collapses.
