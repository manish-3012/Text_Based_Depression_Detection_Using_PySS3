GoodbyeLooking back on my life, there are so many regrets and so many missed opportunities.
So many people that I have treated wrong and so many friendships that I did not see.
And all of these have come back to haunt me.
I am truly ashamed of the person I have become.
And I am distressed about the path that I have chosen in life.
I lived as a proud and a pathetic human being and after tonight I will be shrouded as a weak and a coward ghoul.
