I don't want to live this life anymoreI've burnt every bridge including with my family who have me the world due to drug use. Sobriety doesn't help,I was clean for two years and thoughts about suicide almost every day, due to the fact that I haven't done anything with my life. I live in my grandparents garage,I have a shitty job that I can't live from,I have no training to do anything or money to get it. I have no real friends, just junkies that want to get over on me, and the old friends I have turned their backs, and out was still so even when I was sober..idk what to do, I've been in and out of rehab and community hospitals.somebody help more before I do something stupid..
