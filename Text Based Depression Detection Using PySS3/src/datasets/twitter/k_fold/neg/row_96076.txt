Things are hopelessI have posted here before. The good news is that I'm still here. The bad news is that I'm still having suicidal thoughts. The depression comes in waves. Some days I am okay, I only cry a little. Other days, I cry non-stop for extended periods of time. Last night in particular I wanted to just end it all. I reached out to a friend and he helped me through the feelings, but they have lingered. 

I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist on Wednesday morning, and then I have my appointment with my therapist that afternoon. I can't say whether or not any of it is helping, but I'm going to try. I will share my suicidal thoughts with them. 

I have tried to share my feelings of depression with my family and other friends, but I don't think they understand how bad it is. I am also wondering if I should share my feelings with my boss at work? I believe in full transparency, we have a good relationship, he is an extremely compassionate person and I trust him. But I don't know if there is any reason to tell him now. I don't know.

I try to reach out to various resources whenever I start to feel bad. I've used friends, suicide hotlines, reddit posts and compassion chats to help. I don't know what else to do other than stick with my therapy and hope that one day the waves aren't so big.
