I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™ve had events in my life that changed me. Iâ€™ve been destroyed internally and have developed an eating disorder. My brother who I loved and depended on walked out of my life. This loss hurts, along all of these problems that where started by me. Iâ€™ve come to realize I am the reason my life is so miserable. I donâ€™t want to die, but thereâ€™s no one out there who needs me. Iâ€™m a living waste of space. Iâ€™ve always had suicidal thoughts that come and leave for the last few years. I hate moping to others like this but Iâ€™m at a level where I want to end my life right now. I donâ€™t know who to talk to personally about this.
