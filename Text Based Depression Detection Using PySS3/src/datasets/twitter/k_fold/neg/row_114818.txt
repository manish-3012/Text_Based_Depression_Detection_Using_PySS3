I donâ€™t really know if I want to dieI think Iâ€™m bi polar. I have really good days and really bad days. Sometimes Iâ€™m super happy and think Iâ€™m amazing and then other days I feel completely depressed and think the whole world is against me. Everybody always says go see a doctor but I donâ€™t have health insurance and that shits expensive. I try to self medicate with alcohol which I know makes it worse but those few moments of being drunk are worth it. I donâ€™t know what to do. Today Iâ€™ve been wanting to die. I had to see my family yesterday and they stress me the fuck out. I got wasted and cried to my dad all psycho about my miscarriage then drove all the way back home. It was stupid. I know Iâ€™m just rambling now but I donâ€™t even know how to talk about all of this.
