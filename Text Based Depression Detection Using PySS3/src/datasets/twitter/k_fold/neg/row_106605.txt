I am a loserWhen I was a kid I was the best student in my school. When I became a teenager I started reading a lot of books. I taught myself English, Spanish, some Italian, and even a bit of Latin and formal logic. My goal was to become a poet. My role-models were Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. I was about fifteen. 

I had very few friends, but I don't really think this did bother me at the time, for they were good friends.
By June 2012 I fell in love with a girl two years older than me who lived in another state. We talked a lot through the internet for two months or so, until things started to get very heated and she decided we should stop talking. 

During those two months, I lost my study habits. In the months that followed, things got worse and, by mid-2013, I was already depressed, lonely, and spending whole days and whole weeks on Reddit and, later on, 4chan.

In these last two years I gradually came to the realization that I am not, in fact, smart. Or at least not smarter than the average slightly educated person. I also came to the realization that all my dreams and goals are ultimately unattainable, and in most likelihood I shall never be more than a failed, lazy wage slave with extremely low self-steem, living in a third world country with no hopes of improvement.

In addition to that, I have lost contact with my old friends. And I need friends. But now I don't even know whether I really am capable of holding a real, genuine friendship anymore.  The vast majority of my communication with other people happens in anonymous websites on the internet and I have lost the hability to talk to people normally in real life. In social settings, I tend to isolate myself and act very awkward.

I also cannot stand the city where I live, which is something that in my case has a serious impact on my well-being. I love good architecture, I love walking, I love museums, I love music concerts. These things are almost essential to my life, and my city offers none of it: the architecture is made of ugly concrete boxes, the climate is too hot for me to take a walk (30 to 35 C is the usual temperature during the day), the museums are poor, and good concerts are rare.

I am 19 years old. I am a short man - 5 foot 8 (173cm) -, overweight (82kg), my face is full of acne, and I have never dated a woman in real life or had sex. 

I have been living the same daily routine for a quite some time now: wake up, go to uni, come back home, buy food, eat, watch some movie, read something, waste time on the internet, sleep, and repeat. I can't bear it.

When I look at the life of the people I know they are all doing better than me: the girl I fell in love with is a psychology student at the best university in the country and is now full of friends and seems to lead a very happy life, her boyfriend is an engineering student at the same institution who in ten years will probably be making ten times more money than I ever will, one of my old acquaintances is a photographer and dates a beautiful young journalist, the other is a young filmmaker, another one is living in a beautiful city in Germany, and the other is working for Apple and making a lot of money. When I first met them I was very smart, hardworking, dedicated to my passions, and capable. Now they all developed their potential and are doing well, while I have become lazy and depressive, and am overall a worse creature than I used to be. They have improved themselves, I have worsened myself.

Suicide has been on my mind quite frequently since 2013. There is no way I'm going to do it now or in the following months or years, because I could never deprive my parents of their only son. However, I do sincerely believe that my death will happen by suicide, probably when I'm around my 30's or 40's. I despise myself and I do not think I am worthy of this world, of my family, of my country, or even of this ugly, small, fat shell which I call my body. 



tl;dr: I was a smart student, fell in love, became depressed, wasted my late teens on the internet, have no friends, no self-steem, live in a city I hate, and the reason why I haven't killed myself already is that I love my parents.
