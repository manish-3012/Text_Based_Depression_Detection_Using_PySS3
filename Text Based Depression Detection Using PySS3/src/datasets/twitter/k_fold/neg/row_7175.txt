How do I open up to a friend?Hey everyone!

Iâ€™m an 18 year old guy who has been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for several years now, and have finally decided I want to do something about it. A lot of people have said you need to â€˜open upâ€™ to people about it, and that this is the first step in getting better. However, I have a couple questions about this:

1. What does â€˜opening upâ€™, or telling others about your issues actually do? What benefits does it bring?

2. How do you have this conversation? Iâ€™d feel uncomfortable just bringing up that Iâ€™m suicidal with my friends.

3. What should I expect my friend to provide? I can just imagine telling my friend about my problems, and him just not knowing what to do

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
