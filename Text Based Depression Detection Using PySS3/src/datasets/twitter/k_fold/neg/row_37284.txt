I am so unfathomably fucking close to the fucking edge that I cannot accurately describe it using words.I am legitimately a sociopath.
I am lonely, and extremely angry.
I do not enjoy any of the things I do at all, infact, if I enjoy anything it's most likely due to schadenfreude, that's just about the only feeling of joy I can perceive.
I gym, I study, I used to do martial arts. I socialize with people, I crack jokes and make everyone laugh, I laugh at others jokes.
I have friends.
My friends enjoy my company.
I don't care for it very much at all. I'd rather be alone or with just one single person that I like very much.
As soon as I get home I turn into a depressed angry ticking time bomb. I used to enjoy playing videogames, but they only make me angrier now.
I have successfully deluded myself into thinking I am a walking example of Murphys law.

I typed out a 1000-ish word long post before deleting it all and settling for this simplistic approach, because I know you fuckers won't even reply since reading more than a few paragraphs is super hard or something. I've done it in the past, got no replies. Don't bother checking the post history, deleted them. I am going to delete this one too once I realize no one really gives a shit, just like I do.

Do not mistake this simplistic approach for calm demeanor, the past hours I've been frothing with pure anger, my hands are covered in sores from punching holes in my desk and walls.

This is a throwaway I use to vent my angers and make embarrassing crappy posts like these.

I will die soon, either by my own hand or suicide by cop, unless something changes.
