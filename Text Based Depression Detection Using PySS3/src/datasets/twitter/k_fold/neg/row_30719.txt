So tired, numb.............so tired, everday seems a bit harder to find a reason to get out of bed.  No friends, never had any growing up, seen death from both suicide and the like......Yes i am a Veteran......who cares?  No one, i look around and see so many happy people, and wonder why I am not able to grasp such a feeling.  it's scary what lie behind a smile, one never knows the dark thoughts of others.  Don't try to enter the dark realm that is my mind unless you are willing to live at the bottom of that rabbit hole............  I grew up not being wanted, not by either parents, but instead of giving me up they just kept me around their twisted fucked up alcoholic abusive world.  only recipient of their torment and abuse was I.  Not really sure why i am here...........no one gives a fuck anyway..............goodbye
