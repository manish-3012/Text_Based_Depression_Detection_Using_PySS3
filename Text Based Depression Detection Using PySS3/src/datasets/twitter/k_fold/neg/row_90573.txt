When does it get better?Everyone says it will get better, but it doesn't. I've been bullied and alone for years. I have a best friend who is moving and therefore, abandoning me. Great. I wish people would stop caring. My mom, my friend, and another girl. That fact they care or act like they do is the only thing stopping me. I honestly don't see any point in my life. Nothing will change. I'm afraid to die, but the idea of living is miserable.
