My weekend didnt work out.On friday as I left the library, I felt happy, I felt asured of things. I wished everyone here on SW the very best and went back knowing that this weekend everything would be okay.  

For me, okay meant that I would finally die and get the release and relief that I want. long story short the end was supposed to come via car exhaust.  But on saturday night for some damn reason, someone who was supposed to be gone all night and the sunday, came back and caught me, i was just honestly starting to feel drowsy, I felt like nothing was happening before and then I felt a sleepy feeling, like finally things were going to happen.

Since that moment i've felt, scared and troubled.  I havent been able to sleep and I dont even know if the other person understood what was going on.  At this point im desperate to die, hopefully today.  I dont know what way would work but ive heard water intoxication can work, so im going to try that later tonight.  

Its important that I die asap, unlike some of the other SW posters,  my issues arent relationship related, they're mainly [but not totally] financial, and i'd rather be dead when my financial realities are exposed.  I dont even know why im typing this now, I just feel like I should be doing something, but dont know what to do.

So yeah just typing whats in my head.
