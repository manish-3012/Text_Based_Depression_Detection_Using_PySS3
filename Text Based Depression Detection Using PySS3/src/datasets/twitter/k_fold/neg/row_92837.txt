I fucking hate myselfI keep thinking that my best friend (my only friend left) is still my best friend. I fucked everything up in every way and it's entirely my fault. I got fucking drunk a lot to try to forget her, but I just can't. I still see her in school, but she doesn't even want to talk to me. She doesn't even look at me. I don't know where to go anymore. I'm failing every fucking class and my parents and all my teachers are dissapointed in me. I wish I could just be genuinely happy for once. I wish, I could stop existing for once. I can't do this anymore. I have the rope. I have the pills. I have the pocketknife. I have the bridge. She told all her friends and her entire family about me and what a bitch I am, so I'm sure nobody will care if I move on. I can't do this anymore
