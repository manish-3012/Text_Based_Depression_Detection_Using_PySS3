my life has completely fallen apart again so here I amI just... I can't believe I'm still alive, it genuinely surprises me how I didn't do it, even with the detailed plan and all of the shit that went down, I have no friends, I have no family that cares about me, my narc parents toy with my life, no one listens to me, my sister doesn't talk to me anymore, everyone avoids me, I'm the literal plague... 
what the fuck did I do to deserve this?? whose crimes am I fucking paying for?? 
I'll give it another month max, if all else fails I'll fucking wreck havoc then pass
