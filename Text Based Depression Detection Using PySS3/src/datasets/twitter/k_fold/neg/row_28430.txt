I want to live but i know it only gets worsei've been going through high school blissfully ignorant just doing bare minimum, not doing homework and not thinking about my future, but since lock down i have not done ANY school work and i'm getting dumber each day, its made me reflect and see what path i'm going to have in life and what is going to happen.

i am a talentless nobody, i have no plan for the future and i know its going to be shit, i love my family but i know im a dissapointment to them, i spoke to my mum about how i'm feeling she said she would love me no matter what but it got me questioning, should you still love someone even though they are worth less than dirt and don't have any want to change it? i would love if i could be hard working, have goals, be smart but words don't mean anything with actions to back them up and even though i'm sad about my future i dont have the will to change it.

i have been thinking about how suicide would just be a good option, it would get rid of 1 less parasite to deal with, i love playing games all day and i really love nightlife but those 2 things won't get me anywhere in life, so my plan is if i leave school with shit grades and colleges reject me, unless i develop a passion for something else besides from gaming, i will end my life.

i want to live and be successful, make friends, find a lover, go places, enjoy my work, go out at night and all the other amazing things that could happen in life, but i have come to terms with the fact it probably won't be like that, i'll be living paycheck to paycheck at a dead end job that i hate hoping for a better day that will never come. 

alls i can do now is just enjoy what i have until i lose it all.
