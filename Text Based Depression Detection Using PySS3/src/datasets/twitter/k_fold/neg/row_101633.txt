Why does it get harder each time?Iâ€™ve attempted to take my own life twice now and Iâ€™m planning my third try (third times a charm I hope). However, Iâ€™ve noticed that with each time it gets significantly harder to go through with it, even though Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m much more suicidal. Maybe itâ€™s because I know the consequences? Curious
