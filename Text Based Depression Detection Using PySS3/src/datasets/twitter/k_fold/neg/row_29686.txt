thought things would change but apparently i was wrongi moved away from home to go to uni but things have barely improved. im still lonely and the weirdo of my flatmates and suicidal and its such a cliche but nobody actually likes me. they just put up with me cos they have to cos i live here. i survived covid but i wish it had put me in the hospital cos i dont know how much longer i can keep living like this. even when everything changed, nothing changed. im so fucking unhappy. i dont know what to do anymore, i dont care about my degree or attending lectures or cleaning my dishes or eating or waking up on time. i dont know how to function. i wish i had killed myself years ago, because i wouldnt be in this fucking limbo. i hate myself
