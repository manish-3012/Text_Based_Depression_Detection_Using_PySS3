can you help me, im just 13My parents keep on fighting. I have 2 other siblings. It happens a lot and is really scary. It happened yesterday when my dad was going in bed and my mom was pissed at him for being to clingy and they had a fight and lots of screaming. My dad had to go to another room, and apparently my mom actually "kicked" my dad. Today my dad tried to make up with my mom and my dad said "im not joking physical fighting is dangerous, so just prepare" and my mom said it as a threat and they started fighting again with tons of screaming and big words. Then they start blackmailing each other and after the fight my dad says hes not gonna drop me to school, and i think if my mom finds out she'll be pissed because she does tons of housework. 

Life is so shitty for me, I only have one true friend, I have other friends put my best friend is my realest friend idk what i would do withouth him. I just hate my parents fighting and i think i should just kill myself its way to scary.
