Me: "I feel so exhausted and depressed all of the time that I can't even tidy up my room or maintain my hygiene properly." My mother: "Well maybe if you just stopped being such a slob, you wouldn't feel so depressed!"That's it. I just had to rant somewhere and I figured my friends were getting tired of my crap.

I acknowledge that the way to get better is to start looking after yourself, but depression makes it so hard to do that people that aren't suffering from it simply don't understand the problem. 

My mother is often under the impression that she raised a slob because my family members often blame her "lack of parenting" for my messiness, which is false. I don't choose to be this way, I don't enjoy being this way at all.
