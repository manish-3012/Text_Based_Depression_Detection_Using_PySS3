I posted last night.Iâ€™m not looking for help. I more or less want to vent. 

I need to do this. It isnâ€™t an option. 

Iâ€™ve been abandoned by everyone whoâ€™s came into my life, no one cares whether I live or die. 

My most recent abandonment has pushed me over the edge. I canâ€™t deal with this anymore. 

As soon as itâ€™s dark, Iâ€™m finding a tree to hang myself from. Iâ€™m not scared at all. The only fear I have is if I fail. 

Iâ€™ve got everything I need. Iâ€™m well prepared and I donâ€™t need to leave a note. No one will care anyways. 

I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. May peace be with you all.
