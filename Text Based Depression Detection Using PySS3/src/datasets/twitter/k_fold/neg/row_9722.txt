It's my fault I want to dieContext: I have been growing closer to a guy. Admitted I love him but he told me he didn't want to date right now. He said we weren't exclusive. I hung out with another guy last night and things escalated but I felt nothing and it felt wrong so I stopped it. I was honest with the guy I am close too and understandably he was upset. He says he doesn't know if he could forgive me and that the two of us are in the air. He said that when he told me how much I mattered it was implying that we were not to sleep with anyone else. I take responsibility for it and I guess I consider it cheating. 

I feel so ashamed and in pain. My chest physically hurts. I am on he edge of an anxiety attack. I have been in rocky waters the past weeks with stress and struggling to recover from self harm. I plan to met up and discus everything with the guy I am close too. But if he doesn't accept my apology and tells me goodbye I am convinced I will lose the small will to live I have. I already sat over a bottle of pills only a few nights ago, and now with the guilt of this...
