Update:I told my momIf you look on my profile youâ€™ll see my post earlier on this sub about being suicidal. It finally overpowered me and I told my mom. She told me that she loves me and that Iâ€™m gonna be happy again. We might go to a therapist soon. 
Iâ€™m also still talking to that girl and weâ€™re both getting closer and dealing with this fucked up world together. Thanks so much for your advice guys, you saved my fucking life. I love you guys and Iâ€™m trying to love life again.
