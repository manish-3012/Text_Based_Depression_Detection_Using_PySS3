close to giving upI'm proud of what I have done already, I'm just 20 years old but I think I'm satisfied on what I achieved already. I'm in the point in my life that I don't want to continue anymore. I think I had enough. My parents love me and are very proud of me but little do they know the struggles I face everyday. I was once an achiever, a positive person but these days its just too much. I dont want to burden them. So if youre reading this thank you!!  At least I vented out to people who actually listen.. Maybe we could be friends in our next life who knows haha anyway youre all strong
