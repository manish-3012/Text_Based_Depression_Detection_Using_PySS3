I really think I should tell someone I want to kill myself but I have no one to talk toI have two groups of friends, if I told one they would be really awkward and not be able to offer any advice and I can't tell the other because I want them to like me and not just see me as the kid who talks too much about how he wants to kill himself

I don't have a therapist or any sort of counsler I'd want to tell

Both my siblings would just tell my mom

I can't tell my dad cause he's not doing so great health wise right now

And lastly I can't and won't tell my mom for many reasons. Mostly beause she probably wouldn't believe me or just brush it off, but also because if she does take me seriously I would be the biggest asshole in the world. Her life sucks enough right now I don't want to burden her with more problems.

This post would actually be the first time I've told anyone I want to kill myself while sober. I guess I should ask for advice, but I really don't know what options I have left.
