I wish I could go back to easier times. Iâ€™m tired of everyone and just l feel useless. I was a mistake.Iâ€™m done with everything. At this point I donâ€™t care anymore. People are awful and pushed me to this point. If I do it I bet they act like they did nothing wrong and will act like they were my friends. Iâ€™m a laughing stock who canâ€™t do anything impressive while looking awful. Why do people base others on their physical appearance without getting to know them. Iâ€™ve been used and made fun of for a while and now the pain will finally take over. Please help.
