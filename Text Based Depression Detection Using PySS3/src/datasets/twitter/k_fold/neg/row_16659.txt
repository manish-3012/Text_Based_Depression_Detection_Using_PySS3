Oh, God, I failedThe job I've wanted for like six years came open and I've been working on the application materials for weeks and weeks and it was due last night at 7:00 and I didn't get it in on time and the opening closed and now I won't get the job and clearly I don't really deserve it anyway if I can't even get it together enough to get my shit done.
