Terrified of CounselingI've read about a few places that offer free counseling.  But I know the laws, and the laws scare me.  My patient-doctor confidentiality doesn't apply if I'm a danger to myself or others, which I obviously am.  How do we deal with this conundrum?  I really want to at least try some counseling.  But I'm afraid if I say the wrong thing they'll put me into a psych ward.  I mean, my head isn't exactly the friendliest place all the time.
