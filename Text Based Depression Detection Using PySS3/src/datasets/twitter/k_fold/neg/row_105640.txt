The rope around my neckI'm shaking as I write this but hopefully someone that knows me finds it. I'm tired to tired to keep going to tired to be accused of being a drug addict to tired to be me I can't fight anymore I can't deal with my narcissistic parents I can't do this anymore 

Maybe as I dangle from the ceiling by a rope maybe then I'll find relief
