I cant do this anymore.I have been planning on writing this for a while but have never got to posting it. I am 16 years old and all I can think about is killing myself. The only thing I do all day sits and make lists about the pros and cons of actually going through with killing myself. I started feeling suicidal since I was in grade 3. I clearly remember when the school asked me to go to the mental hospital cause I could not keep up with the other kids in school. Over there they found out that I have a learning disability. Ever since then I have felt different like I'm not worthy to talk to other people (ik it sounds stupid). Once I finally had the courage to try and talk to people I realised they don't talk to me the same way they talk to their friends. I am sick and tired of people making fun of my learning difficulty and treating me like I'm different. They talk to me like I am not one of them. I have been called to the principal's office multiple times and made fun of by him cause I can't read and spell as well as the other students in my class. I have had enough of this bullshit. I thought schools were meant to help us, students. School has just made shit so much worse for me. I don't want to be different anymore. I just want to start over. (Sorry for this shit I just needed to let it out and I don't have anywhere else where I can share this. Thanks)
