I want to die in the worst way possible.This may sound off, but I am wanting to just punish myself. My life is just bad enough, I try to make others happy, but it just seems when I get hurt people are happy. I want to die in a very painful way, maybe even in front of them. I'm going to try and say it's a 'dare'. Also, is overdosing on anti-depressants a thing?
