Mood swings are killing me slowlyI start feeling angry for no reason, sad and empty, cry for 30 minutes, get back to myself and just zoom out whenever I need to concentrate or do something. Itâ€™s not enough I feel empty and like I canâ€™t feel anything sometimes, they have to scream at me telling how disrespectful I am and how I should review my attitude and that I do nothing all day. Iâ€™m trying alright! Iâ€™m trying to stop this but I canâ€™t. Just let me be, I donâ€™t know how I should feel. Just please stop screaming at me when I get angry. I canâ€™t control it. How hard I can it doesnâ€™t make sense.
