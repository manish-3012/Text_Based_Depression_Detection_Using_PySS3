My girlfriend wants to kill herself and I'm trying my bestI feel like I need to find help somewhere but I'm not sure where to go and I'm starting to get concerned.

Me and my girlfriend, both of us are 17, have been going out for 6 months now. We're both in the same sixth form so we see each other a lot. I knew she had depression before we started going out but I still wanted to date her cause I'm very much in love with her. She's been getting mental help for months and I've been supporting her how I can, walking her home from sixth form, always being available to talk and doing little odd jobs around her house just trying to make life a little easier on her. I helped her to open up a bit with her doctors, since she wasn't telling them everything. Her doctors put her on medication 3 weeks ago and she's the worst I've seen her. She's stopped eating, stopped going into school, doesn't get enough sleep and has nightmares most nights. I was talking with her last night and she said she wants to start cutting herself again and that she wants to kill herself. She says she hates living in her own head and that killing herself seems to be the right thing to do. I'm terrified any day now I'll get a call from her mum telling me something bad has happened. Everyone's giving it their all, the doctors, her friends, me and she's on medication but none of it seems to be enough. I want her to be ok cause she's so important to so many people and I'm trying my best but it doesn't seem to be enough. Any help would be greatly appreciated cause I'm not sure how much more she can take

Edit 1: Wow, so many responses in such a short time! Thank you everyone for being so quick to help, I really appreciate it. She's taking Fluoxetine tablets if that helps at all and next time I see her, which should be tomorrow, I'm going to suggest talking to her doctor about it
