Hopeless, chest hurts, feel ill, feel angry.I'm angry at life for not going the way it should have. I should not be bedridden at 16 with no friends, and having not left the house for 6 months. I should not rely on my parents for almost everything when i'm almost an adult. I should be going to school and be out in the world learning. My entire childhood and teenage years have been defined by panic disorder and psychotic depression. I was born mentally ill. I have never experienced normality, and for that I grieve. Things have only gotten worse in the past year, even after multiple hospital admissions, medications and therapy. I get recurrent infections and always feel ill. I have gastrointestinal issues that cause daily nausea. People say it is an effect of the panic disorder, which tells me that its irreversible. 

I'm tired. For the last few weeks my chest has been hurting unbelievably bad. I thought it was a heart attack from long term stress at first. I have uncontrollable anger to those around me because of how miserable I am. I go into rages and physically lash out. Afterwards I go to my room and plead for something to change so I can be normal.

But in reality, I can't live like this anymore. I will NEVER be normal. I will never live a normal life. I was so naive as a young child and thought this was something every kid goes through. I had dreams of becoming a nurse or a doctor. Boy, do I miss the innocent dreamer days. I don't want to be stuck on disability money my entire life. I don't want to rely on therapy and medications. I'm too worn out to think about this. I need a break.

I am scared
