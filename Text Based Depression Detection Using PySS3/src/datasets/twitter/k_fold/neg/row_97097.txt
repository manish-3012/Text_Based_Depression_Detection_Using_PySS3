How do I escape from my abusive family with no support network?My family is abusive, and groomed me in such a way that I have/attract relationships with abusive/maligned people (acquaintances, friendships, etc). I also have no friends or acquaintances I can turn to - I donâ€™t have a single contact that I could turn to for help. I grew up being bullied and ostracized most of my life, and had other authority figures abuse me too. I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but I feel trapped and stuck; the more I feel this way the more I want to kill myself. I want to be able to make new connections, live by myself, and have healthier relationships. I feel like other people have a much easier and get the help they need easily, get what they want (even when they donâ€™t deserve it and are unethical/deceptive about getting what they want) and even have a support network and people who love them, want to help and care about them. But I donâ€™t have that; my family and no one cares if I kill myself, if Iâ€™m raped, abused, chronically ill, hospitalized, or even murdered/commit suicide. Iâ€™m even vilified and made out to be the villain/bad guy. I say this from past experiences (itâ€™s factual, and not thought distortion). Everyone treats me like Iâ€™m an inconvenience, a burden, and with indifference/disdain. Being stuck and trapped in this ongoing cycle of abuse from family and past connections has made me spiral downwards towards suicidal ideation and mental illness. I want to get out, but I donâ€™t know how. The resources available arenâ€™t able to help me, because they are mostly geared towards the homeless/poor. No one takes me seriously nor believes me when I talk about abuse and needing help because I come from a middle/upper class family full of well respected individuals in society. I feel hopeless like Iâ€™ll never live the day where people do love and care about me, and not subject me to ongoing abuse. I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s possible for people to feel positively about me in any way. I feel forever cursed and damned to be treated like shit, hated on, and be met with indifference and/or disdain. Iâ€™m constantly treated that way and told Iâ€™m a burden and worthless too. I just feel heavy and numb - kind of dead inside already.
Iâ€™m tired of hoping and trying to grasp at anything to survive. Iâ€™ve seen it so many times too, people rushing to the aid of others in need. Iâ€™ve helped those around me, but when I need help and everything is falling apart, I have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t have anyone. And if there are people, they had bad intentions/motives and want to make things even worse (reap benefits at my expense). It hurts a lot. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m destined to live my life alone with no person to turn to for help, and no trust, transparency, honestly, respect, intimacy/connection, etc. I feel like I was branded as â€œworthlessâ€, â€œunlovableâ€, and â€œdefectiveâ€ at birth.  Iâ€™m tired of being told to love and respect myself, and set boundaries, etc when Iâ€™ve done all that, and still do. Nothing works. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me, and what I need to do to get a tribe of people who are there for me. Iâ€™ve tried so many times, and really hard. But in the end itâ€™s just a fail after fail. Itâ€™s hard to not feel or believe that Iâ€™m worthless and deserve it, when thatâ€™s the input I get from my family and connections. I feel like Iâ€™m better off dead than dying a slow painful death.
