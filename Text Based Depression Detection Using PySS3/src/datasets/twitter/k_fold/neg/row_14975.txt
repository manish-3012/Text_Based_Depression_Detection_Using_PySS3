I am here because I don't know how to tell anyone about thisMy heart feels cold. I feel so lonely. I have a beautiful family and so many loved ones who care for me, a good job, a wonderful life, and I still feel so miserable. I just want it to all end.

I don't do it because of my girls, my wife and daughter. But fuck it hurts just to live.

Thank you for listening. I really mean that. Thank you.
