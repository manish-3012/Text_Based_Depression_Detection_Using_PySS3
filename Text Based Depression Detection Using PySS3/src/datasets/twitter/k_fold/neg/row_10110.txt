I think itâ€™s almost breaking point.I feel like Iâ€™m stupid for having hope. Iâ€™m stupid for thinking I can get through this and that it the pain will end because it wonâ€™t. Why wonâ€™t it just leave me alone. Why do I keep crying like itâ€™s gonna do fucking shit. Why do I think talking to other people will make it better, when obviously they donâ€™t understand, they tell you just be happy, that life is good, that I am lucky. But would they call me lucky if they knew the pain I felt? They tell me that they donâ€™t want to hear it because it makes them sad, but what about me? They call me selfish because I want to kill myself but why am I selfish when Iâ€™m the one suffering? I hate myself, I hate my life. I hate who Iâ€™ve become because of this. What the fuck is the point? I feel like Iâ€™m trapped here and thereâ€™s only one way out. 
To be honest, Iâ€™m probably gonna do it soon.
Iâ€™ve only put it off this long, because Iâ€™m scared of hurting everyone.
But soon itâ€™s gonna make me not care enough.
