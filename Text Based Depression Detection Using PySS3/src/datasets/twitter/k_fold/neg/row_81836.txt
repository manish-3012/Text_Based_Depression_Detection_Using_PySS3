i'm being refused medication and i can't do anythingi only live for my girlfriend anymore. i know that my death would probably kill her too and i don't want her family to suffer. i can't get depression meds because my parent says it's "not right" for me, even with a diagnosis after spending days in a ward. i can't get a job even though i do well in school. i can't afford anything because we live paycheck-to-paycheck. my girlfriend has to pay for everything. i'm ashamed. i'm horrified that i'm so useless, such a husk, so absolutely terrible at everything in life that i can't get a minimum wage job after revisiting the places three times.   


i just want to leave. i want out. i want to be with my partner forever and that's it. i can't kill myself but i'm seriously considering doing it anyway. i just want to participate and be an individual. i can't have even that.
