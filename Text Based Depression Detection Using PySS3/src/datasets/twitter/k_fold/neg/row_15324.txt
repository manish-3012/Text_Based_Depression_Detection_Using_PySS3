Considering trying to put myself into a psych but want to talk to someone whos been in oneI'm tired of living. I hate myself and everyone around me and I can't do anything right or get much enjoyment out of anything. I've tried to talk to others on this subreddit but none of it does anything for me. I believe if I continue to be around my family and other people I hate I'll end up killing myself anyways so I feel like my only option is a psych ward or suicide but I want to talk to someone who has been in a psych ward as a minor so I can make up my mind on what I want to do but I also don't know If I can be put in a psych ward at 13.
