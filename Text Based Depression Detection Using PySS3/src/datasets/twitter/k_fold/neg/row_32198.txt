I will never know how it feels to be loved...I will never cuddle with someone on a cold day, i will never be viseted when im sick, i will never wake up next to someone that i love, i will never have someone to share my interests with, i will never have someone to travel with, i will never know how it feels to hold hands with someone that actually means it, i will never hug someone that actually wants to hug me. The longer im here the lonnger i suffer and the worse it gets. 



I will never be loved.
