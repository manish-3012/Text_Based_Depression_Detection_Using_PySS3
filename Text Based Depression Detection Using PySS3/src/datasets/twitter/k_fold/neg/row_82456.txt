SometimesSometimes I think about how wanting to constantly kill yourself for years on end isn't normal; that people can function and experience life without their subconscious nagging at them.

Sometimes I think about how people do things for joy and not about how much pain it will give them since they believe that deserve to suffer.

Sometimes I think about how people can just live their life the way they want to without worrying about pleasing others since they used to be seen as "perfect".

Sometimes I think about how people just eat whatever they want and don't restrict themselves since they don't believe that they're just wasting resources and that they might as well rot anyways. I wish my weight plummeted as quickly as my grades.

I'm scared of men but I don't feel that I deserve to be since I haven't been traumatized enough by men that I deserve to be scared, but I'm also slowly becoming scared of women. Yet again I'm scared of any entity that can provide me love since I don't deserve it.

The only reasons why I'm not currently dead is since when my cousin found out I was suicidal he said that it'd be a waste of my parent's money if I killed myself. My brother said it was the "stupidest shit I've ever heard" when he found out I was a lesbian and suicidal on the same day. Also the last time I tried killing myself and my parent's found out my dad didn't know how to react so he told my mom to deal with it and I in turn just got a huge lecture about how I probably think that my mother doesn't love me and I in turn just wanted to die even more.
