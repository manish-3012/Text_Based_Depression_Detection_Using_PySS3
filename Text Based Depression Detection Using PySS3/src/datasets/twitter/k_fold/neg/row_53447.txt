Question about my boss and sexual harassment...I know this isn't the place to ask this sort of question, but I don't know where else to ask and I don't want to make an advice post if this isn't actually a big deal...

I(m18) recently got my first job. My boss(f20~) was asking some questions to get to know me more. She asked if I had been in many relationships, I said no. Someone then made a sex joke and I didn't find it very funny so I didn't laugh. She then said I am 100% a virgin and then went around telling other people I was because I didn't talk about sex or relationships. After that every sexual joke that was said she would make a point of asking me if I 'got it' and then would say loudly "He doesn't get it", even one she made about a fellow employee's daughter (11) being a hooker that I didn't laugh at. Instead of denying being a virgin I walked away each time she said it and she went around asking people if they thought I was 100% a virgin and if I was straight or not. 

What she doesn't know is I was raped as I kid for around 2 years (8-10) and emotionally and physically abused all my life. Thinking about that experience or talking/ thinking about sex too much in general makes me throw up. So I usually avoid it... I don't have many friends and can't make romantic relationships because I have no self confidence. I don't have social medias partly because I was never allowed to, and partly because who would I add? I mentioned not having it and now she and some other employees call me Joe after a serial killer in a show called You. 

Would this be along the lines of sexual harassment or can I just not take a joke? I don't want to bring it up if I am blowing this out of proportion and I definently don't want to tell people about my past or cost someone their job...
