How to overcome suicidal thoughtsI've been suicidal for a few years and I've had fantasies of killing myself for a long while. Back in middle school I used to write poems about suicide and I contemplated writing a suicide note and killing myself. I don't think I have the guts to do it though and I'm not saying that I'll kill myself I just need some advice on how to overcome these thoughts and this suicidal ideation.
