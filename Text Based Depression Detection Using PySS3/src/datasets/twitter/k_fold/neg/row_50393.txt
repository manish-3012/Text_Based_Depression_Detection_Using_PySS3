AppetiteOver the last week I've completely lost my appetite. I plan to die in early February, and the only way I get through the day anymore (aside from the fact that I don't have the equipment yet) is by remembering that i have to keep up appearances so nobody sees any signs of depression. If I die, it's my fault, and I don't need other people wondering what they could've done differently.

Anyway, is loss of appetite normal? This hasn't happened to me before.
