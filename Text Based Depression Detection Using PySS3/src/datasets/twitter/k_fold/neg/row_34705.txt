Help??Hey there, I'm new to this. I just need to let it out.

 My girlfriend doesn't care for me anymore and is always negative towards me. My parents don't seem to care too often and my sister doesn't get me. Lately I have been trouble sleeping and I think it's because I want to hurt myself for not being good enough. There has been times when I try to kill myself but I just break down and cry for days. I realize that I am an insignificance tot this world. I just don't know what to do any more besides die
