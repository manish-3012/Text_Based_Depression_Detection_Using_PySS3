I hate living and Iâ€™m tired of people saying that it shouldnâ€™t be thrown awayI really donâ€™t understand people saying â€œyou shouldnâ€™t throw your life away, it will get better!â€.

Itâ€™s my life and I can do whatever I want with it, including ending it. I tried 4 times and heard it so many times. It never gets better and never will, until I die which will happen sooner or later. Besides, I never asked to be born in the first place.

The only thing I know is emptiness, self-hatred and suffering. Ever since the day I was born, Iâ€™ve been suffering because of birth condition. Then abusive parents, bullying at school. After I tried to get rid of that suffering for 4th time and failed I ran from home. I could barely survive with what I was earning and coworkers were making fun of me. Then I was almost raped, and then got into a relationship which turned out to be a big lie after 3 years. Now Iâ€™m stuck at my exâ€™s apartment without a job, being pushed around and told that Iâ€™m â€œfreeloadingâ€. Even psychiatrist who was supposed to help only cared about making money by prescribing shitty pills that didnâ€™t do anything.

At this point, Iâ€™m done. Not sure when or how itâ€™ll end but I need to have an insurance first, just in case Iâ€™ll mess something up and survive.

I regret that I ever trusted someone like this, even though I knew in the beginning it was a mistake. Humans are monsters and Iâ€™ll make sure to not trust them ever again. They say pretty words - just what you want to hear, how convenient. But as soon as they turn around they make fun of you and make you seem like a bad person instead. Nothing new, I know.
