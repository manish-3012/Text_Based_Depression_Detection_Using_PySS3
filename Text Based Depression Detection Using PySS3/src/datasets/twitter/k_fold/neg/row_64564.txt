I'm going to kill myself at 18I don't want to live as an adult I've already been through so much and just to deal with all the burdens that come with being alive as an adult is too much.
I am going to forget about school and just try and have as much fun as I can until my 18th birthday. voted my birthday because for my 10th birthday my mom missed it because she was in prison and I was in foster care. Every birthday since then I've only been able to cry alone in my room at least I'll have one good birthday. I basically let the strangers and my mother is struggling with money trying to get an apartment for us but that'll just rip me for my friends. I've always dreamed of being a stay-at-home dad with my kids to be a better father than the one that I don't know but I know that's an unrealistic dream. I was in a juvenile detention center a couple weeks back cuz me and my mom got in an argument and she hit me and i pushed her away. I was in the detention center they diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety but the medication for it is very expensive so not getting that anytime soon. I have a very bad astigmatism in both eyes but Lasik eye surgery even glasses are too expensive. about a week ago I ate a pistachio for the first time and was rushed to the hospital because I had a severe allergic reaction to it. the allergies so bad that I would need an EpiPen that gives three times the normal amount of epinephrine cost about $1,200, too expensive. I'm living on the streets of being in foster care I've never gotten to say goodbye to any of my friends. I've never been given closure on anything that I've ever done. everything that I've cared about before has been ripped away from me and I expect that everything will be ripped away from me again. I don't know how I'm going to do it. I just know that I am.
