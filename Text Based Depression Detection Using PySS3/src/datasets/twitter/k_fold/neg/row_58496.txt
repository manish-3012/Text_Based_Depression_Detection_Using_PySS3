I donâ€™t know where else to goTo start, my name is Cora. Iâ€™m trans, 16 years old, bisexual and live in Texas near the coast. Iâ€™ve been depressed for the better portion of my life. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized once in 7th grade, and after that I bottled everything up and rarely told my parents what was wrong. I just never felt close to them.

Fast forward to a year ago, where I realized I was transgender. For weeks all I would do at night was reading on transgender, dysphoria, and the stories of others. About a month later I decided I wanted to get on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) but I knew my parents wouldnâ€™t let me. So I used their credit card to open a paypal account to order the meds myself. The first order wasnâ€™t detected ($200), but the second one set off fraud flags ($800). They searched all of our devices and mine was logged in. I got grounded and isolated for three months. 

Months pass and we arrive to about a month ago. I started hearing voicesâ€”my voice, but not me. There are two, one of which want me to die, and the other who wants me to live. They yell and fight in my head and make me get angry at myself for being so stupid. Then I start hitting myself in the head. Hard. I ended up getting a concussion out of it. The voices are still here today, both wanting something else. Both making my head a warzone.

And the final straw is Iâ€™m going to have to stay with a family that I canâ€™t stand for almost the entire summer, if Iâ€™m lucky I will get an internship with a father of a friend of mine for the last few weeks.

But I canâ€™t keep fighting on so many fronts, so many just in my head. Iâ€™m tired of this constant fight, this constant struggle to wake up the next morning. And I may just give in and OD on some heroin, or use an exit bag, or maybe just a .308 rifle. I just want to talk to someone.
