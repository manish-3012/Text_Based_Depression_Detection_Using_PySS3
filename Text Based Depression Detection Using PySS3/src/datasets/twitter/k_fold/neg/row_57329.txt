At the end of the day nobody really caresIâ€™m tired of trying to fight my depression and anxiety every day. Nobody could give two fucks about me at the end of the day. I see a therapist, but heâ€™s led a completely normal and healthy life. Heâ€™s paid to care about me. Both of my parents are dead. Iâ€™m sure everyone else would move on just fine without me. Shit, I could probably jump off to Alaska and nobody would bat an eye.

The only reason Iâ€™m not going out to buy some rope is my cat. I just adopted him and I donâ€™t want to break his heart and send him back to the shelter. I donâ€™t care if heâ€™ll remember me or not, no animal deserves that after I made my commitment to love him.

I seriously just want to stop therapy and flush my medication. Why should I waste my time when Iâ€™m just going to end up a statistic anyway. Theyâ€™ll say how x and y caused this, but in reality, Iâ€™m just a person that happened to be like this. I canâ€™t fucking change.
