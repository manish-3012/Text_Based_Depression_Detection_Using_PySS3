Why canâ€™t anyone around me just let me fucking die alreadyI fight myself everyday to keep existing in a world I donâ€™t want any part of. Iâ€™m exhausted. So many people in my life tell me that they want me here and theyâ€™re sorry Iâ€™m going through depression and that they love me, but it only makes me feel worse, knowing how many people will be hurt if I eventually kill myself. I envy those everyday who do it.
