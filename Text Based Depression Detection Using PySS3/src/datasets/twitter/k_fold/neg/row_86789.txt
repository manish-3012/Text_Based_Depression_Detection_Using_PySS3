I can't take it anymoreI'm really tired of life, I just wanna end it.

4 months ago, I saw this really beautiful girl in an advertisement. She was Asian and I like Asian girls. But I'm heartbroken knowing what that she doesn't even know who I am, I don't know her name, and I'll probably never see her in person. I don't really see a point in life anymore. If I don't change my mind in a week I guess I'll just kill myself, all alone, and that girl won't even know it. Somebody give me a reason not to, please...

edit: She had long, black hair, beautiful eyes, she was tall, nice shoulders. She was probably the most beautiful woman I have ever seen...
