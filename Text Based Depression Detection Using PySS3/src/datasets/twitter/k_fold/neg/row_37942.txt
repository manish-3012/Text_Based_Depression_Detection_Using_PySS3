What's the point?I feel trapped in my life. I have nothing that I'm looking forward to. I feel as if I'm in this homeostasis: I wake up, do something, go to bed, repeat. Simply put, I don't enjoy my life, nor can I think of a way to make it enjoyable. I live vicariously through fictional characters just so I can get some sort of buzz. 
I figured that my feelings of suicide would drift away once spring break happened, but truthfully the feelings have only intensified. I'm tired of the lectures about how I'm always late and disorganized. I have overdue work. Grades are coming out for some of my classes, and I really don't think it went well. I can't leave my house, and my parents aren't letting me go on antidepressants. 
Part of me just says to buckle down, finish the work, ignore the gradesâ€”fuck it, it's senioritis and my winter depression is something I always have to deal withâ€”but the other part of me just doesn't want to. 
I'm off to college next year, but I have no clue where I'm going. And with my depression happening every year, I'm doomed to keep fucking up. There's no escape from this mundane life. Might as well end it. 
But the really sad thing is I know I won't. I tried three years ago, and being in the hospital was incredibly traumatic (that is, I was assaulted, didn't have a bed, was forced to endure a day without food or water, and had to save somebody mid suicide-attempt because nobody cared or showed up). Ever since then, I've had an intense fear of ever ending up back there again. So I won't do it, because if I fail I'll end up there. But god, I wish I could.
