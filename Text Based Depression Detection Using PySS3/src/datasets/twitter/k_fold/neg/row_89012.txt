Another failed attemptThey caught me and pumped me full of charcoal. Held overnight in hospital. Absolute hell. I don't even want to go home. I finally get peace away from my family here. But I want to die more than ever now. Each and every time I wake up I dread the day ahead. I don't know what I'm gonna do once I get out. I feel so down I think I'm just gonna try again this week.
