Iâ€™m going to buy a gun soonSome people just arenâ€™t meant to live. All of my memories and experiences feel jumbled and disconnected from one another, like it just doesnâ€™t make any sense. I am constantly having flashbacks to mistakes that Iâ€™ve made or embarrassing things that Iâ€™ve done and it feels like Iâ€™m watching someone elseâ€™s life and cringing at how horrible it is.

I want a new beginning and/or a clean end. I want to end this existence and start a life that makes sense. The only way to do that is by killing myself and hoping that thereâ€™s something for me beyond death. But, sometimes it is comforting to think that there is no God because then I wonâ€™t be judged or punished for ending it all, ya know? Maybe thatâ€™s just a little bit of leftover guilt from my Southern Baptist upbringing though. 

Iâ€™m going to buy a gun soon.
