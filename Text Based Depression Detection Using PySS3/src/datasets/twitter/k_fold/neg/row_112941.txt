Obese and realizing I'll never achieve my goal of a normal body. Don't want to live anymore.I hate being fat and always have. But I have zero self esteem, and always end up giving up on a diet. Recently I've been trying my hardest, working out doing all the right stuff. It worked for a little while but then I hit a wall. 

So I did research and came across all these studies saying it's almost impossible to lose the amount of weight I'm trying to lose - 80 pounds, and keep it off permanently. 

Not only that, but even if I did pull off a miracle and lose weight, I'd have a bunch of gross loose skin hanging off me.

I don't want "fat acceptance", I don't want to "love myself the way I am." I hate myself the way I am. I want to not feel self horribly conscious every time I step outside, walk up a flight of stairs without being winded, and be comfortable being intimate with someone. It will never happen.

This isn't a life worth living. I'm gonna get drunk tonight and try to end it. Hopefully I'll be more successful at that.
