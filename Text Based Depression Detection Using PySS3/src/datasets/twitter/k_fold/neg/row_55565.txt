Iâ€™ve lost my mind, and I will soon lose my life (read)Iâ€™m 17. Just a basic summary health anxiety since a child became more prominent 2019 and is severe as of now . But everything feels so real, I may aswell actually have something wrong with me. I canâ€™t get over the fact I have silent sinus syndrome, a very rare condition which causes the eyeball to sink into the skull due to the orbital bones breaking down, but thereâ€™s no painful symptoms hence the silent. Itâ€™s so rare I canâ€™t find information on how common/yearly cases occur. The only treatment is suicide I mean surgery to add prosthesis to fix the appearance. For a month or so my eyelids have changed and have 3 creases instead of 2. Nobody in my family has said anything looks off. Iâ€™ve been doing symmetry tests where I take a picture of my eyes and draw lines connecting at the top eyelash, bottom eyelash etc. about a week ago they seemed fine and my anxiety actually kinda went away. Tonight anxiety just came out to get me. Iâ€™ve taken sone picture tests again and some seem okay, some seem asymmetrical at the bottom eyelash, which is a sign according to google. I refuse to think itâ€™s just â€œcamera angleâ€ and indeed those asymmetrical results I get, are indeed from my eyeball sinking into my skull promoting terrifying and possibly disabling and disfiguring eye surgery. I already suffered from self image issues from me being overweight and just ugly in general, but this one put me in a casket I canâ€™t get out of. Imagine me going to school and classmates hearing how I have a eyepatch on from getting a very rare condition that required eye surgery. My life is ruined. Absolutely no chance at life at all anymore.
