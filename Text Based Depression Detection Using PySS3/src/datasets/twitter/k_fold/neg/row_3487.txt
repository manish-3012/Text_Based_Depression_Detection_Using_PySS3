I wish I could have a cat or something to keep me goingMy dads allergic to dogs and cats, and my parents donâ€™t want to get a hypoallergenic dog or cat bc they think itâ€™s too risky. Iâ€™ve j heard all these stories abt dogs and cats saving ppl from killing them selves and thatâ€™s what I want, but I canâ€™t have any. I j feel so alone and so so tired
