Iâ€™m about to be kicked out of college. Should I just kill myself now?I feel like tried so hard. I tried really hard to make it work, but no matter I always mess it up. I wonâ€™t ever fit in. I wonâ€™t ever amount to anything. Might as well rid myself of this world so I can stop being a burden to everyone around me.
