I'm just pathetic(23M) (fuck covid-19)I've been suicide for almost 3 years now, been planning my death since last year but fucking Coronavirus fucked up my plans. My dad has covid-19 and it's been hell taking care of him,  I love my dad but it's taking a toll on my mom and the only reason why am still alive is if u die my mom and younger sister will be alone, am poor by the way and the situation is just getting worse.
