Iâ€™ve recently turned to alcoholIt works for a while but then you wake up with a hangover which fricken sucks, but it sure numbs the pain, Iâ€™m getting tired of living my life without friends and family, all I want in life is to be a husband and a father but In this world with my capability itâ€™s not possible so Iâ€™m drinking just like my grandpa and my father and my brother all did. I donâ€™t want to kill my self but it seems like an easy way out of this living hell Iâ€™ve been through treatment and counseling and all that before. I just wanna find an ounce of hope thatâ€™ll stop me from doing it.
