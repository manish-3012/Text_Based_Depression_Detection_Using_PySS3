I tried and failed to hang myself twice this week.My mental health isn't as bad as it was when i was younger. 
But I've gotten too tired of fighting it seems like an uphill battle to win.  
I have PTSD, BPD, and Severe Depressional episodes with Psychotic symptoms. 
I have a job, a husband and my own dog and flat, but it still seems more hopeless then ever
