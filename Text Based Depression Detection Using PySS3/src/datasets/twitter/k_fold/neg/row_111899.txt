HowHow do you guys deal with the feeling that you want to die but you cant die. Because you dont want people who love you suffer. 
Like me, I'm the only one in my family who have to make our lives better but now I cant. I suck.  I feel worthless everyday seeing all my friends' lives getting better but look at myself. 
It doesnt mean I dont focus on myself, I do. It feels like I'm in hell. I'm tired of crying every night, I'm tired of telling myself everyday that I'm strong. I dont want to fight anymore. I just want to sleep and never wake up. And I wish everyone forgot me so they wont be sad and suffer. 
I'm sorry that I have to write in here again. But no one understands me in my real life. 
Thank you for reading. Hope you dont judge me. :)
