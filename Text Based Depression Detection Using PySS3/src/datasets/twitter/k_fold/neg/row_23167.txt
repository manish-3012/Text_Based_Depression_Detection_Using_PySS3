suicide would hurt some people I care about. Being homeless or in jail would cause them even more painIn my mind, the case for suicide has become overwhelming. I don't want to hurt my mother by committing suicide. I also don't want to hurt her by being homeless or in jail which is what I am looking at.

I don't think anyone would be happy that I committed suicide but at least there would be some closure. If I end up homeless or in jail, then they have to worry about me for years.

I posted other posts and I am telling you; suicide seems like the logical thing to do.

I can kill myself, people feel bad and I am no longer a concern. Being in jail or homeless, then they have to worry and worry. 

From my perspective, suicide would be doing everyone a favor. 
None of my friends will talk to me anymore because they don't want to hear my depressing story and they can't help me.

The only revenge thing I would like is to have my last job know that I committed suicide, largely because they decided not to pay me.

I am on this drug diversion program but I am so terrified of the police, I really feel like I should kill myself before they have a chance to get me.  It would be really hard to commit suicide in jail. 

I feel like I should do it while I have the chance.

I die, people have a bad day and we are done. If I go to jail or end up homeless, people have to worry for years.

Killing myself is just the right thing to do now.

Christmas coming up is just a bad coincidence.
