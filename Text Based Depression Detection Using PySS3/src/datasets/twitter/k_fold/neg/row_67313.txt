suicidal as hell. lonely and going thru withdrawals. help :(a few weeks ago i decided i would stop taking zoloft (100 mg) cold-turkey; i was tired of feeling so emotionally numb and unimpressionable because of it. but now the withdrawal symptoms are driving me to the point of not wanting to wake up anymore. aside from the withdrawal though, theres just been a lot going on with me lately. i haven't showed up to school in 3 months, i rarely see my friends anymore, i feel alone to the point where not even talking to people makes me feel better, im stressed with all of my school and family issues, and on top of that, my family is giving me insane amounts of shit for everything that's been going on. there's so, sooooo much more than just that, but i'd have to write a book if i wanted to vent about that.

long story short, i don't think i could take this much longer. i'm on the brink of letting go completely. i feel no happiness anymore, i feel like no one gives a shit, and my family/friends don't have the energy to care for me anymore. im done. im so done. i dont feel like i have anything worth living for anymore. i feel loveless. i don't even know why im posting this if im honest. im just tired, man. i can't see myself living past a few months from now, let alone a few weeks from now. i dont think i can put into words what im feeling at the moment. all i can ask for right now is love. i dont even think that could stop from something right now, though. im sorry.
  (im a 17 year old girl. i dont even know what im asking for at this point. im just desperate to feel something. im sorry if this comes off as really emo or anything.)
