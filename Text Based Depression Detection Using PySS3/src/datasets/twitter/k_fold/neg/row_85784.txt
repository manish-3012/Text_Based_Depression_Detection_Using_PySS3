Idk what to do now. I wanna do it, but then Iâ€™m to pussy to do it. I wanna go tell someone, but they probably wonâ€™t believe me. I want to sleep forever, but Iâ€™m forced to get up. I want to cry eternally, but it hurts to cry now. I want to find love, but no one likes me.Itâ€™s not fun anymore. I was alone from the beginning, and I want to be alone again because it feels more right. Iâ€™m too pussy to do it because Iâ€™m scared, I want to do it so badly, I want to be erased from this world. Telling someone is basically not even an option. Theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m joking and make fun of me. I donâ€™t trust my parents as well. I want to sleep but then I have to wake up. If I donâ€™t get up Iâ€™ll get yelled at and Iâ€™ll be broken inside. I canâ€™t take being yelled at because it hurts to hear someone you love, hate you. Iâ€™ve been crying every single day. Silent crying because I donâ€™t want to be questioned as in why Iâ€™m crying. It hurts cause I want to scream and shout and curse, but I hold it all inside. I watch romantic shows because it helps me imagine what it would feel like if I was being loved. I would like a hug from a person who genuinely loves me, but I know that wonâ€™t happen ever in my life. Iâ€™m also very ugly, but then people will say â€œno you arenâ€™t,â€ like shut up, you know that I am and your just using this time to get closer to me. I would like to go on a walk someday to just get kidnapped and never comeback. I mean no one would care to be honest. To the one person reading this whole, I am very impressed. I canâ€™t believe you took time out of your day to read this, and Iâ€™m thankful for that. Iâ€™m happy you read this whole shitshow of a life haha.
