I'm done. I refuse to lose anything else.I lost the love of my life, my wife of 17 years, two years ago. Then I fell in love with another woman that I just knew was God's plan to meet her and be with her. My children loved her as well and my daughter has been emotional about her absence lately. It's too difficult to see her face like that especially over her anymore. It turns out this woman has been using me and leading me on for the past year. For the past month I've been trying desperately to hang on to her with her totally ignoring me, calling me crazy, threatening police action as if I was some random person. She played me and took all my money. She convinced me that she loved me and my kids. Tonight it became crystal clear that she never did love us. I have lost too much at this point. I'm scared to fall in love again and be hurt like this. I've been up all night getting high on coke trying to get the courage to shoot myself. I wanted to do it in front of her to let it sink in that she could have prevented this. But I didn't want to chicken out in front of her so I've driven my truck off into some deep woods and sitting here writing this and just messaged her telling her goodbye for the last time. She definitely doesn't care or believe I'll do it. But I'm seriously hurt and I can't go on anymore. I've thought about this a lot lately. It's a terrible thing to spend too much time alone with suicidal thoughts. But this is it for me. I'm turning the lights out.
