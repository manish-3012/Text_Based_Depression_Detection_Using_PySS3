Want to die but afraid of hurting people around meCurrently a sophmore in college. I feel aimless and canâ€™t fully comprehend whatâ€™s going on in class. I socially isolate myself. I donâ€™t enjoy mixing around with more than 3 people at once because it overwhelms me. The few friends I actually have have told me they would not want to be friends with someone whoâ€™s depressed, so I keep my pessimistic self hidden away when Iâ€™m with them. I tired of this facade and I think the people around me are starting to see through this act because they ask â€œAre you okâ€ whenever I relax and stop acting for a minute. 

My self-esteem is extremely low. I think I look good but the people around me almost never tell me so (except for some compliments from strangers). This leads me to believe that Iâ€™m just delusional and deluding myself into thinking I look attractive even when Iâ€™m not. I donâ€™t think my mom has once called me pretty. In fact,  she tells people Iâ€™m just ok-looking when they tell her Iâ€™m pretty (this really destroys any little self confidence I have) :(
I act aloof in the presence of the opposite sex because I just donâ€™t know how to interact with them. As a result, Iâ€™ve never had a guy friend in my life.

I really canâ€™t see my life improving with my anti social personality and abysmal self esteem. I really just want to end it. Whenever I talk to my parents about feeling suicidal they just shut me down and ignore it. My mom once cried and told me to just stop talking about it and my problems. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t trust therapists enough to confide in them. I just wish I could die without hurting anyone.
