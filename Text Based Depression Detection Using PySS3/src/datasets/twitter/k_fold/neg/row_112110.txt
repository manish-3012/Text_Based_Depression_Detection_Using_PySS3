When will the pain stop?This pain is never ending and it spikes up and down constantly. Let me tell you how I got to my breaking point and why I want to kill myself. 

It all started when I became fully aware of my surroundings and was able to understand how people acted at a age then I dont remember now but it was around age 6 or 7 but im unsure as i am almost 20M now and had so much happen between then and now. In elementary I noticed everyone saying the same thing about me over and over, saying how I was a good kid, followed the rules and was everyone's friend  but I just understood why the rules were there and I was an extremely small child so I had to make friends so people could see me then for some reason when a teacher told me I acted mature for my age I finally understood why teachers acted the way they did because as kids they assumed we weren't aware of our surroundings. Back at home my uncle and his girlfriend lived with us..i remember one night I heard so much screaming that I woke up and opened my door and saw all the adults going at it and when they saw me they calmed down and my uncles girlfriend told me to go back to sleep and i did. Still to this day i dont understand why i automatically woke up and went to see what was happening when none of my sisters or my didnt do the same with me.. i wasn't aware of anything wrong with me then

When middle school hit thats when understood more about my surroundings then I should have, I was worried about so much that a middle schooler shouldn't of been worried about. I was thinking of college, love and life after 18 years of age. This is where my depression kicked in, I was bullied for everything, the way I dressed, the way I looked, the way I talked and I was also terrified for my life because everyday someone got jumped and i was scared I was next. I was bullied for all 3 years of my middle school life and it was constant, I had became self conscious about my body, i stopped talking to people and only talked when I was called in on class and the not talking got so bad I became non verbal for a few weeks before I realized I needed to talk. Everyday at middle school was the same I wake up at 6:30 get dressed, go to school, get bullied, eagerly wait to come home and start the day over again. I picked up a habit of playing video games to escape from reality but the pain didn't stop when I left school...there was so much pain at home I just wanted to run away to the military. My family was never a good family, my half brother had anger issues and always fought with my mom and dad then even a few times the cops had to be called so they eventually sent him to live with his real dad in another state. My uncle was still living with me at this time but he had been in and out of jail multiple times and the cops have constantly been watching my house. My uncle just like my brother has anger issues and got into it with my mother over his use of drugs around me and my siblings. Everytime they argued I hid from every one or i just turned the volume up on my game to drown them out. By this time my parents been arguing constantly. Something was bugging me that I couldn't figure out but I had a feeling something was wrong with me.

High school hit and I realized i was actually alone in this world. My parents argued, yelled and threw stuff everyday. I over heard my mom say we were going to be taken away. I accepted my depression by now and I knew I needed help but I didn't trust anyone as I knew they would say it was just a "phase" or it was "hormones" but that really didn't make sense when it came to my depression. When coming to highschool my friend group's split into smaller groups and i just floated between each of them because i never felt welcomed, every group had its own personality and they never matched mine so I just ended up being by myself and because of my lack of social interaction my depression sky rocketed. When in highschool I joined jrotc and I liked it because it gave me a family that actually cared about me and there was no yelling everyday. By sophomore year I realized i was smarter then my family I lived with and I saw my mother as a helicopter parent while my dad spaced himself from my mom as his side of the family had a falling out with her. Junior year is when I held a knife above my heart not once but three times in hopes that I would just kill myself, I went through my first heartbreak that left me scarred, she ended it after two weeks saying we should take a break and come back but I knew she was lying because this new guy came to our school and every girl was after him because he looked good and was tall while i was short and only cute enough to look at but not cute enough to talk to as i remember multiple girls saying behind my back. Then came senior year...i was buillied and hazed by not three students but  two teachers and 2 principles all because i stood up for myself when those three girls did wrong and in return I was forced to read a book and write about what I read everyday for a week until the principles came in and accused me of things but I never tried to defend myself because I knew they saw me as a kid and I knew my voice wasn't going to get heard. Senior year is when I dated this girl who is still to this date the reason I will kill myself. I loved this girl so much that I saw through her flaws and loved her regardless, I changed her life when I started dating her because she had dad issues, she was raped, smoked weed and drank but I helped her get through all of that. When I was dating her during my senior year my mom didn't allow me to do anything with her, I couldn't go places without a parent and if i went over to her house I had to be in a living room because they were afraid of me having sex but I listened to my mom. When my sister who is a few years younger started dating someone my mom put her on birth control and said dont have too much fun while I was stuck making sure it was okay for me to go somewhere with my girlfriend before I went. After the first month of dating my  girlfriend she forced me into having sex with her she did so by making her mom go get us food so I would be pressured into it...I didn't know what I was doing so I feel for it. After the first time we had sex it was not to long before she manipulated me into having sex each time I was at her house which last every week before I went to college. During this time before college she abused me physically for her entertainment but I always thought that she did it cause she loved me. My body soon became numb to all of the sex and abuse. I didn't know who to talk to because I didnt trust my parents because of fear of them screaming at me and I didnt confront my girlfriend because I was afraid she'd hit me and blame me for her actions like she has done.

College came and my life got worse. I was finally free from my mom and I didn't know what i could do but at the same time I still felt trapped because I was still being abused. When coming to college I was abused mentally by my girlfriend because she thought I was going to cheat on her but that didn't make sense and I thought it was an excuse to leave me but I forgave her but the mental abuse kept happening and my mom made it worse everytime I came back from college on break i still had a curfew and I couldn't spend the night with my girlfriend because she didn't trust us but she trusted my sister who she put on birth control. Second semester of college came and we broke up then the next day she told me she had sex with someone and felt bad and wanted to get back with me. The very next i hit the lowest point in my life so far...(I am in ROTC so we have PT) the next day after PT I just laid on my floor after my workout for hours until I had class then after class I went back and laid on my floor in my dorm few weeks later I got back with her and she continued to abuse me and blame me for her actions. Second year of college hit and i suffered a mild concussion i couldn't talk to anyone about my feelings as I never knew how to express them but I was alone with my thoughts with my concussion and I expressed everything to my girlfriend and she accused me of so much and yelled at me for getting a concussion...later that month I asked her to come visit me because I needed someone to hold but then she just ended up hitting me on the head because I wasn't comforting her. A few months after that when I went to do field training with ROTC I broke up with her when I came back and from their my concussion did not heal and its effects ruined my grades and I didn't know how to cope so my body shut down and I lived on a day to day basis with me hating myself. By this time the COVID-19 virus had struck and sent us back home. When I got sent home I finally realized what was wrong with me.

Since I broke up with her I started talking to her and hooking up with her in hopes to get back with her but all I was left with was a broken heart and a broken mind from her using me.

I still am recovering from my concussion and still trying to cope with the abuse, I am now fully aware of what's wrong with me i sit and i observe every single little detail about people and make mental notes  of how people act, i change up how i act and talk around people based on how i score their intelligence on a range from high to low, i see patterns in people and things that no one else sees, i understand how persom acts as an individual and in society and i use that to get what i want sometimes.

I have also discovered that there is a high chance I was misdiagnosed with aspergers at a young age and how I figured this out was I looked at everyone in my family tree and found out what mental illness runs where to what I have and I have came to a conclusion that I might have a personality disorder as I mentioned previously that I knew something was wrong with me besides the depression and abuse.

With all of this happening I struggled and continue to struggle with sleeping because I hug when I sleep and need something warm to hug so I can sleep better and I have also became very sensitive to yelling and loud noises that I tend to just shut off when someone yells or a loud noise disorients me.

I don't want to get help because I know it will ruin my future as I want to serve the country and I want to design things in my future, my parents don't know any of this because I know they won't understand because they have not helped me with mental health at all in the past.


I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense as my mind is very cloudy and i was going to kill myself tonight but that voice in my head saved me once again and told me it will get better but im at my breaking point because each time that voice told me not to do it and it'll get better it just ended up getting worse and worse. It's just like my life is the definition of bad luck and I was destined to kill myself. 

So with that being said, I am in constant mental pain and I want to ease the pain but I don't want to pop pills, drink or harm myself so I'm just stuck in a circle of pain.
