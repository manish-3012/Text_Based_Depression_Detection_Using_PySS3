I canâ€™t do this anymoreGod I really fucking tried
 Thereâ€™s no point anymore
My husband is miserable
I feel I have made no leeway with my stepson
My work is becoming too much
Iâ€™m a teacher and they donâ€™t care if we die from this pandemic 

I am stuck, and I keep making everything worse
I do all this research on how to have healthy conversations 
All this work on how to better my mental state

And it ends up failing every time.
Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re miserable and angry.
I wish I could take it all away for you. I do. I wish I could help everyone thatâ€™s hurting. I canâ€™t. And when I try, it hurts people more.

Iâ€™ll do it tonight.
Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t help my loved ones. 
But I canâ€™t do this anymore.
I donâ€™t see a point in living. 
I think itâ€™s now becoming more of a burden to live. 

When I share my feelings
Or try to show empathy
It takes a lot to do so
But it just sounds selfish

God I wish it were different guys, I really do. 
I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m reaching out to you all.
Maybe because itâ€™s anonymous
I donâ€™t want anyone to really know

I deactivated all my social media
I donâ€™t want anyone posting on my pages when Iâ€™m gone

I donâ€™t think people would care right now
Everyone is wrapped up in their own lives

If you are able to, please thank your support system if you have one

I did have a decent one, but I canâ€™t help but feel I have failed them too

Iâ€™m sorry.
