Giving upI'm done. I'm sick of being nothing but a stain on humanity. I'm tired of both my own pain and being a burden on others. I've already taken two sleeping pills with alcohol, and have 18 more waiting. Hopefully that will be enough. I'm terrified. I know that my family would be better off without me. I don't know that this is the right place for this, and I don't even know if I can really do it, but... I have tried to reach for help with nothing to show for it. I don't even really know why I'm posting on this sub.
