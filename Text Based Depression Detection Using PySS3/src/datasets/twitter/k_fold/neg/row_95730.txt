I wish I could take the place of innocent terrorism victims who want to liveSeeing all these attacks, in London, in The Hague,  people being randomly stabbed to death. It makes me wish I could take their place, so that the fact that I want to die can at least be put to good use, and let those strangers who had so much to live for continue their lives and get back to their loved ones. I wish there was just a button to switch places with those people, to make an otherwise meaningless death become at least somewhat useful :(
