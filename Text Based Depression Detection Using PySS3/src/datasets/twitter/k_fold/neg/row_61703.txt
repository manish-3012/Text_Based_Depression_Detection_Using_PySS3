Everything is falling apart and no where left to turnToday I asked my best friend if they wanted to talk ( through call ) and said they were busy ( which is completely fine ) so I asked if they would want to later and they went off on me. Saying how their life didn't revolve around me and should deal with my stupid problems on my own and how I was never worth it to them and never should have been friends. My family is going through a divorce over my abusive dad and everything is going wrong and I just want it to end. I have zero friends who care enough to help me, my family barely notices I'm here.  I've tied a noose and can't bring myself to do it. I'm just too much of a coward and a failure and I know I should just do it but I can't.
Please help
