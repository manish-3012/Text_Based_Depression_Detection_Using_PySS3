It's been a good run.I have absolutely no one left to talk to anymore so this is where I get to have my last say. I've had a very good life and could not complain except the fact that I fucked everything up. I have had the best possible life I could ask for. 
I messed up everything good that came to me and I was never thankful, took everything for granted and today when I'm at my loneliest point I am not crying anymore. It doesn't seem to help anyways. 
To everybody that I've ever met I apologise for being a really shitty person and I dont blame anyone for it. I was always pretending to be someone I'm not and I deserve to die. I pushed everyone away for reasons I can't explain, I'm just really worse than what anyone could have imagined. I now await my useless body to be found by someone. I have absolutely no regrets left, I've been there and I've done that. I know it might seem as I'm bitching about a perfect life but that's just me always bitching and complaining about everything be it good or bad. Never trusted anyone and this is where it's come to just me and my anxieties. It's about time I live my last day as the true me not an isolated anxious piece of shit. 
To my family - I could never tell you how depressed I was when you sent me away, you took a leap by trusting me and all I did was blind sight you and lie about everything. I'm sorry. It's best for you if I'm not around so you can focus on the others and hope they don't turn out like me. I failed you and you were the best anyone could ever ask for. 

Thank you to anyone reading this.
