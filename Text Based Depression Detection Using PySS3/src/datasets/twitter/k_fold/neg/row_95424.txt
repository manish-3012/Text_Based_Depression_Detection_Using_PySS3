I went on an amazing 2 year detour from my life path and now I've been grabbed and planted kicking and screaming back on the determined routeMy life until 18 was a certain path towards misery.

I met her shortly after I left school, for 2 years it was beautiful, we went on so many adventures, we did so many things I never dreamt I'd get to do.

I had nobody but it never mattered because I had her.  I turned 21 this year and things had been declining in my life.

Now she's gone for good because I pushed her away and ruined it, and it really is over this time, it's not like the past where we came back from things. 

I'm alone again, I feel like I'm getting slower and stupider and uglier. And the beautiful mask I had created has shattered and can't be worn again because I know it to be a lie.

I am finished. I can't be mediocre, I can't love again after having the best, anything else would seem like less.

I can not accept mediocrity in my life of any sort, but now I'm destined for it. And I choose the way out instead of a slow slide towards eternal misery and a wasted life.
