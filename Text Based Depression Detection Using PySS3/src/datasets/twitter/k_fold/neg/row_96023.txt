Time to have some peaceMy last attempt was in December, it was technically successful because I died for few minutes, but I was already at the hospital so I was revived. I was put into an induced coma and on a ventilator while they cleared out my body of all the crap and fixed me up. My time in the coma was the worst fucking thing I have ever experienced. The dreams, hallucinations and being trapped inside my body, it makes me shudder just thinking about it, it was the absolute worst. 

I woke up 2 weeks later with no clear memory of the past few months and I dont even remember taking the overdose, ive just pieced together from what people have told me, but I know I was planning it for a long time. 

I was placed in a mental ward for a few weeks over Christmas and New year and I fucking hated it. Being away from my family and my dog and my boyfriend. Being surrounded by so many people, being trapped inside a small unit. It was awful and I lied to get out as quickly as possible. For a few weeks I had loads of help and support from the mental health team and my medication was changed and things seemed to be okay. But now I have no contact with the mental health team. I have no support, no treatment, no care. 

My mum lost her job because of what I did and has ptsd from the whole thing. Basically I fucked everything up for my whole family and destroyed my boyfriend. Instead of this motivating me to live to protect them all it makes me feel more suicidal because I hurt them so much and I need to be punished. Im just making everyones lives harder and harder and im such a drain. I cant work right now and my mum only works part time to try and look after me and keep me safe. My boyfriend is really struggling with life and im so terrified im going to lose him to suicide too. Im trying to help him but he just ignores me or gets angry with me whenever I try. He is all that's keeping me going at the moment but knowing he is in so much emotional pain makes me break down and scream with pain. 

I dont want to live in a world where people suffer so much. I can take my own suffering becuase I desevre to be punished, but I just cant take liviing in a world where everyone else is suffering so much. Ive seen my worst triggers are seeing others suffer, whether they are friends or strangers...it just makes me desperate to die and escape this evil fucking world. And all the people I talk to are struggling so im just permanently being triggered by them and my boyfriend.

But I dont want to hurt anyone like I did in december, I dont want to ruin my mums life, upset my dad and hurt my family. I dont want my boyfriend to kill himself because I did. I dont want to leave my dog. I dont want to hurt everyone but I cant fucking do this anymore. Im so exhausted of the fighting and trying to be strong for everyone else. Im tired of pretending im okay. Im tired of saving everyone else and protecting everyone while no one gives a shit about me and how I feel.

Im not risking surviving an overdose again so this time it will be under a train. 

I want to say goodbye to my boyfriend, I want one last hug, one last kiss, to just be in his arms and breath in his scent. But If I do he will stop me from acting on this. I cant say goodbye to anyone or they will know whats happening and stop me. Im fucking scared. part of me wants to go to my doctor and tell her how Im feeling but I dont want to be locked up again. I know part of me must want to survive or I would have gone ahead and done it instead of writing here looking for someone to talk to. 

Im so afraid, I dont know if I should reach out for help, go ahead and go under a train or just lay in bed and cry and ignore the world and wait for natural death. I really dont want to hurt anyone, and seeing how worried everyone was in decemeber briefly made me want to live. But now im self harming again and the voices are back and im not having any treatment or help and it all just seems like the end...

Im sorry for bothering anyone, I just feel so alone and terrified and I guess im looking for some comfort in talking to others.

Sending my love to you all &lt;3
