Appreciation for suicide hotline operatorsI have been violently depressed for a month or so now (these times come and go amid a general depression that started a long time ago). I talked with two good operators lately, thank you to them. They tried to understand what I was saying, and even when they didn't quite get it, I could tell they were trying. And I could tell they were trying to not judge me. They're human, they can only try, and they work an emotionally taxing job, especially on the nightshift. Whenever I'm unreasonably bad, at those times talking with an operator is a chance to practice being decent to somebody. It can return me to my senses, restore my empathy. I'm also so lonely so I appreciate the conversation. So thank you to all hotline workers&lt;3
