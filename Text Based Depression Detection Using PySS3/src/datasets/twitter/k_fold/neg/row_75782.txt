I am sick of people telling me to hang on because they want me to deal with this all my life. Goodbye!I fucking hate this life. This curse has been getting worse and worse for 5 years now and I am done. Everyone I have tried to tell always ends up saying "Just hang on for me. It gets better". No. It fucking doesn't. This is chronic pain that paralyzes me every day and I am done suffering.
