Can't right a wrong, but don't want to leave my brother alone.It appears as if I have hurt someone badly when I was drunk and likely having a depression induced psychotic break. They've done what I concede to be the right thing and got the authorities involved. 

I don't want to be afraid of my self or what I can be, I don't want to be the socially awkward idiot. I don't think I can keep up the charade any longer I can't keep wearing that smile. 

I'm just worried for my family, in particular my mother and brother.
My Mother is somewhat lonely (I still live with her as do 2 siblings) and has already in her life suffered the loss of one child due to complications upon birth, she's never been lucky in life and I fear it might break her. 

I'm worried about my brother because he has worse anxiety than me and also suffers from depression. I am his only friend. We have always been very close and I'm so worried for him. I love him so much.

It's just not fair to have to keep living when you desperately don't want to for the sake of others, I'm pleading for a type of euthanasia more than anything else. I don't want to suffer this pain any longer. Like most on this sub it's not that I want to die it's that I don't want to exist.

Legitimately just asking for ways I can make this easier for them. I love them so much and they love me too.
