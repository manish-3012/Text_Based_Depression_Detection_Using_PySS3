I don't want anythingEveryone hates me. I have a really good life. I worked very hard with this small business I started.. I'm self made and used to work minimum wage. Now at 22 I own a house and a car. I'm in good shape, good looking. But over the past few months everything fell apart. No friends or family, not sure how much of that is my fault anymore. I could fix it all. But I am so depressed I don't want to do anything. Everyone hates me and should. I'm throwing it away. I worked hard and deserved to get it, that's what they don't know. It's just I'm a shell of that person now. I don't know how to be the way I was before. It was easy then. Now everything is so hard. I want to want things but then again I don't... Because I honestly don't want anything anymore, not even to just survive.
