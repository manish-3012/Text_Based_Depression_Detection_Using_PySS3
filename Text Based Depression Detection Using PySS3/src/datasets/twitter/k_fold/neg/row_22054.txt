There's literally nothing leftThere's nothing to do, no social interaction, not aloud out of the house, nothing to look at, nothing to care about, everything that gave me even the slightest will to live has been cancelled, everything I've worked for hasn't worked out, I have nothing left keeping me away from doing it, and subtle cries for help never worked, I just want someone or something to distract me, and recently it's been self harm, and I hate myself for it, and it contributes to it even more, but the only way to get away from the fact I'm hurting myself to distract myself is by hurting myself to distract myself.

I just want this to end any way possible, I don't even care anymore, and none of my friends or family would miss me or even notice at this point, much less care to help.

The only people who helped me I can't see because of this whole Corona thing, which stresses me out even more, because I don't want to see the people I care about get hurt, even if they don't care if I do.

They always tell me it will get better but life only gets harder from here, and if I can't take the tiny bit of stress from my life then there is no hope for my future.
