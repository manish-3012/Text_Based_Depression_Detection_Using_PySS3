Burned my old suicide note last nightHaven't posted on here before but I want to remind everyone that there is hope. I wrote my suicide note on the 6th of May, and I was fully convinced that I was going to kill myself that night. Nearly three months later and I found it again. It was almost like a fresh start when I started burning it, though I couldn't change it, I could try to move on. I'm not saying I won't feel sad or numb again, that's just stupid, but every time you are on the edge you get stronger. Whether you realise it or not.
