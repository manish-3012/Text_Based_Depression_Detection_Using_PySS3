My own family has turned their backs. I'm heading to the bridgeMy own family has turned their backs. I paid for a hotel room last night Soo I could have a place to shower and a bed to sleep in with my last money, and she I was 50 dollars short for just the damage deposit my mother said no way and hung on up on me. I'm done. I'm sick and homeless and out of my mind. My suffering won't end and I am totally alone.
