1 pmwoke up maybe 15-20 minutes ago. thought about doing it on Friday and last night but didn't happen. tonight i might do it. 

i can't deal with this and nobody understands. if i don't do it i know ill end up feeling the same way.

i talk to a nurse once a week, but need to wait a week each time until the next meeting is which is sometimes harder than usual. 

i don't have any friends, i know one person i type to sometimes and my parents are still alive. they're not that old yet though. (63 and 68) 

everything is pointless and meaningless. it would been better if i wasn't alive. i wouldn't been a burden to anyone anymore then. i don't want to leave and hurt my parents but really cannot do this shit anymore.

turning 29 this year and i'm a huge failure as a person and i'm definitely not smart or good looking. never been and never will be. i don't have an education. i tried getting my math grades up twice but couldn't. only had 2 jobs or so. cleaning jobs. never want do job with that again.

nothing is interesting or fun. everything feels meaningless and meh. everyday i wish i wasn't here.
even lost my apitate. i do eat.. kinda. but not as before. even if i eat everything taste the same and just, pointless. ive lost another 2 kilos. which is needed anyway. im around 81 kilos now. was almost 93 or 95 before.
