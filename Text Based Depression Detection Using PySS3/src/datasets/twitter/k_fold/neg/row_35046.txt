On edgeI keep trying to fix all thatâ€™s wrong with my life right now but itâ€™s so damn hard to fix things he problems you created because youâ€™re too depressed to care. I feel like Iâ€™m constantly on edge and constantly about to break down if someone even asks me whatâ€™s wrong. My sadness is starting to come out in anger and I donâ€™t like being angry towards others. So it comes back to me. This is the point where I feel the need to self harm even though I was doing better. My fucking world feels like itâ€™s falling apart again after I tried so hard to get better. Iâ€™m in the edge, right on the line of still trying and trying to make things better, but I so badly want to just fucking jump full force and give up
