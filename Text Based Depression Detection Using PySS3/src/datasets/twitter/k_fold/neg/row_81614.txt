Weird episode: my drunk self wanted to commit AND save me from suicide at the same time (xpost r/madover30)I feel like Iâ€™m going insane.
I got drunk and kept telling myself â€œI wanna dieâ€
Went into the kitchen and got a knife. I literally told myself â€œno no you fucking idiotâ€ Then I crawled back into bed. 
Then I got back up again to get the knife again. Told myself  again that I was an idiot for thinking this.
I think I did this about 3 times.
I think Iâ€™m going insane guys.
