Depression has overthrown my life. Is there a way to combat this or should I just accept my fate?Recently, I lost my dog who was my best friend, lost my dream job, and lost my will to live for others. I live to make others happy but nobody wants to return that respect to me. I find myself waking up every morning filled with sadness and wanting to end it all. Iâ€™ve effectively ruined my relationship with my girlfriend who also suffers from BPD, and severe general anxiety. I donâ€™t want to be near anyone anymore and my girlfriend is sort of a large reason to that. She doesnâ€™t want to be alone since I made her move from her only friend who ended up disowning her. I have dedicated my whole life the past year to making sure she and our cats be fed. But I donâ€™t want to put effort into anything anymore. I donâ€™t have a future, I have to put myself as self employed since I worked as a contractor and nobody wants to hire me around where I live (I used to travel 2 hours to my dream job) because of my past. I donâ€™t see much of a future. I donâ€™t want to see much of a future. Everybody thinks I hate them even if I explain that Iâ€™m just sad and donâ€™t want to be near anybody and want to help my girlfriend reach her full potential. What do I do? Do I just give up and drive my car 100 MPH into a tree? Or do I find a potential path for myself? Any further questions I will happily answer with further details to give some insight to where I go from here.

Iâ€™m writing this drunk, because I wouldnâ€™t normally have the confidence to spill my sadness into the internet for help. I just hate my life and feel bad about everything I do.
