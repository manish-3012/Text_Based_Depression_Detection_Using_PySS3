This is might just be my last weekI have tried everything i can to sort my problems but i guess its a sign that i should just give up . Eveyone makes fun of me because i was sick and my 2 years in school were wasted . I cant study at all , i cant do anything. No matter how much motivated i get sometime but this motivation to work hard goes away whnever i think that My old school mates are in Universities now . Im a loser , Im a failure , everyone around is successful but Im not .
 I work hard but Still i fail at everything idk why people say that dont be afraid of failure but right now this failure is the reason i wanna end this life. I cant take it anymore . Suicide is the only option left for me . I really dont want to do it because of my parents  , i love them , if i killed myself theyll have to face so much emberassment in this society thatll be so terrible . But again I just want to end this pain because i literally cant do shit.  I cant even  sleep properly . Every morning i always get stressed out. I cant take it anymore :( . Saturday is day i am gona do it ...
