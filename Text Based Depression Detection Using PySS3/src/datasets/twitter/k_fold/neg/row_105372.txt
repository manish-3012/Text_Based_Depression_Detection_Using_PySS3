How can you say life is going to get better?I feel like I have it all and have nothing at the same time.  I have all the material goods that I could have ever asked for.  My parents care for me and do things for me that they don't even have to.  But I feel completely empty.  I'm socially awkward (self diagnosis).  I can't interact with people unless I've been sitting next to them in class for the whole year.  I try to make friends, but nope, this awkward sophmore in highschool can barely interact people without the situation getting awkward.  As an obvious result, I have never had a girl to call my own.  Hell, the only people that have hugged me in my existance are my parents.  As a result from all of this, I feel completely lonely and alone in this world.  I feel no one gets me or ever will.
I'm a so-so student.  Everyone says I'm incredibly smart, but I don't aplicate myself.  I go out of my ways not to do schoolwork and procrastinate.  I'm never productive except for my old job.

Couple of questions I would like to ask.  
Why do you guys want to prevent others from killing themselves?
Why does anyone care not in direct relation to the person want them to prevent that?
Why does the government even care.
It's not like there is a point to living.  We are all just matter composed and designed over billions of years of design.  So what.  Our existence's only purpose is to create existences of more people.  If i'm never going to reproduce, doesn't that make my life pointless and worthless?  

Also why would people want to live if they were in my situation.  Life ahead of me is just going to be composed of awkwardness, anxiety, embarrassment, struggles, misery and more pleasant things like that.
