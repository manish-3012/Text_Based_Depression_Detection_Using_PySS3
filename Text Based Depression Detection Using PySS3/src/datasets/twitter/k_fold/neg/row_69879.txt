If I catch covid I might consider ending itI'm freaking the fuck out right now because everyone is catching covid and dying. Hospitals are full and I don't wanna take up another bed. I also don't wanna have to deal with the effects 10-20 years in the future.

I barely ever leave my house and I always wear a mask if I do. The only way I would catch it is through my parent (an essential worker) or passing by a neighbor or someone on the street. It seems as safe as you can get but with almost everyone having it now it almost feels inevitable. I'm scared. I don't want to have to deal with this.
