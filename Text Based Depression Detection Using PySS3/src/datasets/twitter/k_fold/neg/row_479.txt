I don't know why I'm even writing thisI don't even know where to start... I guess, I feel guilty for even writing this. I keep telling myself I don't feel that bad, I should get over myself, I have friends who feel worse than I do... And then it all just escalates and keeps on escalating until I tell myself I deserve to die... I don't want to die, I'm terrified of death, but at the same time I also feel so indifferent. Whenever I think of death I feel terrified and then I feel bad because I should want to die.

It's gotten to the point where I have thoughts of just ending it. My  brothers both have really busy schedules, to the point where I'm left alone by myself all the time. I've decided exactly how I would do it, and where. I just haven't ever decided when. I want to live so bad... But I'm scared I guess... I don't feel alive. I don't even know what I want. For a long time I've told myself I'm not depressed, I'm just making myself think I am, but then I wrote my mom a note about wanting to see a therapist for another problem I have and it all came flowing out I realized how badly I need help, but I don't have the courage to actually make anything happen.
