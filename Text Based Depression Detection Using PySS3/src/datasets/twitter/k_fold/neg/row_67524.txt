Sound of failure is QuietListen, if this is formatted weird or whatever, I apologize. This ended up getting typed up as a letter on the memo pad on my phone. When i copy and pasted it here, it inserted like html or something? No idea. Hope it isnt too hard to read?


Let me tell you where I stand. A horrible father, a horrible husband. What the fuck is wrong with me? What the fuck am I going to do? I fucked us all over. 5 people that counted on me, that looked to me for direction. I am thankful my kids are much too young to understand the position we are in. My wife hates me now. Almost 7 years of progress, down the tubes. From homelessness in the snow, refusing to go to a shelter because they&amp;apos;d split us up. I remember the love we had, that we&amp;apos;d rather sit huddled up in the trees in 7 degree weather in blinding snow overnight without a blanket than be split up for a couple hours at the shelter. I remember when it was genuine when she told me she loved me, we were so young. Married at 19, she was 18. I fell for her instantly. Now that phrase is just used as a formality, the same way you&amp;apos;d say &amp;quot;bless you&amp;quot; to someone that sneezed on the bus. I remember when she was so perfect, when I was her everything, and she was mine. There was nobody in the world but her. No family, no friends, no mom or dad to cry and plead to. We did it together, we know the struggle and we made it together. I still think of those cold nights, even miss them sometimes, where we would have killed for a sip of whiskey to keep warm. God it was miserable but the love was so real. I miss that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now all we do is fight. She yells at me, talks down to me. I don&amp;apos;t blame her. I&amp;apos;m a fuck up. I cracked big time under pressure more than once. I can&amp;apos;t keep it together. This isn&amp;apos;t the first time. I deserve all of it, if you ask me, I don&amp;apos;t get enough.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We got off the streets and had kids. We both worked our asses off to give them everything. I remember walking 4, 5 miles home, soaked to the bone in the middle of winter after washing dishes for 12 hours every day 6 days a week, getting home to change and then going to another job, and then another. No idea how I did it without meth haha. But it was no problem, I was proud to be amongst the millions of the WORKING poor class who&amp;apos;s story is like mine, because for every guy like me, there were 10 other people on the street median holding their kids as objects to gain sympathy with a sign in hand. Fuck them. I&amp;apos;d rather my kids learn how to get a job, than have them learn how to write tearjerking signs on cardboard. What productive members of society will they be?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ah then things got hard. Obamacare, hour cuts, layoffs. It hit the job I had at the time hard. From 40 hours a week down to 32, overnight. My wife was completely let go of hers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And it just got tougher. The animosity grew. The stress level rose. Anxiety took hold of me like a motherfucker. After all these years of working for no gain, which is fine, at least we didn&amp;apos;t starve, at least we had a place of our own, I find myself doing the most ridiculous things. Paranoid. Always dreading something. 

I laugh about it a little. Some of the things I do. For some reason, Im scared to be seen by the neighbors. No rational reason why. When I need to go to the store to buy milk, I wait until after midnight and I&amp;apos;ll sit by the curtain and watch for up to a half hour to make sure no one is outside. Then I sneak down the stairs and powerwalk to the street corner out of view. Hahahah

So the issue at hand.... my wife and I live in a tourist town. Just for discretion sake, I wont say where. But we both had seasonal jobs. We both got cut loose in January. Havent been able to find work since. Pisses me off because I am employable and WANTING to work. I know how to work, I know how to find a job. Just never get any bites when I need it the most. 

Wife stresses out. I understand why. Late Feb comes, rent statement. So far behind. What the fuck. As the man, I pretend to be calm and collected. She cries. Talked about how we hae been living here for over 3 years and now its over. Its okay. I will take care of it. She says I know you will.

I walk to the day labor spot, every day. Scarce work. But thats my solution to everything. Work it off. Didnt realize the 40 bucks a day, 3 days a week wasnt adding up.

Started going door to door on days I wasn&amp;apos;t getting sent out and asking everyone if I could clean their yards or other shit like that for 10 bucks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
March 2nd hits. 3 day notice, pay or quit. For some reason, they never filed with the court because we made it to about the 12th when we got our tax money. Paid it all off. Relief. And I still had some money left over to buy a car. A luxury we never bad before. People don&amp;apos;t realize how much the job market opens up once your mobile. Had a revoked license I had to take care of. But I had 2 job offers from the neighboring city about 45 minutes away paying significantly more than what I ever made down here. The job I really had my eye on was even cool enough to hold the position open for me til I got my license squared away. No problem, looked at it like an investment for our future. Fuel pump burns out when my wife drove it. Then the battery died too. Maybe from overcranking it when the car wouldn&amp;apos;t start? I dunno. Now I have a paperweight that can fetch about 175 at the scrapyard. But I am pretty scared to let it go because if we end up on the street, would be nice to have something to sleep in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then the lights go out. Fuck. That&amp;apos;s right. They trusted me to take care of everything. How the fuck could I forget that? With kids in the house, my hands were tied. I had to pay it. No payment arrangement. They want it in full. Down another 375. We are in line for state utility assistance, but normally don&amp;apos;t get approved til the end of April because they give you one lump sum on your food stamp card to pay something like 6 months worth. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;apos;m such a fucking moron. Fuck, I thought I had it all figured out. Now we have nothing. They eat well, food stamps are generous. But fuck, I should have known better. Why didn&amp;apos;t I know how to do simple budgeting? I normally keep track of every single penny in the household.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tell myself I was blinded by a life changing opportunity. And it was. The wage gaps were ridiculous. I thought about all the shit we could do with the money. Hell, we would even have enough to put in a savings account now.&lt;br&gt;
But that&amp;apos;s what I tell myself. But it&amp;apos;s an excuse to make myself feel better about fucking everything up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So now I have been exposed as an idiot. The jig is up. Now she can&amp;apos;t stand me. Her and the kids sleep in our bedroom now. I sit up all night in the living room for days on end trying to plan my next move. By the time the sun comes up, every morning, there is no next step. Sell the car. That&amp;apos;s about it. Could bring the cash straight to the landlord. They&amp;apos;d laugh me out of the office. Okay... what do I do after that... blank.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No idea why thet haven&amp;apos;t brought me another 3 day notice yet. I expect and deserve no leniency. Fuck, I just got done paying off back rent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She&amp;apos;s going home. I understand why. The kids deserve better. The kids deserve someone better to call dad. It&amp;apos;s too late. It&amp;apos;s over. And she calls me delusional. And she&amp;apos;s right. For some reason I keep going on with life like it&amp;apos;s okay. Like the family isn&amp;apos;t splitting apart. Like how my everything is fading away. Her family hates me. I used to be a bad person when we dated. This just gives them more ammo.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She said she doesn&amp;apos;t love me anymore. She said how could I possibly love and care about them if the thought didn&amp;apos;t occur to me to do something as simple as budget correctly. She&amp;apos;s right. This is all so stupid, but all my fault.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now the only thing I look forward to are having memories. Watching my 3 year old playing minecraft. My oldest daughter telling me my &amp;quot;sammiches&amp;quot; are awesome. She starts school this year. &lt;br&gt;
Guess I better get it together. It&amp;apos;s funny, I&amp;apos;ll be heading back to the same thicket of trees that we camped in together. When she was my everything. But I guess this time I&amp;apos;ll be there freezing alone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;apos;t get a grip. I can&amp;apos;t come to terms. Like clockwork I sit out here in the dark living room, 3AM crying and living the past in my head. She&amp;apos;s what my heart beats for. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I can&amp;apos;t imagine sitting in this empty apartment waiting for the deputy to do the eviction. The quiet. No crying baby. No toddlers fighting over toys. No laughing. No playing. No kids to yell at about knocking off the noise because it&amp;apos;s late. No I love yous. Nobody in the bed next to me. No one to sit up late at night with, watching the same stupid reruns of Frasier with, talking about how someday we were gonna make it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is just too much for me to bare. I just hope she knows that I still love her. I hope my kids know how much I love them too. She&amp;apos;s gonna make it. Shes smart. 
I can&amp;apos;t keep typing this out. I don&amp;apos;t know anymore.
