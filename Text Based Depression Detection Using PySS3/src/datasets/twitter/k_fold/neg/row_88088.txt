I feel like I've been walking on a knife's edge my whole lifeRegardless of how I treat myself, how depressed I am, my lack of motivation, my life really isn't that bad. Which is why even though I've wanted to die for years, I can't bring myself to do it. No one would understand where I'm coming from. Despite my shortfalls, I seem to be relatively successful, or at least passably average in everything I do.

That's why I feel like I am constantly walking a razor's edge. And each time I start something I think: well, if I fail or this blows up in my face, I'll just end it. But it never does. My life is literally just one big game of Russian roulette, and I guess you could say I've been "lucky" up to this point.

I know one day my luck will run out, and I'll have a significant failure or life will throw an extra sour, flaming lemon in my face. I know at that point I'll decide to just jump off the knife, or better yet, do a fucking split on the blade. It's only a matter of time, really...
