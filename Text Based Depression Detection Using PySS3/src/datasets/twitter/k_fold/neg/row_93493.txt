My girlfriend has been feeling suicidal and I don't know what else to do.My girlfriend and I have been dating since July, and since the beginning of the school year, she's opened up about being depressed and suicidal to me. I knew that she was depressed before we met, but seemed to be a lot better when we were dating. She seemed very happy during summer when we could spend all day together, but got worse as school went along. She's not a good student and doesn't care very much about her classes, and fails many of them. She's tried therapy, and only went three times before she stopped, and she gets very upset with me whenever I bring it up. She has a bad relationship with her family, and brings up how she feels often, but they just pass it off as melodramatics. So she refuses to ask them for help. She's just very adamant that everything is horrible, and there's no way her life could possibly improve. I constantly try to convince her otherwise, but she just ends the conversation, telling me that it's pointless. She says that she's never gonna be happy, so there's no point in trying. I'm really scared for her and don't know what to do anymore. Please, any help would be greatly appreciated.
