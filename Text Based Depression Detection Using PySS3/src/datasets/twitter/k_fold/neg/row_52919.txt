I just need one single person in this world to listen to me...I feel like in the mindset I am in right now, I am maybe 10 minutes away from actually just committing. I honestly feel like I am all alone in this world and I donâ€™t know what to do. There is no one I can talk to about any of this and I just sit around and cry and scream all by myself. 

Death scares me but once I am dead, itâ€™s not like I can regret it, because I wonâ€™t have a conscience. I wonâ€™t be able to think, so I canâ€™t have the feeling of missing out. 

My thoughts just seem all jumbled and I canâ€™t think straight. I donâ€™t know what to do.
