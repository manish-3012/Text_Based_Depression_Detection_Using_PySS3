I donâ€™t know what to do. I wanna die but I donâ€™t wanna kill myself.I know what Iâ€™m saying might no make sense but I have no one else to ask help from. If I talk about this to my parents they will either say Iâ€™ve gone far away from my religion/ donâ€™t trust in God or that itâ€™s all in my head. 

If I ask friends theyâ€™ll say the usual im sorries/ itâ€™ll pass/ just a few more years (Iâ€™ll graduate then but im in a place where if I go to a university Iâ€™ll still be either at home or Iâ€™ll go abroad ((which I really want but chances are 50/50)))

I know I need a therapist. I know it. But here therapists cost like a tonne and weâ€™re basically low class. 

My parents donâ€™t believe in therapy either. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. 

I feel stuck. 

I feel depressed. 

Iâ€™m sad and depressed all the time. Thereâ€™s no changing because the source is my family life. 

I have three younger brothers and Iâ€™ve been a half mom to them their whole lives and as much as I love them theyâ€™re the most f*cking annoying and disobedient kids Iâ€™ve come across. They love talking back and not listening to a think you have to say. 

My dad is like a child in a mans body, and a child whose manipulative and doesnâ€™t understand shit. Heâ€™s mentally abusive and has the upper hand in everything because heâ€™s the â€˜man of the houseâ€™. 

My mom has tolerated this and tbh I canâ€™t ever say it aloud but I f*cking hate her for it. 

She thinks honour and other peopleâ€™s collective opinion on you matters more than divorce. 

I hate both of them. I hate this life. I hate forcing myself to be an introvert and I hate forcing myself to just be emotionless and I want to die. 


Iâ€™m paranoid because of my father who talks like heâ€™s suspicious of everything i do because Iâ€™m a girl. 

I f*cking hate my father. I hate living here. I hate this society.  I hate it. I wouldâ€™ve killed myself a long time ago if I wasnâ€™t to some extent religious myself. I do believe in God and all because Iâ€™ve seen things happen that couldnâ€™t be less than miracles but you know what I am angry at him. 

I am so angry. I am angry at my parents and I want to die. 

If someone can help me out or not I donâ€™t know.  Iâ€™m too afraid to ask anyone else for help now because Iâ€™m also paranoid.  I think everyoneâ€™s out to get me. And I canâ€™t ask anyone for some sort of therapy. 

Iâ€™m paranoid because my dad is paranoid everyoneâ€™s out to get him. Itâ€™s rubbed off. I wish it hadnâ€™t but it has. After 18 years it eventually does.
