Just sadIt takes very little for me to want to leave. And i know im being an asshole for crying over losing my paint when theres people dying but sometimes i cant talk myself out of being sad. I usually want to die because im sad, but lately its been because im just too tired to live if that makes sense? Like im too tired to do anything.
