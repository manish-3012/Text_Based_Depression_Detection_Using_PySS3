i think i hurt everyone who loves me just by existingiâ€™m a really distant person i have bad complexes around not letting anyone in iâ€™ve developed a really rough abrasive shell to hide who i really am and it hurts the fuck outta anyone who tries to love me or care about me because i cannot let that shit in 
i know i need to change the way i am i need to not be so numbed out but itâ€™s gonna take some love and care to change me i donâ€™t think i can do this all myself i need love and care but i donâ€™t want to let anyone do that for me even if they offer to and want to love me 
i want to bury myself down so no one ever has to deal with the frustration i am to love ever again 
i have no shortage at all of people who want to love and care about me, good people too but i donâ€™t feel like i deserve any of that i feel like i have a responsibility to keep people away from me
because i know who i am and itâ€™s rotten
i wish no one cared about me so i could fucking kill myself
i really would if no one cared but killing myself here now is the most selfish â€œsacrificeâ€ i could go with 
i want to sacrifice my life so i never hurt anyone ever again but iâ€™d hurt them all so badly with that 
i really donâ€™t wanna live at all
iâ€™m hurting a lot i want to destroy myself over this but thatâ€™s a failure too
iâ€™d be weak if i hurt or killed myself over this
iâ€™m obsessed with not being weak
i know what i need to do and i need to roll up my sleeves and fix myself but iâ€™d rather just commit instead
