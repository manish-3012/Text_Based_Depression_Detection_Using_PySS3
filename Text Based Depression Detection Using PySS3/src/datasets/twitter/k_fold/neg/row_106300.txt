I canâ€™t go on anymoreMy gf left me and Iâ€™m living alone now. 
4 years we were together. 
Sheâ€™s all I think about. She left me for her new classmate. 

The pain is so great. I just want to kill myself. 

I donâ€™t have any friends. My family live across the country. 

I donâ€™t know who to go to about my pain. 

Iâ€™m in therapy and it isnâ€™t helping.

What do I do? Ending my life seems like the only option at this point. Please help me. 

Is anyone out there?
