Venting is nit enoughI had some times alone not talking to my friends about my real problems (after some very bad jokes one of them did about me saying that i feel bad ans need help) and recently, two days ago, i finally said to my partner about being suicidal. Then today i said it to my best friend. I will not talk about this to more people, i instantly feel like i'm faking it when i'm talking about it. I always feel like i'm bothering everyone.
But.. idk, i heard that it's worse to keep it to yourself and i talked to them, maybe wishing it will really help. It didn't. Idk what i expected, i can't promise them anything, i can't tell them that they can put trust in me that i'll do my best, i'm just so fucking tired of this. 
Venting isn't even helping, i would like someone to just take all these emotions out of me, i can't bear it.
I wish i could just go back in time because now they're scared for me, it would be better if they just didn't knew.
