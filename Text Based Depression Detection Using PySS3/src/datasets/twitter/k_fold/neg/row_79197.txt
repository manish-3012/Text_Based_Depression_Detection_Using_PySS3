Working from home makes me feel like I'm literally dying.Maybe not physically. It feels like my soul is being beaten up. I have no energy. I know how to deal with my clients, I just don't want to. I know i need social contact, but I don't love anyone. I know i need to stop eating, but it's the only joy I get. I know i need to go the gym, but it makes me even more tired. Movies, music and video games are all trash. I watch choirs and cry at their beauty as I wonder if the very concept of art is now dead. I'm nearly 30 but I feel like this is it. No more joy, no more love. That's it. Time's up.
