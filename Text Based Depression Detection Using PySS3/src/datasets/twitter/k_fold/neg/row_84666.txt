College struggles have me at rock bottomI started the first course of my STEM major a few weeks ago. It is not going well at all, I don't enjoy it, it is causing me immense stress, and leaving it will derail my entire life plan. I just don't know what to do. I can change my major to something that interests me, but it would be something useless. Complete rock bottom. My life was on a massive upturn with a great gf, good health, etc. it is all shattered now.
