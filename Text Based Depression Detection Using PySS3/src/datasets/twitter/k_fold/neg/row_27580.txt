Thinking of doing itThis is my first post, and I supposed my last one, I think that I don't have a choice, it's clear for new now, I just can't live happy anymore. I was struggling with many things in my head but, I just feel very alone. I m learning how I can use a rope, how properly use it, but I'm afraid of not dying, and just cause something on my brain that can remove after, if you can advise me how I can do it but  minimizing the probability to be alive after that.
