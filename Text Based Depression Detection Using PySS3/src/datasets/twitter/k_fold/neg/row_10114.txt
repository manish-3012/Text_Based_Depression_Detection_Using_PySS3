It is all my fault snd I cant take anymoreEverything is my fault.  I was diagnosed with Crohns disease when I was a teen.  My husband knew I was sick when he married me.  The entire time we dated, I never had a flare.  So he knew I was sick, but had never seen it.  Fast forward 20 years of on and off flares and a very high risk pregnancy......our daughter is now a teen.  My Crohns has become so bad I cannot work.  I am to sick to work but not sick enough for disability.  The last two years my flares have been almost back to back.  The last month I have been hospitalized.  The worst was the ischemic stroke I suffered.  

My illness has vastly exceeded my FMLA so I have lost my employment.  This has caused us to lose our house and has forced us to move in with family.  I had several auto withdrawals set up when I was working.   I tried to put a stop pay on them but two still cleared causeing overdrafts.  My husband is so mad at me that he now isn't talking to me.  It may be better than him yelling at me but silence is also painful.  He maintains this silence even in front of our daughter.  He blames me for everything.  Not being able to pay our bills because I have not worked, to our losing the house, to our moving in with family, to the overdrafts.  All of this is my fault and he never misses an opportunity to tell me.  

I have a large life insurance policy......he would never have to worry about money.  He always said he would rather have me than the money.  Now he says nothing.  Maybe it is time to solve the problem of "me" permanently.  I have the means, I have the plan......I just don't know what I am supposed to do.    I don't know what the right thing is.  My death would probably be my fault too....
