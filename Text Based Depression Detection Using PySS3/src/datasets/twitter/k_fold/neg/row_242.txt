I don't know...where to turn so I'll write here. I've have had thoughts of wanting to die before and admitted it at my last appointment to my pshychologist. 

I'm really trying to make myself think that I'm not suicidal? Does that make sense, probably not. Like it isn't valid. My thoughts of wanting to die doesn't feel valid? 

Like sure I've thought of it and I have the way I would do it layed out in a mental plan but I've never made any steps "irl" to complete that plan like buying the stuff or so on. 

So in my mind it's not suicidal thoughts? But isn't it?

I got  new meds a couple of days ago and one of the first thing I did was start to think and look up how many I would have to take to actually die, I don't think I would, but I want to and now know how to. 

Sry for a messy post, I'm just rambling at this point, just needed to write it down somewhere, anywhere so it isn't only in my head.
