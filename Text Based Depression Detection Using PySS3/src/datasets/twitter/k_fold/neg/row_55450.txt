always sad and feelinghey

i dont know if anyones gonna read this but whatever

i feel ugly. like just not attractive, i feel like people are actually grossed out by me and i can never be fully myself because its almost always on my mind. obviously im comfortable around certain people and i dont usually feel this way around my close best friends, but i can rarely interact with new people without this thought on my mind. i genuinley feel like im unattractive and sometimes it reaches the point of like, self worth. sometimes i feel like, who would want me? guys i've been interested in dont seem to like me back, and the people who are interested in me i seem to push them away because i swear i genuinley cant see a reason why they'd be interested in me. somedays i dont wanna get out of bed and literally dont want to do anything because i dont feel like me or my life is worth it. im not gonna lie, i've thought of how great it would be to die. im on my worst days, when things dont seem to work out and it feels like my life is nothing, i think about how good it would be to leave. and of course, my low self esteem accompanies that thought with "well yeah, no one would care about you dying anyway" its ridiculous. im always upset, i always feel ugly, i always feel down, and im always fatigued and just want to sleep all day. 

i've thought of therapy, but i dont feel like anyone would understand me and i feel like my problems arent significant enough for it.

am i being ridiculous?

good night
