help pulling through the night?but i'm a little concerned about managing. i haven't been sleeping much. last night i didn't sleep at all. i am so tired but i can't sleep and i wrote a note entitled "in the event of my death" and I'm sitting here with a razor blade and i know i'm not going to do anything probably but I'm a little concerned because these aren't super normal actions here and i don't really seem to have control over my actions atm and i feel horrible and need to sleep. what can i do right now? can someone just give me a 3 step plan to do right now? i have showered, i am fed, i have drank water, i really would rather not leave my house (or bedroom), i have texted friends but they have not responded. bothering family would elicit more harm than good. it is well past my therapist's bedtime. i do not want to call/text a hotline or talk about what is going on. i just need someone who is thinking clearly to give me a healthy action plan that i don't need to think too much to execute.
