First I wanted to kill myself for revenge, now it's because I am exhausted.The reason I wanted to kill myself first was because I wanted everyone to feel the pain I feel. Now i realise what a selfish human being I am and how fucked up i am in the head. I have been given everything to me on a silver platter and I still feel this way. I hate living inside my head. I am fucking exhausted.
