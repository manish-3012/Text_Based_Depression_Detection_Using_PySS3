I've gotten to the point where even I don't even care that my loved ones beg me not to feel this way.I have no patience to see it "get better". Yet I'm too much of a pussy to actually do it. 

My friends and family cry at the thought of me dying. But the pain is too much. It sucks to see them hurt. But I always tell them not to blame themselves.

I just feel like....I don't even care anymore! Alright... I'm still in too much pain. 

I ruined my life! I don't know what to do. I love my friends and family so much but the pain is destroying me. I don't know what to do. Someone give me the magic button that fixes everything. 

Does ANYONE feel this way? I can't actually go through with it right now.
