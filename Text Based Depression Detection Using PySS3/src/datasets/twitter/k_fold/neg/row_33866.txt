I can't keep going anymoreI feel like a burden on society, I don't wanna live, I don't wanna keep hurting people with my existence, I don't wanna keep pushing through, I can't find my why, I can't find my motive to not just end it all. I don't wanna keep going. I can't. I'm not enough. I'll never be enough. I'm a disappointment. I'm just a piece of shit and the world would be better off without me. I've tried to kill myself 24 times and none of them has worked. You know how much that is? THAT'S AN AVERAGE OF *TWO* ATTEMPTS EVERY **YEAR**. I can't keep going anymore. I just wanna be ended.
