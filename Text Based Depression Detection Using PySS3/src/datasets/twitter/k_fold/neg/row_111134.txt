Tbh I do want to liveJust not this life, not as the me right now but as someone else with a better life, I dont see a good future for myself neither am I living in a good present, I'm just kinda existing rn not knowing why, I hate myself alot, I hate my entire existence,  everything is so frustrating, no one understands me no matter how much I try to explain what is wrong, it's like it's just falling on deaf ears and there's nothing I can do about it and its slowly making me go crazy, I'm not sure how much longer I can deal with all of this shit, I truly can't see it getting better for many reasons, I just hope I can one day wake up as a different person with an entirely different life, I don't want to die, I do want to live but as a different person, my own body feels like a prison.
