I keep feeling down but not the type where it comes fir a few minutes or hours, mine lasts for days.I was a precious child growing up, I was taken care of with at least 2-3 different families and they made sure that I was pure and innocent. Now I have moments where all my drawings will never be better because it really hasnâ€™t, and if I canâ€™t draw what should I do? Iâ€™ve done a couple of things but Iâ€™ve been the worst at all of them. I feel like killing myself sometimes and feel like if I met those families again theyâ€™d be let down and disappointed of who I am. I feel like Iâ€™d be letting my mom down the most, even though sheâ€™s in a worse place than I am now. I go though long periods of time just thinking of how Iâ€™d kill myself, why, and what happened afterwards and how after a few months nobody would remember me at all
