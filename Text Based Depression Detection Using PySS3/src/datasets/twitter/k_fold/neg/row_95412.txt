Spent the day in bedHavenâ€™t moved. Donâ€™t care too. Itâ€™s cold out, my water pipes are frozen, and my wife does not understand depression. She thinks itâ€™s me be dramatic or a joke. Iâ€™m laying her alone when I wish someone would be there. I donâ€™t know why it canâ€™t be her. We have a kid. I feel like a terrible role model and sheâ€™s the only reason weâ€™re even together. But now Iâ€™m realizing that I canâ€™t live like this and be daddy. Then again can I really not be with her everyday? Maybe itâ€™s better if Iâ€™m just not there at all for anyone. Things have been their worst for the past year and before Christmas it all seemed to go up in flames. A 12 year relationship that completely broke down and for the past 4 years makes me feel like Iâ€™m trapped in it. Trying to leave seems like a bitter march that will be unbearable â€” I guess I lack the courage to change life for myself. Itâ€™s just is just a constant reminder that nothing will change. Iâ€™ve had marital relationship issues and therapy doesnâ€™t seem to be helping. Considering checking into the hospital but scared of the process or if theyâ€™ll even take me seriously. Thereâ€™s so much work to do I donâ€™t know if I can even make time for it but then again Iâ€™m posting on a suicide board so why am I so concerned with time. I guess Iâ€™m just sitting here in bed thinking and wishing I could understand if this is normal. People donâ€™t think like this, do they? Iâ€™m just over it all. I hate where my life is and every time we come close to seperation we stay and I fall deeper into depression. Iâ€™m just lost.
