What can I do?I'm a 19-year-old male, if that changes anything.

The world is full of assholes, seeing the stupidity of everyone. makes me sick of being human. Everything is absolutely horrible, and I can't do anything about it. I don't get why some people fight so much to keep on living (like people with chronic diseases) while I don't do anything with my life, have anything to worry about, and I still want to die. 

Freedom, love, all of that, only illusions. You have to go to school your whole childhood, and then go to work a shitty job your entire fucking life to not starve to death. Is this what freedom is supposed to be like? 

Also, I have never had a girlfriend. I fell in love a couple of time, and each time the girl didn't acknowledged my existence or simply didn't give a shit about me. Heartbreaks were definitely the worst pains I ever felt. I have loads of friends, sadly I don't have a meaningful relationship with any of them. I have no memory of a moment where I didn't feel lonely.

I have no self-confidence, nobody who understands me, nothing. 
And here is the worst thing: if I kill myself, people will actually be sad. If I can't end my life when I want, do I have control over anything? Or is life a just free fall where you suffer until you die?

If all of this keeps getting worse, I will end it. I won't care about my family and "friends" anymore, I'm suffering way more living than they ever will because of my death.
