I delayed my suicide schedule.I uploaded a post about my suicide plan on my social media throwaway account. One of my friends asked me if I can buy him a can of beer and have a deep chat with him before I really make my commitment, and I said "Okay, why not". 

I am a guy who make the only promises I can keep and I always keep my promises, and my friends knew it. That kid made me to make this promise and decided to keep delaying the date for drinking, just for keeping me alive, as I cannot kill myself before I drink beer with him and have a deep chat, according to that promise I made. What a clever kid.
