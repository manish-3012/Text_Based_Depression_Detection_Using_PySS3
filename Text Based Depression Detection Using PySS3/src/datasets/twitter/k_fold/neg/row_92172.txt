Its always parking garages....I work right next to two of them... one is about 4 stories, situated on a hill, and the other is about 6. I pass them every day when I go to work. I can see them from the windows.

I fantasize vividly about jumping, so vividly that I can almost feel the wind if I close my eyes. I've been on the roofs before, always backed down, but its so tempting. I'm so tired.
