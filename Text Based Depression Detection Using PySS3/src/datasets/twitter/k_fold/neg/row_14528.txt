I dont want her to careOne person. One person who cares. One person who i live for. One person who actually tried to help me. One person who i love. One person who is interested in how i feel. One person who dont want me to die.

One person who i will hurt with killing myself. I cant even fucking die without feeling guilt.

My friend, please stop caring. Let me go. Find someone better. You deserve better. I dont deserve you
