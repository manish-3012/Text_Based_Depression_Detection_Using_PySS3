Wondering where I can find good, easily understandable diagrams of the proper way to do different suicide methods for free?I have an LD that I never got proper help with in school, so I am retarded and useless for life. That is part of the many reasons I want to kill myself. But anyways... does anyone know where I can find easily explained diagrams with detailed and easy to understand pictures of how to do different suicide methods successfully? I don't understand how to do a proper rope to hang one's self. I found one I found easy to understand but I don't know if it's a troll trying to make people survive suicide attempts by doing them wrong and just ending up maimed for this person's sick enjoyment: [https://raidforums.com/Thread-How-to-correctly-tie-a-noose-and-hang-yourself](https://raidforums.com/Thread-How-to-correctly-tie-a-noose-and-hang-yourself)   
May your ancestors keep you close, fellow suicidal people.
