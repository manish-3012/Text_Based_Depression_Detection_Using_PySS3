I hate being trans. I hate this country. I hate being lonely. I hate myself for being too much of a coward to end things.My parents are totally unsupportive. My mom is apathetic, my dad doesn't know, because telling him would endanger me. I'm too fucking stupid to succeed at getting my license. I got kicked out of my first trade school because they found I self harm. That made me want to do it more.  
My father does not see trans people as human. I'll never be able to get a degree. If I'm lucky, I'll succeed at my next trade school and get to be a vet tech, which pays terribly.  
The government is fighting tooth and nail to strip away my rights. I won't be able to legally change my gender, because these racist, borderline fascist assholes will be deciding it for me.  
I keep trying to date, only to get ghosted immediately after. I don't want to live anymore. But I'm too weak even to put myself out of my misery. There's nothing left for me here.
