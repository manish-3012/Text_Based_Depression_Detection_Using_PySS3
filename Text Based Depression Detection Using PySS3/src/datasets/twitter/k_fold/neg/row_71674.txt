I feel like I'm not going to see 2021I feel like I'm not going to see 2021. I don't have a particular plan per say...but I have this feeling in my gut that I will not be alive come January 1. My region is going into lockdown for 2 weeks, and I know that it's not just going to be two weeks. It's going to keep going. Just like last time. I feel like it's triggering a massive amount of anxiety in me. I feel like I can't breath again and nothing makes sense. The fear and isolation I felt the first time we went into lockdown has set in again, with 45 minutes until the lockdown officially comes into effect I feel as though the clock is ticking. I wonder if I would have more motivation to live, to reach out for help, if there wasn't a pandemic. I can't see my therapist in person so everything has come to a standstill with her...so what's the fucking point?
