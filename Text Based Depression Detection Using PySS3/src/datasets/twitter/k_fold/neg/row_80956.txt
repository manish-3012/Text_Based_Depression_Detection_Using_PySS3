Ways to die. TWI can't think of any way to die without having possible traumatic repercussions if I survive. 
Medication: vomitting, hospitalisation, potential brain damage, liver damage
Hanging: brain damage, spinal injury, partner finding me 
Car accident: risking someone else's life, debilitating or lifelong injuries if I change my mind in the future.
Drowning: I'm not sure I could actually do that? Doesn't the brain use my flight or fight response to save me?
No guns around.
Bleeding out: Horrible way to leave my partner in our bought house with memories and stains like that.
Life is always overwhelming me, but also does death.

Ways to kill myself seems to come with many reasons not to do it. 
I guess any excuse counts right? ðŸ˜”
