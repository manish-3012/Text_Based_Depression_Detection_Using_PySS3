Well... I fucked things up a ton.I'm part of a small group of friends in an online game.  Late last year, one of those friends had suddenly passed away.  While that certainly made a lot of us sad, the one person that knew him in real life was devastated.  She seemed to recover somewhat, but recently I found out how much of it was just a facade she was putting out in front of others.  I tried to help, but ultimately, she needed more than just me.  I tried guiding her here, and that's where things went poorly.

I convinced her to get a burner account to make a post here.  She did, and after reading it and realizing how bad things were, had the idea that some of our other friends should know, so they could offer help, encouragement, and perhaps make their own anonymous posts here.

Unfortunately, that plan backfired when one of the people I told asked her directly about it.  My friend was devastated again, and felt like all the trust she had placed in me was gone.

I'm afraid of losing her now.  I was one of the few people she had confided with in the months following our friend's passing.  Now that she feels the trust is betrayed, she's furious.  I tried explaining that I had her best interests at heart, that this wasn't some scheme to expose her to her friends, and that I felt that if I didn't say something, I would lose her soon.  While I think she believes me, she still thinks she can't trust me with anything any more.

I think the worst part is, she's scheduled to get some life-changing surgery sometime this year.  Unfortunately, the recent stress of grief and her efforts to recover have likely made her a poor candidate for the surgery.  She goes in to find out the final verdict tomorrow, but she pretty much told me that if she's turned down, she may as well end things now.

I don't know what to do for her...
