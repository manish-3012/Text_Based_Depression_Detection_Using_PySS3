Feeling Lost, Stuck, and HopelessMale, 28, American

I don't speak to my family, who were abusive throughout my life. I tried to speak with them recently, but it was unhelpful and sad to me. It only made me feel lonelier and more broken.

I just broke up with my girlfriend of four years after she drunkenly cheated. I want to take her back, but I know that would be a stupid mistake.

The modern world just seems really...terrible...doomed...shallow...something like that. I feel overwhelmed by a culture of casual sex, fast food, TV, Snapchat, Facebook, global warming, corporate greed, political corruption, and mass murder. I know the world has been bad before, but this is the bad that I've experience and it seems more urgent.

I haven't really struggled with suicidal thoughts in a years. I hang out with friends, play sports, date, and have hobbies, but I feel empty and joyless for the first time in awhile. It's definitely much worse when I'm alone and I guess I've gotten used to not being alone much \(I cohabited with my ex\-gf\). I spent two straight hours at work unable to stop thinking about shooting myself. Many of my friends are stressed and depressed themselves. Relationships lately have felt 

I'm also struggling with underemployment now AND I'm a student, so it's been hard to find the time/balance there. It's also hard to find well\-paying part time work outside of the contract work that I already do, which is a limited client\-wise. So far, I've avoided taking out loans, but I think I might need to for next semester.

I've also considered that I should get back on antidepressants, but I don't have health insurance. I'm trying to stop using cannabis and don't have any other substance problems.
