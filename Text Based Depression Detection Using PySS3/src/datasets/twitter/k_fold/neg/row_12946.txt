I'm retiring. From life and everything that lies therin.Hi.

I think I have lived too long. I have lost my every family member. I have likely killed or partook in the killing of many families now. I have accepted medals for senseless violence while my own homeland was wracked with grief. I hate myself now. My daughter can no longer give me a calming voice. She rests somewhere in the void. It will benefit the future of humanity if I no longer exist. I don't know how I will do it, exactly, but I have to try.
