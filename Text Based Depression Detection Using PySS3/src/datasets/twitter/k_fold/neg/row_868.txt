Is it normal to think about suicide every day?I've come close, and tried to overdose, but every day since then I've just seen different things as suicide methods. Anywhere from speeding cars, to high ledges, to my medication I always get the same "It'd be so easy." thought. Is this normal?

SECOND QUESTION
VVVVVVVVVVVVVV

When I picture it and imagine me actually doing it I smile, and feel relaxed, it feels just like taking in air after holding your breath for too long. Is this normal?
