There are people who can help.Or so they tell me. But none of them have been able to make me want to live, and all of them remind me that, if given the chance, they would use violence to stop me.

Death is the only thing that can stop things from getting worse, and they want to take it away from me. Now there is not limit, and it's their fault. They aren't there to help, otherwise they wouldn't do this.
