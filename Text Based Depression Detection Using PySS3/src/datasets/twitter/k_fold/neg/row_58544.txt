Iâ€™m going to commit suicide after Avengers: EndgameNot going to get into why Iâ€™m doing it, since thatâ€™s an entire essay to write out and thatâ€™ll probably bore most people. I grew up with Marvel and the only thing that gives me any sort of happiness are those movies. I wanted to end it awhile ago, but I just wanted this once last thing before I go. Once I finish this arc of the movies and get closure on the story, I feel like I can just end it all and die in peace.
