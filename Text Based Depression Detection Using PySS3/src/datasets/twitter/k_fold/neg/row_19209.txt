I've never wanted to kill myself beforeI'm terrified of dying. I don't want to die. But I'm reaching a point where I think about it way more often that I used to. I'm in a place right now where I don't think I want to hurt myself but I want to be hurt. Maybe a car will run into me and I'll be hospitalized and I can just be gone for a while. I don't know anymore. I just feel trapped in my brain with my emotions and I don't know how to not feel this way anymore.

I've been through too much shit in my life and the last few months has been the straw that broke the camels back. I just want to wake up and it's March 2019, and I have a chance to do things differently. I want to do better. I want to be better.
