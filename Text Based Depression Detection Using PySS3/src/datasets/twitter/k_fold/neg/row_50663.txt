Things have been better but...I still want to commit suicide. Nothing bad has happened lately. Everything has been fine. 

I remember things though, and it feels bad. I remember all the things everybody's said that has hurt me before. I remember everything bad he's ever said about me. And I always think every message I receive is going to be him screaming all those things at me. I feel guilty for being a bad person. 

I also see things that you just can't unsee. It sometimes prohibits what I can do. Why just reading a story today brought it all back, hit me hard and I started sobbing. 

I wasn't planning on making it to the end of the month already, but tonight made me want to speed things up. 

Do I deserve all this?
