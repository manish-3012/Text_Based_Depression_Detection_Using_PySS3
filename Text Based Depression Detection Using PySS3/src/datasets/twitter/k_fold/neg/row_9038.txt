Follow-up to suicideAfter [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fztcz/where_the_fuck_do_i_go_back_to) I tried to kill myself, but did not succeed. So I'm still here, but still depressed and suicidal. I tried killing myself again last week with pills, but again, it didn't work. I fail at self-harm. I find that funny. And sad. I have a shotgun and ammo but don't want to use it because the idea of leaving that big of a bloody mess behind is abhorrent. 

I've tried years of therapy and drugs for my depression, but the bottom line is that I'm an awful, ugly person and nobody likes my personality. My only friend is my SO, but even he doesn't like me. I talk too much, I care about and talk about stuff that nobody cares about, and I get frustrated and defensive. I just don't see the point anymore. 

I think my SO is still with me because he's lonely and doesn't want to be on his own, so he tolerates me and that's it. He's also about as observant as a paper bag so he had no idea that I even tried to kill myself ever until last week. He asked why I was so sick and sleeping all day and I told him the truth, finally. As usual he didn't know how to be supportive and so he just kept playing his video games. He doesn't want to be with me, but being alone is worse than being with me, I guess. 

Oh well. Maybe next time. 

TL;DR: I've failed at killing myself twice in the past month. I'm a bad person, I don't have any friends, and I don't have anything to live for anymore.
