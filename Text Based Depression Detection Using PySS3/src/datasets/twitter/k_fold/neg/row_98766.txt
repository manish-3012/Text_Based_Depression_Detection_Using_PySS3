I think Iâ€™m doneHad a really bad at work. A supervisor threatened to fire me for something I never did. In short because I canâ€™t say who or what I did, someone who was scheduling an appointment did not give the right email for a Zoom link. When I clocked in an hour ago, I forwarded the email for the angry person who missed out on her appointment. The coordinator responded with â€œI heard McDonaldâ€™s is hiringâ€.

Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m done helping people, Iâ€™m done giving and giving and people just taking and taking. I called my college therapist office but no one was available.

Just give me one reason, one reason to stay. Someone please help. Iâ€™m done. I have shit with school and now work. I just want to be with nature. I hate how this world turned out. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m a bad person. I get it. Iâ€™m a horrible human being but I never did anything wrong at work. I always try to help people and if Iâ€™m really â€œfiredâ€ Iâ€™ll jump. 

I hate this world. Iâ€™m done. Please someone help me.
