SodudbiwbI've suffered from depression, and a few other mental ailments, for years but I've never been closer to killing myself than I am now. My work schedule is fucked up (work nights, and weekends) and I never realized until recently the full effects of social isolation. Newborns die from lack of social contact, and I now understand why. It's not just being lonely though. My brain chemistry is all messed up for a multitude of reasons, and I feel like a piece of shit in general. I can't afford therapy or drugs of any kind. I honestly don't even know why I'm writing this, other than some slight comfort in knowing there's company in misery. I'm just afraid one of these days I'm gonna swing by the armory to pick up a box of slugs and then go buy a bottle of whiskey, and that'll be that. Has anyone been super close to suicide? I've never been this bad before but I legitimately feel like these next few month might be my last. Nothing seems to work
