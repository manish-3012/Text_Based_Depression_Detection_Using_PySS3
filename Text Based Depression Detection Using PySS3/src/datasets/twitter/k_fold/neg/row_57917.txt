I don't know how I made it through today.I don't know how I'll make it through tomorrow. Tonight I'll lay in bed tossing and turning thinking about killing myself. Tomorrow my alarm will go off at 5am but I'll have woken up naturally about 30 minutes before that. The first thought that will go through my head will be "Fuck. Still alive." And for those 30 minutes I will unmoving, panicking as a cold sheet of terror begins to crawl over my body at the thought of having to live through another day. My alarm will go off. And I'll go through my day getting lost in thought. Visualizing, fantasizing, and thinking about killing myself. Hopeless and alone. 

Then the night will come, and I won't know how I go through that day. I won't know how to get through the day after that. I'll lay in bed tossing and................... "Fuck. Still alive"....my alarm will go off...

5am... Cold sheet of terror... alarm... Tomorrow... Today.. yesterday.. three minutes ago.. an infinity more of tomorrow. Why not today. Fuck. I'm still alive....
