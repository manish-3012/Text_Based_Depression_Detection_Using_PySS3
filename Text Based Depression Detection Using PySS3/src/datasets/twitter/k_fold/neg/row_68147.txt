When to call it quitsI have come from a family where life has been a blessing. By most standards I am lucky. I have faced no hardships that even compare to those of so many people, get I do not want to be here. 

I am a 29 year old male, had the world promised to be, and I have thrown it all away. That is not why I wish I wasn't here, but just another reason why I think it would be best. I scored top 1% in my state on SAT's and ACT's. Could have gone to any school I wanted. Yet, when I did, I drank to the point that I had to spend 10 days in the ICU while going through the It's and withdrawal. I maintained by 4.0 Goa but was miserable.

Nothing has changed. Years down the road I feel the same. I do t want to kill myself bc I don't want my nieces and nephews to ever have to think about why I did it. But I do not wa t to be here. 

What do I do? I am just about done trying, and as much as it pains me, I am about finished caring about my nieces and nephews. They are young, it would be far easier now rather than later for them to accept it.
