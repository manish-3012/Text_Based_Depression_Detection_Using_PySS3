God please help me, I have no strengthI don't remember the last time I smiled. Everyday is a war to get through. I keep asking why me?.. I've never hurt anyone, I've worked hard, I've taken care of my friends and family.. and I'm in a position where I'm being hurt intentionally everyday.. I'm thinking of ending it, I have no strength left
