I just feel so worthless.Iâ€™m 21 have had severed depression since I was 10 and Iâ€™m so frustrated and anxious. Iâ€™m in my fifth year of a 4 year degree and working minim wage racked with credit card debt. I just want this to be over with. I feel like such a waste of a human being Bevause Iâ€™m so depressed I canâ€™t bring myself to do basic things like cleaning the house. I can barely get to work and have panic attacks almost every night.

The only things that help are just adding more fuel to the fire. I overeat and have gained 50lbs from stress eating. And when I get stressed about eating to much I throw it up. I smoke and drink too. Iâ€™m such a failure I donâ€™t see how Iâ€™m allowed to live while being such a huge disappointment. 

And of course I feel awful because I know there are people who have it wayyy worse off than me. I have no room to be this whiny and sensitive. 

I just want to be free from all of this. Clearly My depression isnâ€™t going to go away anytime soon so I canâ€™t help but think that maybe I should just end it and save myself the pain. 

Sorry for the long post :/
