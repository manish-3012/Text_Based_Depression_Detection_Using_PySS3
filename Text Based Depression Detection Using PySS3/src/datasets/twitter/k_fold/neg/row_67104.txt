Being gayI am gay and:
1.My country is very homophobic 
2. The public oppinion on gay people is extremely negative by the vast majority of people (88% according to a survey)
3. As a result of the negative public oppinion the laws are not going to change. Another survey done by a major media says the best case scenario is 30-50 years AT BEST
4. Gay people here have no rights to marry or to have children by any possible means.
5. Moving is not an option in my case. I want to move but I can't because I am still in University, also doing the work I study for in another country is absolutely unachievable. It would mean working here for years to gather money, then learning a language to a C1 level in both spoken language and medical terms, getting numerous approbations and certificates depending on where I want to go to, applying for all of which requires money, somehow managing to find a job before even going to the country or finding a landlord willing to give you a place to rent when you don't have a job and are basically unreliable because of that. And even after all these things it is still not certain if I get an approbation or end up wasting a ton of money and going back home. Also, moving means leaving the only person to ever fully support me( my mom) by herself here with no family and friends.
