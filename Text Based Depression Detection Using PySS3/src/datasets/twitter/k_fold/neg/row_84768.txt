Why the fuck does everybody fucking hate me and ignore me?This is a throwaway because nobody fucking replies to me on my main. 

r/depression won't reply to my posts.
r/suicidewatch won't reply to my posts.
r/offmychest won't support me
r/needadvice won't give me advice.

Family doctors ignore everything I say. Emergency room physicians send me away with medication. Psychiatric nurses tell me I need to try harder if I want to feel better.

Why the FUCK is everyone against ME? What did I do? Why the fuck aren't my auditory hallucinations, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts important to anyone? I just want to fucking be better. This is just one more reason why I should fucking kill myself!
