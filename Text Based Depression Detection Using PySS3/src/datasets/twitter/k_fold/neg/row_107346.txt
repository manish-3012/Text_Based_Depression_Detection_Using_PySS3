When your parents are your reason for living AND for wanting to dieMy parents just terrify me. During my past suicide attempts I begged them for help and they ignored me. I'd wake up in the morning sobbing because I'd have to face the reality that they don't care. They'd let me die basically. Every single day I want to attempt again and I can't get help for it because they don't allow that. Every single day I back out in fear that I'll survive, and my parents won't be there for me. I've been having nightmares of being in the hospital and waking up to them in my room, and they're stone cold and won't really talk to me. I imagine them being angry and shaming me and punishing me for trying again. It's just really really draining, I feel trapped in one place with no escape.
