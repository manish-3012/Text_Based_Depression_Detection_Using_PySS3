Am I supposed to exist?Just getting back home, I felt as though I wasn't wanted by everybody and that they all hated me. 
On the bus, I was all by myself without my so-called friend at my side.

He doesn't even want to talk to me anymore. 

He is my only "friend" that I can confide in even though all my other friends, some of which I've known for a long time or even since birth, are just "acquaintances" in my opinion. 

I can't even converse normally because I'm always worried that they would get bored with what I say or they would tell me to shut the fuck up and die. 

I am at a loss at what to do.
