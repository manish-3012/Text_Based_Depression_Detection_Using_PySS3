iâ€™m 17 and i want to diehi. iâ€™m 17 years old and i donâ€™t know if i can do this anymore. i think my entire life iâ€™ve been depressed. for as long as i can remember, iâ€™ve been bullied and picked on. it made me hate myself and i eventually got to the point where i donâ€™t even go outside anymore. when everyone calls me ugly and fat how can i dare to exist in the world. i know i donâ€™t deserve anything and i donâ€™t know what i expect from posting this but i donâ€™t know what else to do. i have so much anxiety and depression that waking up is disappointing. i used to have so many hopes and dreams but they seemed to have dissipated as fast as my self confidence. i wish i was pretty and skinny and confident. i think thatâ€™s my main source of my depression, is being fat and ugly. i used to be active in sports and stuff but i got depressed at first from the bullying and then i just spiraled. it also doesnâ€™t help that my parents ignore how sad i am and say that depression and anxiety arenâ€™t real. deep down i still have dreams, like one day going outside again and being able to exist without a care in the world. i want to breathe the outside air again but when people pick apart every thing about me, telling me iâ€™m worth nothing and that iâ€™m a mistake in this world, how can i dare to dream? i used to have friends and hobbies but now i just sit all day in bed wishing to be dead. the thoughts about suicide take up so much space in my mind every second iâ€™m awake. i try to sleep all day to ignore my problems but it just gets worse. iâ€™ll have some good days where i feel amazing and like i could do anything, but living in a toxic and mentally abusive household makes being happy almost impossible. iâ€™m a senior in online school and i only have a couple months left. i used to have really good grades, but because of my depression, iâ€™m now failing all my classes so i donâ€™t know what to do. anyway, i hope someone responds. anyone. thank you if anyone takes the time to read this.
