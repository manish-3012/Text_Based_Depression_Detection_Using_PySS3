Is it normal to feel suicidal before exams?I dont know if it's just me but i have mock GCSEs coming up and i don't think I have felt worse in my life right now. 
Is it normal to feel this much pressure from exams? Will it be worse when it gets to my actual exams? Is anyone else my age experiencing this?
