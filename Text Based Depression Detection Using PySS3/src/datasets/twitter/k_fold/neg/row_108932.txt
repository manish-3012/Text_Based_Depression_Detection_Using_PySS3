Anyone looking in on my life thinks anyone would love to have my lifeI am very popular, get very high grades, am extremely athletic, my family are perfect financially and people think Iâ€™m hilarious. But I just want to end my life more than anything. Iâ€™m only 14 as-well and Iâ€™m already struggling mentally. Iâ€™ve even attempted suicide twice before, once the pole I tied my noose to broke off and the other time my belt tied in a noose snapped. I know this post has no structure and is all over the place but Iâ€™m not in a position to write an A grade essay about this right now, I havenâ€™t been able to think straight for the past year or so.
