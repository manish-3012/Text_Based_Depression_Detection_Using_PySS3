Tonight is the nightI am finally going to do it. My life is going nowhere, and Iâ€™m tired of laying in this damn bed wanting to be gone. My life wasnâ€™t meant to last from the beginning. I do not have friends or people who would care. This is not an exaggeration either. I have no one in my life. I just canâ€™t go on feeling this bad about myself any longer. I still felt like I should get it out somewhere. I do not know if a single person is reading this, but I hope your life is better. I hope youâ€™re able to make use of it and enjoy yourself. Please do what you can. Ok, thatâ€™s all.
