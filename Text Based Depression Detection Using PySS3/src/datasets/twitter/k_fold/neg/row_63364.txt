Depressed 24/7I'm so sick and tired of always being depressed. Even when I get the slightest glimmer of hope, it never lasts. I've tried so hard to hold onto my happy thoughts. But I guess I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I've come to the conclusion that, no matter how hard I try, I don't have a purpose and I never will. I want to help people, but I can't. I have nothing in my power to help anyone. I've been struggling with this stupid depression for over four years now, and its just getting worse. I feel like I've tried everything. The only thing keeping me from not committing suicide is my fear of pain. I don't want to hurt myself, but that's all I'm doing by staying alive. I can't handle this anymore, I just can't...
