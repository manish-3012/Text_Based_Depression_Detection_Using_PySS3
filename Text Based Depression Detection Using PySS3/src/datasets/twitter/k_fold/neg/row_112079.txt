I'm going to kill myself because my dad wants me to do a job I don't want to doJust then he came into my room and a dumped a book on my bed saying, "sign up and do it" you need a job. I don't like how he approached me about it and it's something I have no passion for. I don't want my life to be like this doing physical tough work. I don't want to be someone full of regret because of something I wish I could've done to follow my passion but was too broke for it. I just want to end my life cause I see no hope but misery doing this job. I still can't believe he just did that. And it's very hard to convince him that my passion is something I want to do, but his same, "it wont make you money" drives me insane.
