Suicidal after botched surgeryI was experimented on by a Belgian surgeon. He severed my nerves and put screws close to the roots of my teeth. Now I look overcorrected and my chin is super tight and numb. I feel violated, defiled and ruined. I get gory images of him cutting my bones and nerves during the surgery in my sleep and wakeup feeling horrified. I want to escape yet I can't.
