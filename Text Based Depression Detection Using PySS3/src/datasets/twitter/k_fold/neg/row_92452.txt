I can not take living anymore. I've been through too much and it's not fair.Ever since my father left me when I was 6, my mum turned crazy an started becoming violent with me including physically, mentally, and verbally abusing me. There have been time where I thought I could not take it, but now I know.
My family has started disrespecting me. They treat me less than human.

And worse yet they think they have done nothing wrong. In fact, they call my accusations abuse.

This is not a life worth living. 

I don't care if I go to Hell or don't get to fulfill my dreams, I am ruined already.

So Long &amp; Thanks for all the fish.
