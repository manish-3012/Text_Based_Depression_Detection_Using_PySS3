I think everyone's okay with it.I've spent years convincing what little family i have, as well as my fiancÃ©e, that suicide is a right everyone should have, and that the family and friends of people who commit it acting like they're hurting more because of someone's death than the person who died is selfish and stupid, and its always been kind of in preperation for when I do.

I understand this is manipulative as hell. I make no claims about being a good person.

My life is absolute shit. I'm so poor I eat every other day only when I'm lucky. I have a ton of medical problems, and I can't get the medical supplies or medicine I need (including methadone, to control withdrawals from opiates after becomming very badly hooked on them after long hospital stays and multiple surgeries.)

I only have somewhere to live because someone pays my rent, and they really can't afford to do that much longer. They're screwing themselves over long term to try to help me.

I only have the internet because a friend of mine who lives in canada pays for it, along with a game subscription, because he worries about me and wants to play games with me and shit.

I'm about to turn 30, I've been denied disability, and I live in a state where I can't get medicaid without it unless I have a child.

I'm millions of dollars in medical debt.

I could quite literally win a lottery and it wouldnt fix my life.

There's only two things that have kept me alive this past decade: my fear of death and worrying about hurting other people.

The other people part is taken care of, and I think I'm finally getting over the other.

I guess I just really don't know what to do, and I didnt want to check myself into the psych ward where I'll just be pumped full of the typical bullshit lines about my life being worth something and things getting better.


There has to be some situation where the rational thing to do is accept that things will always be bad.
