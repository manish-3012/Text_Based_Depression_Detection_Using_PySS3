I think my girlfriend and I are doneIâ€™m 20, I donâ€™t know what to say anymore or think really. I feel like my world is crumbling around me and I feel like I need her. I donâ€™t want sympathy, or anything really I just want her. She wonâ€™t answer my calls or texts and sheâ€™s not coming home tonight I think. And all of this is thanks to me, Iâ€™m crazy. Or what they would say is crazy, Iâ€™m a manipulator and a user. I donâ€™t see it this way really but I have to face the truth. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m getting her back. Her stuff is still here and sheâ€™s gonna need to come get it if she decides weâ€™re through. I feel like when itâ€™s all said and done Iâ€™m just gonna end it. I donâ€™t want to cause any more harm to her or pain to anyone for that matter. And I donâ€™t even know how to respond to comments here; not the actual physical responding part. But the part where you tell me itâ€™s all gonna get better and Iâ€™m gonna be like yeah I hope, but I donâ€™t feel any of that is going to help/ no is going to hear me my voice is not going to be heard. Everything is already feeling like shit and so mundane and I donâ€™t think I can chug along this track we call life like this. Sheâ€™s my everything, my one true love. She will be the one who got away if she decides to leave. -disclaimer not in a state of ending my life right now please donâ€™t call the cops on me internet people by finding my address or something really that is the last thing I need right now. Iâ€™m just gonna try and go to bed and hope I feel better in the morning.
