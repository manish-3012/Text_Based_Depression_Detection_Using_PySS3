I'm tired of being hatedMy ex-wife jerks me around. We share equal custody of our two kids.  She constantly is late picking or dropping off.  Forgets to have them bring their homework, clothes etc over.

My current partner gets mad and yells at me.  Wants me to "just make her pull her weight" or something like that.

I am tired of being caught in the middle. I am tired of everyone being mad at me. I am tired of busting my ass and still letting everyone down.

I am tired of the pain. I want to lay down, close my eyes and have it all go away.

I am sorry everyone. I really tried my best.
