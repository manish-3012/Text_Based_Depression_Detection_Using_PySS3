yep.Getting divorced. Tried to be ok, I'm not. Feel like I'm losing my son, the only thing that matters. He goes to his mother Monday.

She commits adultery with multiple partners that I can prove. I owe her child support. I don't get custody of my son. I never hit her I worked to provide for my family.

If this is lifw being fair. Fuck it. I quit. Good luck everybody.
