confused and tiredi feel like i havenâ€™t felt anything in months. things arenâ€™t even bad in my life right now. i donâ€™t know why i still just want to die. i feel like i only experience emotions during the day because i tell myself thatâ€™s what iâ€™m supposed to be doing. it feels like a mask. i havenâ€™t cried in forever and i used to be the type of person that was always crying. i donâ€™t even know how to describe my current state. i canâ€™t get myself to end it. i would never want to inflict that kind of pain on my boyfriend or my parents because i know they would blame themselves. i wish i could just die in some freak accident instead of these thoughts hanging over my head everyday.
