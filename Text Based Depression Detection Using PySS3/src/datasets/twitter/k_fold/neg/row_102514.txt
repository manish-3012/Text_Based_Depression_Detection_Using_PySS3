UndesirableI feel so empty and alone. I have zero social skills and I visibly shake around people so much that they even call me out on it and put me down for it.

 Iâ€™m just not meant to have someone that is actually attracted to me. It seriously infuriates me to no end when people say â€œshes somewhere out there looking for youâ€ or some stupid bullshit like that. Who the fuck wants some depressed, socially anxious, lazy, unmotivated piece of shit? Thereâ€™s much better options besides me. 

The only interests I have in life is coming up with methods to kill myself. I have already thought of at least 3 or4 methods that I would like to attempt. 

I plan on killing myself sometime during the new year. Life only gets worse past the age of 21 and I want no part of it. Iâ€™d rather not have to live through an entire lifetime of misery and loneliness. The sweet release of death seems so exciting to me. Canâ€™t wait to rid myself of this piece of shit world
