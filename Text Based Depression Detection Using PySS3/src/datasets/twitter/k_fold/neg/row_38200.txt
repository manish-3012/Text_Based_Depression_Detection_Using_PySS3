Sad.I just called the suicide hotline for the first time today. I'm having a really hard time with seemingly everything in life. The woman who I spoke with was very kind, but I know I'm going to feel this way no matter what. I was with a girl for a few months and I thought we were soulmates, but now she's ghosting me and I'm absolutely heart broken. My 23rd birthday is in 2 months and I'm not sure if I'll make it or not. I'm trying so hard to stay strong, but I feel like there's no hope left for me. I'm absolutely dying inside... I hope someone out there is able to relate...
