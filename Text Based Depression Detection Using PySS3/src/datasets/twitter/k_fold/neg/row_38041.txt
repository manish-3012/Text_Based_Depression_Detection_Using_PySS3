Death would make all of my problems go awayI have quite a few problems on my plate. The biggest one is that I just lost my job about a week ago. Along with that, Iâ€™ve got bills that are adding up with no money to pay them with. I have a car that barely runs and will probably die or break down any minute. I just got served for small claims court over bad debt - with more to come. My credit is in the shitter. I canâ€™t enroll in classes at school because I owe them money. I have student loans coming due next January. Iâ€™m morbidly obese and am no longer a candidate for weight loss surgery because I lost my health insurance when I lost my job. I have a bunch of mental health issues and probably wonâ€™t be able to continue seeking care and medication management because my mom makes too much for me to get state health insurance, even though Iâ€™m no longer her dependent. I *might* be eligible for unemployment, but it only pays about 2/3 of what I was making after taxes and what I was making after taxes was barely enough to get by. On top of that, I canâ€™t apply for work until mid-December since I canâ€™t pass a drug test. Iâ€™m also not sure how Iâ€™m going to be able to pay back my loans given that I have no money and theyâ€™ll be drafted from my checking automatically. As if having no money wasnâ€™t bad enough, Iâ€™ll now have negative money and have to pay for the privilege of having negative money. 

I feel like drinking a bunch and just driving my car into a [heavy duty telephone pole](https://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00RKoalswtaQrq/Hot-DIP-Galvanized-Overhead-Electric-Steel-Power-Pole.jpg)
