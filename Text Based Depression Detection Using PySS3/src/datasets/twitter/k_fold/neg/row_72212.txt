Itâ€™s getting worseI donâ€™t know what else to say. Tonight was the worst itâ€™s been. I have to be at work in 6 hours and I canâ€™t sleep because I canâ€™t stop crying. I just feel like Iâ€™m drowning. I have absolutely no support system in place. Iâ€™m scared I canâ€™t be helped. I donâ€™t have time to get help. I just want to stop drowning.
