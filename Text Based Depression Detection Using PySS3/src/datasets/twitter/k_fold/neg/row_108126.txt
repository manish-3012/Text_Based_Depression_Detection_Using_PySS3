Me (17M) getting my gun outI laying on my bed, thinking if better times. But they are not coming. Everyone says, God has a plan for you, but for me, i don't know. Gonna get my gun out the garden an sit in my room and wait till' i get manly enough to pull the trigger. I have no friends no hobbies and no energy to learn something new. Everyone in my family dies, i have to see it and learn to be "quiet" about it.

Everytime the same shit, i go to work and come home, sitting or laying on my bed, stare trough my failures and again and AGAIN AND AGAIN!!
THEN I GET MYSELF SO DREPRESSED SO I CAN SLEEP FOR 3 HOURS, WAKING UP CRYING OVER MYSELF, THEN CRYING BACK TO SLEEP FOR 2 HOURS. 

Is it really better to be dead? Or to have permanent pain, just to make your family happy?

May god accept my dumbness and sent me to hell...
