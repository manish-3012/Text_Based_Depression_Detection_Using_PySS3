Want to be done with the pain, but don't want to hurt others, and I fear what does / doesn't come next!The title is pretty self explanatory. I have a life that on the outside looks good. Good job. Good family etc... however, it is like a piece of wood that has rotted on the inside and is infested with maggots and termites. 

I have been battling depression and anxiety for years now. I have pissed away a lot of money to make myself happy, but they are only momentary reprieves. 

Honestly, I just want to drive my car to a very wooded and secluded area, take a walk down a long path. Leave said path and find a beautiful spot, and put my pistol to my temple and blow my brains out. Suicide notes and all in my pocket, or in my car. 

However, I don't want to hurt my family, friends, and so and so forth. My best friend committed alcohol induced suicide 4 years ago this past St. Paddy's Day. And it devastated his family, and his friends, and I had to be the barer of bad news to a lot of people because his family couldn't do it right away. I just can't do that to my family, even though they are a large part of my stress and depression. My friends aren't for the most part. I mean I just want this to be over. But I also am afraid of what comes or doesn't come next, and if I am doomed to a worse fate. So for now I won't pull the proverbial and literal trigger. But man I want to.
