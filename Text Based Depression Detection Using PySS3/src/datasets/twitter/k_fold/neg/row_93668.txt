I am just looking for some understand, nothing more.To start off, sorry for the long post. 
To begin with... I am most likely going to kill myself in ~58 days. A lot of people come here looking for actual help, who really want to find a new meaning in life and reasons not to do it. I am not one of them, so if you want to prevent someone's suicide, don't keep on reading. What I would like, though, is some understanding - because I am pretty sure I won't get any, no matter how well I explain myself in the note. And if you offer that understanding, well, you will make me feel better and I'd love that. 

Now, to explain how I got where I am and where exactly I am. For a pretty long time I was one of those very idealistic, very dedicated to doing good things people, one of those fools, who believed they could change the world somehow. I am that still, with some alterations.
What changed was my perception of life. For a very long time I waited for destiny to hit me, to find my calling. What was it going to be? The thing worth living for, the thing worth fighting for? Was it going to be saving people in Somalia, was it going to be working in a special police field /the latter seemed more likely considering my direction in education/, or was it going to be something with politics somehow? I waited for the calling to hit me and ignored that I was already there.
You see, I had a really great relationship with a woman I loved from the very start, but around halfway in through I started to ignore her, waiting for my special fight, for my special war to begin. She lasted as long as she could, then she started growing cold and two months ago, she and I separated. At first, it seemed like no big deal - she wasn't important. She wasn't my special battle. 
I was wrong. 
You see, the world is a cruel, cruel place. Since you are here, you probably have heard it said before. Well, it was never something that brought me down - I am a man of deep religious belief and I only thought it's something I must accept and just try to live while attempting to be the change I would like to see in other people. 
Thing is, the cruel world isn't changeable. The people, they are corrupt by design and bound to destroy themselves in the process. This was what seemed so odd to me - why would my gods send me into a battle that was already lost? What is the point in that? Nevertheless, it was going to be glorious and I awaited my calling eagerly, only to realize it was already there. 
You see, we all get something special in life. That special thing we have to cling on to. Very often, for a lot of people, it is love. It is that one special person, who you meet and have to keep. That is the special war, because love is making the other person happy, every day for your entire life, which is really an everlasting fight, if you do it right. If you don't, well, you end up like a lot of people - alone in the end, or settling with someone who is good and makes you happy, but is not really special, regretting your whole life letting things go wrong. 
Well, that won't be me. 
I finally found my purpose. I found my fight worth fighting. She is now with someone else and I am fighting to win her back with all I've got, but it is a terrible feeling, knowing you've lost the one special thing fate had given you and I can only fight for so long. You see, on some level, she agrees with me - while she does not have the deep belief in fate I have, she still believes I may be the most special love she had in her life. Nevertheless, she doesn't believe I will be her last. She is still so, so angry with me, so hurt... Can I really blame her?
She needs time to decide, which is why we settled on two months from the fifteenth of september. In a month's time, I'll give in my notice, a month later when my boss, who is truly a wonderful person has found my replacement. Afterwards I'll leave enough money for a good funeral, a note to my family explaining myself and take a very carefully calculated dose of prescription medicine I have in a safe deposit in my home. (It is curious how easy it is to get things without a prescription if you wear a nice enough suit in some parts of Europe). 

You see, I studied psychiatry long enough to understand something most people here may or may not know, but... you don't need to be depressed to be suicidal. In fact, there may really be nothing wrong with you. Case in point - I am not completely unhappy without her, I still get my moments of victory and triumphant joy, I am also aware I can be happy again with someone else... I just don't want to. And that is what makes it special. 

What I am going to write in my note is how happy I actually am. I die a warrior; I found my fight worth fighting, I found my purpose. I failed and lost it due to ignorance, but I won't settle to live a half life. There are two options - one, there is a heaven and I see her there, once more, unburdened by past mistakes, ready to be happy and make her happy again for ages to come. Option two: there is nothing out here, I am wrong. I still die for what I believe in, I still live or not live life the way I want. How great is that, really? In fact, I can't wait for it; the suspense of whether I will manage to win this fight or finish my war is, well, killing me. (Hurr, durr. Dark humor. Sorry if it offends anyone.)

My family, of course, won't understand. Now, I may be violating the rules by sending myself on a guilt trip, but I have to be honest - I know how much grief I will cause. They won't understand, as poetic and as reassuring I try to make them of how proud I am of the character I show, of the person I have grown to become and the willingness to take a really hard path, they will still be sad and miss me. They will wonder if they couldn't have stopped it; I'll try to be elaborate enough why they never stood a chance. 

As I said, I am not depressed. I am determined. I am with purpose. I am proud of myself, I am the best I've ever been. No theraupetic help would do anything, because there truly is nothing wrong with me. I just found my purpose in life and am a man with a plan if that purpose doesn't work. And, to tell you, I feel freaking awesome about it. 

So... Does anyone here understand me?
