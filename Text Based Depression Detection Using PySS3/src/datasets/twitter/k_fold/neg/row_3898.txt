Iâ€™m short and donâ€™t think I can continueIâ€™m 5â€™6 and am really considering giving up in life. Iâ€™m short and not attractive. When women started noticing I was stuck at 5â€™6 they all scattered and I was left with low self esteem and no confidence because of it. How am I supposed to continue if I will never meet a partner. All of these studies are showing short men are overwhelmingly seen as lesser, unattractive, not dateable, and poor. Itâ€™s too much for my mind too handle because itâ€™s literal suicide fuel. Growing up all I ever wanted was a beautiful women to start a family with and I donâ€™t believe that will ever happen now. Iâ€™ve thought what if ending it would solve this issue and I would have no worries and maybe even be reborn as someone taller. Who knows. Iâ€™m close to giving up. Please help
