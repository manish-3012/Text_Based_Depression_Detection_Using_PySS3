Iâ€˜m attempting suicideIâ€™m in the middle of a suicide attempt. I donâ€™t understand much about mental health or about liver failure, but Iâ€™ve just swallowed about three handfulls of tylenol with many drinks worth of booze to distract my liver. I donâ€™t know enough to know whether this will actually work, Iâ€™m planning on having more just in case, but god I hope it will. I just have no clue how long itâ€™ll take. I just really donâ€™t want to wait anymore for this to be over. Iâ€™ve written a note already for my friends and family, I just hope itâ€™s enough. I canâ€™t post something like this on other social medias because Iâ€™m worried someone would try to stop me and ruin it. Iâ€™m sorry for such a downer post but I needed to say something somewhere. Iâ€™m sorry.
