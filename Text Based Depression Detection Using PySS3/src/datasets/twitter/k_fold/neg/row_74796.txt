I have a choice to make.Hey, 

I have a choice to make. I'm being strongly encouraged to see a doctor/therapist type. That is option one. The other option is to act on my desire to commit suicide. I'm not naive and I know nobody here would tell me to choose option two. Instead of asking which option to choose, I am here to ask questions.

The person strongly enouraging me to see someone is a parent of mine and likely doesn't know the extent to which I have these feelings. At best, this person suspects depression. This person wants me to attend an appointment at the same therapist that they attend. I'd rather nobody know the extent to which I have these feelings.

1. Knowing that:

a) The person is my parent.

b) The person attends the same therapist.

c) The person is likely paying for the session(the insurance surely will).


What is the therapist able to say to my parent? I find it highly unlikely that the therapist would be able to say anything, but I am unsure if the therapist could slip it into a session with my parent.

2. I've been having suicidal ideations for a while now. I've done my own research and mostly have staved off these thoughts from progressing further. Assuming I fully commit to trying to get better and let the therapist know about these feelings, in what situations would it be possible for them to enforce a 72 hour involuntary hold?

In my research, I've read that anything short of a expressing a plan won't be enough for a hold.

3. I don't really want to get better. I know that I probably should and that this is probably just the depression monster feeding itself, but I really don't. I am tired and I feel that it is too late. Why should I try?

But I know question three is bullshit. I've been reading /r/sw for a while now and no words ever make a difference.
