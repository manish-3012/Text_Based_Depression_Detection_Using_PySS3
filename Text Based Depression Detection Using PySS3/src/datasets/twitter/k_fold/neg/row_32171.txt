'Use this time wisely, it won't happen again'You know what? If I had the fucking energy to pick up a new hobby or whatever else everyone is doing during their quarentine time, I would. I look at things and wish I had the willpower to do *something*. *anything* that isn't trying to keep the depression under control. It makes me sad to see everyone making memories with family and overall having new experiences. My family is toxic and I get yelled at and looked at like I am nothing more than a disgusting disappointment. Fuck everything, I don't want to be like this. Stop telling me to just cheer up and be happy and make the most of it. I can't right now. I'm just trying to survive this so I can move on.

Sorry for the rant, hope you guys are doing okay.
