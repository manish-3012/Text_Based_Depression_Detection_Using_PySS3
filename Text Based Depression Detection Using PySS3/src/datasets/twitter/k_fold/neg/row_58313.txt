Iâ€™d rather die than be homeless.I just reached the point where I can work again, but Iâ€™m not making enough at the temp agency while I look for stable work. I canâ€™t afford my rent thatâ€™s due today, and Iâ€™ve exhausted all resources. 

I live together with my friends as roommates, and I have to move out obviously if I canâ€™t pay. I have no one, my entire family is overseas.

Thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m going to let myself be homeless.

Iâ€™ve had suicide scares before, Iâ€™ve been depressed all my life and have BPD. And the scary part is, this is different. I feel numb and strangely tranquil, like I know itâ€™s going to happen.

I just donâ€™t care anymore.
