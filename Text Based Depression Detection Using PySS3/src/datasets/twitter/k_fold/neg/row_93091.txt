I think I've reached a crossroads - I can either continue living a life of misery and depression or I can finally end it.If you meet me, you meet a friendly, cheerful, extroverted girl. I'm in a sorority, I have a boyfriend, I'm of average intelligence, well-traveled, generally well-liked. You would have no fucking clue that every day since the age of 12 I have battled my depression, anxiety and PTSD.

I was briefly happy, for two months on my gap year when I traveled Australia. For those months, my depression disappeared and I finally got why so many people loved living. Then I started university and very quickly forgot that feeling.

I'm in my 4th year of uni. I hate my life. I'm just so genuinely unhappy. I never saw myself living this long, I always thought I'd have killed myself in my teens. I got this far through guilt, laziness and cowardice. The last time I seriously tried to kill myself was 6 years ago, but I've absolutely had suicidal thoughts since then.

I just don't see myself ever being happy or even just being less horribly depressed. I barely leave my bed most days unless I have concrete plans or things to do that day like a test, a mandatory sorority meeting or a date with my boyfriend. I don't have any motivation or drive. I realized last year that I am not cut out for the types of jobs my degree steers you towards so now I'm wrapping up a mistake worth thousands of dollars.

My therapist is out of town for the next few weeks. I don't know if I think my state of mind is risky enough to check myself into the emergency room. I don't know if I would want to check myself into the emergency room if my state of mind gets to the point where I literally am counting out the pills. I'm just posting here for an outlet. I can't tell my friends or boyfriend that I've gotten to this point. I don't talk to any of my family. I'm just stuck.
