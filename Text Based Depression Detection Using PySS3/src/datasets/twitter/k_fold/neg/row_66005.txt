Just waiting for that one weak moment...I have Borderline Personality Disorder. My life is shit. I hate myself so fucking much. I don't have any close friends. I can't make any friends. And the ones I have rather spent their time with other people. They even gave me reasons for that. Fuck this.

I am so tried of being emotional unstable. My next appointment with a new therapist is in 4 weeks. The only thing that makes me thinks I should reconsider. But I know even going there won't help. I'm living a non existent life. I don't even know if I am real. I just want it to finally end.

I have absolutely nothing. I can't do anything and I am worthless. I do have a really clear plan in how I want to end it. I even wrote my last words down. The only thing I am waiting for is that one moment that welcomes me in the arms of death.
