Feel like dying ... againI'm almost 24, just got my first full time job which is going well, and I'm going to be moving in with my boyfriend of 3 years very soon. I am at a big turning point in my life, and have every reason in the world to be happy.

But I'm not. At all.

In fact, it feels like my suicidal episodes are getting more and more frequent and worse by the day. I often brake down right in front of my boyfriend, and while he is supportive I can only wonder how long he will continue to love me as I am. 

Tonight is the worst it has been in years. (I've lived with these feelings since I was 10). I have cried so much that I have reached the point where I just feel empty and lost. I know I'm hungry but I can't bring myself to eat or move from my bed. 

I really just wanted to post here to get my feelings out there, as I usually bottle them up. Even as I type this I'm somehow crying again even though I thought I was out of tears. 

I've never done this before so I'm not sure what will come of it. But at this point even a stranger telling me that it will be alright might help me to calm down. I'm so scared and sad that I can't even sleep. 

Even if you don't really mean it, could someone tell me that I matter? That I'm not worthless and that I don't need to die? I'm losing hope quickly and I don't know what to do.
