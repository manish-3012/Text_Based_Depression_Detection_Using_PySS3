Break-up has been rough. I think about killing myself every night.He doesn't even care about me. He's so indifferent towards me after he broke up with me. We were together for a long time. And he ended it by a quick phone call and doesn't plan to give me closure at all even. Oh and the best part is that he claims we're still friends. This guy abused me mentally, emotionally and slightly physically and all he does is kick my spirit into the ground and make me feel miserable. I've tried to kill myself so many times and it never works. I feel so dead on the inside. It hurts.
