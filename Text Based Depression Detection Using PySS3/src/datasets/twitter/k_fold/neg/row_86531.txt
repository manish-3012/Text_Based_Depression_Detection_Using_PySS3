Quick Question about HangingRecently, I have been feeling betrayed by everybody in my family, my school, and even my teachers. I got ripped apart by the academic dean today for not handing in 1 assignment in Math. Nobody is believing me at anything I do anymore. Taking life is almost guaranteed for tomorrow. I am pretty confident that I would die if I tried it (Thank God). The one thing that I'm not sure on is where. I live down the street from my school and have narrowed it down to two options. 

1. Back of the school outside my advisor's window

2. At home as to not disturb anybody.

If anybody knows what looks better to others, please let me know. I have everything ready and was just looking for a bit of input before I make the jump tomorrow morning.
