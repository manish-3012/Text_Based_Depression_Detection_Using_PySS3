My BirthdayItâ€™s my birthday soon,
Inside this broken mind, this dark room,
All I feel is sadness and impending doom. 

From a young age I was abused, 
For his lustfulness I was used,
No wonder my brain blew a fuse. 

Sex, alcohol &amp; prescription drugs,
This was the start of my sickness bug.

There is nothing that fills this void inside,
Other than Whispers &amp; blades that reside. 

Since I was 7 I have tried 15 times,
Now thatâ€™s a line thatâ€™s hard to rhyme. 

Why is it that they just canâ€™t let me go,
My soul was stunted it cannot grow. 

Iâ€™m tired of fighting for things I need,
To help me cope I make myself bleed,
From this vessel I want to be freed. 

Itâ€™s my birthday soon and 30 will pass,
People say that bad times donâ€™t last,
I try my best but no one can see,
Just what this so called living does to me.

I want to be at peace now,
But I canâ€™t help but think, of all the imaginary dirty dishes left in the sink,
Jumping off will end me in a blink,
But for the few that love me I still canâ€™t help but think.

Life will go on, but without me,
I just hope that they will understand some day that it was always going to end this way.
