Girlfriend tried to cheat on me with one of my best friendsFeels like it's all the same old same old and I feel that I knew that this was too good to be true. There's no real good people out there, everyone's got some kind of selfish motive to either fill their pockets or inflate their ego. There's always gonna be backstabbing people and I'm always gonna be lonely. I don't wanna deal with this anymore, I want to hang myself.
