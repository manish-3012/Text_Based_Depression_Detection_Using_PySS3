nothing works. nothing can work. i'm resigned to my fate.you name it, i've tried it. therapy is useless. meds are useless. being around family and friends is useless. talking about my feelings is useless. exercise and eating healthy is useless. going out is useless. spending time with my dog is useless. no "hobbies" give me any pleasure, satisfaction, or fulfillment. the only person i have ever loved ruined my perspective on relationships and on people, so dating is a no go. dropped out of school because i couldn't find any education path that i could connect to in the least. won't get a job because i'm a lazy parasite. i truly am incompatible with life. i'm only posting here as catharsis; "giving myself a pity-party like always", as my father describes it. lots of people on this subreddit have reached out to me; unfortunately, i just can't be helped. i've recently just been secluding myself in my apartment, (that i don't even pay for, i'm too worthless and pathetic and lazy to be able to support myself financially), and slowly rotting away and intentionally not taking care of myself so that i can hopefully die young.
