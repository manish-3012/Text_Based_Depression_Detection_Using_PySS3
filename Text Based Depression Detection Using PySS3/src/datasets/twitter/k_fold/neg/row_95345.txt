I'm going to kill myself.I can't do it anymore. I have PTSD from combat, a brain injury from same, anxiety and major depression. I've been on dozens of medications over 13 years of treatment. It's not helping. I've given it time. I held out hope. I'm never going to be okay. I'm never going to have a happy life. I'm always going to be a burden to my family and my friends. Killing myself would be spare others from my rage and anger and sadness. I can't do this anymore.
