On the grand scheme is death, I'm nothingI have continually lost everyone in my life since I was 2. My dad left me, my mom died, my grandpa died, my best friend's dad was killed in a car wreck I was supposed to be in (he took me in after my family died). Friends leave. My bf just broke up with me out of the blue. And I am over mourning people. I can keep going and building relationships, but I'm so over the constant mourning of people. I took my dog back to the ex's house because she's stressed thanks to the front house having a giant dog that shares the yard. She's the only reason I was holding out last night while those thoughts of suicide danced in my head. Please don't say this is selfish. I've experienced death on a grand scale and my death, compared to that is minuscule. I'm ready to go. I just can't get past my damn fear of dying. I've taken pills and I'm currently drinking ,but I'm worried about seeing fucking Trump go to prison. WTF?!? I guess this is my first practice run.
