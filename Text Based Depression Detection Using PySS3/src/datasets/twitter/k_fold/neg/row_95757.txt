When is a connection implied?I've had a great year-- one of the best. There was a whole 4 month period where I would only briefly think about suicide once or twice a week, and even then I was thinking more on the interesting absence of those thoughts than the thoughts themselves. 

But nightly knots are back again. Along with planning and the hard reaffirmation that I could never bring this stuff up to anyone I know. Hints of sadness may come with a empathetic look, but that sentiment easily fades into the background of everyone's own mind-hive. 

Why is it so cyclical? What can I do to make it go away? Spending days in bed or equivalently in inaction is so extremely self-destructive the more responsibilities I begin to take on, but trying to take control is so much like slogging through chest-deep mud. I don't know what to do. Please help.  

Edit: My title doesn't really make sense in context with this post. It's the old, "I feel I'm alone, but I know I'm not" feeling. I honestly do believe people care about me-- to a point. They just won't think to put up a stop sign until I get run over, though.
