constant temporary apathyi just posted on here a few hours ago, and i figured i would sleep it off and feel better. i didn't, and after some thought i think "sleeping it off" is an inherently flawed perspective to take on these issues. all of the reasons i want to die are either logical or arise from my self-hatred. for those that are logical, regardless of how i'm feeling emotionally at any given time, they still apply. the only way to get respite from them is by forgetting they exist, which can be done through sleeping to wipe the short-term memory. from what i can gather, neurotypicals want to live precisely *because* they can block out these thoughts, even though it's actively harmful to their life and society to do so. the lie of "enjoying life" actually consists of constantly ignoring the exact things that lower your quality of life. i can't justify calling those who are depressed "irrational" anymore. we seem so much more rational and clear-headed, just hyperaware.
