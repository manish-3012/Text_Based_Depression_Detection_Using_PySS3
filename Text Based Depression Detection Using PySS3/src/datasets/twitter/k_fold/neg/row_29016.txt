I really just wanna relaxMolested at age 8, persuaded to sending nudes to a pedophile at age 11, got overweight shortly after, lost weight as a means to help my depression and slow down the suicidal thoughts, it worked for a bit, but I'm back here. Now I'm 17, depressed with absolutely 0 friends and no one to talk to about my problems. At 14 I left Islam without telling my family, because if I did, I would've been disowned. So now I have to live my life pretending to be someone I'm not which isn't helping my mental health.

If you have family and friends that love you, please cherish that and stay around for them.


I'm Male, btw
