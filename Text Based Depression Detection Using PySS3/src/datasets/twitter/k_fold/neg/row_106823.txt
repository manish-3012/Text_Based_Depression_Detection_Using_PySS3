Nothing to turn to tonightNo friends, no girlfriend, dog died, just nothing. My body hurts and I just want to sleep but I can't. There is nothing for me.

How can this be. Just how. Nothing can console me. I don't even know why im posting here. Im a loser. A fucking failure. I've felt this way for years and it never gets better because I'm always me. I can't "love myself for who I am" because nobody loves me. I can't sustain with self love.

There's nothing or anyone to turn to and I can't take it.
