Why haven't I done it, and why shouldn't I?Lockdown still going on in the UK where I am, and each day is a coin flip. Some are good, some are bad. But I'm sick of the bad ones. I'm sick of being unable to sleep at night, staying up, going to bed real early the next day then sleeping for like 15 hours, letting the cycle begin again. I'm sick of just sitting inside doing the same stuff day after day, not being able to see anyone, hug anyone, touch anyone. I'm sick of seeing the deaths. And someone I know died a few days back, not even related to corona but a traffic accident. They were only early 20s. I wasn't a friend and I didn't know them well, but I wanted to and I knew they were a good person. Why should I get to live but they have their life cruelly snatched away? And what right do I have to be sad for them, to cry for them, when they've got family members out there who are really grieving?

I'm looking lovingly at my pet rats right now, and they do really know how to make me smile. But I don't know if that's enough. I've saved the massive shard of glass for just this occasion. Why should I not do it? Why shouldn't I just take it to my wrists and be done with it? It'll be better for people in the long run, they can stop worrying and pussyfooting around me.

Please help me.
