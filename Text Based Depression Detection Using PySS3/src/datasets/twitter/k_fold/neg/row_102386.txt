Can't do it because of my familyI would be long gone by now if it wasn't for my family. My parents have struggled with pain and depression for decades, yet they've done everything they could for me. I can't imagine the anguish my death would cause them. They don't deserve that. I often think about how once they've both passed away, that will be it. The Godfather P2 quote often comes to mind, "I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive". No parent should have to bury their child.
