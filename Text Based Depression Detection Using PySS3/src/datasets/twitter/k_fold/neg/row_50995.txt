Not even the counselors seem to give a shitMy parents made me join a group at school. It's like a once a week counseling session during class with a group of people who go through the same stuff you do. 

They're all alcoholics and smoke and do drugs and that's why they're in the group, no fucking idea why I am. Guess they're just scared I'll off myself even if I don't have alcohol or drugs. 

I had to stop by to sign something, I haven't gone in a month. I figured if they cared they'd actually send a pass to the class I'm in at the time(which they do for all the people who'd probably actually benefit from going to class for once but whatever), otherwise it's no big deal. 

The counselor who runs the group didn't even realize I hadn't been there in a month.  I'm one of five people in the group. 

So now I'm just sitting in a bathroom stall crying, probably gonna eat my lunch in here too.
