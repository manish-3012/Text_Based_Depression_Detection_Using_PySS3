Is hitting myself in the head bad?I usually do it every day, but only when no oneâ€™s around. Punching, kicking, etc. Whatever hurts and leaves a bruise. I only ever hit myself hard on the forehead, or occasionally on the face. I stop once I either feel dizzy or start throwing up.  What Iâ€™m asking more specifically is; can you go blind if you hit yourself too hard? I canâ€™t tie a noose if Iâ€™m blind.
