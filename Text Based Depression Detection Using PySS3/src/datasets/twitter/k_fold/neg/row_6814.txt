I want to have a significant death (misleading title, sorry)I fantasize about suicide all the time, but I have absolutely no plans to pursue it soon. I don't ever want to grow old and become a useless human being, so I plan to kill myself somehow around the age of 50-55.\

That being said, I just want to reiterate that I am not immediately suicidal.

The thing that bothers me is that I don't know how I want to go. I'd like to go out with a bang, but I also want to have a creative factor involved. 

Does anybody else has similar aspirations/feelings?
