Running out of emotional supportI am not an introverted person. I very deeply crave connections to people, I am just so bad at it due to the emotional abuse of my sisters from as far back as I can remember that I am horrible at starting conversations and will just silently coast through a situation even if I wanted to make new friends. I have been depressed for most of my life but there is very much a "you don't know what you have 'til it's gone" situation slowly overtaking my life. I have never been in a real, romantic relationship (I am a virgin at 19 and have had very bad luck romantically). I didn't have nearly as many friends in school as I wanted, and was never as close to them as I wanted to be. After dropping out of high school due to depression, I had very few left in contact and now they are so unreliable to contact that I can actually feel what remaining friendships I had slowly dying. My pets were the pride of my existence and due to something out of my control I had to see them taken from me in November. The shelter euthanized one dog and two cats with little warning and adopted the remaining dog (the one I personally took care of the most) out without telling me at all. They had the legal right to do so, but I will never forgive them regardless. I have no job, no friends, no relationship, and very little family left to rely on. I thought life was an awful pit of despair I could never escape before, but the hope that my emotional supports could help me survive my depression and live happier and safely was what carried me this far. As that hope slowly dwindles, I can't keep relying on daydreams and fantasies that it all gets better. I just ... don't know what to do with myself anymore.
