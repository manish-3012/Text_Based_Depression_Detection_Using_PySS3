HelpIâ€™m 13 years old and I want to disappear. My dad has anger issues and my mom has mental health issues. I only feel happiness by going online and playing video games. I hate going outside and only like to be in my room. I hate having responsibilities and always wish to be alone. I donâ€™t have any friends I donâ€™t think I want any. I try to be happy but is really hard because I always feel like Iâ€™m on my own.
