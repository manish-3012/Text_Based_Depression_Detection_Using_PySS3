Mixed feelingsI ordered what I need to kill myself a couple of weeks ago and it came today. I don't have a plan on when I'll do it, but having it here is definitely the closest I've come to being able to go through with it. It's somehow both comforting and uncomfortable at the same time. I researched methods thoroughly and this will be 100% effective if no one discovers me for at least five hours. That's very easy to accomplish. I'm just rambling now. Anyone relate?
