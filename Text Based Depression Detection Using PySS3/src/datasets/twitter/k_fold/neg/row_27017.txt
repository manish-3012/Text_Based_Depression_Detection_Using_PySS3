Iâ€™m trying to not think about the negative things that happened on my life. Some days I just canâ€™t help to throw myself pity party. Hard to not feel that I failed life.I spent my whole life trying to find someone that will be willing to love me. My parents was never there for me when I was growing up, other than giving me a shelter and food, I had basically no memories with them. I never went on a family trip, I never had a board game night or even went to the movies with them. I never felt that I was wanted and I always felt alone. I was never taught how to love myself and I never taught how to love other people. 

I tried to find that family that I never had from friends in high school and college but it just really not the same. I guess I just have no ability to develop these relationships because I was never taught how.

I cant stop feeling that I really failed my life. I tried over and over again but I still failed. I spent my whole life trying to find someone that would be willing to love me. But Im still alone, Im still unloved, Im still unwanted.

If I died, it would probably take months for people to even realize that I was gone and it would not matter

Sorry, I need to get that off my chest. Iâ€™m still trying to move forward but Iâ€™m just so tired of trying. But god can you give me a reason why I should continue living? so I know you did bring me to this world not to just endure the meaningless suffering of this life.
