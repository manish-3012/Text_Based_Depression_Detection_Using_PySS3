I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on.It seems like everything in my life is falling apart. I was always a bright student, but college has brought tragedy after tragedy. I was finally doing better this past fall semester, and then my grandmother died unexpectedly. Iâ€™m such a fucking failure and embarrassment, Iâ€™m never going to get anywhere in life. All I want to do is sleep and avoid the pain of life. The only thing that has been keeping me back is my family, it would be devastating for them. I feel horrible to have such a loving and supportive family, but still be this way.
