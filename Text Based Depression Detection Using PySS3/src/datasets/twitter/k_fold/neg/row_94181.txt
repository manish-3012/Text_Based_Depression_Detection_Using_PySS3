detached (from the election, from the world)anyone else feel detached or disoriented or deluded in a way where you find yourself really taking the election/current events in stride? like, everything was already upside down/incomprehensibly fucked up in my life where i see no way but out, and that the election is just another fucked up thing i have to exist through until i decide to opt out? (or, my personal thought: sometimes things are fucked up in a way where it isnt necessarily the best choice to try to salvage it)
