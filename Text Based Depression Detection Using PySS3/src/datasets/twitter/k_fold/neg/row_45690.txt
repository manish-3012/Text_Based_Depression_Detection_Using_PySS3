2morrow I hopeI lost her because of a third party and she still liked me but her parents stopped it and blamed me I did nothing wrong

I'm tired of having no control

We'll never see one another again and I can't cope

Idk if she still likes me but I think ending it now will be good, she'll probably hear about it thru 1 of my friends....

No control....when does it get 2 end, I'm at the point of romantasizing my suicide and I like how it ends

My not is complete I've been abandoned by all but 1 friend and I'm ready to give up

Idk life is fucked i have no1 to talk to and going to inpatient sounds like hell, I'd prefer the nothingness of death if I'll never see her again
