i am confused, scared, and i need advice as well as reassurance.i am pretty sure that what i experienced over these past 5 days was derealization due to my head feeling very foggy and everything appearing dreamlike. i feel after i had Extremely discomforting feelings of unreality, that is when my OCD worries started to pop up and from there started the body aches, the anhedonia, the feeling of wanting to end it all. for 5 days i felt like i was a different person, i felt like i was in a dream on top of severe feelings of hopelessness. watching a football game at home felt almost like having the flu with the added feelings of unreality effect. moral of the story: i am scared and i am not prepared if this comes back again. this episode was the 3rd time this has ever happened to me. i feel normal now but i still feel hopeless, i just have no joy to look forward to the future, the episode was so paralyzing to the point the only thought i get was ''suicide''. i can't deal with another episode and the after effects of it. i have no support or reassurance. im on zoloft, seroquel and sure they helped my OCD in many areas but i am completely vulnerable now. i feel the medication should have made me immune or much more resistant to an episode like this. i want to move forward but what if it comes back? whats the point of anything. i really do not know what to do, the episode could literally be interpreted as the spawn of satan, i don't mean that literally but it can be so bad to the point it can destroy your life in those 4-5 days.
