Any online hotlines?I haven't needed a hotline for so long but I'm at my wit's end right now. I can't call anyone using Skype OR a phone and it has to be instant. Does anyone know of any online chat hotlines that are ACTUALLY available 24/7? I just went to the National Suicide Prevention hotline chat and it hasn't connected me to anyone yet. I really need to talk to someone.
