I feel like Iâ€™m at the end of my ropeIâ€™m a sophomore in college, and I think about killing myself 1-2 times per day on a good day, and as of late, anywhere from 4-6 times a day. I genuinely canâ€™t be alone in my room without constantly thinking about how badly I want to kill myself. The worst part is, I think itâ€™s driving away all my friends. The people in my circle of friends have been incredibly distant since I first started trying to talk about my suicidal ideation and mental health challenges more openly, and lately my best friends and the girl that Iâ€™ve been seeing for the past few months (who Iâ€™m normally really close with) have all been incredibly distant, and it constantly feels like they donâ€™t want to be around me and donâ€™t love me anymore. Im sure there are a ton of variables as to why they might be or seem distant, but the only thing I can connect it to is my mental health. Only one of my friends has communicated why sheâ€™s been distant and im still sort of confused on what she wants me to be doing better. 

Part of me feels like Iâ€™m going insane because I try so hard to remind myself that people get busy, and not everyoneâ€™s available all the time, but when the people I love most seemingly always want to be apart from me, I canâ€™t help but feel that Iâ€™ve done something wrong or bad. 

Iâ€™ve been reaching out to the mental health services on campus, and have an emergency case manager who I love and is incredibly helpful sometimes, but even going to regular therapeutic sessions twice a week canâ€™t shake this deep deep urge to just kill myself. Iâ€™ve even been cutting out weed and the likes from my habits and diets and I still feel horrible, sometimes even worse. 

I feel like a pathetic, unloveable, mess, and I just want to be dead so badly, but the nearest gun store is 5 miles away and the windows to my 6th floor dorm room donâ€™t open wide enough for me to jump out, so for now Iâ€™m out of luck. What the fuck do I do
