I must be very selfishDoes anyone else want to be missed? Like I know Iâ€™m going to do it, I honestly canâ€™t imagine living after failing AGAIN or getting any older. But I want someone to remember me. Iâ€™m really isolated right now, and I feel like that should be a really good thingâ€” I wonâ€™t traumatize anyone when I blow my brains out, right?? But part of me just really wants to be missed. Iâ€™m pathetic, right?
