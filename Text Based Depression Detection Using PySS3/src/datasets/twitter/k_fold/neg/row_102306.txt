I will jump. My final goodbye.I am standing on the top of a 7 floor building. I am on the edge with my phone. I managed to break trough the locked door, it was hard because many we have most of the suicide ratio/person in the world, and in my town, it is one of the highest..

I can't accept, that I have to live without a driving licence. I failed the driving exam 4 times. That's all you can try in my country. I won't live without a driving licence anymore, but because I am unable to drive I don't want to deserve life, as a 20 year old male university student.

 If I wouldn't kill myself, I would just drive without it, and I would just break the law everytime. I wouldn't care if I got busted, I would still drive. And then I would be in jail. And I didn't talk about that I could easily kill someone because I am bad at driving, that is why I failed many times. But I won't accept my fate. When I write jump and tap on the post button, I will make that jump and in 5 seconds, I will be a dead, bloody thing on the ground. Goodbye everybody.

Jump
