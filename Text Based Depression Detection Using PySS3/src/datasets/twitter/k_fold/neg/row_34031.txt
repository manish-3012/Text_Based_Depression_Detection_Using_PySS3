I'm gonna OD tonightMy life is a right mess. I feel so completely alone. My work schedule prevents me from going to any sort of group activities that I'd be interested in. Board game nights always start hours and hours before I get off work. I just spent close to $400 on board games that will never get played.

At work I get panic attacks at least once a week. Heartburn is hitting me constantly. I have zero friends and the only one I thought I had bailed on me when I needed him after a bad panic attack.

So I have nothing to look forward to at all. Why keep going?
