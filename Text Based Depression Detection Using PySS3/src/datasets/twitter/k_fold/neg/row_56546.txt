I can't take it anymoreI failed my 5th year in college for the 3rd time in a row, and it's the final one with exams in it.

I never failed a year before that.

I never wanted to be a doctor, I only chose it because I had good grades in high school and my dad wanted to see me become one.

I'm not a good person at heart who only wants to help people, and I'm not in it for the money either.

All I wanted is to play video games. But even that had changed with time, seeing all my friends moving on and almost graduate while I'm stuck here.

I only made it so far because my parents were forcing me to study through it. But now that I've grown and realized that I can do whatever I want, they lost that power over me. And it all went to shit after that.

I can't start over after I've spent 7 years in this shit hole of a school.

My dad doesn't want to see my face around here anymore.

I'd rather die than move out and work as a burger flipper for 8hours a day for minimum wage.

I can't take this shit anymore... I just wanna die...

Don't fuckin EVER let anyone decide what your job will be.
