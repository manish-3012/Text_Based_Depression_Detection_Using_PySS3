Idk what to doI've made a bunch of posts here and deleted them after like a day or two but I never put any background information or anything like that so here's my genuine post. 

I am 18 years old and a freshman in college, and I had a long depressive episode that lasted from the start of the semester (August 30 around) to about a week ago. It "ended" in a life changing epiphany. BUT, it's also resulted in a lot of missed classes to the point where the highest grade I have is a C-. I had a paper due last week that I never even started and it's worth 25% of my final grade. 

My plan (for school) is to just take an F in that class and try to bring the grades up that I can. After school is over and my parents kick my ass for wasting their money (they're paying for 100% of my tuition) I'd like to leave the school and not return for the spring semester. I would get a job and pay my parents back for the semester just to tie up "loose ends". 

I would then pick one of three paths:

1) Pack up and leave. Everyone I love talks poorly about me behind my back (I'm usually in the other room when I hear shit). With this path, I'd either tell people I'm leaving and move to a different state, or just disappear and move to Europe. 

2) Suicide. I have such crippling anxieties and other shitty traits that make me a weak human in terms of survivability. It's to the point that I don't want to waste time. I don't see anything desirable in life and I don't know what could change that would make me feel differently. 

3) Go back to school and try to make my parents proud. 

I'm sure there's so much more information that I haven't put here but I'm really shitty at putting thoughts into words. 

Anyway, I'm just looking for some stranger's input.
