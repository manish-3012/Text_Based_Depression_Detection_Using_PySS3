Why do I existI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing in life Iâ€™m a failiure academically and socially, and Iâ€™ve never actually made an inpact on someoneâ€™s life. Iâ€™m always the disposable person anyway. I might end up killing myself or I might talk myself out of it weâ€™ll have to see. Thereâ€™s no reason for me to be alive and Iâ€™m going to die from rabies or cjd first anyway. I have no future and Iâ€™ve never had one. I donâ€™t feel good anytime now . Iâ€™ve never felt this way and Iâ€™m scared and exhausted and tired and sad and I donâ€™t m is what to do anymore and killing myself is just going to be the easiet option for everyone. Everyone always tells me itâ€™s going to be better in the future but it never is.
