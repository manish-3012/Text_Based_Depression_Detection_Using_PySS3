Suicidal , depressed , lonely 24/7. Overdosing soon . Goodbye .Male ,19. Always on drugs . Average looking . People always fuck with my head then leave . Iâ€™m sick of this shit man . I donâ€™t have anyone to talk with . Seeing people go about their day with their significant other just kills me. Im struggling to see the point in living anymore . Just feel empty , depressed , suicidal . Canâ€™t be bothered to do anything anymore . First thought I have when I wake up is â€œ fuck I want to die â€œ. Iâ€™ve learnt that people really donâ€™t want anything to do with someone like myself . People like me will more than likely always be alone in life . Iâ€™m not sure where this post is going , but if anyone reads this all Iâ€™m asking is that you guys be there for one another . Strangers , family , pets etc . Iâ€™ve just taken roughly 20 oxys, 32 ,2mg Xanax and Iâ€™m drinking some beer and liquor . Knowing Iâ€™m not waking up from this brings me a sense of peace and tranquility.  Love you all , stay strong , keep your loved ones close and donâ€™t give up the fight . We all have our own demons , not all of us can win the fight but try your best . Iâ€™ve tried my hardest but I couldnâ€™t do it. Goodbye everyone . ðŸ–¤
