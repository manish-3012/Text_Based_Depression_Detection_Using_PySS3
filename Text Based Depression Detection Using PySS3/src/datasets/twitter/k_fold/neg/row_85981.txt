Why am I still here?Hello /sw, I'm new to reddit. I'm 20 years old, and for a long time have been battling depression and anxiety. I've seen a number of psychs, been on a lot of medications over the years, quit drinking and doing drugs, and started working out a lot. My current drive is to be a bodybuilder I suppose. But lately I've just been feeling sick of living. 

I don't have a lot of drama in my life, and I tend to avoid it. But I just can't figure out why I'm still alive. Something or some force out there is making me stave off these feelings temporarily as if I have a purpose, but they always come back even stronger. I don't know if I could commit suicide, but I don't think that death would be terrible if it came to me. I just really don't know what I should do anymore.
