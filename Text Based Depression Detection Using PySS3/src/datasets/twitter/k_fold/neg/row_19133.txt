LostI have no courage to talk to other people, my mind races and then self doubt sets in.
It's always been like this.
I have no clue how it started maybe the past of childhood trauma.

I've tried receiving help so many times but always ended with me isolating myself.
I've never had a relationship with the opposite sex, I'm 23 and male.
Always seen myself as a dirty Aboriginal, so I truly never tried having any relations with people.
I've always hated the color of my skin so much that I cant truly accept myself, I guess it's just how I was raised.

Now in the present i'm gonna be homeless my power bill is a staggering 1k
First it was 500, now they added another 500.

I can't keep going like this, it's so hard waking up knowing you failed as a human being.
I see suicide is the only option at this point.
