Was given two optionsIt was either right back to the mental ward or the halfway house. Having been to the mental ward many times, I chose going to a halfway house. If Iâ€™m caught trying to commit suicide before I go to the halfway house or during my stay I lose my spot and have to go to the mental ward.

Being away from home and being on my own is what I wanted in the first place, so this is cool. I gotta experience this at least once before I die. I donâ€™t actually have much to say this time around. Once I return home Iâ€™m still gonna kill myself though
