Every now and again I get an urgeI have do idea what I want to do for the rest of my life. I think I'm going to fail this semester of college. It feels like so few people like me. I have no talents. I have little will to live. I'm old enough to get a gun now... I always figured that's how I'd do it. I seriously seriously doubt I will. In fact, I know that I won't- but I still get a hankering to do it. I am weak. I am a coward. I'd never do it, but I just.... wanted to post this I guess. There's something wrong with me. I haven't eaten in 3 days. Everyone thinks I'm weird. I don't want to be so.... me. I want to be not me. Oh geez idk what I'm saying.  


Thanks for reading.
