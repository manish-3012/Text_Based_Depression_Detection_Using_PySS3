17, no friends no hobbiesHello


I've been abused by my mother for all my life, physically aswell as psychically. She "raised" me by herself, I visited my dad every second weekend. She screams at me for the smallest things (for example: my shoes not being where they should be or leaving my jacket laying around). She also hits me and everything is my fault. This might not sound like a big deal, but it has been going like this for my whole life. That, in combination with bullying and acne has hurt my confidence incredibly, to the point where I can only go out masked with a hood and sunglasses. I also cant look people in the eyes. Just hearing the door shut when she comes home brings up PTSD and gets me afraid and annoyed. 

I used to have a few good friends, but they backstabbed me (after 2-3 years of friendship) while we were on school vacation. They found new friends, spread rumors about me and dont talk to me anymore. Furthermore, my best friend of 5 years got more and more depressed and anxious and refuses to talk to anyone and is in a psychiatry now. She brought so much happiness into my life, we did stuff like photoshop battles were we would shop eachother into ridiculous situations or draw togheter (she is very talented, in strong contrast to me). Her leaving probably hurt me the most, altough I dont blame her.

All I have are video games, but I slowly lose the interest in them. I tried clubbing and I didnt enjoy it. 

I just havent ended it because Im a pussy and theres no painless way I know off


Thank you for reading this, it means a lot to me
