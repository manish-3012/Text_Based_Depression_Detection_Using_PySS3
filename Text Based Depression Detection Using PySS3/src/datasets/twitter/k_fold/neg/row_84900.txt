I don't think I can keep goingI'm trapped in an abusive marriage that I can't stay strong enough to leave. My stepson has suffered some sort of mental break after seeing his estranged mother, and my husband has blamed it entirely on me (even after his kid has physically attacked me &amp; stolen a knife to try and harm me). I've learned the hard way that my husband wasn't looking for a wife, just a babysitter that would never have an issue with his children.

I've been trying to fix my marriage for so long, and I've been trying to escape and leave on my own but neither are working. My husband has been screaming, shouting, throwing shit, breaking shit, and telling me how much of a cunt I am for the last 11 hours pretty much straight, taking breaks only to take a piss or make coffee. Thank fuck he fell asleep.

Even if I get past this episode it's going to happen again in a few days. I'm shaking, I can't stop crying, I'm terrified to leave my chair because I don't want to get hurt. I have no support system, he's taken my paychecks and car, and I don't have it in me to keep putting up with this. I don't even see a point anymore. The kids hate me, the husband hates me, my friends can't stand me and even I can't stand myself anymore. I honestly think ending everything is the right way to go for everyone involved.
