She doesn't even understandI've felt suicidal for a while now, but I have no viable methods (I live with my parents, don't have enough money for a taxi, and can't drive). I was talking to my only friend today and mentioned how I hear about John/Jane Doe suicide cases where someone goes out of their way to kill themselves and no one who knew them ever ID's them. And I told her how I think that's lovely. I wouldn't leave my family with a funeral to arrange or that sort of guilt. Yeah, I'd be a missing person, but they'd have hope that I chose to start a new life.

She told me that I could run away and start a new life rather than kill myself. She blames my parents for my depression and thinks that when I get away from them, it'll be better. No, that's really not it. I hate myself and my life and I have no drive to exist any further. 

I'm just so frustrated that everyone says, "it gets better" when I've been dealing with depression for nearly 5 years now and it's only gotten worse. It's unbearable now. Everything is too much. Like, for example, I have to take a defensive driving course (I panicked while driving right after getting my permit and got into an accident). I would rather kill myself than do the 8 hour course. Same with the prospect of driving again. Or going to school after break. Or waking up in general.

I don't want to do this anymore but I have to keep pretending like life is great and "yes I can't wait for college!" When I know I'm worthless and won't get anywhere.
