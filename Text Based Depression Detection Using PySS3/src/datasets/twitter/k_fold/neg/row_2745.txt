I can't even call a suicide hotline for help.They just sent cops that wanted to make me go into the hospital when I cant afford that shit. Thats what they do. Therapist told me they wouldn't but they did. That's it, that's all the help you get. They tell you they wont send cops but they trick you and do anyway. Maybe I just wanted someone to talk to. I can't even call a fucking suicide hotline correctly, I cant do anything right. This was 3 days ago and I still wish I was dead. I have done all I have to get help these past few months even trying meds for the first time and I still just want to die. Fuck everything I all I do is make my loved ones miserable.
