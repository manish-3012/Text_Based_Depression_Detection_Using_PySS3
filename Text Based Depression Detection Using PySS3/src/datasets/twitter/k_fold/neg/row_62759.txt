Charcoal grill in car?Disclaimer: I don't need the suicide help line or to tell me life is worth it. I am not ending my life. 

My question is for information purposes only. Would a cheap camp charcoal grill in a car get the job done? If so, what are the exact steps. How much charcoal and do you light it in the car or out. What are the exact steps to ensure a quick death?
