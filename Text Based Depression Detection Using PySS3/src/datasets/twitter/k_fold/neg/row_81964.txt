my family makes me feel disgusting, gross, and nasty it doesnâ€™t help especially when iâ€™m in a redneck town, i wish i could just topple over, throw up my entrails and dieso iâ€™m gonna get straight to the point, theres some moments where i feel clean and comfortable with myself, but every time my dad, little brother, or sisters walk through the door i immediately start feeling gross and unclean, i feel like a flea ridden dirty dog, my sisters scream at each other, and my mom screams at my little sister, which makes me end up feeling like a hobo

when my family yells at me i feel like i have lice and iâ€™ll never be clean again

i live in a redneck town, nobody here is my age and everyone here is rude as hell to me and my family, my mom wanted to move to a more safer town but since my parents are divorced she didnt want to drive an hour from there to here, so sheâ€™s trapped here with me

on top of all this ive been unable to brush my teeth, go into my room or bathe because we have no shampoo, conditioner or body wash

i hope this all ends in my dead body being thrown in a muddy ditch

if someone can tell me if this is neglect then please tell me because i deserve it

also my mom is very very sweet i love her but i didnt ask to be born into this disgusting place we call tennessee (no offense to the people who love this state i just wanna burn a large portion of this state with me in the fire)

sorry for the messy layout + rambling
