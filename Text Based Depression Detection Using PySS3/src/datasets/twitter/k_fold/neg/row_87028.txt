I love her. She tried to end her life.We planned a vacation together, a cruise to the Bahamas. We got into a silly fight, I don't even remember what about. Things escalated, she ran into the cabin bathroom. I was scared and worried for her so I forced myself in and she was turning blue with the cord from her hair curler around her neck. I managed to get her down and she's OK, but I'm numb. It didn't hit me until just now. She was ready to check out, and she didn't even say good bye. I'm so lost. I don't know what to do. This vacation was supposed to be fun and relaxing and it ended up being Hell.
