Why do I feel like this?I get depressed for no reason because of my mental health and I hate it. I can push through that. When I am stressed and can't fix a problem I can't handle the issue and stress and criticism from not doing well. I spiral out of control and want to die and disappear because who would truely care if I just vanished.
