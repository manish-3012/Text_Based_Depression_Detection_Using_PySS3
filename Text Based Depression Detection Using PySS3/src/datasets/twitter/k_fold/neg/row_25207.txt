Just ready to leave.I have nothing propelling me forward. Things Iâ€™m grateful for sure. But itâ€™s all so very empty, Iâ€™m tired of being conscious/aware of everything. Itâ€™s incredibly painful; living. Part of me wishes I could go back in time, relive some of those more enjoyable moments. And other parts of me wishes I was never here at all. But, I am happy for everyone else. I think thatâ€™s one of the positives about this all, itâ€™s that not everyone has a shit hand in life. Or even has to be stuck permanently with the one they have. Sometimes they can play those cards and things end up working out for them. That makes me glad at least. 

Not that Iâ€™m complaining; I just feel Iâ€™m one of those people who didnâ€™t get that good hand. And thatâ€™s okay. I had an okay one for a while, laughed, and even enjoyed a lot of it when I was young. Iâ€™m okay with things being at the finale point. I wish I had more of a drive to want to feel better; but itâ€™s been 7 years trying to figure this all out. After awhile, that idle time begins to wear on your soul. Itâ€™s like there is no positive feedback anymore. Even though you wish for one/some. 

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing all this. Maybe to get out some internal thoughts or vent. But anyway, I do wish you all well. And I do hope that  things improve for you all on here, if possible. I think I am done though.
