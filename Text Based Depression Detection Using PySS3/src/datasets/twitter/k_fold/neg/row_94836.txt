helloNot sure where to start.
Well. I've got a plenty of debts in the university because I'm not interested anymore. Yesterday, when I had a talk about it with my professor, I bursted into tears. I do it quite often these days and I feel so guilty I can't control myself. 
I mean, I'm so worthless. People waste their time and money trying to give me a good education. And I don't know how to continue when there's no sence at all. And I don't know what to try if I want to quit university and try something completely new. Everything seems so dull for me.
I'm not depressed or something like that: I don't have sleep/weight problems or so on. And I do feel good sometimes. But I spend most of my days wishing I was never born for last 2 years. I don't know what to do.
