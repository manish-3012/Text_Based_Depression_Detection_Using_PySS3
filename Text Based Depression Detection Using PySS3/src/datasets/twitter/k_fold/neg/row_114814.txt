I want to scream after help but I canâ€™t and I wonâ€™tI know this episode will pass, I know morning will come and I will feel slightly better. Surviving the nights are the hardest part right now. For a while it went well, I even got the job I wanted, and Iâ€™ve been working out, my friends say Iâ€™m more outgoing and seem to be getting better, and generally I agree with them. 

And then night comes and my partner goes to bed and I canâ€™t sleep and everything comes crashing down and all I want to do is die but I canâ€™t say anything because â€œIâ€™m doing so good right nowâ€ and I donâ€™t want to disappoint my friends with the truth, but at the same time I desperately want to reach out to them, but I canâ€™t because I want to be able to kill myself in peace when the timing is right. 

I just want to be able to sleep and get through this episode, and I know I will, but I also know the night will come when I wonâ€™t. I wish guns were legal in my country, this would all be over.
