fauuxWhat happens when an empath who's happiness is solely based on healthy social relationships is neglected and ultimately forced into solitude for years due to his social ineptitude? In my case I've turned into a psychotic mess who's sanity has more or less withered away. Eccentric delusions and convincing myself that reality is a metaphysical construct created by me is only the tip of the iceberg. Who's gonna blame me for believing that I am the center of everything when my perspective, thoughts and emotions is all that I ever hear and experience. It's not even a matter of belief, it's my reality and it's what I perceive as fact based on genuine intuition.

I feel so close to figuring it all out, so close. I've experienced moments of ascension and tranquility simply through contemplation and reaching far back into my mind. Is it my mortality that is holding me back, do I need to rid myself of it?

&gt;A state of longing to cleave to God; the passionate desire of the soul to transcend its material existence, to â€œrun forwardâ€ and cleave to its Source.

This is what I've been feeling for the longest time, I'm ready to fully ascend. I created this body I inhabit and the soul I put into it is longing to reunite with the rest of me, the rest of the universe.
