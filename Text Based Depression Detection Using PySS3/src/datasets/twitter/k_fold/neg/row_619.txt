A Meaningless RantHonestly, I donâ€™t know how to properly put this into words but I feel the need to so I can get some proper sleep rn. 

I have no goals, Iâ€™m a Christian without faith and canâ€™t find the point to living anymore. Iâ€™m 18 years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more.And I ask myself every bloody day â€œwhatâ€™s the point of being here?â€ I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving.

This isnâ€™t a new question, itâ€™s been haunting me for about 6 years and I donâ€™t know how to get any drive back, nor has my life improved. The coffee doesnâ€™t help nor does the medicine.

I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and theyâ€™re necessary skills/trades. But why bother with it when your suicidal, the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily.

Iâ€™m just taking a random course to begin with so I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m even going to uni, probably to just meet expectations.

Itâ€™s not that I have no one. I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know itâ€™s a privilege. But I just canâ€™t seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes.

In conclusion I guess I wanted to come out and rant to a bunch a strangers about it since I donâ€™t know how my friends or non-family would take it

Iâ€™ve told my parents that I am in fact suicidal 2 weeks ago they took it well, a bit too calmly idk, nothing has changed in our relationship for better or worse

Ps: sorry for the poorly flowing sentences, I havenâ€™t seen my class on how to write a proper suicidal rant
