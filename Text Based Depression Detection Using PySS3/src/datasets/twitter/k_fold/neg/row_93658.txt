Ok now I'm scaredI was so certain that I'd be able to go to school and get into a trade and that would be a high paying job that would allow me to live my life. But I totally didn't realize that for every trade you need math skills. I am not mathematically inclined. In fact, I'm shit at it. Maybe some trades have less or simpler math than others? Am I doomed to fail at life because of my sheer lack of intelligence!!?
