Driving is becoming dangerous for me (17yo with anxiety and depression)Hi guys, 

Iâ€™ve been having a rough time during quarantine. (Check out my brief post history if you are curious.)  

One thing thatâ€™s made me happy is going out and driving and being able to listen to music in my car. But recently, Iâ€™ve been completely zoning out for periods of time while Iâ€™m driving, and I donâ€™t realize Iâ€™m doing it until I snap out. When this happens I basically am on autopilot, and Iâ€™m worried about hurting other people who are driving if I get into an accident. 

I also have felt significantly worse these past few weeks, and every time I go out driving, I get a really strong urge to just drive my car into a tree or off of the side of the road that winds through some large hill/mountains in my town. 

Iâ€™m conflicted as to what I should do about this. Driving and singing used to make me so happy but now itâ€™s just a Dead Stare Suicidal rollercoaster in hell.
