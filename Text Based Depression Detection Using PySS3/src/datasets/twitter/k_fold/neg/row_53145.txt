my frend keeps ignoring my calls for helpive been suicidal for 4 months now.
im pretty sure im bipolar, dont want to self diagnose, but my mother doesnt let me go get treatment. 
every time i reach out to my friend and tell him im giving up , im so exhausted, he just says "youre breaking the promise?". i made a promise i will try to get better in terms of getting help for my possible bpd, being less toxic and trying to be optimistic. every time i try to rant to him he says he's bussy, playing games or his head hurts. i feel like he doesnt care. at all.
he used to be the only person i could actually open up to and if j lose him im actually commiting. im not scared anymore.
now, when i tell him i cant open up to him, becayse i feel like im weighting him down, like he doesnt care, he gets sad. he says he wants to be here for me, but i jus cant see it. he stopped being loving. stopped being caring. he started being blunt. i have no idea what to say or do
