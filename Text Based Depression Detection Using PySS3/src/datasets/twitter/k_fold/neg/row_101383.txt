Life is a prison and I will never be truly happy or fulfilled.Life is pain, decay and rot. Some people have some happiness in their lives to counter this. I do have very little, if any. I often feel desperate to escape life and existence, but it's easier said than done. I just hope my exit from this world isn't too painful or drawn out. I hate it here.
