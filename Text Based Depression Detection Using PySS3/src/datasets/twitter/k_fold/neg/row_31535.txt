I feel Suicide is my only way outI am 24,  an African student in Canada on a Study Permit, my GPA  is at 1.44, I struggled with depression beforehand, but this last blow is all I can take, I am about to get an F, my 5th in my college years (4 years) with an A from my other course, and with parents retiring and no personal savings of my own(my parents wanted me to value school above everything else including having money), I am now in a corner and the only way out seems to be suicide, I tried my hardest, but I fought too many things at once in a losing battle...
