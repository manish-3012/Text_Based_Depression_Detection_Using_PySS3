Trying to be strongSexually abused as a teen, fell in love and got married and now she wants a divorce after 11 years together and 5+ married. Emotional abuse and sexually manipulation on her end, both of us made mistakes. I'm back with my family which I've missed, it's just I've never really fit in with them (I dont drink, different interests, etc). I feel more alone hear with them then I did back in TX. My credit is in the hole, no 401k as I spent it in our wedding, lost my dream job, and I lost the woman of my dreams. I'm just trying to stay strong. I dont want my family hurt by suicide, but even more so I dont want her to blame herself because of me. Finally got a meeting with a therapist but its not until next Tuesday.
