I really don't want to be alive anymore.I've been living several years in a cycle of depression and self destructive behaviour/thinking and I just want to end things. 

I've always said that if I could gain access to a gun, I would have ended it years ago. I'm tired of trying and never achieving anything in what I want. I feel I can't be saved and it's the logical idea for me to go.

I'll be honest, I feel like a culling would be useful as well. I'd be the first to go by choice. We have horrible people on this planet that should be dead and we just need to get it over with.

Yeah this post is dark, disturbing and "wrong" in the eyes of many but I don't care. Millions of us don't desvere to be alive and we should all just fuck off and die. I just with I had the means to do it now.

I wonder how long it will take for me to get reported/banned. Its not like it matters. Nothing matters anymore. Existance is pain and we should just end it all now.
