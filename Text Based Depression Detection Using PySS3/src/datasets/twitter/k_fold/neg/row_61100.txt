i'm basically, pretty much, just waiting for my grandma to die before i do it. i feel like "at least i can wait, so one less person will have to be devastated by my suicide" -- and our family dog alsoi'm giving it a few more years... i'm trying hard to do so, at least...

my problems cannot be fixed, it's literally impossible, and there's no way around them either.

i'm in my 30's. i was never this suicidal until something very very very very very tragic happened to me.

plenty of tragic stuff happened before. but this one was one of a kind. much worse than the previous bad things.

and i come from a christian background, so yes i see relief in death, but at the same time, i've been told all my life that people who commit suicide go to hell. so that's stuck in the back of my mind. even tho i'm no longer a practicing christian
