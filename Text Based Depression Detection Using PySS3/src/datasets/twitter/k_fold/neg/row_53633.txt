Want to hurt myselfI'm constantly depressed and angry and just want to hurt myself and break things. I should already be dead. I'm almost 33 and I'm a fucking loser that lives with his terminally ill mother and works a humiliating job. I have no skills, ambition or future. No relationship and only see friends once every blue moon and do cocaine and drink with them. Once my mother dies, I'll be homeless.

I'm just desperate for life to end. It's bleak and I hate reality. I want to escape.
