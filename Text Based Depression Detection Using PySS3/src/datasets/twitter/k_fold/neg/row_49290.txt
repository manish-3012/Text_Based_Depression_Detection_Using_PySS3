todayhey everyone.
today i am going to die.
iâ€™m going to walk in front of the train that is express that comes by everyday when I wait for the train to take me home.
i have to.. i HAVE to do this..
depression is such an unbearable pain &amp; no one gets that. it turns from mental to physical and iâ€™ve gone as far as i can go..

i feel super sad to leave my loved ones,
but i canâ€™t deal with this pain any longer.

i want to say that my job is the #1 cause for my death. Although, entirely my fault for taking this job only in regards to money, I have reached out to my manager to express how I am depressed and nothing was done about it.

no one gives a shit if i die. 
only if i die will they actually believe that my depression was the truth.
only if i die will i actually fucking mean something .
my death could be a door opener for all who suffer silently or in peopleâ€™s face who then still turn a blind eye.. 

i fucking hate this world. i always have. and i know itâ€™s my fault and i fucking hate myself too.
i hate myself for creating a life that is destroying me. and iâ€™ve came so far itâ€™s so hard to pick up the pieces and make a turn around.

i hope i can make an imprint before i leave..

please, please, help those who reach out.
please donâ€™t turn a blind eye.
please help others.. please..
