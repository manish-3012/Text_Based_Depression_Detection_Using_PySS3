deteriorationi enjoy feeling myself deteriorate, knowing iâ€™m becoming and embodying nothing - because i am nothing. i donâ€™t deserve love. i donâ€™t deserve happiness. i donâ€™t even deserve friendship. the small things in life ought to go to someone worthy, and more valuable than i. deteriorating means that it will, and when i kill myself, happiness will be found elsewhere by those who truly deserve it and need it. i am not one of those. i am going to live a short life. i will die by my own hands, on my own terms. i hope itâ€™s soon.
