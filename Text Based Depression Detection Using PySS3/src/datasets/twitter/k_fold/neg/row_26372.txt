Guilty beyond reasonLong story short I ruined my spouse and best friendâ€™s life. I was selfish and mean to him for months until he snapped. He did something admittedly wrong to me and I reported him to authorities. Heâ€™s losing his job and might end up in prison. Heâ€™ll lose his benefits and wonâ€™t be able to afford college. I ruined his life. I wish I could go back in time and slap myself in the face. I wish I just left instead. I am filled with guilt and regret. I feel like heâ€™ll never forgive me and I can never make it up to him. Iâ€™m not sure what to do. I think about suicide often and the only thing stopping me is thoughts of my family.
