UnsureI'm 16 and I don't know if I'm actually clinacally depressed or doing this for attention or its my hormones or something. I seem to get upset/angry (usually more anger) about the smallest things. From January last year I was self harming till my mum found out that July. But since December IVE been doing it, not as much, but hiding it better. I Get upset at night about things like my parents divorce or splitting up with my friendship group and stuff like that but in the day I'm not as bad but just seem to be very short tempered and negative towards my friends. I do have suicidal thoughts but I know I'd never do such a thing because I can't leave my family like that. I don't really want to tell my mum anything as she was really angry that July but I don't know what to do which is why I've turned to asking people online rather than my friends/family etc I'm sorry for so much writing but I just don't know what to do. I probably don't have it cause I could just be doing this for attention of my friends or cause of my hormones and stress with school but I don't know.
