Update from YesterdayUnfortunately, the post got removed, probably for the details relating to the attempt. Thankfully Iâ€™m still alive! 

I now have a new appreciation for life. I realize that Iâ€™d rather live for the sake of living than die for the sake of dying. The world is such an enormous place that I can use my life to explore for both its benefit and mine. 

Iâ€™d especially like to thank all the kind people who left heartwarming messages for me. I shed a lot of tears reading through them. 

I would like to clear up a few things though. A lot of people were very concerned about my dog. Iâ€™m only 19 years old, so my dog lives with my parents. I just have a very close relationship with him and miss him greatly while Iâ€™m away at college. Secondly, itâ€™s important that people realize this was very impulsive. Iâ€™m very lucky to still be here :)

Thank you, everyone.
