Another person left meI don't know what I do wrongly. People always leave. This one left without telling me why; she just blocked me in all social media (we were soft dating). I didn't love her, but was creating something. 

I spent the last three months kinda well, now I'm all suicidal again. I'm not enough for myself - maybe nobody is. But everyone seems to hate me so hard.
