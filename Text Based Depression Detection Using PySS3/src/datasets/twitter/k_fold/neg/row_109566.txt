kinda done.reading lots of books. life feels pretty pointless.

or at least, disappointing that society largely consists of amoral machiavellians at the top and a mixture of good and evil down here in the middle class.

i hit the gym, learn instruments, read excessively and whatnot. i try and create a better life for myself but still feel down in the dumps. i still feel unable to create connections with people.

i go to parties and many don't want to talk to me. i try to reach out to people but conversations are always very short. i don't know why.

i've gone to church in the past because i was lonely. i was part of an online community for a while when i had no real life connection, but i was exiled.

the exile was a gift in disguise though. while i was jacking off my ego being a popular member of a forum, i felt this stopped me from trying to make friends in real life. i felt this prevented me from developing social skill.

i just want to not be a loser really. we're all going to be forgotten eventually though.
