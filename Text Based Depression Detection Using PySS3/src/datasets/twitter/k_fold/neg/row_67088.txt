the silenceI can't sleep because the silence makes me think too much and I'm scared I'll act on it if I think about it too much, I have to get up for school in 6 hours, I need to sleep, but I'm scared to stop hearing the clicks of me typing this because that'll bring the silence back. I need to sleep, maybe longer than I planned. But I really don't want to, there's someone close to me I love and I don't want to leave her.  But the thoughts don't care about that. Not at all.
