TramadolI have a full bottle of tramadol here with me plus about 6 beers down. If I knew it would for sure kill me, I would have already downed the entire thing. Death is a part or life, what does it matter if I chose to end mine a little early? 
Don't know what's stopping me from just trying it right now......
