College ApplicationsWas just finishing up my last 2 common applications for collage and at the end there was a step I didnâ€™t remember doing for my all other applications. I just checked and even though I paid and everything I didnâ€™t finish up the signature and I havenâ€™t applied to a single college. Iâ€™m panicking and feeling like I just fucked my whole life up.
