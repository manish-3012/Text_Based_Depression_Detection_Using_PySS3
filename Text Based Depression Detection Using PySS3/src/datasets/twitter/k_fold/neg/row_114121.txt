It's just a matter of when, really.I don't know what to say even. It feels like I have some basic human need that isn't being filled and I don't know what it is. Like I can't feel happiness. Every emotion is riddled in anxiety. I'm on autopilot.

I used to be on meds, but what's the point? Its postponing the inevitable. I'll never be normal. I'll never have a normal family or be able to have kids.

I just hurt all the time. I've seen like 6 therapists and countless doctors. I've been on 4 different SSRIs. I'm not getting the help I need. What I've really figured out is there is no cure for depression or anxiety. I haven't heard of anyone who has depression who got over it. They either live with it or they kill themselves. 

So, eventually I will, and it's just a matter of when I decide I've had enough.
