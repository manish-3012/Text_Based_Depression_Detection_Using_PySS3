giving upi feel so lonely and alone. disconnected from humanity and nature. my existence has become an illuminated screen and keyboard in the dark. as far as i'm concerned nothing else exists. my fingers glow in front of me, but do they really belong to me? worthless. pathetic. sinking lower in defeat.  shame. how do i redeem myself when i have no courage? no will. how am i so self-absorbed? i wish i could roll over and vomit. then again maybe i should lean back. god, i am so tired of living with myself. it's exhausting. why do i have so much hate for myself and no one else? it sickens me. i feel it destroying my confidence and spsreading disease inside me. fuck i hate myself. why am i so stupid? i'll never be enough. nothing i do will ever be enough. except mayb ethe day wheni  say my last goodbye.
