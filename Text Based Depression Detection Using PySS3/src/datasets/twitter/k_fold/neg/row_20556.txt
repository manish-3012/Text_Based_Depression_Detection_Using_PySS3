Every one of my interests, will never be equivalent to those around me.Honestly, I feel like there isnâ€™t another soul out there that understands why Iâ€™m so weird. I have  too many mental disorders to fit in with any group of people, and I donâ€™t have enough socials skills to pretend like I give a fuck. Iâ€™m seriously a trapped conscious being who will never have the satisfaction of feeling like somebody else out there understands life the same way as I do. I feel as if Iâ€™m tripping on, but a daily basis. There is no way to convince myself otherwise. Iâ€™m constantly in another realm of thought. Either my brain is broken or everybody elseâ€™s is. But whatever the truth is. Iâ€™m different. Iâ€™m also incredibly stupid. Iâ€™m aware of that. I canâ€™t put my thoughts into words and Iâ€™m more aware of my idiocy than anybody should ever be. I understand that my death would bring sorrow to those with whom Iâ€™m closest. But when youâ€™re as broken as I am itâ€™s hard to be empathic enough to suffer day to day. I feel like theyâ€™d all be able to handle it better than I ever could. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s hard for me to continue.
