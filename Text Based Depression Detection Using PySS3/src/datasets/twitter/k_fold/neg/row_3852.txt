I will probably kill myself in the near future without ever bring the subject up to my psychologist.Why simply because as a minor the government (at least in my state) requires psychologist to break confidentiality if a **minor** is at risk of abuse, self harm, or thinking about/harming others. 

So since I am not able to turn to anyone in confidence I will likely die without ever attempting to seek help despite it being available. Isn't it funny how the governments attempt to help me will be a contributing factor in me never being able to use a service that could have potentially saved me.
