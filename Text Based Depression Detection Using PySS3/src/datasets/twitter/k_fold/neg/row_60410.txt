Struggling badly.I feel like I'm literally crumbling inside, I have recently developed an online gambling addiction. I stop for a few days but always go back to it, I'm young in the scheme of things and I have no source of income. I'm scared to tell my family about this as I fear they would disown me. I am failing in my college courses, I'm not happy there anymore. I'm sick of being in my room 24/7, but my anxiety won't let me go anywhere. My true passion is to edit videos, I can't even find people who would hire me, my life is a mess and I keep messing it up, many times this month i attempted to end it all, but I'm to much of a coward to do that. I want it all to stop and want everything to be normal. I want to be a normal lad, out with mates, working making my family proud. But I'm not. I can't do it, but I want to. I feel at my lowest point right now.
