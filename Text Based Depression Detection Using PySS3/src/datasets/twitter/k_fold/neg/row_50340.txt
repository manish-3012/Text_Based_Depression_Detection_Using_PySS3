Thinking about writing a suicide noteI just donâ€™t feel normal anymore. Iâ€™m having intrusive thoughts every minute of the day and feel as though I can control any of them anymore. Iâ€™m in huge credit debt, student debt, I lost my job and health insurance. I have homosexual thoughts, I have relationship obsessions, I have weird attractions to my family members and my boyfriends family members. I honestly think Iâ€™m a sick person and donâ€™t deserve anything. My family and I have a terrible relationship, I have basically 0 friends. I have no car, I sit in my apartment all day and live in a state/ city where itâ€™s hard to get around anywhere without a car. My mom barley makes any money, my dad is miserable and pays all of the bills. My brother is a complete dick to me. Iâ€™m just ranting right now because i had lots of coffee and my mind is just running. I was a porn/ weed addict and got off both and now I feel like Iâ€™m going into borderline psychosis. Iâ€™m in New York visiting my boyfriend right now and I dread the thought of going back home because Iâ€™m extremely dependent on my boyfriend. I hate myself, my life, where I live and I honesty just want to end it.
