My best friendI want to end it all. I know my wife and kids will be better off financially if I do. (Life insurance) I grew up without a dad and I feel I did ok.  I have a 4and almost 2 year old. And a wife I thought was my best friend. But she does everything she can to undermine me as a parent. Any time I try to discipline my sons, she â€œtakes overâ€ and does what she wants. Any time I try to teach them something new she has to do it her way. I always get the â€œshort end of stickâ€. I love her and my kids. I just want whatâ€™s best. Maybe thatâ€™s me gone.
