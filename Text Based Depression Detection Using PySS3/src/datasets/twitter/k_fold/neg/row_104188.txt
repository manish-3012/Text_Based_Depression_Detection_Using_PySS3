I'm tired of caring for people who don't care about me.I'm just tired of it. Every single fucking day I talk to people who only want to talk to me to talk about their own problems. None of them ever seem to consider my feelings. None of them ever seem to even think about how something might hurt me. None of them fucking care however much they say they do, I ask them how they're doing, I'm always there when they need to talk or they have a problem, but they never ask about me, they never even try to be there for me. It doesn't bother me that much, or it didn't used to, so I let it slip, I just try to make clear that I wanna talk, and even then, even when I try to hint at it, or even when I blatantly say that I'm feeling like absolute fucking shit, they completely ignore it, they completely disregard everything I say.

I've been trying to do better for myself, to be more confident, to learn to like myself do things for myself, to just be happier, and now it just seems like that's backfiring like hell. Even the closest people to me seem to care more about other people or themselves more than me, and I don't blame them, you know? But they could try to care a little. Even a tiny bit, I think it's fucking sad that the tiniest things like short-lived "You okay?"s seem to be the happiest moments of my day, even if they don't really care. Nobody I know cares, nobody. Everybody I know is more concerned about other things, nobody ever thinks about my feelings let-alone puts my feelings before their own or someone else'. They're bad for me, everyone I know is a negative influence on my life, and I get that, but I'm scared that if I even try to speak up, I'll lose them, and I feel like being surrounded by people who don't care is probably better than not being surrounded by anyone at all, I don't want to be alone, but lately the littlest things are making me feel horrible.

I'd really rather tell all of this to someone close to me, someone like a friend or a family member, but guess what? They wouldn't care. They wouldn't want to hear it, they'd make an excuse not to talk to me, or they ignore what I say altogether and go on to talk about other things they deem more important than the fact that I'm fucking sick of waking up every day. Every single day I do the same useless meaningless things, I talk to the same uncaring inconsiderate people, and it's depressing me to no end. I don't have anything to wake up for anymore, I don't have a job, I don't go to school anymore, my family is strict as hell, and I don't have any real friends, there's nothing to actually live for, and I'm so tired of it. I'm tired, all I want to do is sleep and even that is hard for me. Just sleep and stop waking up for no good reason, that would be easy, you ever realise it's so easy to die even when it's hard to live?
