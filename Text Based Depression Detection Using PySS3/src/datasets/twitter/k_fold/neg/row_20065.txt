Help meI am 15 years old. All day, i am shouted at, mistreated, and made to feel like shit. There is not a single person who i like except my mother. I hate every one. I tell myself there is no point in life because no one will remember me when i am gone. I dont truly feel happy anymore, the only feelings i feel are sadnes an anger. I know none of you care, but i dont care, because for the first time, i am feeling empty. I know it is not good but i am not sad, neither do I feel angry. I am frustrated of everyone. I have tried to take my life several times, but i always fail to do so. The marks on my hands constantly remind me of the pain I feel everyday. I love to code and make games. But since my father said that he feels that this was a waste of time, I don't feel passionate about that as well. Please, I ask you, help me because I want to die.
