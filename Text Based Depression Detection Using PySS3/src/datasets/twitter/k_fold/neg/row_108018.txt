21 and doneSorry for my english, iâ€™m german. 
I am just a really Bad person. I had so many expectations and always thought i am Safe and can do anything. But in the Last 3 month I lost everything! Iâ€˜m a student and this Semester i didnâ€˜t do anything. I always tried to hide it but soon it wonâ€˜t work anymore and i think the most of my friends at university already know that theres something wrong with me. I lied so fucking muchbto all my Friends because i just canâ€˜t except that i am depressed af and suicidal. If i have made the right choice 3 month ago everything would be ok. But i waited for something better and now i have nothing. I donâ€˜t want to live This Life. I am annoying all of my Family members because i needed their help but they canâ€™t and donâ€™t want to anymore because i did nothing. The only thing they are saying is that i have to Go to a psychatrist. But i donâ€™t fucking want to be someone who has to go there and live on meds. Altough there is so fucking much fear an thoughts in my Head i would need 24 hours assistance. My friends recognize that i am acting strange and donâ€˜t want to be around with me. They donâ€˜t even Text me anymore. 
I was so fucking happy and had so much but now i want to die. I live alone, my roommate and friend left me two month ago. And I did nothing.
I have so much fear inside me. This shit is not even everything. I did. so much creepy things and i hate myself so fucking hard for this.
I donâ€˜t want to die but i am so fucking sure that i will never be able to Look back and ne proud of myself or be my old me again.
My only chance is to turn back time. But i canâ€˜t so i have to kill myself.
Maybe tonight using a belt and a door.
I am so fucking angry and sad.
I will left a note for family and friends
