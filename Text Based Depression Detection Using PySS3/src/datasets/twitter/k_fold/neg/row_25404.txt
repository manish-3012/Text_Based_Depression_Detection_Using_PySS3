everyone would be relieved, even if they didnâ€™t want to accept it or voice it. they would be relievedif I could be sure it would look like an accident I would. that would be perfect. everyone could cry about how much they miss me without any guilt about the method. then they could go into their homes and carry on with their lives and try to ignore that real sense of relief thatâ€™s gnawing at their heel. relief that itâ€™s over. of course they wouldnâ€™t tell that to anyone, of course not, appearances and all. but god. it would be there. thoughts of â€œwell at least that issue has been resolved. at least that disruption has been quieted. at least that waste has been removed.â€ thoughts that would be quickly pushed aside, but truthful thoughts nonetheless. there would be a relief. Iâ€™m sure of that. as sure as the sun will be there tomorrow morning or that atoms exist. so sure that itâ€™s not even really worth it to debate it anymore. Iâ€™m not mad about it by the way. I understand. if I was in your position maybe Iâ€™d feel the same. I can picture everyone in my life feeling it. I can picture (name) having a drink after she finds out. even though she knows she shouldnâ€™t. and sheâ€™d feel badly. and maybe sheâ€™d even miss me. but sheâ€™d also let out a breath she didnâ€™t know she was holding and feel a relief she wouldnâ€™t want to let herself feel. I can picture (name) not wanting to let herself even write it down. not wanting to make it real. but it would be real. things would feel better for (name). (name) would cry but he wouldnâ€™t dare talk about it or else he might let it slip that maybe it was for the best, in the grand scheme of things.
