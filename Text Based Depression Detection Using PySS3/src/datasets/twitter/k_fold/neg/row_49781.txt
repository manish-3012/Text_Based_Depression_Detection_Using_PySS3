Yall know what it is...Chronic illness has me down again. My disability hearing is in october so here's hoping I get it. Honestly if I don't I probably will actually end it. But today I want to die because I've been in constant pain for days and apparently because of it I'm a raging bitch and made the one person who cares about me, for some reason, feel bad. And got mad at him over it. I think I'm just gonna stop eating for a few days so I feel something else.
