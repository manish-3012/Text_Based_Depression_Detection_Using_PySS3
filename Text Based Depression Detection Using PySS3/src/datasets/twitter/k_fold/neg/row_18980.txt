I had the balls to do itMy heart's still pounding, but I'm happy. I don't know where I extracted the courage from. I got my coat and hat, left my house around half an hour ago, went to the nearest bridge which is roughly 1km away, and mucked around at the ledge for a bit. Then I made sure there were no traffic, and jumped over the fence, hanging off the overhang with my arms behind me like I'm on a diving board. I kept talking about it, thinking about it, contemplating it, and I finally did it. I think I'll try it again tomorrow.
