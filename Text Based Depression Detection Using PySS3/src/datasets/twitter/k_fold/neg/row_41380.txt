Last wordsAfter suicide of my father my own suicidal thoughts became persistent and almost irresistible. I started to brood over death more than usual ; and the graveyard where my father had found his final rest became my favorite place to visit. There is something apparently enticing in the idea of death; when you contemplate the lofty beauty of graveyard you no longer want to participate in the idiocy called "life". Suicidal thoughts became even more intence after i had found myself in my current financial plight : now im buried in the foreign City from wich i can not get out. I will never. Im done. So i have to tell you; it is not death that we should avoid but life ; why would we take lives from caring hands of death to delever them back into cruel hands of the butcher called life? Dont try to "save" us we have made the right decision
