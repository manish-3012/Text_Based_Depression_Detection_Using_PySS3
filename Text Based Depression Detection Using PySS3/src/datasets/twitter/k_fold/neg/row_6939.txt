I'm here to help. PM me anytime.Created this account due to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d5fqj/if_you_really_want_to_save_redditors_lives_why/) post.

I would like to help in any way I can. Just wanted to let you know if anybody ever needs someone to talk to, PM me. It can be absolutely anything. 

I have only discovered /SW in the last few days and will now be contributing to this awesome community in any way I can. 

I will of course not just be relying on people to come to me with PM's. I'm just stating that for anybody that happens to read this offhand at the moment.. 

So, lets just talk.
