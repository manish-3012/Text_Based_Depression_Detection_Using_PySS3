have any of you found crisis lines useful?So last night I was going through a lot of emotional turmoil and I was afraid of doing something impulsive. I didn't know who else to call so I ended up calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. I was panicking and all I really needed was a voice of reason to calm me down. The only problem was that I was really scared and I didn't know how to answer the woman that asked if I was feeling suicidal. I just told her that I was generally feeling uneasy but I wasn't really sure if I was. Turns out their staff was full and she already had someone else on the line who was having a crisis so she asked me to call back later.

I know that hotlines like this have probably helped a lot of people, but every instance I've tried contacting them it hasn't really helped me. What are your thoughts about it?
