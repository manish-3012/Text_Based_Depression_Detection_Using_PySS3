I need a bit of helpSo.. where do i start huh.

Every day it feels like my life is spiraling down further and further into something i can't control. Every waking moment i'm basically thinking of ways to end it all, and i know it's 'edgy' and 'emo' to talk about this stuff but frankly idk what to do anymore. I feel like i have no one worth living for or anything. I constantly feel so inferior and as if everyone hates me. I hate myself in so many ways and forms i could never list them all. I've cut myself off from everyone and i almost don't want to go back. I feel so disconnected from everyone and everything.

I'll be honest i might end it tonight. I'm sorry for everything... I'm sorry i'm just an absolute mess rn and i don't even know what my own brain is doing, all i know is that i want it to end.

I'm going to wait for a bit though, just in case anything changes.  

Thanks for your time,
