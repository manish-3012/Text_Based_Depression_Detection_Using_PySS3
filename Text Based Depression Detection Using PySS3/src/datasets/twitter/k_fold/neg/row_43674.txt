Thought I'd shareLast night, I felt worse than I have ever felt before. I decided that is was time to end my life. I left my dorm room and climbed to the tallest building on campus. I stood there for about an hour, staring up into the stars. I wrote my note. I was ready. 

But all I could think about was the aftermath. My girlfriend has been very suicidal and I cannot allow myself to let her die because of my actions. I love her too much. It would have been so easy to take one more step and jump...but I couldn't. I kept seeing her body. 

This morning, I got mail from my parents. Enclosed was a few gift cards and handwritten notes saying that "you're thought about today and every day" and that they love me and I can call them at any time, be it noon or midnight. And then, at the bottom, they said they can't wait to see me again.

How fucking tragic would it have been to have killed myself last night, with those letters still in the mailbox?
