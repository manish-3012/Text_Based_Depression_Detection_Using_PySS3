Nothing specialdad killed my mom. beat us. raped women infront of me. out of jail now and still doesn't care about me.

I pushed away everyone some how. six months ago I had everyone. I had every part of my life filled. Now all I have are new acquaintances who haven't learned to hate me yet. 

I have two questions left to answer. Do I do it or do I just disappear. travel on my last few dollars and have some life changing moment like out of a movie, would that happen? And how do I do it? I don't like the idea of a gun. I like the idea of a wreck, but I want my grandmother to be able to sell my car to pay for the funeral.
