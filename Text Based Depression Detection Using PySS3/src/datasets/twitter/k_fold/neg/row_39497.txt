I know no one will read it . I will just pretend someone understand or careThings falling apart as always 
I don't know how i got there , i was pretty optimistic , energetic and care about those care about me and i was helping them . I know i am not perfect  but i just trying my best to become a good person and helping people like me .  Well  i got nothing .
no jop , no love , no future and hope 
I was abused by everyone i know and still ...
My family already turned their back on me , i got no where to go , it is really fucked up i can't believe everything get worse ! 
I don't know what i should do  or don't know who can help me .  How everything came to this i just don't understand ?  i got no future and i have destined to suicide . I don't have a support , a friend or social talent to run away from the shithole i have been living in !  
No one loves me , iam stucked in this hell and i feel like only way out is death .
If everything really  would work  i would plan to have a new ID , fake my own death , immigrate to USA and work there .  
 It sounds pretty optimistic but impossible unfortunately   : ( 
A young man will die for nothing , without knowing love , without help the good people , without  achieving nothing , without a family or without a vision !
What a shame does it ?
I would never choose to be in shoes of this loser !
I will kill him !
