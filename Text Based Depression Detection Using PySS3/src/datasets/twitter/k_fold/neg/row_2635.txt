I Need to Disappear and Leave No TraceI don't mean anything to the world anyway, but I do have some close family. I don't want them to dig through my possessions or (especially) my computer. "Looking for answers" - it's simple - I'm worthless garbage, hyper-aware, and have no real chance at recovery.

I can't stop (for example) having a funeral, but really, why? Mourning what exactly??

Has anyone thought about this and come up with ideas? I've been alive for far too long. It's so sad and pathetic that I've even tried to save a worthless life, and in the meantime have proved that I'm of no use to the world or any other human being.

Thanks in advance.
