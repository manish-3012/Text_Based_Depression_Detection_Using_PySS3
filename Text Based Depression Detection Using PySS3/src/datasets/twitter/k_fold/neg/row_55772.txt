It's sad knowing you can't rewrite your life.Everyday I think about death and killing myself. It's so tiring and depressing and I want to follow through on my plans. I just hate myself for being so stupid during my teenage years. I just want to reset my life and change the mistakes that wouldn't make me depressed. I hate myself more than ever for being a dumbass, and I will never change myself for the better. I just want to die and feel a sense of eternal peace and belonging. That's all I'm asking for.
