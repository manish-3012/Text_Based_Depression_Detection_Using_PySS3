"I did this to myself"All of it. Everything. Ask me anything about my difficulties and my pain. This is the answer to all of it. People tell me and they're right. I'm toxic, negative, suicidal, an asshole, etc. that's who I have become. I always wanted to be a good person but I also wanted to be a happy person. One thing leads to another and another and now I am where I am. I'm only happy that as the depression gets worse and worse I become closer to the end game. The survival instinct is wearing thin and I hardly have anyone that cares anymore. Because I drove them all away. I'm hoping that 2018 is my last year.
