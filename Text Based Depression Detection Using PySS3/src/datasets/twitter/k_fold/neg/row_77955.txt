I would do anything to end my life. Maybe.I've been having a really hard time. I am depressed every day. I constantly have this urge to harm myself or kill myself. Now it's to the point where I'm forming visualizations or ideas in my head on how to go about it. My last suicide attempt was in March. I tied a bag around my head. 

I've seen so many therapists. None of them really helpful except for my current one, who is telling and helping get a better lifestyle. I don't see the point in continuing with her because this doesn't feel like it's helping me and it's really hard for me to open up to anyone in general. Also, I just really really want to kill myself. There is no point for me to continue. I have no joy or pleasure in anything. Every day is the same. I sit at home, not pitying myself but thinking of ways to kill myself. 

I just don't want to live anymore. I don't matter and never have mattered to anyone. The flashbacks don't stop. This is what I want. I want to die.

EDIT: I am thinking about just giving up on everything. My job, my games, everything. I don't want to keep feeling like an oxygen thief every day. I just want this all to end. I keep eating junk food in hopes that a heart attack might happen soon.
