I want to kill myself right now.I donâ€™t want to deal with the immense deafening sound of loneliness. I know that there are people there for me but I just do want to fucking be alive. I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to live to see another fucked up day on this earth. The sad thing is Iâ€™m so young. Even if I did continue going Iâ€™m just gonna feel like this for the rest of my life. I donâ€™t wanna feel anything anymore.
