It's the only choiceI finally started making the practical preparations again. Note is written. Apartment cleaned. Day is set.

Honestly, it's such a relief. Better of course it were done already but... I think I need a few days since the note is written. So people know I didn't do it spontaneously.

In some sense I'm scared, the method I'm going for has it's risks, especially if I'm found (which shouldn't be a problem, but there is always that chance).

Lately I've been thinking about committing suicide a lot and why it's the only choice. I've suffered for nearly 20 years. At this point, looking at my grandparents, I can look at 60 to 70 more years of suffering. And you know what? Fuck that. It's definitely not worth it. Even if life somehow got a little better (which it wouldn't) it's just mathematics. To get to even, well, even it would take 20 years of of ecstacy to balance out this hell. Being even not miserable for the rest of my life? Will not result in my life having been a decent experience.

Ramble over. Sorry I found this place so late.
