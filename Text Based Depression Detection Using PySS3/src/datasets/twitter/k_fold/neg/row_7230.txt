I hate feeling numb(Obviously) I have depression and I take meds for them and they help me feel not depressed. But they leave me feeling numb and I hate it. I hate just being â€œfineâ€. I want to be happy. I want to enjoy things. I know being â€œfineâ€ is all we can be sometimes, but itâ€™s all the time. I donâ€™t have good days or bad days. I just have days. I feel like a shell.
