I think my mom and broâ€™s visit rekindled old thoughtsI have been suicidal since I was 12yo, I canâ€™t tell you what happened back then, but Iâ€™m pretty sure it was something traumatic. This weekend, for the first time in several years, my mother and brother were both visiting at the same time. Something sparked a familiar feeling, and I couldnâ€™t move from the couch yesterday. I cried off and on all day, and imagined how I would commit suicide. I was supposed to be with them, but they had made it clear I was unwanted. Itâ€™s been awhile since I felt so low, like decades. Iâ€™m 36F, and should not have these feelings, but a lot of bad things are happening. I hate my job, I hate the society I live in, I just dumped my long term live-in boyfriend because we werenâ€™t healthy together (still love him dearly). Then this visit happens and totally triggers something I never really knew correlated. Now Iâ€™m almost certain, my suicidal thoughts are somehow related to these specific family members. I want to know what the point of my life is, I donâ€™t feel necessary.
