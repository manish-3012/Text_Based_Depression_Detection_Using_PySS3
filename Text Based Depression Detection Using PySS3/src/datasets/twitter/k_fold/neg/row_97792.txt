30 Hours in VSED and still going.18M. I've been having a terrible food/water intake routine lately that drained my health bit by bit until i can't talk straight most of times. I did VSED for about 31 hours 11 days ago and at the last minutes, All i could feel was a heavy head and slight sluggishness. I've had another problem with my parents and this time i ain't giving up, I'll go all the way. Until now i don't have the heavy had i have had before but i'm experiencing pain in kidney, No will to go take a piss until 15 hours pass the way i see it, pain in the breastbone, Dry lips, Haven't had a dry mouth nor throat yet for some reason like the last time. I haven't felt anything in my heart nor brain yet. I guess the best help i could get is someone doing the science for me to tell me my exact death date or the closest to that at least. Would i get seizures? I heard that would be really painful and what about going unconscious? I have really had enough of everyone around me and the bullshit they keep pinning on me and the heavy shit they except me to deal with, it can all burn in hell for real, I'm done with it. I'm just someone with no reason to live other than bearing senseless responsibilities, I have nothing to fight for and i'm fine with it, i just want to fade. If my parents get cheeky with me i might as well just leave the house and keep walking until i pass out in some street, Not like i would care if my body ends up being dumped in the river.
