I'm ending it tonight unless someone gives a solid reason not toim in college right now studying computer science...i spent all of last month in lab grinding my balls off for comp sci only to finish off with a 60 in the class...the amount of work i put in relation to the result is so insulting its what makes my sad times worse.

my mom left for good and i was in college only to show her i can become successful and now im trying to become sucessful and failing more than when i wasnt trying as hard. 

little backstory, never fit in i got kicked out of every school i went to, went to juvie then tried turning my life around by getting into a top tier school and going there..but now im there and its only worse than where i was before. im only happy when im sloshed out of mind. im heavily addicted blow, booze and molly (only thing that makes me happy :D) and i smoke weed (almost a quarter a day) just to get through the day...im working hard (btw i can work stoned its not hard u get used to it) 

im kind of at the end of my line here i thought i could change for the better and have a longer life but everything and everyones just hitting me down and i cant see whether its worth getting back up and fighting or growing some balls and callin it quits
