screaming for helpEveryone always says itâ€™s so brave to ask for help and you just need to be strong enough to ask for it. Well, I have been screaming for it but there is just no one who cares if I live or die. What am I even living for at this point? No one would miss me, no one would help me...if I wasnâ€™t such a coward I would already be gone
