Suicidal thoughts are taking over my lifeI am 26. 

I've survived an abusive husband, a nightmare divorce and years of cancer. My family has several issues and that makes it all worse. I finished school late because of cancer and am only now starting out on the job market. I got a lousy, terrible paying job. 

I feel so heavy inside. The painful emotional baggage is suffocating me. I've lived through too much pain and each year something happens and life gets worse. I can't keep going because I am hopeless. I see no point in anything. My heart weighs a ton and I just want this burden that's trapped in my soul to go away. 

I can't stop planning out my suicide, step by step.
