I genuinely have no one.I've been there for so many people I genuinely loved and helped them out of a dark place just to watch them walk out of my life. I know I'm not owed anything. I'm tired of crying alone, I'm tired of becoming so dissociated, I'm tired of having no one who even bothers checking up on me. 

I have no friends anymore, I come from an abusive family, even my own boyfriend goes to sleep just fine when he knows I'm feeling this way. I'm only 22 but I've fallen so far behind in life that I don't see a way in fixing it.

I wish someone could prove me wrong and change my mind that humanity isn't complete shit and that I'm atleast worth something to someone in this life.
