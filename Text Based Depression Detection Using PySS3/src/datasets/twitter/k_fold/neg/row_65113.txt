Need help x-post from asktransgenderI think about suicide and/ or de-transitioning several times a day, every day. This is based primarily on the fact that life was marginally better before transitioning. I was able to gain and keep a relationship (now I can't even get a date), I had an active social life with many friends (now I sit in my room alone all the time because no one will hang out with me anymore), and I had a very close family (1/2 of them don't talk to me anymore). I wish I were dead ALL of the time, even when I am happy or having a good time because I know it's short lived. I'm cutting now more then ever even though I am in lots of therapy (4 hrs per week).

I am ridiculed in public for being in between genders and I doubt I will ever be able to afford surgery so I am no longer "in between". All I ever wanted was to be loved and I feel like no one ever will.

I just don't know what to do.
