Just another saturday night.I can't live in society. I can't see people, I can't understand people, I can't rasonate with them. People don't speak the same language actually, they just think they do, but nobody really understands each other.       

Today I tried to tell a group of people I trust about one of the things I think about more. They were very nice, they tried to be supportive, but... I don't think anyone there truly understood what I feel everyday and the anxiety and insecurity it makes me feel. They said I was idealizing things too much.       

Oh, well, sorry for wanting to actually enjoy life like you. Sorry for wanting things.       

I'm starting to feel angry again. I can do very bad things when I'm angry. I want to die today.        

Don't even start telling me "well you say you want to enjoy life!" because I said it already. I'm angry. I only want to destroy the things I have created. I don't know when I'll be satisfied. Probably never.     

I really hope God has fucking mercy on me and fucking kill myself in my sleep tonight.
