I failed a suicide attempt last nightLined a hose from my exhaust into my window. Something I didn't know is that modern cars don't output enough carbon monoxide to kill you. Now I'm on the side of the freeway, spiraling out, unsure of what to do, or where to go. I can't face my family. I left them a message that I'm sure they've heard by now. I'm thinking of stepping in front of a passing semi truck, but don't want to die like that. I don't know what to do.
