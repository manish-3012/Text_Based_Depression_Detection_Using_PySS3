Are these thoughts a problem?I wouldn't consider myself depressed...I have a somewhat decent life and all. But I keep getting these recurring thoughts that I should kill myself. Sometimes it's just an intrusive "I want to die" and then it goes away. Sometimes the thought comes and it causes me pain. Other times it seems like a good idea and I really do want to do it. Am I really suicidal or is it something else? I see a therapist but it's for substance abuse. Should I find anotber one more related to mental health or can I make these thoughts to away somehow.
