I just wanna quit, thatâ€™s all.Let me just be blunt with you by saying that I am not planning on killing myself, this is just a thought I keep having. 

I give up... lifeâ€™s too hard for me to smile daily, to respect those who bully and mock me, and to strive for success in a system thatâ€™s broken and corrupt. I donâ€™t want to be a millionaire anymore, I donâ€™t want to have the latest system or game, itâ€™s just become boring now. I give up on chasing my dreams because they keeping flying away. So really, now that I lost my motivation to keep going, whatâ€™s the point of doing anything. I have no emotions to make life interesting, and fun things are no longer fun to me, which makes me believe that life has no meaning anymore. I have had my ups and downs, and I realize that these wonâ€™t ever stop so whatâ€™s the point in hoping for a better future. In other words, I have no reason to continue, or to stop. I canâ€™t stop because others wonâ€™t let me, and I have to continue so that maybe it gets better, and all Iâ€™ve lost comes back. But again, it doesnâ€™t matter because I have no motivation to do so. So now Iâ€™m stuck in this endless loop, knowing I may never break free. So now that I have officially given up on life.
