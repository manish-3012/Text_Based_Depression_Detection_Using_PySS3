Friendless, Hug/Kiss-less, 22yo Virgin. Day 1 of 125.So I've decided I'm going to carry on with this apparent nightmare for another 125 days, then I'm done with it all. I'll be posting on here often I guess over the next hundred days. I like this subreddit. I feel like I'm among the friends I've never had reading some of these posts and comments; I feel the same way, and can relate to many of you.

* Why 125 days?

Because it enables me to do all the things I've always wanted to do, but was never truly able to do.

* Complete a fully modded Skyrim play-through and beat all the content. 255 mods. 

* Get an escort(or prostitute) in a country where it's legal(and will provide details), and finally I'm going to commit suicide calmly and peacefully using Nembutal and alcohol to wash it down. 

* My country of choice after saving enough money would appear to be Thailand. I've always thought Asian girls were pretty. Let it be known I think all girls are beautiful no matter their color, ethnicity, or body size, and would love to spend time with any of them. On the contrary though, I'm a loser, and a nerd. So outside of paying for it, actually going out with a girl isn't really a reasonable expectation at all. Also apparently my money will go a LONG way there. So I may be able to have fun for several months.

* There's a chance, however unlikely, that I may drag this on a bit longer than 125 days. 

I will be saving money and buying mega millions lotto tickets(Pointless I know but I will be dead soon, maybe I'll win and stick around or have more fun before I die), and I'm also going to want to save as much money as possible. Before I leave since my desktop is so bulky I will be selling it for a laptop and some extra cash as well. My desktop computer and monitors are the only real things I own(don't even have a car) and it's probably worth around $1,600-$1,800. Monitors are about $150-$200 each. So I could more than likely pull  solid $1,500-$1,600 of Craigslist. Also with my job and constant savings I could probably save over $2,000 for Thailand. 

* As an anecdote I'm currently skinny-fat(Google it) but excising and will be eating healthy to bring my weight down for when I leave. By the time I do leave which will vary between December or perhaps even January(this would take me out farther than the 125 days I outlined above obviously). I should be thinner, healthier looking, and might even be able to get laid for much cheaper, however this is a big might as my hair is thinning. I still could get hair system before I go, but this probably isn't cost effective, meaning it would be cheaper to pay full price then get one. Facially I'm actually not ugly at all, and still looks like I have hair if buzzed down really short. Either way I'm sure I will get laid in Thailand. 

Why are you posting about this?

I want to be remembered not for my shit life, but for the fun I will have in Thailand, as a lonely internet nerd, literally taking his life into his own hands. These daily journals will serve to do that for me.

**This post is really long and I had intended to keep these short and sweet, so...**

**tl;dr**

* ITT- Friendless, Hug/Kiss-less, 22yo Virgin is going an hero in 125 days, possibility a bit more.

* Going to Thailand to get laid, and have fun for once in his life.

* Committing suicide using Nembutal and alcohol.

* Going to post everyday updates on this SubReddit using this account before death.

* Going to do a full play-through of modded Skyrim in the mean time.

* I will provide cellphone pictures, or screen captures throughout.

* Not one fuck shall be given from now until death; I've spent my whole life caring too much and now I'm spending the rest of it not giving a fuck. [Not one fuck.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/653/349/be5)



Edit:

Also thinking about Hungary as well. Budapest, maybe wait a little longer, save a little more money and go to them both?

Also feeling happy for the first time in years now that I've finally decided to end it, and that this is how I'm going out. It will be a blast writing this out for all of you as well.
