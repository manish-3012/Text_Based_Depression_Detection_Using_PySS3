I don't know...I'm so tired. This is my last option. I have nothing else to turn to. I'm just... Sitting in my bed, gritting my teeth trying not to make any noise. I put on music to drown out these feelings. Like always, nothing works. I'm so done. I've written it so many times. I'm tired of writing about myself. I won't take up your time with words that don't describe me. I don't deserve a word to describe me or my emotions. I don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe a last cry? Who knows... not me.
