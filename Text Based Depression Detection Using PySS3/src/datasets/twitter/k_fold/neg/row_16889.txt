I started drafting my suicide note.I've drafted before, but I was younger and had no idea what I was trying to say. I'm 18, now, and feel like I know what I want to tell my loved ones as I know they will be searching for a reason why. While I don't think they will ever be satisfied with the answer, I do have my wishes I hope they will honor in my passing.

I'm scaring myself.

I don't want to be an in-patient again, but I also don't want to stay with my parents if it's going to be like this. There is no escape for me. My coping mechanisms have become dull; I've become numb to life. A part of me wants help, but the other part knows I will not get it. I have a therapist, but she tells me my scars are for attention. I stayed at a hospital, but they were too busy to help me. I have a lover, but I do not want to concern them.

All I can do is sit with this rope in my hands, stare at the wall, and listen to the screaming numbness going on in my head that I've been dealing with for seven years.
