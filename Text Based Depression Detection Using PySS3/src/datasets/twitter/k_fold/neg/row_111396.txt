I want to die but not have others suffer from the consequencesI really just want to die. My mom said she would commit suicide if I died. I don't want my dad to live with that. I really really don't. One thing that makes me a little happy is thinking of the fun courses I can take later on. I know that's  weird. I know AP Chem is hard but I'm really excited. AP calc? Sounds awesome. I wish I could find more that makes me happy that isn't so lame.
