I don't know how any of you carry on this longI'm only 17 and I'm already at the stage where depression has turned into a mix of self hatred a severe spite. I want to kill the people in my life so they won't mock me anymore, I know I wouldn't do it but I've been losing control of my depression and anger recently. Noone will listen to me and I'm getting angrier and angrier recently. Afraid I'm going to lash out one day and not pull myself back in time to prevent myself from hurting myself or others. This wouldn't happen if someone just listened or cared, and if people stopped mocking me.
