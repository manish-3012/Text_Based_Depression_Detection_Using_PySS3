HiI've been doing my best to keep happy thoughts. I try to help people out on here to distract myself. Nothing's working. I just don't want to do this anymore. I feel almost certain tonight I'm just getting the job done and I'm ok with it. I don't deserve to suffer anymore -and the people around me don't either.
