Pregnant and thinking about suicideBefore anyone goes off on me, I do not want my baby to die. I want them to have a chance at life and be happy. 

Iâ€™m bipolar and my doctor took me off all medications. Itâ€™s not going well. I have been thinking about dying a lot lately and I have a very small support system. My fiancÃ© is leaving on a trip for several days and I will be completely alone during this time.  

We moved to a new area for work and nothing is going right. I donâ€™t know many people here and Iâ€™m scared. I guess I just want someone to talk to.
