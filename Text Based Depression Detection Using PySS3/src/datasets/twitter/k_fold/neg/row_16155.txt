the only thing keeping me going is what it would do to my familyI am extremely fortunate and fairly good looking.  I have done an ironman and i am on the way to getting my bachelor of science.  I just dont really want to go on living anymore, i dont get happiness out of anything and no matter what I do is good enough for myself.  I have been depressed for a while and have been considering suicide for about a year.  The only thing that stops me from doing it is what it would do to my family but its just not enough.

Not thinking of doing anything right now but If anyone has been here before help me out.  Thanks guys/girls
