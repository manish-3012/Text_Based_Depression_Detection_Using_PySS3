Will my parents inherit my debt?Good afternoon, I have a lot of problems as a 21 year old broke college student and 15k in debt and potentially more to come. I want to know if my parents will inherit my debt once I decide to go through the act of self-annihilating this personality construct that is the idea I have been made to believe.  I really don't feel like working out the problems and I am not looking forward to surviving and becoming a mindless zombie with little to live and a 9-5 till I'm retired. I am in love, but unfortunately this person isn't enough for me to face the reality I have created, so ask you for something I don't want my parents to deal with and that is more debt to their name. Will the credit card companies come after them? Surely it would be illegal, right? It's my debt and my decisions, after all? Call me and wuss for not taking it like a man, I stopped caring about this life months ago. Thanks in advance.
