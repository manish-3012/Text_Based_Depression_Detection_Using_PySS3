18m Close to committing suicide again.Iâ€™m tired of being ignored constantly and no one understanding my problem. There is no answer or help anyone can give because Iâ€™m doomed. All Iâ€™ve wanted is for someone to love me but that isnâ€™t going to happen. I try my best to be confident and nice to people but they usually ignore me or donâ€™t reply. I donâ€™t want to live life without experiencing what it is to feel love. Maybe if I overdose again I can pretend in my dreams.
