why am i so calm?i realized a few months ago that no matter how i die i will end up doing it myself. iâ€™ve been happy and sad and everything in between, so why bother keep going? iâ€™m not depressed and iâ€™m not sad, i am nothing. everything i look at now i see as a way to help my family after iâ€™m gone. itâ€™s the most amazing feeling to just know that in a month or year or two none of this will matter to anyone and especially not to me
