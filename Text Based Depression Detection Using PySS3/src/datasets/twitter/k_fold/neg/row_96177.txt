It's getting so hardI'm 20 and in my third year of university, and it's been getting so hard. I'm not used to online classes at all, it takes so much to motivate myself to watch the videos and take notes. On top of that, my parents think it's actually easier, and they think I'm just finding excuses for not trying harder. 

For the past 2 weeks, I've been feeling so anxious and panicky. Everyday before I need to sleep, I have trouble breathing well, which leads to crying, which makes it worse. It takes me so long to calm down, sometimes I can't even do that, and I feel so tired everyday and I can't study well.

My parents have also been the biggest criticizer of my body forever, which may have led to the state I'm in right now. I can't talk to them about these things, we're not close like that. And frankly, I can't trust them enough to talk about it.

It's getting all so hard, and I need to find a reason to keep going at it. Please give me some of your reasons too keep going, I'm scared.
