I hate myself and I want to dieTitle explains it all. Iâ€™m a senior in high school and Iâ€™m probably gay. I wasnâ€™t born this way and in middle school and the earlier half of high school I distinctly remember being fully straight. I donâ€™t know why this happened, if itâ€™s psychological. I hate this, Iâ€™ve been looking all over for ways to change myself back to my former self. I want to go out with women, not men, but Iâ€™m probably not attracted to them enough no matter how hard I convince myself. I feel like Iâ€™m going to be an embarrassment to my family. Try to convince me to accept myself all you want. Itâ€™s not going to work. I have nothing against being gay and if youâ€™re happy with who you are power to ya. I have no religious motivations behind this. Iâ€™m a freak, born in the wrong body. Wrong generation. I think I may just get high and drunk one night and put myself to sleep with a gun I find. A therapist will not help me. They will just tell me the same answer Iâ€™ve been getting to just accept yourself. Fuck that, I want my old self and life back. I want to be normal and have a normal life. Iâ€™m really hoping to be attracted to a certain woman but I doubt itâ€™ll ever happen anymore. I hate myself. Iâ€™m the worst example of a human being with terrible genetics. Getting the worst from both sides of my family. I guess death is the only option now.
