I Give upBetween the multitude of therapists Iâ€™ve gone through, and all the cocktails of pills Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™m at a point where I no longer care about myself anymore. I doubt I can trust anyone the same way I trusted my ex anymore. And youâ€™d think after virtually 4 fucking years Iâ€™d be over it, but here I am having her in my nightmares every single goddamn night for these past years. I just canâ€™t anymore. (I apologize for the rant).
