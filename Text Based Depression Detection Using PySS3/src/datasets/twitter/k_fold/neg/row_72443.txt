I nearly went to the hospital last nightMy boyfriend of (a total of) a year and a half broke up with me again yesterday, over text and blocking me. After struggling to make friends and finding happiness in anything, this broke me. I nearly went for all of my pills. I called emergency services and had my mum watch over me. It took 3 hours for them to arrive.

Once they did, they were very good, and just talked to me like a friend would. It gave me contact with people that I just so desperately needed. As Iâ€™m sleeping tonight, I keep going between being okay with the breakup and being so hurt and devastated that I want to die. I think about all the free time I have now that I can use to do what I want, and the money I can spend on myself since I spent so much money getting to and from his house - he always insisted that I go to his house instead of mine.

However, I just think about the fact that I have no friends. I struggle to make friends because of my disability. My boyfriends laugh, smile, and his caring attitude toward me haunt my mind. I was leaving his house yesterday, but I was having a really bad depressive episode. He brought me a cup of tea and some toast, and you know what, it did get me out of bed. Later, when I was gone though, he broke up with me.

Iâ€™m so confused. Why am I suicidal and hurting so much one minute, yet feeling really calm and accepting the breakup another minute? It doesnâ€™t make much sense to me. I just want the pain to end.
