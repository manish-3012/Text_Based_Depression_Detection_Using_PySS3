I can't do this anymoreI'm so tired of fighting this. All I want in my life is a stable period. I've tried so hard to cut the negativity from my life.

I'm out of ideas, you guys. The only thing stopping me right now is my living situation. I don't want my brother to be the one to find me.

I need help
