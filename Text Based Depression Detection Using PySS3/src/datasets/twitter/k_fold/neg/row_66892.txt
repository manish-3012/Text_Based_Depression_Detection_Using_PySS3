No intentions on hurting myself, but I just feel so alone in lifeBasically Im 20 with no friends outside of work. I have no-one to talk to about problems (leading to me bottling everything up). I can hardly talk to other people, cant make friends let alone get a girlfriend. My partner at work has a great life, and always is talking about her friends/dates. This is just a constant reminder of how much my life sucks and I'll be forever alone.

All I want in life is a friend and maybe a hug. Is that too much to ask for? 

I know a lot of you guys have it worse than me, just needed to vent for a minute.
