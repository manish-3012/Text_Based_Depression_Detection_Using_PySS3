here it is... Againa couple of days ago I said that maybe one day I'll give in to this stupid thing. A year ago I said that when I'm overseas I'll end it. In 3 months I'll be leaving for the UK and I have plans to end it there. I'm so tired. I don't know who else to tell who won't be overly alarmed. Like. I don't know what to tell people anymore. It always feels like the same time. The whole I'm tired I've had enough I don't want to go on. I feel like it's always the same, just always a little bit worse. I don't even know like, how to share what I feel. I just want to be loved. All I ask is for that. I just want someone to hold me close and tell me it'll be ok. I just wish there was someone who could that now and tell me it'll all go away. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I want all of this to end.
