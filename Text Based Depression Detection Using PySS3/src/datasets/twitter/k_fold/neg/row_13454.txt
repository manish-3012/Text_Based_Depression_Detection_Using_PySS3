i just want it to end.everyone has it so much worsse than me, why am i crying and feeling so useless?? whats the fuckign point

i promised my partner that i wouldnt self harm but i did anyway. im a fuckign complicated piece of shit. im scared to vent to anyone because im scared of seeming dramatic. i dont know how to open up, and when i do talk about myself i feel like its selfish of me.

i have the perfect partner. i love them so much and they accept me, but sometimes i feel like they think im too much to deal with. i cant shake the feeling that they wanna go back to their ex and leave me. im the reason they broke up anyway. im a shitty person. i need to die i want to die
