End of the roadI turned 24 yesterday and I havent done anything with my life. I've been unemployed for 4 years due to my social anxiety and depression. So naturally I lost alot of my friends who looked down on me for the situation I've been in. I don't have much family and obviously no romantic partner because I'm a fuck up. Its hard to pick myself up and make something of myself when I have no will to live to begin with. I'm tired of people saying "suicide isn't an option" when it clearly is. Who cares if we die at 24 or 84. You cant bring anything from this life with you after death. Nothing matters and nothing has a purpose. I'm glad I live America because its easy to get a gun where I live. All I think about is death and all I think about is blowing my brains out. I am nothing. I'll only be another statistic in the yearly suicide rate in America. 
I'm fine with that.
