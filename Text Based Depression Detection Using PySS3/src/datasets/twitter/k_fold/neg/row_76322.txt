Can someone explain the hotline touting?They're known for being flawed, run by volunteers, complete luck of the draw if you get an empathetic human being (rare), an idiot reading from a script parroting everything you say back to you with an added "I understand you're...", or someone who treats you like you're wasting their time while they're late for a movie and just straight up hangs up on you.

All this said, why are they touted as the end all be all? The definite solution we have to give people if they express suicidal intent? The automatic bot that replies to everything you say with the number, messages you about it, I have the fucking number memorized at this point. It just gets sent over and over and over and over. And for what? It's a sick joke. Even seeing the stupid digits just makes me want to fucking scream. 

My theory is it's just virtue signal bait. Just for others who aren't suicidal who feel like they want to do something. I'd rather they did nothing at all. It's like being desperately thirsty and grabbing a water bottle only to find it's completely full of sand.
