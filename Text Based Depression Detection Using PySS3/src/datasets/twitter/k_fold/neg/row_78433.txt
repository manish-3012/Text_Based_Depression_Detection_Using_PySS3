Ugly, ugly, uglyFucking hell, what did i do deserve this fucking body. I didn't ask to be born like this, hell i didn't ask to be born at all, some selfish pricks decided to start this fucking thing. Im fat, i am that's fact. My back is crooked, my nose is too big, my eyes are too far away, my nose is big. No fucking amount of working out, losing weight is going to get rid of this fucking skull shape. My head is far too big, if i grow my hair out its got to be 3 kilometres long and there is no magic point where its alright, it goes straight from too short, to too long. Fuck, dont lie to me about how looks aren't fucking everything, that's a fucking lie and i know and so do you.
