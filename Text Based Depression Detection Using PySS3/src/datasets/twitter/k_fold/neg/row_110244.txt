iâ€™m only happy when iâ€™m on drugsWell, mdma. no other drug makes me happy anymore. alcohol doesnt make me happy anymore. 

i never thought when i was a depressed 12 year old that iâ€™d be 18 and doing the same shit. i never thought iâ€™d drop out of high school. i never thought i would do so many drugs.

im destroying my family with my mental illnesses. i hate myself. all i can think of, 24/7, is how much i hate myself. how ugly i am. how worthless i am. the only time iâ€™m ever happy is when iâ€™m on mdma.

ive overdosed twice in the last three weeks why the fuck am i still alive

i want to die 
i want to die
i want to die
