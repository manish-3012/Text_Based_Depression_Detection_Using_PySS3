I know I'm gonna kill myself someday.I dunno if I'm looking for support or advice or anything specific. I just wanted to share how I feel. I am not currently suicidal, but my life has been going downhill, and severe social anxiety, lack of direction, loneliness, failing classes, and more have made me deeply depressed for the last 6 years. At this point, I know it's going to one day get the the point where I can't go on and I inevitability take my own life. Does anyone else have these thoughts? I guess this seems kind of absurd to share with my family or anyone else, so I figured I'd put it on reddit.
