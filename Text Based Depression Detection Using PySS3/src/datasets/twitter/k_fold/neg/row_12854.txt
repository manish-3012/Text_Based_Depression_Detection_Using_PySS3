3 seconds of peaceBefore I start do not think i post this for attention. I'm posting it cuz I have no where else to speak. I've wanted to die for 2 years now. Not necessarily kill myself, but die. At least until recently, I want to fall backwards off a building. I want to stare at the sky knowing I'm already dead. Nothing would be more peaceful than those 3 seconds or so, knowing I'm living death. This fantasy helps me sleep and get through the day. I know it's always an option and that brings be a little bit of peace.
