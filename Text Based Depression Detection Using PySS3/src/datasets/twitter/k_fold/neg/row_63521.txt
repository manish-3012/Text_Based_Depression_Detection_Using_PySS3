Even though Iâ€™m Christian, I canâ€™t help but wish reincarnation was guaranteed so I can try again.The only thing holding me back from taking my life is the possibility that death is just death. Nothing else afterwards. I donâ€™t even hate life. I hate myself. If I could just be a nice tree or something, that would be fine. Iâ€™d love to live as someone better than the piece of garbage Iâ€™ve turned myself into. Someone normal with more friends, a family that understands them, better looks and talentsâ€”but nope. I was dealt a shitty hand from the start, and I couldnâ€™t turn things around. Iâ€™ve given up in school because my procrastination is terrible, Iâ€™ve quit most of my hobbies (except video games cuz Iâ€™m hooked on that dopamine high), and Iâ€™ve pretty much stopped trying to meet friends and talk to girls. I used to be pretty extroverted but now I intentionally walk the other way just so I donâ€™t have to talk to ppl I recognize. My family argues almost every day and even the happiest discussions eventually become yelling contests. Even though Iâ€™ve hardly had a positive interaction with my parents in 3 years, I canâ€™t imagine what my death would do to them so I keep fighting the pain. Iâ€™m the internet around 15 hours a day to distract myself from the shit in my head. My parents are always nagging me about it even though itâ€™s the only thing that keeps me sane (and probably alive too).
