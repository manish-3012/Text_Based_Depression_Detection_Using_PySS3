Only if it were that easy36 male, and really just done existing.

Iâ€™ve dealt with anxiety and depression my whole life and have had my plethora of overprescribing of dangerous meds.  Well 8 years ago my doc had me on 2 diff benzos and topping the 8mg daily dose and I was a zombie.

In 4 months span I got DUI 3,4,5,6 at the age of 28 and lost my license for 50 years.

8 years has gone by and life has been a struggle.  I canâ€™t keep a relationship, a job, my sanity, money in the bank, and Iâ€™ve had to live with my fucking parents still till this day since then.

Iâ€™m worthless, and I need to just die.  This doctor ruined my life and these lawyers took all our money.  

What use am I to my parents as they get older and I canâ€™t even take care of myself let alone then?

Lifeâ€™s a fucking JOKE
