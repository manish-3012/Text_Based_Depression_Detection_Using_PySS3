Depressed, I think my future isn't gonna be worth livingHi, 
Why do I keep feeling like I have no energy for anything?. I'm so bored and stuff keeps  getting to me. I'm worried about my future and if I'm gonna be happy with it, everything seems so tough but I'm not sure really why.

I just feel down a lot now, sometimes all these negative thoughts keep running into my  head and I just think the easiest best thing to do us kill myself.

I have posted similar things  but it's like from week to week I just think different stuff.

I've posted about how I feel like I lost myself. I used to be really fun, exciting energetic and it was all effortless to me.
But it's like that's gone now. I cant even make myself laugh. 
I just have no energy for anything even tho I want to, I'm not sure of my future, if I'll be around the same people. 
I think it's the  unknown that is doing it. I wish I could just toughen up but i just feel like i lost myself and this is making me lose people and my future.

How can I slap myself in the face and wake  up, and I've tried it literally.

Thanks,
