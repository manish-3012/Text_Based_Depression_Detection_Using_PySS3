i'm scaredeverywhere i go i see things that aren't there. i don't know how to explain but hopefully someone relates.

imagine a watermelon in the corner of your room. you see it right ? it's like there but isn't. you can barely see it but it fades away after 1 second. let's call this 'watermelon'.

this watermelon always happens when I'm just doing anything. for example, when I'm walking down the main road I 'watermelon' and see a car crash. or what scares me the most is when I'm turning a dead corner and 'watermelon' a murderer or someone being there waiting for me. i daze out and believe myself until i actually move past it but the panic and everything that i go through before is so fkn tiring. 

it just all feels fake and i cba constantly living with unanswered questions. i can't put up with it anymore.
