Why Stay?  

I attempted to take my own life a few weeks agoâ€¦ and then spent over a week in the hospital trying to get mentally better. 

I felt like I was making progress. I felt like I was becoming more in tune with myself and feeling mentally prepared for life. 

I am not happy with who I am or the mistakes I have made in the pastâ€¦ so I have continued to go to therapy to try and change thatâ€¦ to love myself. 

But itâ€™s not working. Nothing is.

Every time something goes wrong, I just am right back at the giving up stage.

This weekend I made a mistake. I made plans with two different people and had to bail on one of them. I had a very tough decision to make due to my personal relationships with each of them, and I picked one over the other. I made a mistake. The person I chose to hang out with never would have left my life or blamed me for this mistakeâ€¦ yet the one I didnâ€™t pick, did. 

I found out today that he had to cut off all ties with meâ€¦ and it hurts me because of how much that person means to me.

I donâ€™t have any more fight in me.. all I wanted to do is drive to my friend and beg for them to change their mind. But I didn't. I just let them give up. Because I feel like I am giving up. Losing this friend put me right back in the deep end.

  
I know it seems petty because I am leaving out a lot of details, but whether or not this person is toxic or a decent person and I am the toxic one is irrelevantâ€¦ my point is that I went right back to wanting to commit suicide. 

If I have to live the rest of my life like this, whatâ€™s the point?

I donâ€™t have my parents support or love, and now I have lost someone who I thought was going to help me get through that. Once again, I am lost, alone and hopeless. 

I know life could easily turn around and could be amazingâ€¦ I just really donâ€™t know if I can hold on.

I want to know what keeps you from giving upâ€¦ what motivates you to keep breathing and keep up hobbies. Even when youâ€™re at your lowest and all you feel is tears behind your eyesâ€¦ and that feeling of hurt in your stomachâ€¦ what helps drive you to live another day?
