I am worthless and I just want to hide.Title basically. I cut myself today the first time in 2 years. Couldn't even say that I had a reason or smth. Just thought to myself that the last 20ish times I wanted I didnt do it and nothing changed so might as well try? Well it did not help. Still hating myself and just want to be able to live in a little cottage or something far away from all humans, ordering all things I need online, never having to talk to anyone ever again.   

But I don't have that money and my job will not allow me to work remotely (am a medical student who matched surgery). Did some math and it takes me around 15-20 years of saving up to be able to attempt to finally be hidden. I can't do that. I can't talk to people anymore. I can't be a person anymore. I constantly want to cry but it never works. Was in therapy today just focussing on trying to cry, but nope, nothing.   

I just feel worthless and like a pathetic piece of s... and I don't see a way out other than killing myself.  

Now I don't have a good method around but if I don't mess up the last batch of exams will be able to just buy all non-narcotic-level meds in autumn... and that sounds better every day lately. (Now that is a new type of motivation to study...)
