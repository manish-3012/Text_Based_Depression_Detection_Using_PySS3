Suicide Due To Failure In Academics and Life In GeneralI feel like I'm losing my mind and there's no hope. I have prepared my entire life for college with a 2.9 (because of a bad year in AP Literature). I thought I at least do okay. Currently, I have 1. Something and even when I try my best, I fail! Not only that but most of my family has degrees and has at least scored a 3.0 GPA. I feel like I'm just a failure. This is similar to life as my classmates and friends are growing up and moving on with their lives, showing off jobs, internships, and the like, and Im a 20 something whose only joy in life is video games, writing, and anime! I ask myself what's the point and that I should just get it over with but I'm always too scared. 

I wish I had at least a small bit of bravery to throw caution to the wind and just fucking do it.

But I don't... Im not brave.... I just wish something would happen and allow me to disappear from this life.
