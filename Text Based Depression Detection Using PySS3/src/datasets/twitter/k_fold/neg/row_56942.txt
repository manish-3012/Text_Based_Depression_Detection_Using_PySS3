Will this really pass?I have been suicidal for atleast a year now. Whenever  I try to open up, I get bombarded with phrases like "Don't overthink it", "This too shall pass", "Just take a walk and freshen up your mind".

Now to the reasons. My family. My family is a weird one and my parents have a abusive marriage. They fight all the time, sometimes things get physical. They shout, scream, get me and my siblings involved. And this has been going on since I was 6(I'm 17 now, about to turn 18). Some of my earliest memories as a child is seeing them fight. It's imprinted in my mind. I don't even trust the institution of marriage anymore. 

I was diagnosed with Diabetes Type 1 in 2011. My whole life's changed after that. It's really tough to manage studying, diet and my routines(taking insulin, checking glucose levels). My family helps me  with it but the thought of dealing with this disease for the rest of my life scares me. The reaction people give when they get to know I'm Diabetic just pisses me off. It's an autoimmune disorder and there's nothing I could've done to prevent it. 

Things were getting good for me 2 years ago, and were good for a few months. I made many friends and they really got me. But then I finished 10th grade and had to transfer to another city. I am still in touch with them but ofcourse it's not the same. I talk to them like once every 2-3 months. 

A few months ago I got to know that my brother's clinically diagnosed and he's taking antidepressants. And last year my father had to go through a heart surgery. That took a real toll on me.

I moved to this new city to prepare for my medical entrance exam and now I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I just finished Highschool (with good grades) and family expects me to clear the entrance. I know I am not well prepared. 

I feel like I have no control over my life. It feels like everytime I start enjoy something, it gets taken away from me.
