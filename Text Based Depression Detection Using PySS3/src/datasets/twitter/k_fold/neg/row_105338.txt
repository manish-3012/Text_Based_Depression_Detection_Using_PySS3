Intrusive thoughts about swallowing a monthâ€™s worth of ProzacI canâ€™t get out of my head. Iâ€™m not as good as I thought I was in my journey to recovery and I keep having intrusive thoughts about self harm and overdosing and driving my car into traffic. I hate it, itâ€™s scary and I canâ€™t turn it off when Iâ€™m stuck in a depressive loop like tonight.
