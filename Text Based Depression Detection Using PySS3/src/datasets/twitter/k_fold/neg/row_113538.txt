If I die tonightIâ€™m tired of fighting this heartbreak. For the first time, Iâ€™m starting to feel elongated physical pain on the left side of my chest. If I die tonight, I welcome it. 

Iâ€™d rather give up my life now instead of tacking on more days without the person who I thought I was going to marry. 

Itâ€™s not fair having to battle like this. I miss you so much every day. 

I love you.
