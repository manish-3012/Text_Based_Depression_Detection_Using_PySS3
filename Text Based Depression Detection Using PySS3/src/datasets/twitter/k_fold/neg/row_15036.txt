Being a failure hurtsSeeing everyone around me including the bullies that tormented me as a child succeed in life makes me feel much more worst about myself.
 Dealing with my anxiety, depression and dyslexia (which i hate the most) is getting to much for me to bear, i wish i was a normal human being with friends and a life, instead im busted and broken, being used and abused by my parents especially my father and uncle. I have no love for them anymore, i can't even believe i idolized them, how stupid i was.
The worse part is that i hate looking in the mirror because i look exactly like my father, even to the point people mistake me for him,  when i see my face all i can see is him and all the horrible things is done/said to me.
I honestly wish i was dead or better yet wished i didnt exist in the first place, it'll just be better for everyone.
