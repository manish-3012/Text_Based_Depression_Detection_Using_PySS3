I'm so tired of failingAfter surviving my last attempt, I just felt anger. I'm usually a passive, quiet person but I was so incredibly frustrated that I'm such a failure that I couldn't even kill myself. I've lost count of my attempt but this last one was probably the 7th of 8th. It's draining, to fail. To fail at life and then to even fail at death. To fail, but never to get back up. Life is always worse, and I'm just so tired. But I know I can't give up, I cannot ever stop trying to kill myself. I don't belong in this world and once I am dead I will be free of this constant pain. Hopefully the next attempt will be fatal and I won't have to keep trying anymore.
