what counts as a suicide attempt?once when i was around 15 or 16 i decided to take all of my mom's pills in hopes that i'd poison myself and die. I took them all out and held them in a pile in my hand, but i started to freak out at the thought of failing and surviving with permanent organ damage and put them all back. would this be a suicide attempt? I did have intention of killing myself. would it only count if i HAD taken them but ended up surviving anyway? thank you
