I was doing goodI told myself I would hang on til the 28 to see my brother for the first time in a long time ( and it was his 18th birthday). I saw my mom and â€œauntsâ€ (my moms best friends who lived with us for years) too. I did it I made it. But the thoughts had only gotten stronger as it got closer. Well I did it and now here I am debating if todayâ€™s the day. I almost reached out to a hotline because I donâ€™t want to die without telling someone Iâ€™m sorry out loud.  but every time Iâ€™ve done it they say, â€œNo one forced you to reach out so you donâ€™t really want to dieâ€ oh I do. Iâ€™ve tried help,Tried a respite house, Iâ€™m waiting for group therapy (February), hospital here sends me home.. I donâ€™t deserve help. Im a burden if I try anymore. So Iâ€™m sitting here.. I messed up already. (Self harmed) and other stuff but now I just said to decide if tonightâ€™s the night...
