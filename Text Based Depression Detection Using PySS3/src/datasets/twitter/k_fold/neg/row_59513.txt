Depression setting in again and can no longer self medicateI was arrested for DUI and possession of marijuana and tomorrow I will lose my license for 60 days. I will be on probation for one year. I quit my job because I wasnâ€™t doing well and I was commuting 80 miles each way everyday. I havenâ€™t found another job and I am worried that my background check will prevent me from getting a good job. I am overweight and have no friends that care about me. I have a great loving girlfriend but she doesnâ€™t know how depression really feels and how I am contemplating suicide lately. Iâ€™m a male, 31 years old. 

I am going to be drug tested and I have to abstain from marijuana but it was the only thing that was helping me cope with my depression. And now I canâ€™t have that any longer. 

I see these people on Instagram and Facebook living these great lives and doing fun things and traveling and hanging out with friends but I have no money and no friends. Even when I was working full time I had no money and no time for myself. I know I shouldnâ€™t compare myself but when I see these people who donâ€™t have to work and just can live their lives smoking weed and being happy it makes me even more depressed. 

I just want to make music all day but I havenâ€™t even had the motivation to do that while I am unemployed. 

I had a couple good interviews last week but none of them will pay me what Iâ€™m worth and I will just be back to struggling all over again. 

I am worried that I wonâ€™t make it.
