I'm with family and I feel nothingI'm with them right now and I can't bring my mood up today. I just want to sleep and not wake up, what's the point if I can't even enjoy this. My parents didn't even come to hang out with the family either for no reason, I guess they just didn't feel like it, but on the day I'm feeling depressed and it's quite noticeable I have to be with family and loud children and they sit on their asses.
