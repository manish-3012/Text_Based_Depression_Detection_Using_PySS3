I'm going to kill myself on the 17thI have already accepted that life isn't going to be better. I'm not going to have some epiphany that will give me a purpose. 17th is the day I get my exam results, figured I'd wait until I accomplished something to do it. Also the birthday of the girl that made me wait for a month before dropping me as soon as she found someone better. I don't blame her tbh, I'm a horrible person. Nobody hates me more than myself.  It's gonna be a nice birthday gift too. For everyone. I'm a constant burden who cannot do anything right. I fuck up the simplest things and blame other people for my mistakes. Not anymore. This is gonma be the last time I dissapoint anyone. I'm not gonna leave behind a note or anything so I thought I might as well post something here.
