i feel like there is no pointi am 19 years old male, from 3rd world country, so sorry for my mistakes, i would like to share my story.

i had great life, although i was still awkward and i always felt in public weird and especially shy to girls, but not always, if i knew a girl long time i had no problem talking to her, but if i go drinking with friends i could not talk to girls even when i was drunk, i was just too shy, i haven't kissed and had sex, but i am not that ugly, i always though i am weird and not handsome, but many girls have told me i am attractive and had some contact with me, like sitting on my lap and sleep overs, that kinda boosted my confidence but i still could not get in relationship with girl or even kiss a girl, i had that "moments" where i should kiss her, but i was always too shy, i was thinking i will do something wrong and she will tell everyone and i will be extremely ashamed, i guess that's kind of anxiety or something, but yea that was in past. NOW i am pathetic, i gained a lot of weight, i haven't had friend in 2 years, i completely isolated myself from society, it started because my mother was drinking a lot, with my friends too, and i was too shamed to go outside i felt like they will make fun of me and i was ashamed that my mom is drinking, i dunno, my grandma says who cares what she does, its your life not hers, you should not care, but i cared a lot and i could not go outside, and so it went for a while and i didn't left my room, i quit school too, i was just pathetic piece of shit sitting in my room and did nothing, i just couldn't leave my room, then after like a 1.5 year i man up and went to the hospital or whatever u call that place, i tried to cure my depression and feel better, it kinda helped, i was drinking a lot of meds but it helped, i felt better, i though it will be fine when i get out, i even moved to different city where i could get out and meet new people, because i will still scared to go out in my home, i still felt ashamed, i was afraid of questions, some of my friends found out i was in mental hospital and that made me so ashamed, so i moved to different city and tried to live there, at beginning it was pretty good, i went out every single day, i even joined back to the gym, oh yea i forgot to tell you i was going to the gym before all this, 2 years i trained and had pretty nice body, but now its all gone... so yea, it was great, but then after 1 month again i felt depressed i could not make any friends, i guess that's the reason, maybe not, but anyway i was depressed again and i moved back to the home, now i am again in my room, i am not going out, doing nothing, just sitting here and thinking about suicide, but i am coward, i can't do it one of the reasons is my family, i once already tried to overdose meds, and my family went nuts, they said if i do something to myself again they will do it too, other reason is i am just too scared of pain, i am real piece of shit coward, i don't know what to do with my self, i just think there is no point living...
