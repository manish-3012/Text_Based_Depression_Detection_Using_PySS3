In praise of all the Suicide Watchers on this sub!You got your own jobs, your own problems, your own lives. And yet you still serve to instill positive energy to complete strangers in need, without demanding payment, for the reward of a few Internet points. As a person who is neither miserable to the point of posting or enlightened enough to comment, I find your efforts very touching; you are invisible angels with infinite kindness that light up a corner of the world, often understated and overlooked, but embody the beauty of humanity. 

Who are you? Are you impregnable warriors of life that never once struggled? Are you former victims of suicidal thoughts who would like to reciprocate? Are you just meanderers with nothing to do and nowhere else to dawdle? Why do you exist and do you ever need to refill your tanks before commenting?

Nevertheless, I want to thank everyone for your generous service. Seeing the constant online tally brings a smile to my face. Keep up the good work and thank you if you managed this far into my post!
