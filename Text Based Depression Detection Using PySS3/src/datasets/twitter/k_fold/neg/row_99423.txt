There is no life after traumaabusive childhood, exposure to sexuality/porn/adult men hitting on me as a 6 year old, threatened to kill myself with a knife when i was 4 in front of my mom, one and only friend died of cancer, suffer from being all alone my whole life, abusive relationship, r*ped by someone i love so much i have stockholm syndrome and would rather die than lose him, being hideous, no post-secondary education, ptsd triggered by anything slightly sexual or loud/drunk men.

I'm 21 years old almost 22 this year and yes I'm a girl and no i don't have "so much life ahead of me" like everyone says. I don't have time to make the most of my life. I don't have the money to do that. I just want to feel safe and protected and loved. I have nothing, i have no one.

I'm in $20k debt from student loans &amp; rhinoplasty. I have no job, I'm too mentally f*cked up to work, i get fired every 3 months. I can't ever be okay i can't ever be free i can't ever feel happy to be alive.

I have no reason to live. Hope and hope and hope and every year, nothing, every year, it keeps getting worse and worse.
