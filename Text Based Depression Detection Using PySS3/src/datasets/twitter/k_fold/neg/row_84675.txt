I'm scared and I'm losing hopeI'm just really worried about the future, and I don't know how I'm going to do this or go through this. (for context, I'm just not good enough to be accepted by colleges and my parents won't approve of going to community college) But an hour ago, my mom told me I probably won't get into college, I know I shouldn't listen to her but, I still worry If I'm on the right track or I need to do build up my G.P.A even more. I know I'm probably the worst person to apply for a pre-med program but, we'll see how it goes. Another problem, I keep on having is no motivation to study for the SAT or anything else right now. I feel shitty going into senior year and I wonder if I'll ever feel happiness other than getting into college and if I'll make my life better. Honestly, if I don't get into college, I can't bear the thought of going to community college but I'll try not to focus on that right now
