has anyone ever heard of this methodI don't really know the rules because they're not in the side bar, but I'm thinking of killing myself.

I've already tried hanging myself but it was really hard and gave me too much time to think. I was considering using two methods simultaneously, namely drugs with hanging. If I get myself to a point of OD'ing and already have a noose around my neck it won't even have to too high up, or too tight, to really be at the point of helping me totally lose consciousness. 

I don't want a suicide hotline, I tried that at 15 and never called again because they were not helpful.

I believed in the right to die, I don't have anything to live for and my attempts are like a person attempting to dig themselves out of a well with their barehands. Also, I watched my mom live a suicidal and hopeless life for years only to die of an overdose after years of being miserable, and I don't really believe theres anyway to sugarcoat my positions, all I am going to end up is procrastinating the inevitable just like her.
