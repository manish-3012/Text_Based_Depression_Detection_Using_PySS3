rejected by all collegesi feel cold every time i think about it and my arms are so heavy to lift. last year i was going to shoot myself but i convinced myself i couldnâ€™t because my grades were too important. now they donâ€™t mean anything. i canâ€™t stop asking myself why i wasnt good enough.  i put in everything i had. im worthless. i want to rip my arms off. i cant do anything because of my parents but i want to so badly and i wouldnâ€™t even know afterwards. im less than fucking garbage.
