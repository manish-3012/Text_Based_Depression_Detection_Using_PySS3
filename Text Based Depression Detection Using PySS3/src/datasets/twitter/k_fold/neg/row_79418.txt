I tried to commit suicide yesterday....Hi! I just wanted to share my story. 

I tried to commit suicide last. I had been planning it for one week and I had made some preparation like emptying my apartment and withdrawing money from my account. I have been battling depression for the last 4-5 years since my mother died and I had decided that I wanted to put an end to my constant anxiety. I have been off my meds for 1 month and have since been acting more and more irrational for the last couple of days. I bought a rope, tied a noose and drank lots of alcohol. I hadn't been sleeping all night and I felt numb... 

I called the national suicide prevention lifeline and talked to the nicest guy ever. He was so calm and sincere. I talked to him for 45 minutes and he offered to call me back. I really wish I could thank that guy and I appreciate that I had the opportunity to talk with him cause it felt so much better afterwards. I had never called a suicide prevention line before and to be honest I didn't think it would make any difference if I talked to some stranger over the phone about my problems. I was so close to doing something permanent..suicide.

 I feel so ashamed of myself. I have never come so close to doing something like this, I feel afraid of myself and that I sometimes get so overwhelmed by emotions that I can't think straight.
