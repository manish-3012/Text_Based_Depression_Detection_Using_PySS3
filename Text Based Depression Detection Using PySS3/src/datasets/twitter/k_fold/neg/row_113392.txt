Why won't anyone listen to me? I'm so sick and don't deserve this.I've been sick for years. No one listens. Doctors rush me out the door.  I'm often so sick I can barely make it to the appointment, let alone fight with them over proper treatment and respect for the patient.

I have bankrupted myself and am currently homeless. If it can't be fixed in 30 minutes and with a pill of some sort, no one seems to care.

Family and everyone else in my life abandoned me in my time of need. Normally this would be okay, but I'm too sick to help myself. I feel drugged after eating. I'm so sick I can barely move some days.

I just enrolled in school in an attempt to save my own life. I cannot do the work and cannot learn the material. More debt, more wasted time, more disappointment, more hopelessness.

Why is it that a once very nice, genuine, caring, person is now thrown to the curb? What did I do to deserve this? Why do millions of people who make bad life choices get proper treatment, and yet someone who has always done the right thing can't get help when needed?

Why do I have to be so sick and alone for several years. Where is my help? Why won't anyone listen? Why won't anyone do anything to help me. I beg and plead for help, and no one cares. I have never begged for anything in my life. The one time I need help I'm left to rot.

I have been sick for over 4 years now. I'm 28 years old. I should be in the prime of my life and I spend every waking minute looking for answers. Why can't I get help???
