Too many things in the wayLast month was the closest Iâ€™ve ever been to attempting in a long time. Things have improved and Iâ€™ve been working hard to stop cutting myself but Iâ€™m feeling closer again lately. Iâ€™ve researched it a lot, over years honestly, and i could probably hang myself, but thereâ€™s so many problems with it. I still live with family and theyâ€™d have to find me like that. I have a dog (the best dog) and heâ€™s so clingy that he canâ€™t even stand to be in a different room from me. So to solve those problems i could get a hotel room. Pretty difficult honestly as i struggle just to afford food week to week, plus then i feel terrible that an employee would have to find me. If i can even manage pulling it off. I know if i vent about this to any of my friends theyâ€™ll just get really worried so i guess i chose here to get it off my chest. Sorry / thanks
