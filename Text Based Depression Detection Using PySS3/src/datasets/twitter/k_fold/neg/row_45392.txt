No friends, no girlfriend, no job, no purpose...I tried to fit in in high school, didn't make a single friend; tried to fit in in college, failed. Can't find a job, still living with my parents at 26. I'm extremely awkward and socially anxious. I tried meeting people everywhere, never made a friend. I don't have a career path, no passions. I have absolutely no more strenght in me to even start whichever long path I have to take to get out of this. I'm so depressed I can't even make myself a sandwich. I've been hoping for a change for 11 years. I've come to the conclusion that it's just not meant to happen, and the idea of suicide brings a lot of serenity to my mind.
