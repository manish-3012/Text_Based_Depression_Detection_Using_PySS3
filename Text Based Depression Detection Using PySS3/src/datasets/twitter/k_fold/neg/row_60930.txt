Iâ€™m tired of trying.I feel so hated. I donâ€™t know why. I feel like everyone who I care about somehow hates me for whatever reason. I donâ€™t have anybody to talk to. Iâ€™m utterly alone. I made plans to kill myself today. I was looking for a sign I shouldnâ€™t but I honestly think everyone is growing tired of me. Iâ€™ve tried for what seems like forever and I can just never do anything right. I canâ€™t stand myself. Iâ€™m only alive because of my pets. It feels like everyone is against me. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m tired of trying. But I donâ€™t know what else to do. I can see that everyone is growing tired of me. I canâ€™t handle all this pressure anymore. I just canâ€™t. But I donâ€™t know what else to Do. It feels like everyone is against me. And I donâ€™t know how to talk about whatâ€™s really hurting me.  The only repack Iâ€™m here is because if my pets but I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
