Nearly 40 years in, haven't found any place, nobody talks to me, nobody loves me or even thinks about me. There is literally no point in keeping myself alive.I can't find joy in anything because I don't have anybody to share anything with. People come in and out of my life peripherally but I never learned how to make lasting or meaningful connections, and nobody wants them with me. Nobody thinks about me, nobody cares about me and I don't care about myself. I just feel so much pain and misery from loneliness and the emptiness of my life. There is no hope anymore. 

If there was an off button to my life I would have already pushed it. Instinct against hurting myself is the only thing keeping me alive right now, but rationally I know that killing myself can't be worse than this hopelessness.
