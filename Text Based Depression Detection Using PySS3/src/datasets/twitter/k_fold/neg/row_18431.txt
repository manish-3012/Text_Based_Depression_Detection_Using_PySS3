All Barriers are Broken. The Only Remaining Step is Pulling the TriggerExistence is struggle. Literally. From the moment you are born gravity is pushing down on you, crushing your body and folding it up as you age and shrink. You can try to workout, try to resist, but you will decay all the same.

Existence is also emotional strife. Even the most beautiful things pain me. Actually, the more beautiful something is, the more pain it causes me, because I know I am not worthy of and can't retain that beauty. Yet without any beauty, I'd be lonely, sad, and dull. 

See, there is no escape from the strife as long as I live. The only option is to pull the trigger.

It shouldn't be hard. I've expected this moment for years and I have access to what I need. God, it shouldn't be hard. Sure, my brains may be spilled on my friend's floor, but so what? I'll be dead. One more step, one more step until nirvana...
