I desperately need help for a suicidal online friendHey everyone. I have known this guy for around 6 months and while he is so amazing and nice when he's not depressed, he thinks everybody hates him and he feels so lonely and I honestly don't know what to do. I try to show him how much I love and appreciate him and how other people in his life do, but he has trouble mainiaining that image in his mind because he has had a troubled childhood of abuse.

He uses alcohol_x0014_ to cope. He lives in a different country than I do and so it's hard for me to try and help him. I know that he has tried to kill himself multiple times and it breaks my heart, and I just wish I could support him in real life.

He's been offline on all of his accounts for almost a week and I'm scared. The last thing he said to me was that he hated his life and was going to end it all while his parents were away, and also mentioned that he felt horrible that he wasn't good enough for his best friend who doesn't see him as his best friend, and that he wishes he could be a better friend to his best friend so that he would "like him like he likes his other friends."

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you in advance to anyone who wants to help.
