Slipping away...Why is it that it's so easy for me to think about suicide? People shouldn't be so willing to die as much as I am at times. Sometimes I will just think...why not just drink some wiper fluid? Why not just sit in my running car with the windows down in the garage? It scared me that my mind will just think these thoughts so nonchalantly that I literally step back and think...whoa did I I really just say that? But then I settle back into the desperate idea of just making a move and then just slipping away....
I am frightened of my own mind.
Does anyone else struggle with this?!??
