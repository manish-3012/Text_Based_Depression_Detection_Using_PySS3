Walked in on a suicide attemptSo when I was smaller coming home from elementary I found my dad. He was on the floor, rolling around, told me to get him tea. He was so incoherent. Had tried to OD. I didnâ€™t know what was happening so I called my mom, she came home and thatâ€™s really all I remember. I didnâ€™t think about this memory until I found some documents talking about it. It all clicked that it was an attempt many years later. It fucked me up. I have a question, who would let their young daughter find their dead body? He was attempting to die. My dad has had more attempts. Once with carbon monoxide in our garage. It could have easily harmed our pets. When you kill yourself, you think for a second about who will find you. What a selfish asshole.. I canâ€™t forgive him. Weâ€™ve never talked about it. It makes me feel worse.
