I don't just want to be dead, I want to die.I always hear people say "I don't wanna kill myself, I just wish I was dead" and I used to be the same but for the past few weeks I've hit a new low and I just can't relate anymore. I don't just wish I was dead or had never been born -- I *want* to kill myself, I *want* to die. I guess this is the difference between being passively suicidal and (nearing) actively.
