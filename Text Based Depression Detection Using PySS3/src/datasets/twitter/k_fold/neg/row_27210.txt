what's even the pointI don't even see why we feel the need to exist. We live and die and can do nothing to prevent the latter. I am Christian so if my beliefs are true, killing myself just gets me to heaven faster, if not then I go into the void just like everyone else will. To be honest I don't see why anyone who strongly believes a religion would want to spend any time on Earth and not get to whatever afterlife faster.
