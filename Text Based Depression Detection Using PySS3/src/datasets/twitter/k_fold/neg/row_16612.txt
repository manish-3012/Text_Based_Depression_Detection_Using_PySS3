Been tossing around the idea of suicide for a few weeks now.I know where my father's handgun is, and I know it's loaded. If I really wanted to, I could go get it now and end myself. Truth is, I want people to be happy, but since I can't make anyone happy by being here, it stands to reason I would be doing everyone a favor by not being here. Only person who would be seriously affected is my mom, and that's why I haven't done anything yet. There's been many times in these past few weeks I feel like I could have turned this around but I'm too much of a damn pussy to do it. Now I just wanna end this so I can quit being bothersome. I have no friends, no significant other, and no events to speak of in my near/distant future to look forward to. If I go to college, I'll just flunk out because I know I'm not smart enough for it, and if I don't go to college, I'll end up working minimum wage jobs he rest of my life and I'll never accomplish anything. Tell me reddit, what's left to live for, other than disappointment?
