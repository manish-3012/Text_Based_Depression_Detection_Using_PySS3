What's the point?Anyone else find it increasingly hard to care about anything? Last year my depression got so out of hand that i spent my Christmas drunk, throwing up saying how much I wanted to kill myself. I didn't do anything last year to directly kill myself,  but i started drinking more, tried some drugs, and even almost quit my job because mentally i was just a point where i didn't care about my life.

Fast forward this year, i still drink, but i know my limits,  i don't do drugs, and i quite vaping, but it still seems like that doesn't matter. Whenever i drink i have coworkers telling me not to despite them drinking far more than me. My roommate was convinced that i started day drinking (i dont) despite whenever she's home in the morning she smokes weed in her room. I know people worry about me, and i have a few people i care for too, but that doesn't seem like enough. Even when I'm with friends or when text people I always feel alone, and whenever i try moving on with life I get knocked down. I haven't tried killing myself because i dont see what that will accomplish, but also a bottle of sleeping pills mixed with some wine just sounds nice.
