I feel alone in a bad wayHi guys, Iâ€™m here because I really have no one who will listen to me. I need some support, maybe someone has a similar experience?? Growing up I was never allowed to have emotions, Iâ€™d get punished for crying emotionally  or being hurt physically. Now I have a partner who also punishes me for being hurt about anything. It doesnâ€™t even have to be about something specific to him or the relationship, just any sign of emotion from me and heâ€™s had it. It really makes me feel more suicidal than before. Completely alone. He tells me Iâ€™m too sensitive and I need to stop crying over things. I save how I feel for when heâ€™s not around because of comments like that. It confuses me how Iâ€™m â€œtoo emotionalâ€ for him when a lot of the time I hide my emotions (I started to hide my feelings only after trying multiple times to be open and honest with him ab them). It makes me want to die. I have never threatened to kill myself for the sake of attention or manipulation. I told him I needed to know I matter to someone and the response was â€œIâ€™m not expressing to you that I want you here, because I shouldnt have to.â€ I donâ€™t have anyone. I feel really alone and I donâ€™t want to hurt anymore like this. Iâ€™ve had two panic attacks tonight- Iâ€™m exhausted and want out.
