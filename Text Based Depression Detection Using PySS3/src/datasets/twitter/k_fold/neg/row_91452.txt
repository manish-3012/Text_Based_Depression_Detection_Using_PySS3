Iâ€™m losing hopeIâ€™m really struggling to get hired for any job. Iâ€™ve been applying non stop and it seems like no one wants to hire me. My anxiety doesnâ€™t make the situation any easier at all. I also tried looking for jobs that I can do from home.. but I get nothing. Iâ€™m trying my best and itâ€™s not enough. Itâ€™s just so frustrating not being financially stabled.
