Well, I failedHey, SW. This is just a throwaway account, but I really need advice now. If you promise to not judge me, I won't judge you.

I'm a high schooler, formerly an A/B student that, although shy, did well in school. Well, the problem now is that I've been suffering from depression (it's self-diagnosed, I know, but I haven't gotten an evaluation yet) since the beginning of middle school. Constant bullying, house arguments, and just not being able to stand up for myself put me in a dark place where I would contemplate not if I should commit suicide, but what was the best way to do it. Messed up, I figure, but I'm used to it.

Anyways, starting last month, I hit rock bottom face first. Every day, I wake up wondering what shit I would have to deal with today, sludge around in school, absorb the arguments my sister and my single mother would have, dick around on the computer, and go to bed. And frankly, I can't bring myself to do anything else. If I have schoolwork, I can't bring myself to do it. If I want to do something creative like write or take pictures, I can't take the first step. If I want to start something new, my feet cease to move, and I'm stuck in the old. My brain will not let me go any further in life. I'm just stuck like this forever.

So now, I'm bombing all my classes, I'm letting what little friends I have down, and, quite frankly, I don't want to live in a world I loath. I don't believe in an afterlife, but no life is better than hell. Every day, I dread the future, whether it be the next day or my future as an adult. Both end with failures, disappointments, and uselessness. I'd rather save everyone the time and sorrow and end it quickly.

Thanks in advance.
