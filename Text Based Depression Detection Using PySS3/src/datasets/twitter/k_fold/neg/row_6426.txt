don't read this if you want to die today.I know this is very silly, but I'm lying here in my hospital bed because I'm suicidal, extremely tired of life. I find great comfort in these suicide Reddit subs and thought of one more way to use it. I will use this thread to list reasons to live and would love for you to do the same, whether you are in the same boat as myself or if you just want to contribute. It does not have to be a good reason and we might not have the same reasons, mine might not help you and vice verca. I will try to write every day or as I come up with more reasons. You can add yours as you come up with any. I'll start:

Music, art, books, dogs, animals in general, wine, exploring new foods and tastes, funny things, musicals, coffee, learning new things, creating new things, learning from each other, pasta, especially sea food pasta, men with beards.

That's it for now... and as I was writing this I thought of something said by an Auschwitz survivor (not comparing myself to him) when asked what made him so determined to survive all those years in the death camp - he said "the thought of eating loaf bread with strawberry jam when I got home". My point is, these things are trivial but maybe we can find reason in the little things? Just maybe?
