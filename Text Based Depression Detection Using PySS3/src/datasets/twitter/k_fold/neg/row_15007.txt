I'm so sorryAll I ever wanted to do was make you happy, but I just made your life worse, and now you'll never want anything else me, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me after I'm gone, I know I can never fix things between us, but please don't despise me forever. I've lost everyone, but you told me you loved me, and would always be there for me, but I made even you leave me, that just proves how worthless I am.

I'm sorry, I hope you can find happiness, goodbye, I love you.
