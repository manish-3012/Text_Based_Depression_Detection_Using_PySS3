I almost did it this morningThe last time this happened, I decided to give myself a week. It's been about that long.

I have daily panic attacks and I just want it to end. I've been self harming, but even that doesn't make me feel better anymore.

I had a big panic attack this morning. I tried to find the gun. My mom must have hidden it the last time she visited. I searched and searched and I couldn't find the damn thing.

If I had found it, I wouldn't be here anymore. I still don't want to be here. So now I'm sitting here with a sore arm and eyes that hurt from crying. And a heart that won't stop fucking pounding out of my chest.

I can't stop shaking. I can't talk to anyone about this because. Well because I only have 2 friends in this world, and they don't want to talk to me. And I don't want to be a burden on their own mental wellbeing. I don't want to upset anyone.

I wouldn't want to talk to me either. I don't blame them. I just.. wish I could be ok. I wish I could forget about my life.

I'm still here. I don't want to be, but I am. I don't know what to do with myself.

I wish I could just dig a hole and crawl in it.
