Possible TW// My best friends mother wants to commit.Sorry for my English and sorry if this is a wrong sub. 

My(M15) best friends(F13) mother says that she wants to commit. My friends parents divorced and from there it went downhill. Her mother emotionaly abuses her and says things like : "if you visit dad I'll jump from a bridge, etc. " Today my friend told me worried for her mom and she doesn't know how to help her. I'm worried i'd say something stupid so i'm asking here. I comforted her and now she hopefuly feels better but she's still worried. 

What can she/we do to help her mom, without damaging their relationship? ( we live in central Europe if that's helful) 
And again sorry if this doesn't belong here.
