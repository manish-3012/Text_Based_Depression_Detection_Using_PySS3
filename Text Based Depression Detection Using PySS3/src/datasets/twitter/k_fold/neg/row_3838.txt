Time to goI did something awful. I cheated on my girlfriend with my best friend whoâ€™s also friends with my girlfriend. Heâ€™s not going to tell. But I feel like absolute shit. We both feel incredibly guilty. I canâ€™t go on. I fucked up so badly.... as soon as he left I pulled out the blades and I went a bit too deep. But Iâ€™ll be damned if I put any effort to make it stop. See you guys on the other side.
