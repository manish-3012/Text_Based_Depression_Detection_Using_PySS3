It makes no difference whether I kill myself or not.I donâ€™t have friends. My family wonâ€™t care. Iâ€™m not going anywhere in life. I donâ€™t know, it just can be hard trying to cope with your life/death both meaning absolutely nothing to anyone, including yourself. I might as well do it, because Iâ€™m depressed and canâ€™t imagine things ever being better than this, but something still holds me back for some reason. Maybe Iâ€™m a narcissist. I always hate when people say narcissists donâ€™t kill themselves because they love themselves too much; I definitely donâ€™t love myself, but I also definitely shouldnâ€™t be here anymore, so what am I doing???
