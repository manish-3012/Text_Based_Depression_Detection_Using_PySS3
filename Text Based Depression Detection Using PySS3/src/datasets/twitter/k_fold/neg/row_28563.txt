It keeps getting worse.Right now, I just cracked my laptop screen and got locked out of my school studies, which Iâ€™ve been working my damnedest on. My parents donâ€™t understand or care. Everyday, it seems to get worse, never better. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts several days and it seems to be getting more frequent. I used to have them everyday but I started feeling more and more numb. Iâ€™m laying here, tired, wishing I could sleep because Iâ€™ve worked for eight hours straight no break and accounted for nothing. I keep looking over at the pill bottles trying to convince myself to do it, but Iâ€™m a coward.  I feel worthless and pathetic for so many reasons. 

Sorry if this if bothersome, I needed to rant, even if no one will listen.  

I just wish I could sleep and not wake up, beats laying here numb, thinking about every fuckup Iâ€™ve ever made. 

Thanks
