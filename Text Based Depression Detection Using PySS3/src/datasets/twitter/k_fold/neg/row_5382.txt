My daughter is 14 and has several suicidal friends, are there any resources to help her better support themShe seems to have taken on the role of being her own suicide prevention hotline and support network for her friends. While I am proud of her supporting them I am concerned that she is taking on their depression and is not equipped to deal with this or best support them. Is there a resource you know of to help a teen deal with supporting suicidal friends?
