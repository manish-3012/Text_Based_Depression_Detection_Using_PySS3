Art is nothing without time. You are time.When I was 19 I realized the way I think and communicate could make interesting lyrics. I'm 35 now and i have more songs than the Beatles. If you count the ones that suck i got a shit ton more. I started a little solo project to make something out of my thoughts so they wouldnt just disintegrate in my head or evaporate in the air and just go right over peoples heads. I found out in my 30s I'm autistic which explains alot. I have too much art and it piles up daily. I'm not sure if anyone could understand this but art is nothing without time. What I have done is something and its huge and its tearing me apart. I want to live my life and share myself and what I have but where I am living.. I'm also an inventor of quite a few things and I'm in the town the electric guitar was invented. But.. Gibson only put that label here like 5 or 6 years ago and I bet most people here were like.. huh? Were a guitar town? Who's a les paul? Really?? Lol.. I bet. It's so not. Im from the town over. Its painful to have this stuff and be so secluded with noone to be part of it with me so this thing can grow. I've had the joy of a few small groups. It grows. It's something. I have to take my art somewhere it can be heard and felt and grow among groups so it can be as big as it is but I cant leave my son here. Long story short.. pain and urgency and overwhelming ambition. And.. well.. youd assume I'm not good. ...considering who I am. That's not the issue. I dont know where to go with what I have and what I do. It is something and its painful for me to have it here. I'm not sure what to do. I dont want to die. Life is full of wonder and I love to write trippy stuff about it but its overwhelmingly painful to be my art and have so much of it to offer. I'm not sure what to do or where to go.
