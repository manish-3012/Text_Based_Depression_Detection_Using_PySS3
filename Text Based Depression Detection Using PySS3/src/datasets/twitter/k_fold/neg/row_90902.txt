I'm over itI'm going to kill myself tonight. I can't live with myself anymore. 
I'm having issues with my relationship right now and I dont think I can get past it. I have two friends, one of which is my boyfriend, and to everybody else, I'm just there. My family doesn't care about me. College has been super hard and it's just going to get harder for the rest. I dont see another way out. 
I've already written my notes. I'm going to take all the pills I hava in my house. 
I finally feel like I'm going to be ok.
