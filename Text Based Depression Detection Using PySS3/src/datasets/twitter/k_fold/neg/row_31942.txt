19 years too manyi made this account because i wanted to share some of my art, but everyday i hate everything i make more and more. i used to love it so much, and i wanted nothing more than to be a gallery artist or character designer. it was so beautiful and magical to me, but i don't believe in it anymore. i've battled anorexia, depression, anxiety, for years, and i'm ready to have peace. i've been to therapy, i've had medication, nothing helps. drugs and alcohol don't do the trick anymore either. everyday i spend in this body is agony and all  i want to do is lie away and rot. i don't know how to tell everyone that i have to go soon, so i guess it'll be a surprise. i feel horrible that my boyfriend and friends will live in the wake of it and that my roommates will have to pay more rent, but hopefully enough money is in my account to last my end a bit longer. it will all be okay in the end though. it's like i'm taking a vacation
