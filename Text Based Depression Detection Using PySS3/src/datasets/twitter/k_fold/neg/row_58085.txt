I overthink, hate most of the world, and want to die. That's it. That's the title, folks.Everyday I constantly overthink every fucking thing to the point it makes me physically sick and I almost throw up. It was FUCKED today and I can't function right now. I reached out to three of my friends for help but none of them answered their phone. I want to blow my brains out. I want to blow my brains out. I want to blow my brains out. 

It's not fair. Everybody gives me the same cliche speech about how "life isn't fair but you just have to get through it, it'll get better". Motherfucker, I've been waiting years for this shit to improve but I'm still spiraling down. What the hell am I supposed to do?

Why do I have to work a shitty retail job just to have enough money to live? Why do people feel so entitled to their goddamn 10% off discount that they personally demean and tear me down? Why do I have to worry about following a preconceived set of notions and behaviors so I don't get locked up in a mental institution? Well, fuck it. 

I don't wanna put up with it anymore. Fuck fuck fuck FUCK. I hate myself so fucking much. I want to splatter my brains across a wall. It's going to hurt some of my friends if I actually pull the trigger but I can't do this shit anymore.
