Junior in college, less than 2.0 GPA and am going to fail all my classes this semester, just like the rest of my semesters.Iâ€™ve given up, I canâ€™t keep disappointing my mom. Education means the world to her and I have been lying about how I have been doing this semester, making up grades and telling her that I am doing fine and that I will pass. Every semester from freshman year to now, I have failed multiple classes a semester. I am on probation and have been for most of my college career, I am hanging on by a thread in school. I tried changing my major and what not and I was interested in it for a while, but then my depression and anxiety (like always) took over. I started this semester strong, I was seeing a therapist over the summer but stopped once I came back to school. I stopped going to my classes for 1.5 months and didnâ€™t do work for any of them either and there is no other way out. Last semester was the worst semester of my life, I didnâ€™t shower for days, didnâ€™t see or talk to anyone for days, laid in bed crying majority of the time. I donâ€™t know if school isnâ€™t just for me?? but I do somewhat enjoy my classes when Iâ€™m not depressed. The only times I got out of my bed during those 2 months was to go to dance practice, then immediately crawl back into my bed. I donâ€™t have it in me to fail again. I physically and mentally will not be able to handle finishing this semester and showing my mom all the Fs sheâ€™s spending all of her hard earned money paying for. I feel like Iâ€™ve failed more classes than passed, and the classes I pass are easy elective type courses that have nothing to do with my major. I need to end things, I am tired of disappointing my mom, the most important person in my life. I donâ€™t want to hurt her anymore. I pretty much have been kicked out and reinstated twice due to summer classes and I honestly have lost the effort or energy to finish this semester. I canâ€™t keep failing, I feel my unintelligent depressed self is a failure. I canâ€™t look at another F on my transcript. I will never get a job or even graduate with my transcript and my GPA, whatâ€™s the point?
