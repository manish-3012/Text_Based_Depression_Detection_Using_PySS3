My 20th birthday is coming up next month, and I don't intend to live to see it.I've been suicidal a long while now, and depressed even longer. I've been on meds, but they didn't help. I don't feel comfortable telling some counsellor or therapist about all my goddamn problems. Their time is better spent elsewhere, with someone more worthy of such help. 3 times I have tried to die, and 3 times I have unfortunately wussed out. By the time my birthday comes around, I hope to remedy that.

At this point, my existence is of no real benefit to the world. I have no life skills whatsoever, and I dread having to explain to my mother that I'm probably failing uni this year too. Once that happens, I'm out on my ass, and it's not like I have anyone or anything to fall back on if that happens. 

I'm ugly and overweight, and frankly it feels like my only two friends I haven't driven away are only with me out of obligation. I don't even really deserve that much, honestly. It kinda goes without saying I've had no intimate physical contact with another person, not even a kiss. I'm not even slightly approachable, certainly not to that extent. I offer nothing as a friend, companion or partner. I'm a leech to the few people I'm around, because I'm too fucking lazy and useless to make something of myself.

I constantly read that life always gets better, yet all the recent cases of suicide, famous or otherwise, say differently. For some people it doesn't and won't get better. I'm too exhausted to keep fighting to find out whether or not my life will be better 5 or 10 years from now. I just want it to stop, man. I just want it all to fucking stop.

Goddamn this post is a fucking mess.

Here's hoping the 4th attempt will be the charm.
