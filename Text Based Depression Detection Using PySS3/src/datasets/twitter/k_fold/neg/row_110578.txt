history repeating?Hey guys, 

heres my story.. im sure youve heard it all before.. 

about 5 years ago my life took a turn for the worst, i was hard working, getting my head down, paying bills, doing ok for myself, new car,  had a lady in my life, my own appartment, everything was going really damn well, i had a vast circle of friends who i could rely on..

for some crazy reason, i decided to change jobs, it turned out the grass wasnt so fucking green as my new employer was keen to point out, he cut my hours in half, and then in half again.. i went from 50 hours a week to just over 15 or something.. 

long story short, i couldnt pay the bills, i lost my apartment, i lost my car, my lady and friends didnt stick around either, not because they were with me for the money, i just changed i guess, i moved back in with my parents, i lived in the same room for 3 years, i never socialised with anyone..   

then 2 years ago  my father got redundancy from work , he decided he was going to invest in a business for the future, e asked if i would join him,   so yeah.. a new change to get back out in the world, i gained a fair bit of weight from my reclusive life style,   then i met a new lady , she was awesom, she treated me like i was the best thing ever,  we were together for a year or so.. an she fuckin left me   the week before she was telling me no one ever treated her the way i did an why i treated her as good as i did,   she jus straight up left, without a text or a call or anything..    i really love working with my old man  i work so damn hard, i volunteer all my hours in the shop, i regularly do 50 - 70 hour weeks, with next to no pay, the business is doing ok, but not enough to pay myself for all the hours.. i think i pay myself if im lucky 20 hours a week.. same with my old man an my sister, we are on really low wages... with this recession and what not.. i see drug addicts.. alcoholics getting help from the government.. they have nice tvs.. big cars...   all the good shit.. im fuckin bustin my ass off an i have nothing.. barely enough to buy myself anything nice    my car has jus gone tits up   my lady left me.. i feel like what happened 5 years ago is repeating its self all over again.. i cant see a way out this time.. i really dont think i can go through the whole re-building process over again :( i dont know where to turn or what to do 

why does it always have to be about the money??

money is evil!


people tell me,   money doesnt make you happy,    but when you cant pay the bills  or even feed yourself properly     then it sure does bring unhappiness
the only viable options at the moment   turning into a drug addict or an alcoholic.. 

but to be honest id rather be a respected member of the community,.. 

i dont even know where im going with this rant.. :( 

Edit :    iv had to step away from the PC  i need to be up in 5 hours time :(   thanks to the people who took the time to try and help.. it really has!  even my free hug.. 

thanks!
