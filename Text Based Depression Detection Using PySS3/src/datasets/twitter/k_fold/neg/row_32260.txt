M[17] senior in high school..So Im about two months from graduating and.. I have done nothing with a girl. I have never had a relationship. You name it. I've never done it. I didn't start even texting girls by senior year and it wasn't anything even close to being a relationship. Every single day I get lonelier and lonelier. I can't take it anymore. I just want to end my it before I have to suffer from being a loner the rest of my life.
