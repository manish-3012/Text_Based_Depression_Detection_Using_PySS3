I just want to stop thinking foreverI feel so empty inside and I have no motivation to ever change. Iâ€™m so worthless Iâ€™m just waiting out the rest of my life until Iâ€™m gone. Whatâ€™s the point in living when you know things will never be the way you want them. There is no point. I havenâ€™t hurt myself in a long time but I wish I could go away. I am awful. I am sorry. 

I wonâ€™t do anything tonight but every week i get so worked up about life and I feel paralyzed. My heart and head hurt and it feels so bad. I hate myself so much fuck this awful world
