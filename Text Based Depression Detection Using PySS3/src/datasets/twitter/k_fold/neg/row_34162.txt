I can't keep doing thisI keep trying to believe that fucking up is a verb, not a state of being but I really don't. I have been a fuck-up forever, and I never seem to get away from it no matter how I try. I wish there was an external thing I could point to as the cause, like a drug problem but the truth is I'm just so fucking stupid I don't even understand how I haven't accidentally died yet. There is nothing I hate more than myself and stupid I am.

My fucking up has continually lost me opportunities, employment, security for my family. I watch my beautiful children growing up in abject poverty because I can't hold a job. Every job I get I manage to screw up something badly enough I get fired.

I want to die. I can't stand feeling like a ridiculous failure any more. I really, really can't. I want to die, but I would fuck that up too because I love my kids so goddamned much I can't stand the thought of betraying them forever. Thinking about how hurt and lost my babies would be when they learned I left them behind, not being able to tell them I love them and I'm sorry, hurts even worse than the burning self-hatred.
