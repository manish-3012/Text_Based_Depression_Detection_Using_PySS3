Can't find meaning in anythingHonestly I can't even dream properly anymore.

If you asked me what future I would like I would have no answer. I'd like to be dead, so that I don't have a future. If you offered me a billion dollars or death, I'd just take death. I just want to disappear.

Being alive sucks and it has always sucked. I feel like I've had to just lie to myself about being happy some of the time because I'm not always 100% miserable and just to try and make things bearable.

There's a scary thing that happens if you grow up in pain and never know happiness. It's just your baseline. It's just your normal. And you "adjust" but when I realized that having adapted to suffering wasn't the same as actually feeling okay, it sort of tears your whole world down. My whole life hasn't been worth the trouble.

It would really make a difference if my mother cared about me, but she didn't and doesn't, and I can't change that. But I don't know how to make up for it. I don't know how to recover from that idea, that my own mother doesn't love me, how could I be worth anything? I know that's irrational but I can't shake it.

There's honestly not that much love in the world. You have to find it, compete for it, earn it. Otherwise you just disappear.

I'm not really that useful to the world. I'm not the most useless person ever, but the world doesn't seem to really need me. I could die and history will proceed exactly the same. The people in my life who don't forget about me immediately, they'll die eventually too.

Hopefully I die soon.
