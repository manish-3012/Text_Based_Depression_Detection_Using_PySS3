How serious is this?How many people just want to fucking bitch and be dramatic? And how many are *actually* suicidal and want to discuss how to do it et cetera? Sometimes it's hard tell. Seems like lately it's just a bunch of people moaning about their lives or stupid fucking kids being dramatic. Sorry in advance if I offend anyone, I'm just curious. I also would love to discuss some genuine suicide methods.
