I found the worst thing on this websiteIt's [u/SuicideAwarenessBot](https://www.reddit.com/u/SuicideAwarenessBot/).

Yes, it's just as bad as you expect it to be. A soulless bot that replies with the suicide hotline number whenever it sees stuff like "I want to kill myself".

Imagine talking about about something as serious as wanting to die, only for a bot poorly made in 3 minutes to make its creator feel like a good person to come and reply to your comment with a soulless, unedited text that it automatically replied with to thousands of other comments.

Fuck [u/SuicideAwarenessBot](https://www.reddit.com/u/SuicideAwarenessBot/).
