Wishing for the apocalypseIdk about anyone else here but I have been wishing for the apocalypse, craving something catastrophic to just end everything. My suicidal thoughts have become so intertwined with believing that people suck and we deserve a catastrophic end. Itâ€™s to the point where I love watching disaster movies, imagining how things could end and everything. The pandemic and 2020 unrest has only made this craving worse.

Does anyone else have this?
