I'm running out of options..I hate whining, and I don't want to be told I'm being selfish, but I really am tired of existing. I know I suffer from anxiety and possibly depression, but my parents have been denying I have a problem for 5 years. My father is a selfish bastard and my mom deserves better than our family. I don't know where to turn.. My only friend is pissed at me because he's had a shitty day too, but Im so self absorbed that I didnt even ask to see if he was okay. I just hate myself and I hate this life that Im stuck in.. Im out of ideas and options.
