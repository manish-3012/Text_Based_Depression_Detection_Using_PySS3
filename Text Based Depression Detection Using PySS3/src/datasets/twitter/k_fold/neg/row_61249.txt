RooftopI'm on the rooftop right now taking my cat for a walk as always. I like this place. It's mostly lonely, calm, and you can see the city around. I'm really sad right now. I like to imagine myself jumping and splatting on the ground, over and over again. Or shooting myself here. I've even chosen the spot I want to sit and shoot myself. I like to fantasize on the moment of how people are going to find me, how loud is it going to be, how much is going to hurt probably, my brain on the ground. I come here everyday to take my cat for a walk, but I like to imagine the silence and fantasize about a world without people, as if suddenly everyone disappeared from earth. I come every night to see the stars and the moon and my own shadow. I like to imagine myself as a ghost in the afterlife. Sometimes on specially bad days I climb the fence. I think about my cat and how is she going to take it. No one is going to take care of her when I'm gone. She will die of hunger. So I go back. I wish I could talk with anyone but I tire people out and it's understandable. I cannot expect for anyone to put on with my shit when they have their own problems. I don't wish that for anybody either. Sometimes I go to online listeners but sometimes I can't freely talk freely about what I think because they will either call the cops on me or they ban certain "way of speech" in their sites. I wish there was some kind of robot or AI I can talk so I don't feel like I'm being a burden everyday. Because even if no one says it I can see when they are getting tired of me and my everyday talk. How can they not. I'm like a scratch record just like many people.

At least I can talk about it hear, even if no one reads it I feel like I'm getting it out a little bit.
