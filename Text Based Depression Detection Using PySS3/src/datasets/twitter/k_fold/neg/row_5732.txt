TrappedI am trapped in a disgusting body, a miserable marriage, surrounded by acquaintance-friendship where I feel obligated to provide support and empathy but get none. I just want out and every person I know wants me to stay here to suffer. Everyone I know is a soulless vampire. Happy to see me suffer so they can get whatever from me. So I am fucking trapped. And no one acknowledges it. If I could get one person to admit to me that they donâ€™t want to be me and they would wanna die too I would be so happy. In the meantime, Iâ€™ll wait for when it will be a good time to shot myself even though I know it will never come. I am fucking trapped and it is not fair. I am physically a freak and I should get to die. I look like a horror movie without clothes. I should be have my desire to end my life respected. I shouldnâ€™t have to constantly give and give to people who give me nothing. I should, for once in my life, put myself and what I want first. I am sick of being invalidated. I have good reason, I own a gun, I know I am better off dead. I shouldnâ€™t have to feel trapped.
