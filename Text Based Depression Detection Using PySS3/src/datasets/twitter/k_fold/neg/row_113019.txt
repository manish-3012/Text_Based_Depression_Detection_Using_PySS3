My life is ruined so Ive decided to end my lifeI'm a serious alcoholic and have been trying to get clean for a year. I started off well, but 6 months ago I relapsed. My mom found out, so she called the cops on me. She firmly believes sitting in jail is the way to get me sober. Now I'm facing felony charges of assault. She made some bogus story up and they just believed her and arrested me despite there being no evidence what so ever. Im already on probation because I passed out in her yard about a year ago, so now I'm hopeless. I've been trying to stay positive, but the closer court comes the more depressed I get. I can't talk to anyone about my self harm or thoughts of killing myself without them calling the cops and me having to sit in the psych ward for a few days. I just can't stop thinking about that jail and how my future is fucked. Ive decided on a plan to kill myself, so now I just have to find the courage to do it.
