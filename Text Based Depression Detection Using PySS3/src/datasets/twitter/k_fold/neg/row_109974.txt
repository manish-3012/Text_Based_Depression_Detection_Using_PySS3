whats the point in living anymoreFor years I've been dealing with depression and i can't get over it. Every time something good happens to me its ripped away. My parents are the greatest thing to happen to me even though we argue all the time and im always a complete fuck up, they still love me. I don't have many friends at all i never did. Relationships are always terrible. Like the one im in now. i love this girl so much but not even 30 mins ago she texted that she doesn't know if shes ready for a relationship and said she would call me once she thought it through. Usually smart people would just walk away but not me.I crave attention and a relationship and im to scared to walk out of a toxic one because i fear i will never find someone again. It took me three years to finally trust people again and start looking for a new relationship. My last one ended in her fucking some of my friends. I failed out of boot camp because im a pussy. i failed out of college because of my cheating ex. I just started college again and i dont know if im still cut out for it. I failed my EMT test twice and when ever someone ask how it went i tell them im passed because im to scared to face the reality that im a total fuck up. I dont know what to do anymore. I might kill myself tonight who knows. If this is my last night and if my family some how finds this i want to say sorry its not your fault it never was. I love you and take care of yourselves.
