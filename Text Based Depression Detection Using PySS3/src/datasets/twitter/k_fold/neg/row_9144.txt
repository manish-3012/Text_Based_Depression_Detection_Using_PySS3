feels like a bad dreami just want to wake up. everything stressing me out rn is my fault for not being on top of it. nothing seems real and it's all far away. my anxiety makes me constantly second guessing every time i open my mouth. i wish that i had a support system but no one i know irl wants me to dump on them and i don't blame them. trying to stop constantly seeking validation but having a hard time. trying to apply myself and work for a future i want to live in but seems like maybe i'm just not good enough.
