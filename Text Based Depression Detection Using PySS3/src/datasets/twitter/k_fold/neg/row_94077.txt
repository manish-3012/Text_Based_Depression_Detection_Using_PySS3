I donâ€™t want to feel this pain anymoreBackground: Recently separated Navy veteran (2 years ago, no combat tours). 2 kids, 4 and 7. Currently going through CBT at the VA and on meds, but I feel like during therapy Iâ€™m ok. Itâ€™s when Iâ€™m alone and in my head that itâ€™s a downward spiral that I canâ€™t control. 90% disabled through the VA with 70% associated with Major Depression Disorder and Generalized Anxiety. If anything, I feel more depressed and more anxiety.

2 months ago my wife asked for a divorce. Due to financial circumstances and the fact that she doesnâ€™t have a job, we still have to live together. Iâ€™m miserable. Weâ€™ve had our share of ups and downs like many couples, but I know that I still love this woman. She does not feel the same, and seeing her everyday is making things worse and worse because sheâ€™s completely cold towards me. I donâ€™t have an option to get out, have no friends in this location as we just moved here in January and my time is split between going to work and coming right home to watch the kids while she goes out around the neighborhood skating and meeting people, who I have an overwhelming paranoia that she is badmouthing me around. My children are also hanging around these people. Also, family all lives in the other side of the country. 

Iâ€™m continuing to spiral and really donâ€™t want to feel this pain anymore. Iâ€™m alone. My thoughts about wanting to kill myself have been constant for the past 3 days. Today, Fathers Day has been unbearable. I continue to paint these pictures in my head that are getting more and more vivid. Iâ€™m going through the options like a decision making process and I have this analogy where itâ€™s like sitting down at a slot machine...if I sit down and pull the handle long enough Iâ€™ll eventually hit the jackpot. 

I want to die.
