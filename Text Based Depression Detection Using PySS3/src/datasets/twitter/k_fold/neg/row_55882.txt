I'm terrified of getting helpFirst, thank you for taking the time to read this.  Please excuse my bitching and complaining.

I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for years.  In the past several months they have become intolerable and I've made several attempts with pills.  My husband stopped me each time and threw away all of the medication in the house.  There have been a few more times where I was desperate to commit suicide but had no method.  So far, I've told my husband every time these thoughts and impulses come up.   He is the only reason I stay alive and attempt to make my life work.

There have been at least three times that I think I needed to go to a hospital.  However, I'm terrified of going.  I can't stand the thought of going to a hospital.  I have no idea what will happen while I'm there, who the other patients would be, what will happen when I get out, or how much it will cost.  I have no insurance and my husband and I only work 17.5 hours a week.  I'm terrified that the doctors won't care, will think that I'm a fake, and that I won't deserve to be there.  I don't think I deserve to go at all, but I'm not getting better.

I need help but I don't know how to get it.  I can't afford anything.  I don't think I deserve help because deep down I feel like a phony.  What do I do?

Edit: Thank you for the help and the suggestions!
