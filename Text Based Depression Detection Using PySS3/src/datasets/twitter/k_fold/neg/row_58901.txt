Im secretly going to kill myself soonIve stooped very low again, trying to contact people from my past to blame them for my depression. Im so sick of being angry, the feeling of being less worthy, jealousy, so sick of it.. Iâ€™m not going to change, iâ€™ll just stay fat on my room depressed if i dont do anything. Thereâ€™s no way im gonna fix my life, thereâ€™s nothing positive bc ive become fat and ugly and no one likes to be around me
