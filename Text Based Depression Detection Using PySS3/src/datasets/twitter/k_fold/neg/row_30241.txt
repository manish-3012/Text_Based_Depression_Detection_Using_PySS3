I tried to kill myself yesterdayYesterday, I took seven Valiums and drank about half a bottle of Don Q. Today, I woke up, realized I was still alive, and cried. All I want to do is die. The only friend I have has decided they have better things to do than to worry about me and I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Please help me.
