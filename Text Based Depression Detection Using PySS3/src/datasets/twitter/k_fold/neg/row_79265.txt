i cant keep doing thisthe whole life thing, it just seems so pointless. ive been through quite a lot. in my opinion, ive been through enough. i dont know what im gonna do. the thought of killing myself has crossed my mind a lot recently and ive done my best to ignore it but its always there, in the back of my mind. i cant shake it. ive even noticed me acting much more impulsively lately. without even thinking i try and do something that could hurt me, and ive been lucky its only been little things every now and then. giving myself a small paper cut for example. i have a rubber band on my wrist that i flick myself with whenever the thought crosses my mind and it seems to be helping so i guess i'll do that untill it doesnt stop me. theres so much to write so i guess i'll stop being a little bitch and end this here.

tl;dr, im really heckin sad
