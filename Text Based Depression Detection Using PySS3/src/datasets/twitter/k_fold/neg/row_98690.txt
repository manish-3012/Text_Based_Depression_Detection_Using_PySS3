I just cant get over my obsession. Like a tumour it is a part of me. It grows and grows and it cannot be killed.I am obsessed with writing. I have no talent. I ruin and destriy all the ideas I love so dearly every single day. I want to kill this sick, twisted creativity center in my brain. I want to be like everybody else and not think about these things, or question the world. I want to feel happy and be normal. But how can you murder your passion? We are inseperable. I love you writing, even though you hurt me so much. I want to leave you but you wont let me. I just want it to stop
