im tired.i (13f) am so tired. i havent even gone through a lot, which makes me feel like i dont even belong here. im just so tired. waking up every day to go to school, barely passing, and talking to the same three friends every day. its mediocre. every day i stare at the clock and beg for it to be over. sleeping is my only carefree escape. i dont want to waste the rest of my life being an accountant, working a 9-5 job, married to some douchebag with three children in a small town. im ungrateful for what i have, or rather what i havent experienced.  i just dont want to dig my family into debt if i do die. i dont think i needed any advice. maybe i just needed to vent. i dunno. if anyone out there feels the same, im sorry. have a good day.
