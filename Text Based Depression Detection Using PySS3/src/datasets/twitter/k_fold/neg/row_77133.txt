You don't have to go through everything aloneI just wanted to let anyone who is feeling like they might want to harm themselves know that you don't have to deal with your feelings alone. I kept my suicidal thoughts to myself all throughout highschool. I was ashamed, and afraid that I would be told that my feelings were unwarranted, that I was weak, and that others had it much worse than I did. This resulted me in very nearly going through with it. Recently, certain life events led me to once again feel suicidal; however, I finally spoke up to my parents and my friends. I also sought out professional help, and it is amazing how much easier it has been to deal with things. I just wanted to say that you don't have to be alone.
