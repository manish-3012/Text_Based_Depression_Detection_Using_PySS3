What to do before killing yourselfSo I'm gonna be killing myself very soon and just wanted to know about any plans to do before doing it.
I've attempted a few times before but this time it will work 100%

I already have some plans
I'm gonna delete some social accounts, hang out with friends and family before the big day, I definitely have to write something (Dont know what though), clean my room, fix myself up a bit to look good at the funeral. 

I have a lot of other thoughts that I feel like talking about but at the same time I dont want anyone to prevent me from doing this. Honestly I've always wanted to die at a young age and now is my chance.


wwyd?
