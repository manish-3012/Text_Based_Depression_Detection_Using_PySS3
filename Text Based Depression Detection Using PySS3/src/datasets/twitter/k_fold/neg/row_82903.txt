Would you consider my suicide justified?I've been lethargic my entire post-pubescent life.  A year ago I really stopped caring about anything.  I dropped out of school.  I was a recluse for about year up to this point.  I was living alone, and I tried to kill myself.  I really fucked up my liver, and I stayed in bed for three days straight.  I haven't told anyone about this.

After the failed attempt when sitting in bed, I was ambivalent about either shooting myself or seeing if I could put something together.  I decided to wait one year before considering suicide again, and I would force myself to put effort into my life.

One year has nearly passed.  I moved to a new city.  I forced myself to make friends and to go out often. I dated three girls.  I still have to pretend.  I still don't care.

I re-entered school and dropped out again.  I got a new job and quit it.  I had thought doing a job I felt was worthwhile would help, so I got a job in research.  However, my apathy lingered.

I've never considered myself happy nor sad in my adult life.  I don't think hell exists, so I'm not concerned with going there.  I wouldn't be leaving anyone any debts because I paid them.

I'm 25, and I think I've given it a fair shot.  I'd like to know what you think.
