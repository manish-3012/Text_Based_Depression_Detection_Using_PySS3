I tried to commit suicideCouple months ago, I tried to OD on pills, and got sent to the hospital and into a stress center. And things have been going better as of late, got diagnosed with ADD, taking meds for that, doing a little better in school. But I still find myself thinking and feeling negatively. I just feel like life is meaningless you know? We are born alone, we live alone, then we die alone. At least for me I guess.
