I think last night was my last nightI think today will be my last day. Iâ€™m feeling so very low and worthless. I turned my messages off and my phone so nobody can reach me.. they donâ€™t reach out to me anyway. But Iâ€™ve never wanted to disappear this much before. It used to scare me before and Iâ€™m still a bit scared but Iâ€™m coming to terms with the fact that nobody wants me around and they donâ€™t appreciate me nor love me. Iâ€™ve been rejected so many times over and over and today is my last day dealing with this pain. 


I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even typing this out ... maybe because when you write something out it becomes real. I want to disappear. Iâ€™m going to eat some wings today, have some wine and go on with it. Goodbye.
