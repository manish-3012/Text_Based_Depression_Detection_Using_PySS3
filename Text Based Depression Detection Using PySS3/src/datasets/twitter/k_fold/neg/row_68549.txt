I screwed up and I know things would be better without meA few years ago when my kid was 3 I tried to kill myself. I knew that was my chance to do it before it was too traumatising for him, and before I had done too much damage.

Obviously I failed and decided to stick around. My kid is now 6 and Iâ€™ve done so much damage to him. Iâ€™ve yelled at him on occasion, but worst is that Iâ€™m not always able to control my emotions around him. Sometimes he pushes and pushes and I get angry, even though I try hard not to. My mental health takes so much out of me that sometimes I canâ€™t spend one-on-one time with him, and it shows.

And Iâ€™m angry because I knew this would happen, thatâ€™s why I wanted to do it then, and now itâ€™s too late. I canâ€™t kill myself because  it would be too traumatic for him, but Iâ€™ve ruined his life and I donâ€™t want to do more damage.

And all these people say they will help - that if things are bad to just reach out, but I reach out and they never take me seriously. I ask for help and they never give it.

And I just want to die, but now Iâ€™m stuck. And worst of all Iâ€™ve ruined the life of the person I love most in the world.
