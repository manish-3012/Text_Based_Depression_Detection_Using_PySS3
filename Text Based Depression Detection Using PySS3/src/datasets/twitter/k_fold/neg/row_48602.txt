Am coming down from a manic episode, afraid I am doomed, again.I had a bad phase last month where I nearly killed myself, ended up in a psych ward, and got out 11 days later. After getting out, I had some new appreciation for everything I could see. I was excitable at work, happy to wake up, insanely energetic, and even felt like I could happily do something like break my arm. Just to pass time if i was bored. I actually wanted to, it felt exciting. I've never experience something like that before but it felt so good. As of this week, I can feel my energy getting lower and lower. I dont feel excited, dont enjoy things, dont feel powerful, and some bad thoughts are beginning to come back. I feel like I am going on a downward spiral that will just end in another hospital visit, or death.
