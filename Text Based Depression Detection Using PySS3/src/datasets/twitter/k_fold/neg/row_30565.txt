The More Research I Put Into Suicide The More Scared I GetI want to kill myself before the summer ends.

I've never put this much thought into actually going through it, but after researching shooting myself, drugs, etc. the more I learn how painful and how long it takes to actually kill you.

Does this scare anyone else? I just want to die, I don't want to feel this extreme pain. Even a successful gun shot wound still takes a minute or two before you fully die, experiencing intense pain the whole time.

I don't know what to do. I want to die but I don't want to experience all this pain.
