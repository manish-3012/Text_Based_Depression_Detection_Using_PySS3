Idk Iâ€™m a big messHello. Major depression/GAD since age 12, but only medicated on and off for a few years now (currently on). I have two semesters left in college and I am once again having an existential career crisis. I have severe imposter syndrome to the point where I physically feel like my success is not my own. I have stellar grades and good opportunities ahead of me and yet it just...wasnâ€™t me. Iâ€™m convinced whatever I do with my life Iâ€™m going to fail. Throughout my entire life Iâ€™ve dealt with people who on a surface level are my friend but then all hang out together without me or only hang out with me if I ask them myself. At some point you start asking yourself what youâ€™re doing wrong. I want to give up so badly; my family is the single reason why I havenâ€™t done it yet.
