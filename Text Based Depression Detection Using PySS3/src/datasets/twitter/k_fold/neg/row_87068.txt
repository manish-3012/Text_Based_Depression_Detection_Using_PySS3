I guess I need support or advice from youI never was clear about my life or my feels to anyone in real life. I was visiting psychologist a ton of times, but I never was clear to him. I never asked for support, but I feel like I need it so fucking much. 

Right now I am 16. I have suicidal thoughts for year and a half now. A year ago my step-father told me to gtfo from my mom's apartments. Currently I am living alone at my grandma's apartments, because she is old and lives with other grandma for 2 years already. I never had friends, girlfriend or at least someone in my life. My mom didnt gave a fuck about me, dad is autistic and has his own problems, so he also doesnt care about me. I dont have a job or at least some hobby. I am so fucking tired. I just started crying.

When I firstly beaten those thoughts I thought like if Ill wait, something is gonna happen in my life. This is stupid, I know. I actually feel like I am stupid. So a year and a half have passed and nothing happened. I guess I will jump of a cliff in silence somewhere far away from my town this summer. 

My life doesn't have a point. I don't have a hobby, a work, someone I would like to live for. Well I do have pillow seal, but realising that he is the only one who I can treat as a friend or anyone like that feels very sad.

Thanks for reading my post, my seal and I wish you the best
