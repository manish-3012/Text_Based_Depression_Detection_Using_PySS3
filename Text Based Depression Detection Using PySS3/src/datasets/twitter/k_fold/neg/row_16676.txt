Depression has aged me drasticallyI have physical pains constantly, I look like utter shit and have 0 energy. My self-esteem is lower than the pits of hell. I have zero friends in real life, don't have family (they're toxic and narcissistic).I don't know how much longer I can take living a miserable life like this.
