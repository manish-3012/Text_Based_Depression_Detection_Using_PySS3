Buddhist said Living is SufferingMy Life is such a mess now. I own about $2k in various credit card debts, own my Mom $700 and medical bill about $1500. My income is not very steady and maybe $1k a month. I have to pay for my own phone bill, rent and utility bills and I just couldn't save up any money at all no matter what. When I used to work two jobs and make great money, I didnt know what to spend my money on, I used to gamble and frequent strip clubs very often but then I met this girl, she took away eight years of my life, I went from driving a $40k car to $12k used car, tons of credit card debt and at the end got nothing to show for, when she found some Japanese guy on Japan okcupid then married him and left me high and dry. Took me two years to get back on my feet and start living steadily again then Luck would have it, I met another girl who wasted six years of my life, but this time I thought I know better and not repeat the same mistake again but she played me like a fiddle and now I am emotionally and finacially crippled. I hate my life at this point when all my friends seem to find a very great girl/wife and having kids and settle down or get their dream job and having an amazing career while I am working dead end jobs and living paycheck to paycheck. I would never get back those 14 years of my life no matter what, I hate those two wench who ruined my life and lead me on from the very beginning. I don't know what did I ever do in my past life to deserve this. So every night now I go to sleep and hoping I won't wake up in the morning.
