If anyone needs to talk, I am here for youHey guys. If any of you are going through a really dark time, or need to talk to someone I am here for you, any of you, whenever. 

So just a bit of back story on who I am. Just like a lot of you guys, I am suicidal myself. My past has been a very troubling one, with abuse, bullying and rape. I was hid from everything and icolated from the world all the time, I didn't know what was real or fake. 

I self harm, because I find pleasure from it. Im not one of these people who do it constantly, I make a few bad cuts, dont do it for a couple months and relapse again. But I have been through constant self harm last year. So I have bits of both. 

I have attempted many times, My last attempt was about two months ago when I tried to slit my wrists. I failed. I also had another attempts in January when I overdosed and was sent to hospital because of it. 

I have been diagnosed with BPD, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, And others which I cant remember. 

So enough about that. I just wanted to tell you that so you know I understand what you are going through, and to try and convince you that I am trustworthy of talking to you if you need to. 

So come and say hi. Whatever you need help with I can. I am not judgemental so dont worry about that. 

Thank you
