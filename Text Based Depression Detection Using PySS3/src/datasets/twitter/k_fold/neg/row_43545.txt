College Grad Messed Up Her Life, Thinking About Ending ItI'm 23 and I fucked up my life. Big time. I thought that I was doing everything right...going to college on scholarship and earning a B.S. in Genetics and graduating with a 3.3. I wanted to go to med school, but was too scared to take out the loans. So I took 2 sales jobs after college that didn't pan out. The first one I took was because it was the first job that was offered to me. I found out I would be commission-only in a year. I left that for corporate IT sales making 25K base plus commission because I thought it would be a better opportunity...it wasn't. I have never felt so stuck and so sad in my life, even growing up with one stepdad who passed from cancer, and another who was an abusive drug addict.  I will be starting my Master's in Teaching this month, along with a Graduate Assistantship position, but I do not feel like living anymore. I've been unemployed for a couple months because my former company found out about my plans for school and said it was bad for business, lost my unemployment, am getting my car repossessed, and am out of money, since I blew my savings trying to save and eventually put down my cat. I have very few friends and not much of a family. My mom has severe bipolar disorder and has converted to orthodox Judaism. When her and I do talk, all she does is yell at me for fucking up and having "ADHD" (her diagnosis). She told me she doesn't care if I'm out on the streets. Please someone just talk to me. I feel like I shouldn't end things when I know teaching is what I want to do and I do have a good opportunity coming up, but it's so hard even getting up in the morning. These last two years have been horrific, and I don't know how much more I can take.
