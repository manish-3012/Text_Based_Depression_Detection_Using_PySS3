Suicidal thoughtsI've been depressed for at least 1 year now, some thoughts of suicide for the last 4-5 years with it getting more frequent in the last year. I thought if I at least got my two year degree I'd be happy, I thought if I landed a better paying job with upward mobility I'd be happy, i thought buying a sports car would make me happy even at the risk of being kicked out of my parents house. I thought moving out would make me happy. But none of it felt worth it, I'm not doing well financially because of the sports car and my expenses tripling, but this doesn't make me want to kill myself. I know things will get better but it doesn't feel like it's worth it to go through it all to get there. I cant see the light at the end of the tunnel but I'm trying and it's not enough. I feel insatiable
