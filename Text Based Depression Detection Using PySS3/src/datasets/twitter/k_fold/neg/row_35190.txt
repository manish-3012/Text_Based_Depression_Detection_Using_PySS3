I'm tired of living this painful life (chronic pain is slowly killing me)I have really bad chronic pain such as fibromyalgia, stage 4 endometriosis and the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis. My whole body is on fire &amp;it feels like someone poured acid all over me. It's hard for me to hold anything with my hands. Doctors don't care, and they think I'm just a drug addict. I'm tired of living in pain, I've tried everything. I'm in a cold bath right now &amp; I wish I could drown myself, I can't stand living like this. It never gets better, and doctors don't care. I'm tired I'm not getting the proper treatment and can't even go to the doctor's office because they're closed because of the virus. I don't want to look this life anymore in pain. I'm done.
I can't get out of bed without using my walker and my feet curl up, and my toes too. My hands feel like someone lit my hands on fire and it's hard to hold anything. Like even an empty glass I'll drop it and shatter it because I'm so weak in my hands. My hip hurts I had a really bad hip injury back in 2017 and it cracks all the time, sometimes it fuses. I can't live like this longer, I want to be put on my misery just like how animals get euthanized when they're in long-term pain. I can't even type, I'm using voice to text because typing hurts my fingers. I wish doctors would believe how much pain I'm in but they don't!
