I Feel Like ShitI canâ€™t make any friends, and most of the time I really donâ€™t want to. Iâ€™m usually fine with being alone, but sometimes Iâ€™ll get the desire for human connection and feel lonely and have low self esteem. The problem is that people are so boring to talk to, and when ever I want to talk about something Iâ€™m really interested in, usually Philosophy or Science, the person Iâ€™m talking to usually wonâ€™t understand or get defensive and tell me to stop talking about it. Yeah, asshole, I did stop talking about it and now I have no fucking friends. No one cares. Canâ€™t wait to fucking die.
