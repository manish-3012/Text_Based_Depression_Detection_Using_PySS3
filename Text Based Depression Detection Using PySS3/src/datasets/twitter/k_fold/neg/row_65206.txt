Suicide is just indirect murder.It might not be attributable to one individual, but it isn't nature or circumstance that does it, it's other people. It might be family, others we know personally, groups, social structures, or society as a whole. Regardless, you're not killing yourself, you're being killed by the mistreatment of others. 

It might not kill you immediately either. Rarely in war are there these single climactic battles that begin and end it all. It can be one battle where the losses are too high, where a side fails to recover, where the initiative is lost and the dynamic shifts. 

The way you treat others matters. Don't add to the burden, decrease it.
