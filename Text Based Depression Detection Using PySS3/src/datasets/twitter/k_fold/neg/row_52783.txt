Iâ€™m currently studying theatreMy grades are shit but i doubt this will take me anywhere. At least it helps me pretend like Iâ€™m not depressed. I try to forget depressed. Iâ€™m only alive because of Rainbow Six Siege because I wanna see all the upcoming dlc and Iâ€™m addicted to it. Already had a suicide attempt. Couldnâ€™t do it. Noose is too hard to tie. It was a shitty rope anyways. Btw i live in Mexico and go to school in the US. Life is so boring and dull. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this. Probably cuz itâ€™s 2 am and i have insomnia. Iâ€™ll probably regret this later.
