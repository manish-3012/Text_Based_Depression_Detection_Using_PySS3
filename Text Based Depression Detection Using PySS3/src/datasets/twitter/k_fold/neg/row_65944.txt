Spent thousands on a vacation to end it all. I'm ready to die.I just purchased plane tickets to three different states for this summer. I did this because I was told that if I was truly suicidal that I should atleast enjoy my last days on Earth. I am. And there is no going back now. I just want to enjoy my last few months on Earth. I put my two weeks into both my jobs and college is ending soon where I might attend a 4 year if I can even get in. 

Everyone has hurt me. I'm not kidding. I've been called "creepy" or "that weird girl." I've tried talking to therapists, to no avail. Have tried those hotlines as well. They literally just ask for your postal code and tell you it's going to be okay. What a goddamn joke. 

I'm a 19 year old girl. And honestly, broken. I don't really see a future for me. I have no family (I'm being abused at home by my brother and my mother), my dad is far away with some random girl, my friends no longer need me (I've come straight out and told them I wanted to kill myself) and they just do what people do best... They disappear... Or they say I'll be here. Then they disappear. I've even tried being there for them. Strangers come up to me and tell me I'm creepy or gross. People have hurt me. I don't want to continue suffering anymore. 

The thing is, I don't want a funeral. I don't want people to act like they gave a crap about me and get to be "sad" when I'm dead. They don't deserve to mourn. 

I'm going to Jacksonville, North Carolina,\_ Orlando, Florida,\_ and Texas. Is there another pretty state I can add before I hang myself? I figured go with hanging so I can atleast experience DMT and the euphoria that comes with death. Pills cause vomit, and gunshot is too messy. I plan on being an organ doner so maybe I'll fill up my tub with ice so other people can survive. 

I hate people. But I'm altruistic. Welcome to the enigma that is my brain.
