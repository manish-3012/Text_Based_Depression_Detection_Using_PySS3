Apathy x ZillionsI can't seem to do anything. I keep procrastinating everything, as in, almost even this. It's like I'm unable to start anything, there's some mental block that's afraid of doing anything. 

So, I've put off work and uni for a few months now, pretty sure I'm fired and failing out. I have no idea what to do and I keep piling the stress on.
