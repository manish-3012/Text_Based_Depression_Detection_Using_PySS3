I still feel alone.Lately I've been feeling like everything and everyone around me annoy me. That every one is fake, that they only care about themselves. And that no one cares about me. I have a boyfriend, who is one of the few people I actually talk to that aren't a part of my family. But sometimes I also get this feeling from him. That he doesn't care about me. That he'll leave. That I am a burden for him. That I'm not good enough... And I live in this constant fear of losing him. Lots of people will view me as ungrateful and self-centered. That's okay, deep down I know that to be true. I'm not doing so well in life because I'm lazy, although I have the opportunities. I'm not special, I'm not good at anything, I don't have a special talent, I'm not hard-working, nothing. So sometimes I think. Would someone actually miss me if I disappeared? Would it make a difference? I feel like I'm useless and just a burden for everyone, and I can't move out of this

I'm sorry for the messy text. I just needed to let it out. I have no friends that I can talk to, and I can't tell this to my boyfriend. Thank you for reading...
