Uni is making me so suicidalWatching all my friends and course mates find uni easy and enjoyable while I'm struggling so much makes me want to kill myself. I have no passion for my course and everything is too difficult for me. I don't want to drop out because then I'd get kicked out by parents and there goes my financial support and can't even get a part time job because no one wants to hire a student with zero experience. I'm not passionate or ambitious about anything and it feels like my life is falling apart. I hate it so much. I wish I was dead.
