Needed to say this.Itâ€™s strange how people act when they know theyâ€™re suicidal. Like if your life is at its worst point personally, and you know itâ€™s just a matter of time before you end it allâ€¦itâ€™s not *all* dramatic. You may be dramatic about it or your going-ons in the dayâ€¦but itâ€™s not at all the thoughts that are dramatic.

The thoughts are pretty simple. Itâ€™s strange because itâ€™s almost empathetic. *â€œHow do I kill myself with it being the most convenient (or least bit intrusive) for someone else?â€*

Iâ€™ll give you an example. If I wanted to kill myself, letâ€™s say in the way that Iâ€™m going to be dramatic about it, by \*\***Trigger Warning - Graphic**\*\*&gt;!slashing my wrists!&lt;â€¦ Iâ€™d do it but then Iâ€™d have to think about the carpeting upstairs. Like blood barely comes off clothes easily when there's a huge stain, how the hell is it going to get out of the carpet? Thatâ€™s a whole upholstery cost and recarpeting the room is just going to be a bitch for whoever. Thatâ€™s why you sometimes have to do some creative thinking. *â€œHey! I could do it in the bathtub!â€*

But then you think *â€œMan, thatâ€™sâ€¦I mean I guess that works but itâ€™s uncomfortable and you have to drain it and people use that tub to shower, you think carpeting costs are high do you know how much it costs to replace a bathtub?â€*

I donâ€™t. But I imagine itâ€™s quite a bit. I think it stems from the fact that to be suicidal itâ€™s not that youâ€™re devoid of all emotion. Youâ€™re really empathetic to your own situation in a very self-absorbed, self-aware, sympathetic way. Like the pain and misery that this person feels you feel directly, and you wish you could help with the clichÃ© suggested way of things but thatâ€™s not going to help. Thatâ€™s likeâ€¦trying to wash dishes with dirty dishwater. I mean, I guess it might clean it but damn, itâ€™s not ideal and why do it just to get the dishes all dirty anyway.

Instead you become empathetic to the all of it. The situation but also the thoughts and feelings. You understand, just as you would standing at the memorial service (if youâ€™re so lucky to have one) of a another fellow of the **What Are We, Some Kind of Suicide Squadâ„¢** Club. You know, that feeling of â€œWell, I meanâ€¦I guess I understand why heâ€™d do it.â€

What Iâ€™m trying to say is â€“ that moment when you think to yourself *â€œDamn, who would want to live like that?â€* crosses the feeling of *â€œWho can ever live like this?â€* is where you get the final nail in the coffin of the decision to do it. *â€œWhy should I keep living like this?â€*

The only difference between the suicidal people and the people that decide to move, get a hair cut, change their outfits, and maybe their phone number, is thatâ€¦well honestly itâ€™s just too much work. Meh. Rather kill myself than have to explain to that older lady at work why I thought itâ€™d be a good idea to get frosted tips at 25.

The thing is, anytime anyone actually goes through with it, it really does feel like a loss. You feel the potential they had to become someone, something big even. And thatâ€™s because the people that do go through with it arenâ€™t actually lazy people. Theyâ€™re not at all. Theyâ€™re people that can have accomplishments, goals, aspirations, and the motivation and drive to actually achieve them. They have before and they prove it to you again with this one final exit of achievement. Truth is, itâ€™s the failures that canâ€™t do it, canâ€™t go through with it, and so desperately wish they could that are lazy.

Unmotivated to achieve anything in life, and unwilling to do anything about it to change. Even if that change involves just ending it, so you know there arenâ€™t going to be any further things to do afterwards. Man, the only thing worse than people that are suicidal are those that are just failures in life. Like bottom of the barrel trash.

Good people, people with goals and the personal means and will to achieve them are the ones we feel sorry for because they can go through with it. The guy standing in the crowd feeling sorry for himself wondering when heâ€™s next? Meh, who cares. Call me when you do something about it, otherwise fuck off.

Youâ€™re just a dramatic, hyper aware, failure of a human being right now. Do something about it, and then people will notice. Otherwise shut up, swallow some vali-zo-pro-loft or whatever and join the rest of the world who inevitably have it worse than you from the get go. Wish I was the first kind, but it sucks that being part of that hyper aware crew. Iâ€™m at least aware enough to know suicide isnâ€™t right for me. Iâ€™m just a failure, so here I go again for another year or decade, thinking that maybe Iâ€™ll do it but inevitably just posting here or something hoping whoever it is will notice and at least, for a little while, a human connection will be made between us. Just even for the fact that hey, using dirty dishwater to clean your dishes is still something instead of just breaking the dishes all together.

Man. I hate doing the dishes.
