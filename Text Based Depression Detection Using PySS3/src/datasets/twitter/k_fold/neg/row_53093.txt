A three day breakdown and ready to jumpI'm sick of this shit. I can't self soothe, I'm not in a situation where I can and even if i could i can't even remember any of the stuff I dont care anymore I guess I'm just lucky that I only have one person in my life who would miss me friends are overrated right. Fuck existing
