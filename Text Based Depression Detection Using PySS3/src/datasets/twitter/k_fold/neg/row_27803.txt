It's all a big beautiful lie"I love you", so please don't kill yourself because I will feel scoop guilty 

"You mean everything to me", til I realize that I'm talking to YOU after all and I get bored. Can't you be a different kind of person?

"You have so much to offer", I mean, you MIGHT, but I really don't expect much to come from your existence but PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME FEEL BAD BY KILLING YOURSELF :(

Everyone is lying to me continuously anytime I'm spoken to. I know my place and where I stand and I hate it, so I want to be done here.
