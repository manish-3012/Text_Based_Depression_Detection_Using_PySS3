Just felt like saying something :)To all of you who have been told you're not sick enough to have whatever mental illness your doctor diagnosed you with , by a skeptical relative or friend .

To those of you who've wondering if your mental illness is easier than say someone with schizophrenia or something that causes obvious symptoms like that.

No matter what anyone says , you are valid , your illness is valid and most important what you feel is valid .

No one ever told me this , so I figured I owed it to you guys to say it.

Stay strong everyone , you have loved ones , maybe some of you have a belief in a higher power . Whatever the reason , it's always possible to find one single reason to keep going.
