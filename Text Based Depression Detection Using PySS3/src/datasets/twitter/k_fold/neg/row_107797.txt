life is a cruel jokecurrently ive given up. its too big of a step for me. im afraid to change. i feel like a freak. i feel like i don't belong. i wish i didn't exist. i have bad thoughts throughout the day that make me even more sad. sexual thoughts i completely hate and despise. i feel like it's a sick joke. i honestly don't want to really exist, i am a cruel joke. i feel incomplete, undeveloped and i feel like it's too late to change. you might say its not but i feel like its too far. i hate living with myself. i dont understand. every night is pretty horrible. i hate and berate myself. ive made too many mistakes. unfortunately there's no easy way to die. its sick how im going through this. it just had to be me. im tired. im not going to commit suicide but this is how i manage to stay alive i think. i dont feel suicidal i don't actually want to die but i want to escape or quit. life is a cruel joke.


i dont deserve anything.
