I wish nobody would careI wish that nobody would care if I died. The only reason other than my cowardice that I won't kill myself is that I don't want to be even more of a burden. It would make death so much easier if people just wouldn't even notice. Because I wish I could be done with people and the world and everything that fucking messes with me. The world always seems to trick me into being happy for half a day, then rubs shit in my face for a week.
I've never cut myself, so nobody thinks I need help, but I never cut myself because physical pain never actually hurt me. I'm always insulting myself, making myself cry, then I'm pretending I'm fine. I can't go on like that. I can't live like this anymore, and I'm too much of a coward to kill myself or ask for help. What am I supposed to do? Wait for my Prince charming? As if.
The reason I'm posting this is that I can't bottle this stuff up anymore. I did it so much that I'm pretty sure I'm making myself go insane. There's so much in my head that even I don't know what secrets I'm keeping. 
Now that I've considerably rambled, sorry for ruining your day and I hope you're not on this sub because you're like me or worse than me. &lt;3
