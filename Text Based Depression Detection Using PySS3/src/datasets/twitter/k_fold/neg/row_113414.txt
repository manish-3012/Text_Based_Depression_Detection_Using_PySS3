I feel worse as time goes onI feel like throwing away everything I have so I could live on the streets or in a forest. I know that sounds inconsiderate because there are people out there looking to get off the street, I just need to lose myself and change the way I live. I hate my life, always have. Spend most of my nights wide awake not being able to sleep just thinking of ways to kill myself. I donâ€™t know what is wrong with me, itâ€™s like cancer and I cannot seem to get rid of these feelings I have. Iâ€™ve slept in apartment hallways before, I should have no problem living out there but Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™ll end up on drugs like I used to be. Sounds silly right? Iâ€™m literally suicidal why would I care? Iâ€™m not rich... and when I dont have any drugs Iâ€™d feel worse than I already do. Iâ€™ve also been clean for a couple years, other than pot and alcohol. I quit smoking cigarettes too, Iâ€™m sure as soon as I hit the streets Iâ€™ll be smoking again unfortunately. The real killer is my mind though... I feel as if I was born to die, whatever I have that is good usually turns to shit, and itâ€™s my own fault most of the time. I tend to fuck everything up, and when I say everything, I mean the whole bottle of it, every last drop.
Iâ€™m really hard on myself, I feel like I couldâ€™ve been better and shouldâ€™ve done things differently. My whole life is full of regret, and not a day goes by without me dwelling on all the mistakes Iâ€™ve made. I do not sleep, Iâ€™ve gone days without it. I donâ€™t believe in a god or a devil but I feel like when Iâ€™m alone, they smother me, So sleep is out of the question. One thing I love to do is writing, I consider myself not very smart compared to others, but writing helps me find myself. Without it Iâ€™d put a gun to my head by now, with all these thoughts I have. I love everybody but unfortunately Iâ€™m a bastard, Iâ€™ve done pretty shitty things in my life time. This isnâ€™t a confession or church so Iâ€™ll keep that to myself. I just hate who Iâ€™ve become. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it to 30... let alone 25.
