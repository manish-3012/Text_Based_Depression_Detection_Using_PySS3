Iâ€™m depressed because of my bodyBeing an adult guy whoâ€™s really underweight(102 lbs) is making me feel so depressed. I try eating more but I get full really easily so I quickly lose my appetite to keep shoving food in my mouth. It also doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m genetically skinny due to my family, which means I was born with a really small frame. Iâ€™ve remained the same size pretty much throughout my entire life. I donâ€™t know what to do. Is it hopeless? It feels like Iâ€™ll never be able to gain weight and get muscle.
