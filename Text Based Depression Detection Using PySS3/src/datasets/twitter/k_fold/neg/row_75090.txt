How I was able to dig my way out of depression. I used to struggle to be happy on a daily basis. I got to a point where all I could think of was suicide. I was extremely socially awkward, anxious, depressed, losing weight, everything bad.

One day I swallowed my pride and talked to a family member about it (I kept it secret from everybody) they gave me emotional support and from that one discussion I somehow found the courage I needed to change my outlook. Just like that I felt revived. The family member gave me some expensive Vitamin B complex which is suppose to help with depression, anxiety, fatigue and memory loss. So maybe it was that. But in that day I became happy and I've been happy ever since. That was 5 weeks ago.

I used to smoke weed every single day for 6 years, but since I became happy I just don't see a need for it. Before, I couldn't imagine life without it, I NEEDED it to wind down and relax at the end of the day. Now, I am content with life, happy. My head is stable and I don't reach such lows that I did, so weed just doesn't seem useful to me anymore. I'm clear-headed, can remember shit, I can talk to anyone without feeling any bit of awkward what-so-ever and this has already gotten me 3 dates in the past 5 weeks from ladies who have hit on me and I haven't gotten a date in almost 3 years before that! Weed is great, but it can make matters worse if your not in a good head-space.

If you're depressed, talk to someone, it can really do wonders to have someone you can sit down with and really get to the bottom of it all. I avoided it for years, thinking nobody would want to hear my sob story, but people are willing to help if you really show that you need it (IE open up to them). Also, give Vitamin B complex a chance, you may just be malnourished and feel like shit from that. I'm no doctor but it's worth a try. From what I've read, if your even slightly deficiant it can cause issues.
