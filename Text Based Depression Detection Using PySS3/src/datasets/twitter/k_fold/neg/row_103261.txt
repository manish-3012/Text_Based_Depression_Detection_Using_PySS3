A Rabbits End  

I have gone long and far to live this life as my own, I have thrown away my shot and fought on every front there was to be fought on , drank every drink cried every tear broke every heart and laughed every smile. I no longer have any wish to continue this life of cursed misery, existence is pain and I no longer wish to feel pain. I may be a martyr to some and a fool to most but if even one man gets the message the heralds of my death brings then it will all have been worth it. I blame not those who wronged me or those who continue to reside in the bellows of my heart, my death was a fate of my own choosing which I had chosen from the day I first too my steps on this mortal plane. I donâ€™t know whether I was right yesterday or today, I donâ€™t know who I am or who I was, the only linking chain between all these meâ€™s residing in my mind is the connecting sorrow and devastation that seems to follow me in every step I take. The pain Is too great, I bid you good bye and hope you use me to live a better life. had I taken time I would have wrote an essay of bullshit the meaning of which would be lost in translation from my world to yours, my final message, the one before the rope elopes with my throat, is a rushed series of words I typed without thinking, rushing to the next word with no time for pondering I type this faster then my hands can go to the next key, to draw on the words I know I should say but think too much to say. Ive said all I could and I canâ€™t go on, Iâ€™m sorry my love for I am gone.
