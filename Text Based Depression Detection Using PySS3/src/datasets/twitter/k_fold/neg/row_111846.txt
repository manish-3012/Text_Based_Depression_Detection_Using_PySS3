I kinda like that my habits are killing me.I think I've had passive ideation most of my life, but I can finally feel the affects of it. Of course I'm too much of a pussy to actually kill myself, but I feel like my picking up smoking and doing drugs will either kill me or snap me out of whatever shit I'm in. I understand the impact my life has on others, but god damn am I ready to just be done. My entire life has been filled with shitty circumstance and bad luck, maybe it's a sign?
