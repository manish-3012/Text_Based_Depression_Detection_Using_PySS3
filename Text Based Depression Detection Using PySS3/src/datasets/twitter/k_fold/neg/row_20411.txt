Serious question for everyoneI have felt like I am just tired of living for the last couple months. I can't really understand why I feel like that.   I have a stable career, a beautiful wife that loves me and I love back, and on paper, it would seem that I am living a wonderful life. 

I have been taking Wellbutrin for the last few years, and it has definitely helped.  I always feel this sense of despair and hopelessness following me, but I am afraid to talk about it with my wife because I am not sure what is causing it, and I don't want her to think that she has anything to do with it.  

I just don't know what to do anymore.  The feelings get a little worse each day, but I am afraid to see a psychiatrist out of fear about my work finding anything out. 

I could not go through with suicide because my wife has already lost the rest of her family in tragic ways.  She has always been supportive of me even when I was in crippling debt and helped me build the life we have together. 

What can I do?  I read these posts and they always seem like the people have a reason to feel the way they do.  I don't really have anything to complain about, but here I am feeling hopeless but without reason. 

Thanks for listening to me. I guess I just need someone to talk to that does not know me.
