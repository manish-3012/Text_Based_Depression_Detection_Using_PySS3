You know the end is close when you're looking for it.I know it's near, whether I want it or not. I just tried to OD on my anti-dep drug, even though I know it's not possible. It has just made me puke a fucking ton today and feel even more shit. I'm now trying to study and failing even at that because of my insanely annoying panic attacks that settle in anytime I use my brain.

Upgraded my knife to a sharper one because I wanna see blood. I want it deeper.

I just can't anymore. I feel worthless, shitty. Even worse is that my brother's birthday is tomorrow. What if I had died of that OD, and he didn't notice until tomorrow? Or what if I accidentally slit my wrists open and bleed out, the day before his birthday.

3 days until I get to see a psychiatrist and doctor to get put on a real, stronger anti-dep which is possible to OD on. Let's see if I even can make it till then.
