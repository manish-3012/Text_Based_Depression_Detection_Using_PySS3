I just need to unload right now.I'm 19 and I've been dealing with severe depression and suicidal thoughts for basically my whole life. I graduated high school last year but I haven't got a job or applied to college yet. Realistically I don't see myself having what it takes to go to college, I just barely managed to finish high school. Also I have no idea what to do with my life, for a long time I thought I wanted to make movies because I made a ton of dumb youtube videos. But now I don't feel passionate about film. I'm scared of ending up with a job I hate. Also my parents are split up and there's so much bullshit drama between them. My older brother moved to the city and my mom is temporarily moved in with her mother (my Nana). So I'm living with just my dad. I can't stand it. My dad gets severe mood swings and he takes out all his frustration on me. He has no one but me to talk to about his feelings so he's constantly venting to me all this hateful talk about my mom. I don't blame my mom for leaving him at all. I don't feel welcome at home. I get the feeling dad is disappointed in me and thinks I'm a failure because I still don't have a job or even a driver's license (although my driving test is on February 2nd, not looking forward to that ugh). Sorry I'm rambling all over the place but I need this right now. My therapist is shitty. I can't be honest with him about suicidal thoughts because he said he would hospitalize me if it got too bad. I was hospitalized when I was 16, that was an interesting experience but not helpful at all. So I feel like I have no one to talk to. I'm taking celexa but still feel shitty due to situational stuff I guess (having to live with my rough Irish pot-smoking dad.) Best case scenario for this year of my life is I get a job and move out. I just hope that's possible. I hope the depression doesn't get the best of me. Right now I want some reassurance. I've never kissed a girl and that makes me feel like a loser. I'm sorry, this was horribly written but I just want someone to talk to.
