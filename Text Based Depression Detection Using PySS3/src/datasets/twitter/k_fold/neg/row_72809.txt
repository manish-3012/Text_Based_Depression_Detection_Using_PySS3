I had a mental breakdownI keep bottling up my feelings and the smallest thing drove me to the edge. I'm not even balancing anymore I'm grasping the edge trying and failing to pull myself up. I hate myself and I hate my family and I have ever decision I've ever made. I want to end it all. To stop wasting my life on mindless things that I use to distract myself from the endless void of death. I want to end it and stop worrying or caring
