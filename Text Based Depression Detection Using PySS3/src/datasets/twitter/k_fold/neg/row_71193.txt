I feel I might kill myself tonightOver the past 5 years I've always had suicidal thoughts. Nearly everyday I always say I wanna kill my self. I've also made a lot of mistakes in my life so far; such as drinking, drugs and girls. I'm turning 18 this Saturday and I'm not sure if I want to be alive anymore I feel it would be easier for everyone that I was dead. All I wanna know should I go ahead with it tonight
