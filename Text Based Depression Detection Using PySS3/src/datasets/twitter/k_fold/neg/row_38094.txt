Itâ€™s so hard to reach outI contemplate suicide on a regular basis and sometimes it feels like my mind is tearing itself apart when part of me wants to die so badly and the other part is trying to hold on. I donâ€™t have many friends. And with the friends I do have itâ€™s difficult to reach out to because they donâ€™t ever talk about serious problems. I tried bringing the topic of suicide up once to my best friend and he said that he would say to the person he/she is being selfish. I told him that is probably one of the worst things you can say because it does not even acknowledge the emotion of the person who is suffering at all. He doesnâ€™t see a problem with this.

I feel alone. At my university I can socialize with people no problem but when I get home I feel alone left to think about suicide. I try to make new friends but no one really cares to talk with me. The constant hope of trying to make a new friend to feel less alone in this mental state and failing makes me not want to live.
