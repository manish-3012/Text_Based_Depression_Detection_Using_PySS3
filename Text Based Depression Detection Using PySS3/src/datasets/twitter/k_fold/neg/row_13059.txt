Feeling of hope/worthlessnessThis is a stupid reason for feeling the way I do but it's just the way it is: I've spent the last four years of my life getting a Political Science degree and now as I'm getting closer to graduation it's really dawning on me how few skills I actually have. It's a little ironic I post this on Reddit because the constant attacks on the value of the liberal arts on this website actually sort of compounded this feeling. I just keep thinking about how I wish I could go back in time.

I say that this is a stupid reason because there are so many people with issues that were beyond their control or are in actual pain, but this feeling of worthlessness has just been really amplified by this whole issue. I guess maybe it's just representative of me feeling like I've blown a lot of opportunities and that I'm never really going to be able to stop doing that, or recover from the ones I've already missed.

Thinking so much about how I wish I could go back and re-do things and how hopeless I feel has led to panic attack-like episodes, to the point where I can't even bring myself to finish the work I have because it just seems pointless. It's a bit of a negative feed-back loop.

There's been a few times in my life where I've felt fairly hopeless and useless, but I've never felt this close to actually going through with anything this drastic before.
