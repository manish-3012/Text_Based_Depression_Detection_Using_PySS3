I keep gaining weight and I can't stop myselfI've spent nearly my whole life overweight, and I've always payed the price for it, be it medically or socially. 

The worst part of it all is that around this time last year, I was the lightest I had been in about 4 years, 240. But then I met a girl, who I fell in love with. She was also overweight, and our bad habits fed off each other, literally. I gained back everything and then some. 

As we then started our freshman year of college, she decided to dump me, for someone else she had apparently been sleeping with the whole first week we were at school. 

Its been 3 months since then, and I'm over it, but the weight hasn't gone away. I try and try again, but it just seems like I'm too weak to fix it. As I type this I am 312 pounds, at 18 years old. I understand that if this keeps going as it is now, I'm gonna hit 400 by this time next year, and probably have a heart attack and die. And even knowing that, even being looked at in the eye by my own mortality, I can't stop. 

It hurts to move everyday, my joints ache and my body hurts. I have to struggle to breath, just because I'm so out of shape. And I know that the more weight I gain, the harder it will be to fix it. But I just can't stop.

It makes me wonder if it's even worth waiting the year it'll take to die of a heart attack and just get it over with now. Live it up and then just be done. I don't want to be in all of this pain anymore, but I also don't think I can fix it.

I don't really know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post. I just can't stand feeling so disgusting and repulsive anymore. I can't even look at myself in the mirror, how should I expect anyone else to care about the pig I am?

I just can't stop the eating, and I'm just scared.
