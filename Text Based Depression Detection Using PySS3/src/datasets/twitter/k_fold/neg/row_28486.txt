I couldn't bring myself to go through with taking my own life.My most valued person told me they have no reason to stay in my life yesterday night. I prepared to take my life. I sent my message to them, prepared all my materials. But I just couldn't do it. I don't know why. I have nothing left. I lost my last piece of hope yesterday night. Why did I hesitate? Why couldn't I do it? I spent the enite night just staring, wanting to just get over with it but I couldn't. Why?
