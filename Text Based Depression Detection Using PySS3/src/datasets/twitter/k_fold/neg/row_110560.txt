Is there any option besides suicide?I don't feel completly suicidal, I just feel like it might be my only option. Figured this would be a good place to come to, however I take to take time away from people who are in need of immediate help.

Anyways I'm a 22 year old male with no job and live with my lower-middle class parents that I cant really loan from. Finding a job is hard enough as it is, but I have one major downfall; I'm a convicted felon (Breach of computer security is the charge). I don't have much work experience either. I've applied to like 20 different places, only scored 2 interviews, neither one hired.

I feel like it would be best for me to kill myself instead of watching my life spiral into the abyss and probably eventually become homeless.
