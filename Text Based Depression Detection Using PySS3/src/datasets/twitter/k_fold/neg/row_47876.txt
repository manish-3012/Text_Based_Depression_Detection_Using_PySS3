text helplines are the plaguejust wanna talk/feel seen and I've been kicked off within five minutes every time i tried 

they always hit me with the "here's some resources to help you calm down. please tell us about your experience with us" 

like I know it aint gonna fix me but I got nothing else to do other than hope I'm not a hopeless case. but i am 

even someone who has never met me knows I'm a lost fucking case 

this has to be the 20th time ive tried and got the same shit
