No rush.I have some stuff i need to get off my chest. First off, i already have depression which went untreated since i was 8(?) And was diagnosed when i was 14. My depression is genetic, and my father has major depression with suicidal something, i dont remember the word. I joined this subreddit to help people with their problems, it helps me forget about my own too. But, it has been getting worse. Ive been taking medicine for 2 or 3 years now. Ill list some stuff.

1. All my symptoms are getting stronger each day
(I dont know how to explain the rest, bear with me)
2. I have had nightmares about what i felt and thought.
3. The mental and physical pain ive felt during that untreated time is coming back, i have panic attacks whenever i think about it. (Im starting to get one now) it hurts, i shake, tense up and breath terribly when i feel that pain again. I hate it.
3. I have attempted suicide before, could never bring myself to it.
4. I dont know how to tell people, i dont know if i should.
5. It's almost like i have ptsd or something. It take me back and i can feel every ounce of pain, emptiness and emotion, starving and not being able to eat, mentaly not there for days. It's strange.

I have some health issues too, mainly my stomach, and we have gone for tests, still trying to figure it out. Thanks for reading this. Im scared, it hurts. If your confused about something, feel free to ask.
