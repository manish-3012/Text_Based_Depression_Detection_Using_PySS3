Ive Lost Everything in the Matter of 5 DaysIm a 27 male, ive been focusing on a career in law enforcment. Which seems to be an impossible endeavor. My girlfriend of 4 years left me last week. She had told me she had been unhappy for some time and tried on her own. Saying She loves me but isint in love with me anymore. Says she misses me but only in the way she misses what we had. She was my rock and i made every decision in my life since we met with her first and foremost. She left me 3 days prior to a psychological exam to finally get in a police department. Which I was not recommended for by the psychologist. Im 27, lost the love of my life, and lost a job I had been trying to get for 2 years. I work a dead end security job that doesnt even break 11$ an hour, and living with my parents who hate each other. She lived with me in my parents home with our two resues cats. I think they are the only things keeping me from doing it. Ive been suicial before but i was younger. I dont think there is another way out for me, ive never felt this low. My spirit and heart is broken. I will most likely have to abandon my career plans due to me having hearing loss in my right ear. Which makes it impossible for me to pass a hearing tone exam.....I just miss her. Ive had heartbreak from long relationships before but this just so much different. I wrote her a letter saying we should not let all our invested time go away and just try taking it slow. She no longer wants to me with me. Ive looked up painless ways to do it, and even thought of just falling on a knife piercing my heart because of how bad it hurts.
