19/M I can't stop cutting myselfMy meds aren't really working again and I just want to overdose on an amitriptyline cocktail to finally kill myself. I'm a useless human being and a burden on everybody. Everything just hurts so much and yet I'm so empty inside. Someone please kill me already. I can't do this any longer.
