I'm killing myself to protect others from me hurting them.I know people love me, but I am a awful person. I hate hurting people but I cant stop because I want to feel something while protecting others. I'm exhausted. Everyday is the same except for those little rushes.

My birthday is next week and I'm going to see my family one last time, and finish up getting the rest of my affairs in order. Make sure my dog will be taken care of, then I will be overdosing.

I am not the victim, I am a wolf in sheep's clothing. Everyone wisens up and leaves eventually anyways.
