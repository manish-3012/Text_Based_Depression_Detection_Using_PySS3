I literally canâ€™t exist for even another day. Nothing takes away the emptiness I feel like I donâ€™t know how to live, how to exist, how to function like everyone else seems to. Everyone seems to be able to look past all the bad in their lives and move on, but I just canâ€™t. I guess Iâ€™m weak, or lazy, or stupid. I need others so badly, I need this pain to go away. Nothing I try to make myself feel alive works. 

I even go to therapy and Iâ€™m still not better. I donâ€™t want to cause everyone in my life pain, but I just canâ€™t keep existing. Itâ€™s too fucking draining and painful. I feel so bad for hurting them, but the people I know would be able to move on. My significant other could easily find someone else, they are a wonderful person. My loved ones will never understand me until Iâ€™m dead anyway, thatâ€™s just the reality of it.

 Iâ€™ve been like this almost my whole life, but itâ€™s been worse lately. I canâ€™t handle it anymore. People might try to feed me bullshit about how I can, but Iâ€™m just not that strong or smart. Sorry for being  stereotypically suicidal
