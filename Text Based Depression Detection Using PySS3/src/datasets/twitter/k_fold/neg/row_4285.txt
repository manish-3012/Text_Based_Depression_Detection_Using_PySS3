Reminder!  If you get a PM with links to suicide methods, this is a KNOWN TROLL (even if they seem polite).  Please use the "message the moderators" link at right and copy/past the PM into a message to us.  Please upvote for visibility.  We removed the previous thread because the perp was participating and upsetting people.  

Ironically given [what we know about the suicidal mindset](http://books.google.com/books?id=C7uiA5EB5GAC) a polite message that normalizes the idea of suicide can be even more dangerous for someone at risk than an angry, abusive suggestion of suicide.  Please help us take the fun out of it for this person by forwarding us any PMs you receive of this nature.  Thanks!

And, if you get one, please don't take it personally.  This person is sending these out indiscriminately, so ***the suggestions do not actually apply to you or your situation at all***.
