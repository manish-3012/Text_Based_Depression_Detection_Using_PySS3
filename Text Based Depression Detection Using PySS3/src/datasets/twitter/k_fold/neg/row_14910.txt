Can anyone help me?So first some context: I suffer from severe pure OCD (panic attacks, dissociation, etc) and an obsession of becoming psychotic/schizo. I also suffer from HPPD (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder) and depersonalization/derealization and have some visual distortions due to this.

So lately I have been feeling absolutely awful, I feel like i'm not me, like I dont recognize the people around me, i'm having a hard time talking to people and just doing things in general.

 I keep getting horrible thoughts in my head about self harm. Sometimes weird things happen in my field of vision or my hearing and I am unsure if I have started to hallucinate or if it's due to HPPD, I am always questioning reality since i'm scared shitless of hallucinations. I have hallucinated in the past when my HPPD and extreme anxiety were at their worst but this subsided after my anxiety was treated.

Last night I was trying to sleep when this strange thought came into my head, something about "creating a new reality". It was so weird and it scared me so much. I do not know what caused this thought, could've been my HPPD paired with my anxious obsessions and depersonalization.

As far as I know I do not have any delusions but I am afraid of them starting and not even noticing it.

I am very afraid, scared to go outside, scared of myself. Very afraid of something bad happening

Does anyone have some advice? I just want to feel better :(
