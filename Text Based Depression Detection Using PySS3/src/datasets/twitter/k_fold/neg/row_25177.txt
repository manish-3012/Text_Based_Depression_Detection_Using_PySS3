I have accepted that I'm going to end up killing myself.Things are so fucked up for me right now. I don't really want to get into it at the moment but I don't know. A couple weeks ago I came to the realization that I am probably going to end up killing myself. There are so many reasons why I should be happy but my struggle with depression has been so long and so hard and every time I feel like things are getting better and that I'M getting better and becoming a better person I just sink back down again. I'm so tired of living like this. I used to have so many hobbies and now I can't bring myself to focus on anything anymore. I am isolating myself from my friends and my family and I can't stand myself for treating my loved ones this way. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I feel so much guilt for the harsh words that I hiss at my friends and family who are just trying to help but I'm just so tired of people worrying about me, I want them to forget about me so that when I pass on I don't have to worry about people feeling bad about it. I just don't know where to go from here.
