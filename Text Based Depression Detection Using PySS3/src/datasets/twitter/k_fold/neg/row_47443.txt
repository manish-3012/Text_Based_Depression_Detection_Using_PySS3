I know better but...For context, Iâ€™m 21 and have been going through this for nearly two months. So I am going through a breakup. I was with the love of my life for 5 years and 3 months. I wasnâ€™t always the greatest boyfriend but I felt like I was really changing for her. We had just spent out 5 year anniversary in Seattle and a week before our breakup, we spent the weekend at the Coachella Music Festival. I really thought things were better and looking up. Then she left me. I understand that her mind is just as complex as mine and she has so many other things to worry about besides me but I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I have dreamt about her nearly every night, wake up thinking about her, think about her all day long, and go to sleep thinking about her. Iâ€™m miserable. I want to focus on the good in my life but it feels like there isnâ€™t anything good left. I shared my life with her, whenever something happened, good or bad, she was there. I feel like my entire life has been put on hold and Iâ€™m so miserable, I sit at work all day long contemplating how scary but worth the struggle suicide could be. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. All my plans for the future were with her. So I feel like I have no future now. I know this may sound melodramatic to most but I really want to die. My friends just want me to move on and feel better. I feel like Iâ€™m just bugging and dragging everyone down. Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™d move on faster from my death than I could ever move on from the love of my life.
