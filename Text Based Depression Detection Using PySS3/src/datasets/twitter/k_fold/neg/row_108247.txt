There's no hope leftI'm finished. It's too late to change anything. I've had weeks to get this issue resolved and I was too much of a coward to do it. I'm going to miserably fail out of college in 5 weeks. I could have gotten help once I realized I had a problem, but I instead blew it all wallowing in self pity and depression. I wanted to open up and get help so badly, but no words came out of my mouth whenever I was about to it. I'm still lying to my parents about me doing well in college. After multiple attempts at telling them the truth failing due to me chickening out at the last moment, I don't believe I have any hope left. The academic probation letter will get here, they'll scream at me, I'll cry, I'll be so upset that I'll storm out of my house, and I have not planned out anything after that happens. Me trying to imagine my future more than two months in just turns into a blank space. I seriously can not imagine my life past 2 months anymore. I'm doubting if I'll still be around by then. I have nothing left. I've only had a single minimum wage job my entire life and I can hardly socialize. You need to have good social skills to get somewhere in life without a degree. I won't have a degree or social skills. I have no reason left to live.
