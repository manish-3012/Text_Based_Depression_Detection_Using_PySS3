Feel like I wasted my teenage years, please helpI grew up super sheltered. I've been home-schooled my whole life and never got to go and meet new people or go to parties or have sex or anything like that. I spend those years in  my room being super depressed, and thinking about suicide.

I'm about to turn 18 soon, I have no car, no money, no high school diploma and I'm burning up inside. I feel like this regret is tearing a hole in my chest from the inside out.

My current plan is to get a GED and try to apply to college so I can finally have some freedom

What do I do? Am I doomed to forever regret this? What should I do to take advantage of the time I have left as a young person? please help me.
