I spend everyday thinking about killing myself, what I should be doing, wish I had a girlfriend and trying to avoid the fact that I exist, I also live with my parents :-( (22y/o)I am sorry for this post, I am a bit drunk. I don't know how to cope with feeling this way. I think about how I failed to kill myself in 2007 with my father's shotgun (now locked away, but I still have the shell as a memento). I am very sick of living, but I keep clinging to life because of hope. I just want to get drunk cut myself a few times to relax (I used to cut) then cut from my wrists all the way down the length of my arm and bleed out. I have been to the hospital, been through ~5 counselors and I struggle to get out of my bed let alone work or have friends (though I did before i dropped out of college and moved home).
