27 and a failure I have a planHow many pain pills ibuprofen TylenolPm and 
Benadryl do you think it will take to kill me? Iâ€™m female 5â€™3 and a lost 120 . Do you think it will cause me to vomit or think I will just pass away ? 
Iâ€™m 27 I wanted a family a wife kids and career by now. But I failed . I was born catholic and being bisexual was my first failure. I failed at school, was told I was dumb I wasnâ€™t worth it I should just give up, by my own teachers I was told that l. Canâ€™t even pass a math exam for college. I mean I have a learning disability but for the love of God I canâ€™t pass it . I thought things were going well I was dating my high school sweetheart  we talked about marriage kids you name it. Then after 8 years she called it quits, went to go see if the grass is greener on the other side. That was 2 years ago and the pathetic thing is .....Iâ€™m still broken. How pathetic is that? That same girl (we never stopped being friends, we live together) just told me today that she is tired of my shit she is tired of my high emotions and not being able to get over things quickly like her. I am now alone I have no one. I suck at my job , I actually hate it. I miss my old job but it dosnt make enough and has no insurance so I canâ€™t leave. Iâ€™m ready for the darkness to take over and let go.
