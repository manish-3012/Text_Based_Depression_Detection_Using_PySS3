I donâ€™t deserve a lifeI am the worst person I know. The only thing Iâ€˜m any good at is hurting others feelings. There is no point in continuing to try to live a normal life. A month or so ago I (20m) declared my love to my best friend and now he has become my boyfriend. I thought life would become better after that but it has just gotten worse than it already was. Not a couple days ago I basically ruined his birthday and later even managed to make him cry several times over. He is perfect and the sole reason that Iâ€˜m still alive is to make him happy. And yet I even managed to screw that up. My other friends have mostly fallen out of touch with me or stoped caring about me as a human being. Most conversations with my mum end in some form of argument and she doesnâ€™t approve of any of my choices. Speaking of choices: I overthink everything, I grieve over every tiny thing. I canâ€™t even decide which shoe to put on first without spending 2 minutes thinking about it and later regretting everything over again I am a pice of crap. I am no good at anything anymore. I donâ€™t even enjoy my usual free time activities anymore, they just suck. Just a couple days ago I even managed to fail my A-Levels and thus wonâ€™t be able to go to university. Most of my days now consist of regretting everything, laying in bed and crying. It is a chore to pick myself up and do anything, even the simplest things.  And it feels like I just weigh everyone down that I speak to. Now I hate myself. How do people cope with that? I have tried talking to people about my thoughts which isnâ€™t made easier by my anxiety but either they didnâ€™t take me seriously or they made up some naff reason. But there is none. What is the point of my life? To be a failure? A waste of energy?
