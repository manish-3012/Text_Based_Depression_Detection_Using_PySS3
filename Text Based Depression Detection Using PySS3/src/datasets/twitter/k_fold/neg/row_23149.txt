GuidanceHey I uh just wanted to ask how I move forward. I know the â€œright answerâ€ that Iâ€™m worth something but the opposite is all Iâ€™ve ever known. How do you fight something so overwhelming? Iâ€™m just lost and feel out of place, horribly out of place. How can I get stronger? Everythingâ€™s just under a haze I donâ€™t feel quite like anything. How do I continue?
