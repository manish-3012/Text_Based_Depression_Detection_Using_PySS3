cant live like this anymoreim being pushed over the edge. the one person you want to care never cares. im losing myself. i want to die. im going to drive out somewhere secluded and light up some briquettes and wait for my time. ill put signs up so if anyone finds me they know. ive written a note and it will post after my death. i know what i wanna wear. ill prob do it in the middle of the night, my parents will think im out for one of my night drives again. its not uncommon for me to kinda disappear for a bit. i think im ready this time. im going to commit to it. i dont wanna be here anymore. though i feel bad for my parents and best friend.....i hope they understand. it hurts so much. it hurts it hurts it hurts i just want it to go away
