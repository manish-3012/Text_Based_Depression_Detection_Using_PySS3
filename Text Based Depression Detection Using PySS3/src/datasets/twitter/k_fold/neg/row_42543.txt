My miserable endFor the past 2 years Iâ€™ve kinda toyed with the idea of ending my life but in the back of my head I knew I could never actually do it. These last few weeks tho I really began to take it into more serious consideration. Everything sucks. I am completely and totally disgusted with literally every aspect of my physical body. Im not good at anything. My â€œfriendsâ€ are too good for me theses days apparently. Too busy with there new college friends. I only enjoy really drawing and painting but Iâ€™m not good at them. I hate school and dropped out. My mom still thinks Iâ€™m doing online classes and sooner or later she will find out and be furious. Both of my parents are good for nothing losers so maybe itâ€™s just in my blood. Iâ€™m bitter, sad, forever alone and pathetic. Funny thing is my dad wanted an abortion but my mom was too stupid and I had to miss out on not being born. 
I know on paper Iâ€™m really lucky compared to people with actual problems and I try to keep that perspective and it does help me feel better and be better about feeling empathy but itâ€™s not enough. Fact of the matter is my stupid parents didnâ€™t know how to use a condom and bore a wretched mistake because of it. But soon I will right that wrong and once my mother gets over it, I hope she will see that she is better off. Itâ€™s a shame I had to waste 20 years worth of everyoneâ€™s time.
