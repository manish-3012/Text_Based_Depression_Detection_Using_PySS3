Merry ChristmasI wish you all a merry Christmas guys! Even if everything seems hopeless I wish you'll have some good hours and spend a joyful holiday. It's especially hard these days but even one minute without a dark thought is a huge accomplishment!  You guys can make it through the holidays &lt;3

Merry Christmas!
