Everyday i get closer to killing myselfIm 20 years old, i have been depressed for 5 years. Everyday it feels like it gets worse, i see a therapist but it doesnt help at all. All day i think about suicide, i want the pain to go away. Got really close with a girl last year and fell in love with her, but of course i got rejected. This was in december but i think about it everyday, i get more depressed the more i think about it. I still love her, and knowing that she never will love me hurts so much. This really intensified my depression, i see no hope for the future. I just lay in bed all day and cry, i just want my life to be over. I have pushed all my friends away because of my depression, i feel so alone

TL;DR im a loser who cant get my shit together
