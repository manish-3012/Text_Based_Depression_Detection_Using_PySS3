Im confusedSo I've already gone on a rent about my love life, but now I'm just confused.  I have a good life, a family that is wealthy and loves me, friends, intelligence. But I also have Tourrettes, OCD, paranoia, and social anxiety. I feel betrayed by my friends right now for stealing my happiness ( http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/358n6b/fuck_everything/) and no one will ever fully understand because only me and God will ever know everything about me. I have so many secrets that no one knows, an d it limits what I can do eveyday, but if I tell them, I won't be able to live the same.
