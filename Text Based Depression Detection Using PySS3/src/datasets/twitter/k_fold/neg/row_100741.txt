Is suicide a snap decision or do you feel it coming?I've made weak attempts in the past, usually spur of the moment. But lately I just feel it coming on. I feel the need to tidy my things and such. I don't have a plan, I just know when it's time I will be able to do it. I can't tell if I am getting close to actually committing suicide or if it's just depression worsening.
