Please help me.My thoughts have just gotten worse. I have a method and now a date, although I might just choose to do it earlier. But part of me really doesn't like this. But at the same time these suicidal thoughts are dominating my mind along with other ruminations and im just tired of living like this. Please help me. I've already tried many medications, psychiatrists, therapy, nothing works. I'm really just tired.
