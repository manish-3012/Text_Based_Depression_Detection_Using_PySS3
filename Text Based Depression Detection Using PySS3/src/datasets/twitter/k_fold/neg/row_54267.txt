Tips on writing a suicide note?I'm trying to write a note.  I haven't decided yet if I'll go through with it or not, but I'm trying to be prepared so that if I do, my family and friends aren't left completely blindsided or confused.  Do any of you have any tips on formatting or what to include?  I have an idea of what I want to say, but I would appreciate any guidance. Thanks in advance.
