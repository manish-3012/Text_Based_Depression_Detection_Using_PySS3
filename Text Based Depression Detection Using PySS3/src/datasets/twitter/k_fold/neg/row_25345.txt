I just realized that lockdown is going to be forever and thereâ€™s no point in living any furtherWhy am I selfish for wanting my life back? These lockdowns are never meant to end. 

I canâ€™t see my friends yet all these rioters somehow get carte Blanche? 

My internship was canceled because of Corona . 
I just canâ€™t see much point in living anymore. 

The only thing keeping me going is the small chance my school will be in person this fall so I can see my friends again. Even then whatâ€™s the point if they send us all home again? 

Online classes are draining sitting through zoom calls for 3 hrs straight. 

Simple tasks like grocery shopping have become a chore. (One way shopping isles wtf!?) 

Everyone treats me like a lepper no matter where I go. 

I canâ€™t take this anymore.
