Friend attempted suicide, my reaction is not helpingI don't know man. I haven't been feeling the best lately, but now with the news that my depressed friend tried to kill themselves, I've been feeling worse. I tried to be happy around them, but right now I'm tending towards something unsafe myself. Not only is this not helpful for my friend, it feels downright awful that I'd think of something like that when I'm not the one that's hurting. I feel like they'd blame themselves, too, if they found out.
