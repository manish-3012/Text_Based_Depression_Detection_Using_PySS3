I set myself a date.I'm 17. In the beginning of the year I set a date for myself. I have until the end of the year to find some reason to stay alive. Lately things have just been getting hard and I know what people say "don't give up" "have hope". I really tried, you know? I tried my hardest to survive. Even when the world and people were cruel to me, I choose to survive. I guess life sometimes just doesnt work for everybody.

People love to say "suicide is not an option", than what is the option? Survive? Why should I survive? "for the possibility of it getting better"... There is also the possibility of it getting worse. Wouldn't it be much better if I just ended my suffering? I don't wanna hurt myself anymore.

It doesn't matter how many people say that they love me. How many people say "I'll be here for you" "You're not alone". Mental health, even if there are millions of people with mental health related issues, nobody will ever understand you. Because only WE suffer what WE suffer. There is no way of someone knowing your whole life story, whatever made you who yu are today and how much it hurts for YOU. We only feel what is ours. We can try and be empathetic and even feel some of the persons pain but we never know it all.

I don't want anyone to ever put an end to their lives. I know that it's hypocrite of me wanting and probably taking my own life in the near future but... I don't know what to say. I just don't want to see people suffer and maybe that's one of my reasons of why I want to kill myself... I'm a burden to the very few people that I have. Even them don't love me. I'm alone, with my thoughts and my feelings. We should fight our demons, so I'm fighting myself to stay alive but if "good" doesn't happen, I will give up.
