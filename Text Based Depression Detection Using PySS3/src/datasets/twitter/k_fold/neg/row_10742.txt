I'm young, suicidal, and two serious suicide attempts in.I'm on mobile so I'm not too sure how this is going to look, but here's my story anyway.


   I've got nothing. Absolutely nothing. No friends, family, or loved ones. I hate myself more and more with each day. Everyone I've ever trusted has left. I tried to take my own life twice by LARGE amounts of morphine (snorting), but got brought to the hospital. Both times I should have died. Every time I breathe is a reminder that I shouldn't be. Everyone that's survived an attempt talks about "how much they regretted it once they realized they might really die". I didn't feel a hint of regret the whole time. I was ready and willing to die both times. I didn't tell anyone. I didn't want to be stopped. I wish I was one of those people that survive and use it as initiative to get better, but all my attempts have done are make me realize how bad I want to die and how ready I am. I hate being stuck here.
