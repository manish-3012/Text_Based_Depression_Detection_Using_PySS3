OK SuicideWatch, I've ruled out suicide. Now what the fuck do I do with myself? I've been mostly miserable most of my life, and had finally resolved to kill myself last April. Not miserable as in depressed, miserable as in although I have a life and job and social connections and what have you, I've never found anything I really enjoyed or sustained me or inspired me, life has simply been a long depressing and occasionally painful slog. So I was gearing up to finally do it when some folks in my life guessed my intention and made it clear to me how much I would hurt them if I went though with it.

Well fuck, they made me promise not to do it, I can't really take that roading knowing how much I would harm the people around me. 

But now what? Its all well and good to say that I'm not gonna kill myself, but there's still nothing to live for. The thought of this going on indefinitely until nature takes its course is horrifying. I was so close to not having to worry anymore. I don't want to just keep living by default because I don't want to hurt anyone else. I honestly just want to die in peace, its all that's been sustaining my day to day existence for a long time. 

I have no idea where to go or what to do now. I need a reason to keep going. What do people do when they have to live?
