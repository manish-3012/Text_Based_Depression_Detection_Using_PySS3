Given up now.Iâ€™ve genuinely just run out of reasons to keep living now. I left university last year, almost ready to kill myself then... almost tried so many times, but my the idea of upsetting those around me stopped me. I had a boyfriend that I had had for 4 years, and he was the only one that kept me going at time. The fear of upsetting him was the only thing keeping me alive. 

Fast forward to now, Iâ€™m basically unemployed - I work 2 x 1/2 days a week - my boyfriend cheated on me, then broke up with me over a text... and my family hates me. Iâ€™m living at home with my parents, who just make me feel even more worthless. 

I finished university, Iâ€™ve had job interviews... but havenâ€™t got any of them. I just feel like Iâ€™ve wasted my life. Iâ€™m 23, and so far Iâ€™ve achieved nothing in life. And Iâ€™ve got nothing planned for the future. 

I currently suffer from chronic pain, so I struggle being active for the whole day without just giving up and throwing up everywhere. Itâ€™s so painful that Iâ€™ve only been sleeping 2-3 hours a night for the last 4-5 months or so. 

I just donâ€™t have a reason to keep going any more, I donâ€™t have anything more to live for. Iâ€™m already too much of a burden on my family and friends, everyone just forgets me or canâ€™t be bothered to talk to me. 

My whole body hurts, my mind hurts. 
I thought it would get better, I thought Iâ€™d be able to come out the other side, but Iâ€™m just deeper into the hole than I was to start with. 

At the same time, Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself before. But Iâ€™m always too nervous to go through with it. I havenâ€™t got anything stopping me, just never find the courage to do it. I donâ€™t want to, I know in the back of my mind I donâ€™t want to. But I donâ€™t have a reason anymore to keep living.
