I Wrote my noteI wrote my note today. I never had suicidal thoughts before, but these past few days caused them to come in force. I have been dealing with an abusive, hyper religious mother for 18 years, but I am fine with her. I am a closeted bisexual to my parents, but I have my friends who are extremely supportive. No, my thoughts come from college. My payments are due on Monday for my first semester. I am short $6216. And I am stuck I have maxed out federal loans and grants, I have all of my grants and scholarships in already, but my parents were denied for the PLUS loan back in June. And I have been trying since to get a cosigner for private loans, but no one can help. I can't get any more money, can't get loans, nothing. I had a dream of pulling myself out of poverty by going to school,  but I can't even do that because I am too poor to get a loan. I don't know what to do. I have my method ready,  as I am at work, and I am ready, but scared. Please, someone, help me.
