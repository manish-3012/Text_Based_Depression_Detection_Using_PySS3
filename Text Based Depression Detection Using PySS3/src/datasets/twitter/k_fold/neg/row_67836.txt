I don't want to give up...But I don't know what to do anymore. I need it to stop. I am pretty sure I've driven my friends away with my crazy head and I just want to be good again but instead I'm just this waste of a human and I can't deal with it anymore and I don't where to turn. I'm sorry. I hope there's someone who will read this though. I really can't do this alone.
