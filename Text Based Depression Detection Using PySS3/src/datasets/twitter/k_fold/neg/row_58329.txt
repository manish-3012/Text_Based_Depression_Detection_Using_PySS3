I am simply without cohesion.particularly feeling severe anhedonia and alogia, I am not wanting to involve myself with people anymore. And I find no pleasure in my existence. I have not decided to end it or anything yet, but I do not care what happens to me. I find people and talking draining, and hate the sound of my own voice in my head. I do not want to wake up in the morning, nor do anything. I cannot motivate myself, nor follow thoughts consistently, and I have a demonstrable antipathy towards my friends. I wish they would all just go away.
