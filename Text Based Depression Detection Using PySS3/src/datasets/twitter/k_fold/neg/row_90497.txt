Not being suicidal is just lying to myselfI just donâ€™t understand how people can be positive in the world. Everything is just so fucked up, I donâ€™t see how people can lie to themselves and not constantly be haunted with how hypocritical and cruel humanity is. 
I know I must think differently than everyone, I feel sick. I canâ€™t watch the news. I canâ€™t go outside. I canâ€™t face anyone without tearing up. Itâ€™s tearing me up inside to even wake up in the morning. All I want to do is curl up and hide. Im scared Iâ€™ll develop a phobia of leaving the house but everything is fucking disturbing out there, I canâ€™t fake myself and pretend to fit in, pretend to be normal and pretend that Iâ€™m not over analyzing everything in fear of fucking up and being isolated and pointed out because of my differences, I know I just seem edgy, delusional, crazy and emotional...

Death and getting high/drunk is the only thing I look forward to. I wake up with the sole thought of drinking or smoking. Itâ€™s the only time my brain stops.. I want to die so badly. Itâ€™s such a perfect stop. Itâ€™s the only thing I can bet on. 

Iâ€™ve been labeled with mental illnesses and insults but I think I just canâ€™t not see the world for what it is. I canâ€™t lie to myself and pretend to be happy. I want to die, I really do.
