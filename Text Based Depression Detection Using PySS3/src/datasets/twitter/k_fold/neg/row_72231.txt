How to have fun before it ends?I had depression for the majority of my 19 year long lifespan. Also I failed at university because of a complete lack of motivation. Now I have to move away from home because dad doesn't want to see his pathetic failure of a son anymore. In other words it's time for me to go. There is however one thing that makes me stay: I do have a solid amount of money in my bank account. What do I spend that on to make me at least temporarily happy? If live was shit so far why not have the time of my life now and end it when I'm broke?
