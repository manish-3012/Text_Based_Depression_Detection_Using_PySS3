My story...I'm a dreamer.
I'm a singer.
But, I'm gone.
For 5 years, I've fought depression. Secretly.
No one knew, for 4 years. 
For 4 long years, I would somehow have to get out of bed, and face another day in 'hell'
I was a cutter. 
I cut.. Everywhere.
I attempted suicide 8 times. 
I went to treatment, I got medicine
I got better.
I started singing again.

I'm starting to relapse.
I cut 20 times the other night.
My meds aren't working 
I need help.
I just..
One more day until I go to treatment.
Until then, I'm gonna play my guitar and try and forget.
Just until tomorrow.
