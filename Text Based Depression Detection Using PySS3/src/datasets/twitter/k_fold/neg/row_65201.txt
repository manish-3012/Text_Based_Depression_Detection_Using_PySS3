How to get help???Hey I've been struggling with depression (and probably anxiety) for a long time. In the last few months I also have been thinking more and more about suicide (even though I don't think I'd be able to do it ) +i started to self harm.
I'm 16 and school just gets worse and worse, the whole distance learning thing with covid doesn't help much with that either . It gets harder to get up every day. Nothing brings me joy but I don't even feel sad anymore .I don't think I can do this for much longer ...
So ...i guess I need help? But at the same time I'm scared that I'm just making all this up for attention and that everybody will laugh at that kid "who really thought they had depression how stupid" 
Any ideas what j should do? Cause i don't know anymore ...
