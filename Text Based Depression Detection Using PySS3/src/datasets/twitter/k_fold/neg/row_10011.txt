I don't want to live anymoreI can't do this anymore. I haven't had a job in 7 years I used to be normal at one point then I met the love of my life and we were so happy together. Its been 8 years with her and we planned on having kids and getting married. I couldn't bring myself to get a job. We lived at my parents her parents and are own apartment at different times. I've been smoking weed ever sense the age of 15 and I got addicted to it. I smoked everyday every 2 hours for 6 years or more.   
I got so comfortable with my girlfriend and she kept giving me money to get more anytime I needed it. I let weed take over my life and not let me do the things I wanted. I wanted to provide for her I wanted to be the man she used to know when we first met. I cant change what I've done and the fact I pushed her away until she dint love me anymore. I have her name a tattooed on my arm its a constant reminder of the fuck up I am. I cut off all my friends and have almost no family I can talk to. I've always been depressed and suicidal but she always helped me threw it. I've cut myself countless time in the passed when I was sad or thought I would die if i didn't smoke. I tried drinking a bottle of cold medicine the other night but obviously didn't drink enough to do the job i'm still here... I'm all alone sitting in our old room in our old bed and I don't want to live knowing what I've done I don't want to find anyone else I don't want get get a job or get out of my bed. I just want to get it over with. The worst part is i'm not scared to die or kill myself I want to feel nothing. My problem is I don't want my family or ex girlfriend to think it was their fault I did it. I need them to realize this is just who I am and it will never get better unless I'm dead. I don't want anyone to feel bad for me or think they made me do it. I don't know how many more nights I can sit here before I try again and succeed.
