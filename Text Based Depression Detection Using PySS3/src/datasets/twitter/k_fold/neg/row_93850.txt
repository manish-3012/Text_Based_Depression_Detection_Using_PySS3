On a daily basisIâ€˜be had suicidal thoughts every day since I was 16. Iâ€™m now 24 years old. I donâ€™t know who I am without those thoughts or feelings because theyâ€™re in my head so often that I feel they are a big part of my personality. Every day I can feel myself slipping closer to making those thoughts a reality. The only thing thatâ€™s stopping me is not knowing what will happen after.
