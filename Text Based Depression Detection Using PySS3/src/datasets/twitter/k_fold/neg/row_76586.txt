i donâ€™t want to die but i donâ€™t know what else to doi never felt like i was supposed to make it this far. but i really donâ€™t want to die. iâ€™m not suicidal, i just wish i could get up and leave. i have no money and no car so itâ€™s not an option. i know people care about me theyâ€™re all just too busy to give me the time of day. i constantly try to reach out but i just donâ€™t think they take me seriously. iâ€™ve tried everything to get my life together and iâ€™m failing at it constantly. i donâ€™t want to be depressed anymore but i donâ€™t know what else to do
