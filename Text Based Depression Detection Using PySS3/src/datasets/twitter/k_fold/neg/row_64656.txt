I'm feeling tired of thisI have depression for as long as I can think. At the age of 16 I threatened to kill myself in an online chat which was discovered by my parents. I felt guilty for the pain my parents got because of this so I went to a psychologist for like 3 sessions.

After that I always showed myself happy and joked when they were around, but I wasn't. This went OK'ish until 2 years ago. I had a mental breakdown and went to my doc which I trusted. Through him I got a place in a therapy, which lasted for 1 1/2 years. I never spoke with my parents about all this, I hate my dad and I don't want to frighten my mom, because she had a heart attack a couple years ago.

My therapist and I thought everything will be better and ended the therapy after 25 sessions, because thats the limit here. But a week ago my parents showed me a video of myself being 8 years old. I was happy back then, had friends to play with. I felt like this video ripped my hearth apart.

I'm 26 now, after work I sit around, play something, read a book. I don't have friends, noone to talk about things. I feel like I can't endure it any longer, but everytime I think about my death, I feel guilty because of my mother. I think it would kill her when I won't be around anymore.

I just don't know what to do anymore...
