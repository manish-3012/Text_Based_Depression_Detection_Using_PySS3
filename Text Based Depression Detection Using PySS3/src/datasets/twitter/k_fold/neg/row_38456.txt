what's the point in living if no one will ever love me(please don't hate on my religion please)

i finally tried to talk about my rape to someone i know. he told me that i shouldnt have told him because i have to keep my SINS between myself and Allah (swt)! i told him i didnt sin and he told me he knows i didnt but not everyone will think the same way. i started crying and said no one will ever want to marry me because of this and he said that's not true i will marry you if you want. i just stopped replying to him then because i was so upset! whats the point in continuing mylife if no one will ever love me or want to marry me ? im 21 years old been raped twice and the only way i can cope with it is by having sex with so many people anyone who asks and i cant stop i hate it so much i just wish i was dead no one will ever love me!!! im so isolated i have no friends or family no one cares about me no one would even notice if i died so whats the point in continuing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ive been suicidal for as long as i can remember it never gets better everyone is lying when they say that everyone who says they are there for me is lying!!!!!
