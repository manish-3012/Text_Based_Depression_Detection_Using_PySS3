What happens to outstanding debts like loans and credit card bills?Basically it's pretty simple.  I'm going to kill myself. I give up struggling every day, it's worn everyone in my life including me down.  I'm just curious, what happens to debts like a student loan or a credit card bill, that's specifically in my name.  My parents or any other family is not listed on any of the items. I don't want to leave them with any debts that will make them think of me anymore then needed.  If anyone has any advice I'd be interested in hearing it.
