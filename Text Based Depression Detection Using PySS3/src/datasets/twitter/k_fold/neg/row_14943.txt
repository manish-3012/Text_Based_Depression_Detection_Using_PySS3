I don't know what to do.This is my first ever post on Reddit, so sorry if I break any rules or do something wrong. I just need some help. I have depression that gets pretty bad sometimes, and my parents found out about it. I go through periods where I seriously consider killing myself nearly everyday. I am not safe anymore, and I would tell someone, but I really don't want to be institutionalized. Does anyone have the same issue? Have any of you guys been institutionalized before? Please share any thoughts, experiences, or advice that you have for me, and people in similar situations.
