Someone made me realize that I honestly deserve to die.She called me selfish and ignorant for thinking about suicide. She said I had something worse than depression becuase I was threatening her with cutting and suicide. She said that since I don't wanna go back to the mental hospital I don't wanna get better. I hate the mental hospital btw because It has schizophrenics, no music, no good tv, can't move around much, and they check up on you in your room every 15 minutes. She also said if I don't go to the hospital I'll just be a lonely virgin the rest of my life.  Think she was right man.


Oh yeah btw she had borderline personality
