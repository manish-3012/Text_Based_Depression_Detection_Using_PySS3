Just some hope for you all.I'm still suicidal and sad. Some of my feelings and problems aren't going to go away. But:

After months of feeling like a failure because I couldn't get a job, eventually I landed *2* jobs. I'm employed now. Me and everyone else around me thought ill never get one because of my lack of experience and age. But I did. Not one. But two. I never thought in a million years I would get one. But now I have two, unexpectedly. 

I start in a week. I'm going to get money and improve my skills. 

I just wanted to share this with some of you. It can get better in some ways. Just hold on and try to be productive somehow.
