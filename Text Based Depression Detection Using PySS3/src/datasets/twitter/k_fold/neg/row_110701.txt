It would just be so much easier to slip awayThese last few months have been the absolute hardest months of my life. I went through a really hard breakup in which my partner cheated on me. We were together for almost 3 years and I was getting ready to propose. My aunt killed herself and I'm left with the imprint she left on me. My mom was diagnosed with cancer. I lost so many friends because of my breakup and feel emotionally exhausted. I'm left dealing with the trauma of sexual assault and this prevents me from sleeping at night. I'm in college and I feel a mounting pressure to do well in classes (as I only really have my GPA). I can't really tell anyone everything because there's no way I could trust anyone ever again. I feel ashamed. 

I'm not gonna lie, some days are great. I have fun even. There are glimpses of happiness. But underneath it all there's this base desire to end it all because I know that underneath it all there's no point in continuing. My friends don't really know. The people who do know can't really help me. I truly don't think anyone can help me anymore. I'm so far gone. It's not that I don't think I could ever be truly happy again. It's just I know that my highest high can't compare to my lows, so why even bother continuing? My family will be devastated, and my friends may feel some pain for a short period of time. But at the end of the day I just fucking hate this feeling, I fucking hate myself and I can't wait to just slip away and not have to live with this anymore. It would be just do much easier than keeping going knowing what I know. Any day now.
