Professionals helped me to fuck me over after.That institution meant for mental health I went to just totally neglected my file. I've been roaming free taking random doses of meds i can barely access to because they kept on losing, forgetting my file. It's been this way since June. I have mentally unstable and known as highly suicidal and impulsive. Yet, professionals did not seem to give a damn about that. I'm here roaming free, healing and saving my own self. It is very hard. Every day. A hard fight is a worthy fight though. I am not giving up. And I won't.
