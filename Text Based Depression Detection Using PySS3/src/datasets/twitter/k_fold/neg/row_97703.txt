Everything's meaninglessI am not religious, I know humanity will fade, I know the universe even will go dark, so is there any point in anything except my own personal meaning. Every conversation, every memory, adds up to nothing, we'll die, our children will die, and so on. I don't think I will kill myself but life means nothing, and that scares me, I'll laugh at it, but deep down I keep thinking nothing you or anyone ever does will matter so what's the point. Earth is just a cruel joke, and we're the victim. War, death, and the vastness of the universe and how alone we really are. So why live? Why continue under society's thumb? I'm sorry to rant, but nothing is starting to matter to me, and I've been surrounded by people, but I've never felt so alone.
