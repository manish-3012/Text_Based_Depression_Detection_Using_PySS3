Monday is the day.This is such a weird euphoric time right now. I'm at total peace with myself and life. Nothing matter anymore. I wont be attending class on monday, I haven't done my homework. College doesnt matter, job doesnt matter, life doesnt matter anymore. I've been doing what I want, which is lying in bed, enjoying my favorite foods, binging like a pig while finishing some shows I started. I'm not stressed anymore, I havent had trouble falling asleep in the last 2 days since my decision was made. Everything has become so easy now. So peaceful. I'm about to have my freedom once and for all. Life just seems so hilarious when looking at it through suicidal glasses. Just a giant fucking rat race leading to nowhere. I'm tired of it. I'll be posting right before I make my departure on monday as well. Other than that, I'll be going back to my euphoria of using the last of my money on food, drinks, and whatever the hell else I desire. My torture is finally about to end.
