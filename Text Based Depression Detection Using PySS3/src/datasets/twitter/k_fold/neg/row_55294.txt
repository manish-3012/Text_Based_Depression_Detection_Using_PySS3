Gay and proudHi guys I hope ur all well. Iâ€™ve been kicked out of my home because I told my parents Iâ€™m lesbian. I have nowhere to go because my family arenâ€™t from here. Heartbroken frustrated is all I can feel right now, and scared. Weâ€™re going into a second lockdown tomorrow so thereâ€™s no where I can hang out during the days. Iâ€™m asking for a small amount of money if you can so I can figure something out. Iâ€™m embarrassed thatâ€™s it even come to this but I have no other option as Iâ€™m desperate. My cashapp is Â£sarahamfo I appreciate it guys thank you, stay safe ðŸ³ï¸â€ðŸŒˆ
