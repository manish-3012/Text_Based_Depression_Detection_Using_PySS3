I failed all uni exams and I want to kill myselfI have failed my uni exams and I am just done in life. This means I have to take a total of 8 exams in december for a resit! This is just the end for me. I dont know what to do, I dont want to tell my parents because they will be extremely disapointed in me because they have such high expectations of me. I cannot face that. They are not understanding of me at all. They expect me to be the best but uni is not the same as high school. This is my first year of uni and I am just done. I feel like killing myself but I dont know how. wWhat is the point of living if I am just going to fail everything??
