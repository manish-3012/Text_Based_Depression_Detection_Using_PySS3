This stupid house is not helping.I have been living with two other family's for a while and thanks to this dumb ass event going on everyone is on high tension even if no one says so. Just had a blow out with one of them just now over my son. I finally stood up to them and got bitched at for putting my foot down with them. 
I got to a quite place to calm down and the tightness around my neck starts but this time I almost found something to put there. I drank a little to calm my nerves since I'm still shaking for the argument and the though of me trying it out is still there, even with the quetions of how that would affect my son and everyone in my life. If I hope I fine a reason not to.
