I've made too many mistakes, pissed off too many peoples and has hurt myself too many times. What is the point in being alive if you've fucked up too may times?I'm just done 
Heres all the mistakes I made today and in my life 
1) getting up-i should have died in bed 
2) not studying for my online test- I'm gonna fail it anyways so ill just drop out of school 
3) Have depression-im already a failure for that. Destined failure 
4) not being honest with my therapist despite having her for a year-I tell her I'm depressed and suicidal often. But I always show her confidence and hope and the will to live. But fuck that shit. Ill go to her office and tell her I'm done. Why try when I have recovered at all? Im still at step one.
5) eat breakfast-i should haves travel myself 
6) refused to tell my aunt about my suicidal thoughts 
7) Refused to eat my grandmas lunch (cause I'm a miserable fuck)
8) Messed with my friends emotions in my suicide ideations (again, I'm a miserable fuck)
9) Called and talked to my mother (she abused me my whole life)
10) let myself get abused by men (I'm a miserable fuck with no self esteem)
11) push people away (I pushed my friends away so I'm a miserable fucking friend)
12) vented to a friend I barely knew (who told me to be myself and I try too hard to fit in. Speaking of which)
13) I always try too hard ( I know. should kill myself at this point)
This and so many more. Ive fucked up and hurt too many people. Boyfriends, friends, family, pushed them away and made them scream at me and cry over me. I know dying is the only way out
IM 19 too, but its still a good enough time 
Life hasn't gotten better, and so there's no "it'll get better"
Ive been told that, but I've been left with being sexually assaulted (my fault for wearing a revealing top) and being abused by my mom horribly. Nothing has ever come good in my life. Im just done
no use to live
Burdens should die 
Im only one person anyways
