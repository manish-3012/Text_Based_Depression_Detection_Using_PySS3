Iâ€™m close to the edgeMy drinking problem is ruining my life and my relationships.  My new boyfriend is mad at me because of how I behave when Iâ€™m drunk and I want to die.  I tried to strangle myself with a scarf earlier but couldnâ€™t do it.  I get scared when my head starts throbbing but Iâ€™m in so much pain.
