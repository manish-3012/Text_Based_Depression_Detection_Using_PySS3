Terrified of failureThe biggest thing holding me back from killing myself is the fear of failure and then having to continue living with the life changing consequences. I prefer to either jump off a building or partially hang myself but if I donâ€™t die from jumping Iâ€™ll be crippled for life and if I fail to hang myself Iâ€™ll get irreversible brain damage.

Anyone else have this fear holding them back? I really wish I wasnâ€™t afraid and just went for it but thereâ€™s always the â€œwhat if?â€
