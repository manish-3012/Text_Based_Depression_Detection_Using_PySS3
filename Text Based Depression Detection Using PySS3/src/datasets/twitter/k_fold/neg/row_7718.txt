My friend (28M) reached out to me last night saying he's feeling down and been thinking of ending things. Don't know whay I should doSo I met this friend, we'll call him James online gaming through a irl friend of mine. A group of about 8 of us have been gaming several nights a week for the past year, chatting every day in fb group chats, some even meeting in person. despite our distance we're all pretty close.

Last night James reached out to me saying he's been dealing with really dark thoughts for a long time and had only ever told his ex. He said he thinks about ending his life nearly every day and has tried in the past.

He said I'm literally the second person he's ever told, and he wasn't even sure why he messaged me, that he doesn't even feel like it's worth fixing. I Think it might be that he knows I deal with longtime, bad anxiety so maybe he somewhat feels I can relate.

We live half a continent away, and none of his friends or family know. We also game with his best friend who lives 10 minutes from him, Chris. I talked with James for a long time trying to relate and assuring him in here if he needs to reach out im here.

But knowing that Chris, or his family have no idea terrifies me. I dont want to break his trust by telling Chris, and risk him not trusting me to reach out of he needs to. But i also feel like i need to let Chris now so he can keep an eye on him. I know a few of his friends from online in that area but Chris is the one I know best by far and they're basically like brothers.

How should I go about this? I've never really dealt with a situation like this and I dont want anything to happen to James.

Tl:Dr my friend told me he's extremely depressed and has considered suicide. None of his friends or family know, how do I let his best friend know and not betray his trust?
