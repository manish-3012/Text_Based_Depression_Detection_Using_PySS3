Life Fucking SucksSince I was in grade 2 ive had mental health problems. I could never do anything about it, because my family is poor. I've realised it recently, but my entire life has been poor, lonely, ugly, and overall dissatisfying.  The only thing keeping me from pulling the trigger, was the fact that I wont get another chance. I've also realised that the shittier you feel, the shittier EVERYONE AROUND YOU GETS. I vent my feelings to my close friend. This was after physical parental abuse. He replied with one text. suicide prevention hotline.  I poured my heart. only for him to respond with that. I mean, I guess you care, bbut im mentally breaking down. I need emotional support. Not the suicide prevention hotline...

I have had a shit life, although people say hard work pays of, I worked hard nonstop only for me to achieve nothing. Instead of killing myself though, I am going to go through one last challenge. Asking my crush if she likes me. If not, then  I will jump of my friends appartment. Goodnight
