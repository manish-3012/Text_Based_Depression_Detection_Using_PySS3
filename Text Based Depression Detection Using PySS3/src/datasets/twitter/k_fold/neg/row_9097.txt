Update on my lifeHi! My name is Jon and I posted here 5 months ago saying I wanted to kill myself. 
I had planned it out very detailed. I talked about how I was anti-social and was about to fail High School. 
I was playing a lot video games, smoking weed and just a bunch of negative shit. 
But! I passed and got an B on my exams, applied for Uni and got in. I moved. 

First day of Uni, I realized I needed help. I'm done living in sadness and feeling shit for abseloutley nothing. 
First day of Uni, I'm dropping out and moving home. I'm going to focus on myself. I told my parents everyting. 
I told my closes friends how I felt and everyone is supportive. I have never felt more loved in my life, ever. 
I'm crying a little bit while typing this, because I was one of those people that thought the world would be a better place without me. It wont, but it wont get better ether. Unless you tell someone, talk to someone.

This marks my way to recovery, a healthier and happier life. I'm going to use this year to think and most importantly talk about my struggles. I will probably still cry sometimes, but you know what, thats fine. This is much better than living a miserable. First Day of Uni I'm proud to say I'm dropping out to pursue something I find much more important.
Happiness. 

If you are struggling and thinking nobody cares, realize you're most likely wrong. 
People care, they love you and would die for you. Asking for help is not weak.
I've come to realize its the strongest and most brave thing to do.

I still struggle. I'm not way better than I was, but I am on the way to get there. 
Thats what matters. 

Hope you guys have a great day. Seize it, realize its what matters to you thats important. 
Forget everyone else and focus on fixing you, my mans!
