Tell me I don't deserve this!I'm in love. My perfect man. Everything is perfect. 

We've been together for a year now. He doesn't have time for me, even one day a month. He doesn't say he loves me. He doesn't think I'm attractive. 

I lost 2stone for him. I changed a lot for him. I've confided in him and now he uses it all against me. I feel like a fool. I feel like a fucking idiot. Is it my fault? Am I too demanding? I don't think I'm beautiful or loveable but I didn't think it was too much to ask of him to think that if me. He says I'm the one he wants to marry. Or he did. Now I'm lucky f he says good night to me. Tell me! Is it my fault? Do I deserve this?
