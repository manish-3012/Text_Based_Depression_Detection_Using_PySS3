My best friend is telling me all the ways he can kill himself and has set a date I need HELP!!!Ok my best friend has been telling me he wants to die for the last 2 months but the last 3 days he has described how he knows where his mums gun is and might do it when im at work since his mum works at the same time.

But just now he said.

"Look, you told me to tell you if it gets to this point. I think I'm gonna try something when she's at work this week.

I was thinking maybe I'd take a bunch of tylenol and ibuprofen, then knock myself out with benadryl. Perfect OD and can't be saved if after 4 hours. That's something I came up with while "thinking" today.
Tylenol kills the liver so even if you manage to survive the overdose you'll get sepsis quickly, and ibuprofen causes kidney damage and internal bleeding.
Medical knowledge sure is handy."

Are these red flags? I need help! I'm so scared!
I also live in another country so I cant be there for him in person.
