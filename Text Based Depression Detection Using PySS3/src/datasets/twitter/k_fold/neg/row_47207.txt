I know I'll hesitate.My mind will immediately switch to a will to live.

For a moment, for a split second.

Ill be scared and alone if I try to kill myself.

Ill be in immense fear and pain.

My life will for an instant be worth something..

And then afterwards, if I live.

Then ill be back to feeling worthless.

My feeble fight or flight instincts kicked in and made me feel horrible.

Is their really no way out of this hell?


I stay alive and I feel worthless and lower than shit..

I try to kill myself and I suddenly but briefly find worth and want to live, so I falter..


What fucking cruel joke is this...

Does my mind just want to fuck with me for fun??


Is it funny?
