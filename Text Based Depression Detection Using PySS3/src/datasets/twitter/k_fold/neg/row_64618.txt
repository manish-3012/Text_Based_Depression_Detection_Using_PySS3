All my friends are in a shitty place and I can't helpTwo of my only good friends are really depressed, cutting themselves, etc, and I'm horribly socially awkward (as well as mildly depressed), even over text, and feel completely useless when it comes to supporting them or encouraging them. I guess this isn't exactly the right sub or whatever, but I don't want to bother doing the research to find the right one. I jut don't know what to do.
