What keeps you from doing it?I think most people would say their family or pets or maybe religion or shame?

For me, itâ€™s my cat, my baby son, the memory of my chameleon on a toy hang glider (no one will understand this since the mod deleted the thread),&amp; now that I think about it, unfortunately fear. I donâ€™t want it to hurt.

Also weight loss. Iâ€™ve made really good progress but Iâ€™m being a dumbass and forcing myself to be in good physical shape before I go. Thatâ€™s your last shot.

Talk about whatâ€™s keeping you around, maybe?
