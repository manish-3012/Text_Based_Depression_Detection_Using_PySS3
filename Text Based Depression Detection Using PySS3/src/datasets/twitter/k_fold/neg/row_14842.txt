People always say that alcohol or drugs only make things worse. But the truth is, even when I'm stone-cold sober for weeks, I know that they're the only things that make me stay alive until my suicide."quitting drinking/drugs  is the first step to your improvement"

thing is, even before i started, nothing really helped. i'd already decided on suicide and started getting affairs in order long before it...months, almost a year. it was just a....means to keep going.

i don't drink or drug often. i go weeks or months stone cold sober. but honestly, they're painkillers. and that's what i'm going for. not a cure. not help. 

oblivion, maybe. end. maybe there's something, maybe nothing. either way i feel sad. pretty sure there's nothing. sad i'll never see my friends again. they're my loved ones. but i guess it's okay. heartbreaking.

but heartbreaking.

and at this point, i'm almost ready to die, i think. i'm still scared. or maybe just in pain and sad. 

heck, no one's responded to my last few posts. i don't really know that I want a response anymore. just feels nice to type it and feel like at least someone knows.
