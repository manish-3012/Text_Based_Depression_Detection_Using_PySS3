I donâ€™t wanna be here anymoreMy lifeâ€™s been a downward spiral. All I do is hurt people. Like Iâ€™m not even trying to it just happens. I hate myself so much to the point of me being suicidal. I am bullied and that just gets too me.Even tho I definitely deserve it . Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™ve got so much to live for and stuff like that. But that doesnâ€™t matter to me anymore. I went on google and looked up I donâ€™t wanna be better I wanna be dead and noting related to that popped up. Iâ€™ve change my life around and have became very Christian. But of course no one would like to believe me. I donâ€™t wanna be here anymore. Everything in general just sucks. Iâ€™m a musician and I have stuff going for me musically but does that even matter? Does anyone else feel this? Or is it just me. Am I just a freak even more now.
