Sitting on â€œholdâ€ with Suicide Prevention Lifeline Chat for more than 2 hours.I donâ€™t want to call the voice line because Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m going to start crying, plus Iâ€™m at work. Iâ€™m  worried about burdening my friends, and I think Iâ€™ll feel less anxious about an â€œobjectiveâ€ listener. But if I was ready to do it (I confess I have a very well-organized plan), Iâ€™d be dead by now.
