I don't know what to doI've never connected with people. I've had friends and still have people in my life that I consider friends. But I think it's different than most people. I really only have connections to people so that I can talk to people and not drive myself completely insane. When I am around people, I consider myself and extrovert. But when I'm alone, I can definitely see how I am an introvert. I don't know why but I can never see people as more than just people. Friends are basically just people I know better than others. 
I like the concept of loving someone and being loved in return but I don't know what it feels like. Same with friends, I don't know what it is like to have a friend that is there for you to do whatever. There are times I love being alone. I get to explore my mind and try to figure out who I am and what I'm doing here. I really would love to have some friends that actually want to do something with me. Even just hanging out. Having those few people that you can call best friends. 
I don't know what to do and I really can't take it anymore. Sometimes it's as simple as just thinking through things. Other times I am sitting on the floor with a cut up leg and a bloody razor blade.
