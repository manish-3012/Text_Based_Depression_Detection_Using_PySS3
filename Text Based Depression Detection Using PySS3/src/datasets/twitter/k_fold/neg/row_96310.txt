My suicide noteThis is my suicide note to my parents and brothers.

â€œI love you. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m going to a better place. Please donâ€™t blame yourselves. Iâ€™ve been struggling for a long time. And now itâ€™s my time to go. Things will be better without me. Iâ€™m sorry that I couldnâ€™t fight any longer. I love you more then anything.â€

I hope this brings them some comfort. Iâ€™m leaving tonight.

Bye.
