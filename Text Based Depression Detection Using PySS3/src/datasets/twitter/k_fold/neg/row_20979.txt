I've given up hope on humanity. I poured my soul out in a post that was hard to write, and got downvoted.I posted this the other night-

https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3dl7sd/you_win_i_give_up_my_letter_to_the_universe/

This was the hardest thing I've ever had to write, I poured my heart out online and I was downvoted by someone.

Now whomever downvoted me if you're reading this I wanted to let you know it's people like you who are the reason when I do commit suicide soon I'm going to make sure I die painfully. I wanna stab myself to death and bleed out slowly. I realize you must really hate something that I said, considering I spilled my guts out, could you please PM me and let me know, genuinely what about my post made you want to downvote it? 

What made you want to take someone who is already suicidal and push them further?
