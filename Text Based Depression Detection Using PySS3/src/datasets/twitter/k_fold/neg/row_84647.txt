I think this is goodbye. Not sure.It's been interesting reading this sub. Suicide has always been on my mind, for years and years. I've managed to keep my emotions in check so far, but I don't think I can now. 

You know when you know something is a certainty? It's either going to happen now, or sometime in the future, but it will happen, and I might as well get it over with. That's my thoughts anyway.
