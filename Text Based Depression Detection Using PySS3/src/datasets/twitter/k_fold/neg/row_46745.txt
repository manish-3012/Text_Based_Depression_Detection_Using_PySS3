Want help but its difficult to wake my momWalked into my moms room in the dark and she was sleeping. I tried to work up the courage to wake her up but couldn't. She has work tomorrow and has dealt with this crap before.

She looked so peaceful. I left and grabbed the bottle of pills I was planning on taking tomorrow and put them on her nightstand and walked away but I was scared she will be confused when she wakes up so I went back and grabbed the bottle and put it back in my drawer
