I can't get a job and I'm tired of trying.I graduated with a finance degree 4 years ago.  4 YEARS.  I have yet to find anything more than temporary jobs.  The only steady job I've had is doing taxes and I'm damn good at it but even then it's 2 months a year and I barely support myself.    My parents have always been there but I feel guilty taking money from them and I know that they won't always be there.  I'm so fucking tired of looking for work.  I'm so fucking exhausted from trying to put myself out there and getting nothing back .  I'm just tired.

My husband tells me not to worry but he's also in pretty much the same position.  He has a steady job but he's underpaid and there is no way he can take care of us both.  Even if he did the guilt would be too much for me.

The thing is, I know I'm a great worker. I know I do a great job when given the chance.  I feel like there is a pattern of temp jobs on my resume that is keeping people from hiring me and it just HURTS being passed over so much.

The rejection is just too much.  I don't even know where to look for work anymore.
