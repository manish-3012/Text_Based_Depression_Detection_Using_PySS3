I'm terrifiedI'm a 27 Year old male and I'm a complete loser. I constantly struggle to find a job suitable for me(I get the job, I end up overworking myself and then my employers end up taking advantage of that or I'm simply unhappy), I still live with my parents and I have a crappy personality.

My social life sucks because I'm terrified of people and I'm terrified of people because of a culmination of events that had toppled over me over the years. I'm absolutely TERRIFIED of people and I'm terrified of making any friends because I know they're just going to hurt me later on(which, usually they do and usually it's in a way that really really hurts).

I can't look up at people, I stutter when I talk and I'm constantly nervous. I beat myself up over the smallest mistakes or the smallest things that don't even make any sense. I hate this feeling. I hate it so much and I hate feeling restless all the time.

I'm constantly shaking because my anxiety is always acting up, whether it be due to lingering bad memories throughout my life or even if it's due to being around people in general. 

A big part of me wants to die, but I'm terrified of death. I'm scared of no longer existing and although I hate the horrible thoughts that come my way, I don't ever want to stop thinking. I don't want my existence to just disappear. I'm such a complete mess, and I realize how little hope there is for me but I still want to hope for the day that I can become truly happy, or at least not insanely depressed like I am.
