My life is fucked up like a hang gliding whore house.Yeah, so I'm tryin to escape tho situation

I'm not playing,

But the choices I've made will have me paying

Out the ass

Out the soul

Fuck up my self *and* my bank roll.

And I don't even feel I'll land in a sustainable place man

Cutting off my feet to escape the trap

Will cut off my ability to improve my station.

And I'd already been a deformed emotional cripple since my childhood end.

So what the fuck, why struggle when the only future is pain?
