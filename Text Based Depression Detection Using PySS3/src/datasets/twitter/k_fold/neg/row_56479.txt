Time to Go. Not for me, but for others.I have lived a fairly full life. But it is time to go. My children are young enough that they will not suffer my absence. With my passing, they will be afforded far more opportunities and able to live a more full life without having a father that will likely disappoint them. I believe I am a good father, but their mother and whomever she marries will allow them to live in a single, two parent household. They will be given those advantages, and I need to ensure they receive the best outcomes. My death will provide them that. It is more clear than ever, and the logic is sound. A side benefit is that all of the shame and all of the pain will end. I do not want to go, but ultimately, it is what is best for my children. 

I wish you all the best in your lives. You are incredible human beings.
