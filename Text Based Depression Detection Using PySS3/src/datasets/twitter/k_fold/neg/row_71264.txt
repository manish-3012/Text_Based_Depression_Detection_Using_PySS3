I wish people support my decision to end my suffering. I wish people spend a few last days with me and let me die in peace.For me suicide is like euthanasia. I suffer so much. I just want to end my suffering!

And everyone can just tell me things like "don't do it". It doesn't help me.  
Why? Can't I just do something to stop my suffering?  
I really want people to tell me things like they're glad I will not suffer anymore... To talk with me about my reasons, method and my last wishes. To do one last thing for me. To tell me good night.  
**I want to leave this world peacefully, I want to say goodbye to all animals, good people, nature and everything beautiful.**   


**I wish I had someone who understands, supports and helps me with that** instead of telling me "don't do it" like a robot.
