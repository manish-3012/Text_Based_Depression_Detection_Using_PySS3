37 years is long enough.37M who is ready to die.  I was diagnosed with GAD and major depression in my teens and have been medicated since then.  I had a happy childhood and have a loving and supporting family that understands and does everything they can to help me with my mental health to this day which makes me feel like I don't have a right to feel the way I do.  My teens were a loving hell as I didn't really know what was wrong with me when I first started getting anxiety attacks.  Even with them high school wasn't all bad because I had a close group of friends with whom I stay close with to this day.  It did make dating unbearable and barring a few relationships that fell into my lap here and there I have never put any effort into it for fear of being rejected once they learned of my mental issues.

My twenties were better mainly due to college and coming out more socially.  Relationships were still a no go for me but I was attractive and fun enough to hang out with to where I didn't end up a virgin. I Anytime I felt anyone drawing close I would drop them.  It was a survival mechanism for me to reject them before they could reject me.  I drank a lot through my teens and twenties to help with the social awkwardness.  I know now all this did was further stunt my social and emotional growth.

Life after college has been miserable.  I've had a number of jobs in my field but I've never been fulfilled.  I've watched all of my friends take the normal progressive steps you're supposed to take as an adult (careers, marriage, buying a house, children) while I am left behind.  Recently I have started cutting myself off from a lot of them as we don't have anything in common anymore and hearing about their lives makes me ashamed of mine.

A few years ago at the lowest point in my life after losing what I thought to be my dream job and self medicating for a year on pills and alcohol I finally decided to give therapy a real chance.  I had dabbled with it before but never stuck with it.  I thought I owed it to myself to find out what I was truly capable of and that maybe I'm not as horrible as I think I am and am deserving of love and happiness.  I went all in on CBT doing mindfulness and meditation to help with the bouts of anxiety.  They made it a little bit easier to cope and things would go along well for awhile but I always seemed to end up in the same place once I'd run into a situation I couldn't handle.  I also began working on retraining my thoughts which were about 98% negative.  The things I tell myself on a daily basis I wouldn't dream of saying to my greatest enemy.  My favorite being calling myself a loser and that I should just kill myself.  On bad days I would do it 100 times a day at least.  I made some progress but once my moods would dip I would fall back into the same patterns. 

 I also got a new psychiatrist to try to figure out why my moods had started to fluctuate so wildly from happy and energetic and passionate for life one week to hopeless despair and hoping for death the next.  His resulting diagnosis came back as Bipolar II as I was likely misdiagnosed in my teens as it wasn't well documented at the time.  Initially this gave me hope that maybe there could be a light at the end of the tunnel but after trying the meds so far it has been a living hell.  Its only been a couple months and I was told it can take time but I've become very way of what a dangerous thing hope can be. 

From reading this post it should be pretty easy to see that many of my problems result from a non-existent level of self-esteem and confidence.  In truth I hate myself.  I have never been the type to blame my problems on others minus the fact that my parents genetically  fucked me with the depression and anxiety.  I place the blame 100 percent on me for turning out the way I did.  I was too weak to work through these things in my teens, twenties and early thirties and I'm really not sure if it's worth it to keep trying at this late a point in life with all of my best years behind me.  I recently purchased a gun from a pawn shop and have picked a spot out in the woods overlooking the river where I plan to end this mess but I fear I am still too much of a coward to go through with it so I have been trying to push myself by tearing myself down as much as I can.  I stand in the mirror and hurl insults until I cry, I've stopped eating and exercising and I've been drinking a lot in hopes I will push myself to a point of absolute hopelessness so I can do what needs to be done.
