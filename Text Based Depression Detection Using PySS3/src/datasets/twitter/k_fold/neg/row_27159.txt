Getting Old is the WorstI can't see. I can't hear. My teeth are rotting out. I hurt all the time. I have severe scoliosis and many other medical conditions that keep me on medication from the time I get up to the time I go to bed. I have no friends and the little family I have left ignores me. My life is pain, medication, depression and so much crying. And it's only going to get worse. 

Please don't tell me to exercise, because of my back I can't. Who would want to live this way? I sure don't.
