Bad thoughtsWhat are some ways to cope with having severe suicidal thoughts without seeking actual help? My depression is getting so bad I can barely move around. Iâ€™m started to get strong urges to hurt or kill myself, but I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone I know or any professionals because I know itâ€™s just a cycle Iâ€™m going through. What can I do for myself to quiet those thoughts?
