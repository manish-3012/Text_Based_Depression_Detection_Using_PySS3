More broken than ever beforeThe boy I love is lying beside me, sleeping soundly. I am having a break down. A melt down. Every memory that has tormented me for the last two years of my life is flashing before my eyes like some sort of twisted film. I have been depressed since I was twelve. But now it's reached the climax. I'm sitting here on the floor listening to my boyfriend sleep with his knife on my lap, wondering if I could bring myself to end the pain. I hate myself for it, but I'm even wondering whether I ought to put him out of his pain, so that he'll never hurt any other person the way he has hurt me. I love him I do but I've been pushed far beyond what I can handle. I can't live like this, I can't be this person for one more day. I'm in so much pain, I have been for months and no one sees how I'm suffering. No one understands the weight that lies on me when I try to haul myself from bed each morning. No one thinks I'm trying. But I am. They tell me I'm lucky, but that only makes it worse. They keep reminding me of the life I could have if I just 'chose' to be happy. Choosing to be happy to me is the same as walking around with my eyes shut, ignoring every instinct. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm at the end of what I can take.
