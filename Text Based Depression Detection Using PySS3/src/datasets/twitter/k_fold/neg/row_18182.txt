Enough PillsI'm a recovering sleeping pill addict, and I kept some around. I was going through some of my stuff, trying to figure out what I should sell (different story), when I found them and an old bottle of my depression pills. There's enough of both, as well as ibuprofen, for me to finally leave this place. The only problem is that last time I tried the same way and I failed. What if I wake up again and have to hear from everyone how selfish and stupid I am all over? How can I ensure it'll work?
