Help me please! F/23My ex whomb I've been with for almost 2 years and been split but still living with for 1 year has told me he wants to kill himself, he made me swear to not tell anyone, given our past I don't want to be with him again (so much water under the bridge and hurt) he told me he didn't want kids (we lost ours a year ago just after we broke up down to stress, he then recently told me he did want kids with me) , to move on, for 6 months of the break up he was with someone else but they didn't work, me and him was still close ( I found out about her in April, while we was supposed to be trying to fix things) they stopped talking and he was on and off with me for months (he told me he did coke, deal breaker for me, and then told me that was a lie) , now I've done what he said and moved on, not with anyone but job, life outside of home, we still talk like friends, he's now telling me he has a date on when he will do it, and I don't know the date, I don't want to be with him but I care about him a lot, I tryed everything to be with him but it just really is not ment to be, I'm currently sat here crying my eyes out now he's at work, drinking my self silly ( I hardly ever drink) thinking of when is this date, he hugged me before he left but nothing I say will change his mind, he told me he wants everything with me but so much hurt has happened that I can't deal with it, I was in a abusive relationship for 4 years before me and him got together, i have depression and anxiety badly, and I managed to calm mine but now it's gone full swing. I can't stop crying, I'm terrified of phone calls incase it's his mum telling me he's dead when he's out, I'm on edge all the time and he keeps telling me to forget about it, I can't call anyone, i can't tell anyone nothing incase he does it sooner, I'm fucking terrified! My heart hurts so much, I don't love him like romantically anymore I just care for him, and given I'm genuinely a caring person it's hurting much harder, I've had to pull people out of this in the past and already lost one friend to it. I did before hand speak to a guy and fell for him, we still talk but I've put it all on pause even though this guy makes me the happiest I've been in a while, because I'm so scared it could get in the way of this and incase it makes him kill himself sooner, he's admit on it. ... I can't stop crying my eyes out, I'm numb but in pain, my own depression has taken a full swing, I'm writing this without thought, I just don't know what to do. It hurts so much. I keep thinking about his funeral, his mum, everything I don't know what to do and have no one to turn too. I feel like I have to be with him to keep him alive, but I can't do that, I'm risking so much of my own happy ending that I can't bare to spend another misrible year with someone just for the sake of it. He's good to me but the lies about small stupid shit ruiend any chance he had ( I've given him 9 chances  this year and each time there was either another girl, or he just didn't want me ) .... I really don't know how to cope. I'm getting angry by the day, I'm drinking more, I'm smoking weed a hell of a lot more, I don't eat, I wake up everytime he leaves the sofa ( corner sofa we both sleep on, easier than sleeping next to eachother in bed, separate but still near) because I'm scared he's going to walk out and do it, I talk to him every night I'm at work to make sure he's okay. I keep feeling like I want him back but I know it's because I'm scared. It's not an option to try again. I've done it far to much and been hurt too much....someone just please help
