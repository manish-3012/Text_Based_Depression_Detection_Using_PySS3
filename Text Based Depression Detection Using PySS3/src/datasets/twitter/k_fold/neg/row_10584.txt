Why is suicide considered so bad if a person is so unhappy?I think of it at least 1x weekly. Why is it so shunned in general society?  Why should it matter to anyone else if I am unhappy and donâ€™t want to continue being this way??  Yes I love my family and friends but Iâ€™m not liking life. 
Not looking to end today but just honest question on why I keep seeing or being told how wrong it is.
