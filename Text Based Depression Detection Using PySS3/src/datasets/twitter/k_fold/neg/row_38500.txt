I wonder what it feels like to feel depression freeI canâ€™t remember anymore what it feels like. Itâ€™s been so long. Each day, month and year thats passed Iâ€™ve sunk further into the pit of depression. And further away from feeling depression free, energetic, excited, hopeful and alive. 

This sort of life wonâ€™t be my destiny. I wonâ€™t let it. Ending my life is not losing the battle to depression, itâ€™s winning. Itâ€™s winning because I will no longer let it control, manipulate and cause suffering to my own life. Its beating it by leaving the cruel heavy dark mist behind. Somewhere in the mist is your old self but I have to say goodbye. Itâ€™s not the way I wanted to win, but itâ€™s still a win in my books. Allowing yourself to live in terrible pain for several decades, with no indication of improvement, is losing the battle. Thatâ€™s when depression has truly won and taken over you. Itâ€™s a different sort of way to look at it all I know.
