Two Cents From A StrangerAs the title says, this is just my two cents on all of you here: I know that you are depressed, broken, feel utterly worthless, and as if nobody loves you or cares about you. Yet despite all of that, here you are, still alive. You have stared down the darkness of the abyss, witnessed its horrors and lived them, yet despite that you still stand. And that is just absolutely incredible. I mean do you realize the kind of strength it takes to do something like that? You face nightmares of unimaginable horror *every single day* but you choose to keep pushing along. If I were in your situation right now I would opt out, and I bet many others would agree. Yet here you stand, covered in scars, blisters, and other wounds, continuing to march on forward. I hope that someday, even if it isnâ€™t today, you realize how amazing you are to be able to do that. The fact alone that you are even able to get out of the bed in the morning is a testament to your strength. Seriously, yâ€™all have a strength greater than that of even the worlds strongest person or the most brilliant human to ever live, because you keep on pushing on. Iâ€™m so dang proud of you. So gosh dang it I wish you the absolute best, and I hope that your day becomes even a tad bit better than it was. Keep being amazing, you are a shining example. From, a stranger on the Internet.
