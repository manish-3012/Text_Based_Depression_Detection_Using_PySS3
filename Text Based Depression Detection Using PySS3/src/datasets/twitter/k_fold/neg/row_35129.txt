Do you ever TRY to find a reason not to do it?Sometimes I'll sit here and try to find a reason to stay. I try and use the little bit of hope I have to find something I could stay for but they're all temporary things. Everything that's going to get worse in my life overrules all the things that I would stay for. 

It just sucks and hurts that even when I try to find a reason to stay, things just get worse.
