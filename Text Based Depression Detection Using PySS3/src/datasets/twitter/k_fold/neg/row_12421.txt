what happens nextwhat happens next? i've attempted four times, and every time all i want to do is attempt again. i don't live my life every day with plans for the future because i've assumed since i was a teenager that i'd just be dead. it feels too late. i haven't lost the will to live; i never developed it in the first place.

if you've survived: what did you do next? i have therapy and medications that help me function, but the fundamental lack of self and shell of a person i've become haunts me everywhere. what have you done?
