All alone, not feeling very safe atm.Hi all, I was suicidal earlier last year. I went through a lot of therapy and haven't thought about killing myself for a good 6 months, yay me haha. Today my GF of 7 years broke it off, and pretty much everyone in my life was tied to her (our mutual friends were hers first etc.) I spoke to my mom and sister today, and it helped. I would be in a much worse state if it weren't for them being so supportive. Unfortunately I live quite far from home, I would love so much to be with my family right now, but I cannot get in touch with work atm and therefore can't just skip town. 

I just feel so alone, I would love to chat with anyone at all. I am in Vancouver B.C. if anyone knows any good resources for finding new buddies, or even a subreddit for meetups or chatting or whatever. 

Thanks everyone.
