Life is not a movieThere is no third act where:

I get rich so I no longer live as a NEET in my parents basement.

I get a girl who will love me and friends who I can count my life on, so I no longer remember the feeling of loneliness.

Iâ€™m finally fulfilled after a successful project, looking back and laughing at how depressed I was back then.

These things dont happen to 90% of us. Some people dont have to put a quarter of the pain we feel everyday and they have all of this in their early 20s/teens. 

Iâ€™m suicidal I need help.
