I dont know what is wrong with meLife is fine there is nothing that i can complain about, but i just feel so tired. I really tried, i tried to tell myself there is no reason to be sad, things are ok, donâ€™t be ungrateful. But it just didnt work. I tried to be the best person i can, do my part properly, make people happy, i even tried painting happy and joyful stuff. But i am so tired, i feel like everything that goes wrong is my fault, i didnt tell anyone these because i dont want to burden others but i dont know how to get out.
