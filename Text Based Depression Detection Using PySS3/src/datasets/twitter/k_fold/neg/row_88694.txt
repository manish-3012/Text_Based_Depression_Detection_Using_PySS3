Thereâ€™s no escapeMy life is meaningless once again Iâ€™m stuck with someone who mistreats and doesnâ€™t love me. Iâ€™m completely all alone no support with my two year old. My husband is a covert narcissist I feel like such a fucking idiot for falling for this shit.  Iâ€™m a forgotten person I havenâ€™t mattered since I was born Iâ€™ve always been uncared about. I know this sounds pathetic and really emo but it really is. I was left homeless at 20 when my mom died no family took me in. I was sexual abused at 12 and my family knew but kept it secret nobody cares they really donâ€™t and I Truly believe that the only reason for my existence is suffering.
