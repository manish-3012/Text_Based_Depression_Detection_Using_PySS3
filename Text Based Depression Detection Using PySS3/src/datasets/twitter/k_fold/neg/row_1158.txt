uhm this is so weird idk(14/f) uhm hi dont ask what the fucks wrong with me but this is just a vent lol yall donâ€™t need to read it. 

so ive been a little overweight my whole life and my parents has always hated that. they told me every day for years that i was fat and that i needed to eat less etc (this was when i was between like 7-12 or something) but now im 14 and i the only thing i wear is like xxxl even tho i would fit in like m/l.  So they never see my body, plus they know i have really fucking strong opinions about body positivity and shit so they havent said anything about my weight for a while. 

Last year i stopped eating for a while and i lost like 10 kg or something. They were really happy and everyone told me i was much prettier and things. (ik now that my parents apparently thought i had an eating disorder at that time but didnt say anything, prob cause they wanted me to be skinny lmfao) but well well under the summer i regained the weight cause i just realised that i cant walk around without eating ig lmfao so yeah im overweight again. and i have a fucking dentist appointment on thursday (dont ask lmfao) and im gonna get a medicin and theyll need to weigh me. so my parents will hear my weight and bro ik they will hate me so much. idk if ima need to kms before thursday or something cause otherwise ima have to be hated by my parents for fucking years again. and im so fucking scared idk what to do. can someone please just tell me what i should do please this is stressing me out
