Can someone please help me? I just woke up on the couch with an unhostered gun in my hoodie pocket. The safety was off.I don't know what I was thinking, but I do think about shooting myself in the heart A LOT. I was turned down for a job today. Some privileged prick whose dad is a VP got it. I think I almost did it today in a drunken rage. Nobody knows just how bad my alcoholism is. I think I need help
