I justToday marks 11 years since I lost my dad, when I was 11 years old. Iâ€™ve lived now half of my life without him, and I donâ€™t think I can do much more. No one reached out to me. I spent Easter home alone. The relationship Iâ€™m in is failing because weâ€™re both too depressed and tired to give a shit. Iâ€™m stuck inside of this house that I hate with no job and no income and no sense of any kind of future. The days melt into each other with each one being wasted. 
I donâ€™t know when my end is, but I know itâ€™s soon.
