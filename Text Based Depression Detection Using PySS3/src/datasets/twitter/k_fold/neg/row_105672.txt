16 and in need of helpIâ€™m 16 and need hospitalization, Iâ€™ve been here before and know. But Iâ€™m scared, scared because I know if I donâ€™t do anything Iâ€™ll hang myself but itâ€™s junior year. You know? The most important year of highschool and I canâ€™t suffer from another set back. I need help but the world wonâ€™t wait for me so Iâ€™m trapped in a corner and the more I think about it, the more hanging myself seems like a good idea, overdosing didnâ€™t work last time. I need help.
