I lost my catI came home from work today to find one of my cats missing. Her brother was wandering around the apartment meowing looking for her. My roommate and I tore the place apart looking for her. I think she might have gone through an open window and out through the backyard of the apartment building, but I'm honestly unsure of how she got out. I wandered around looking under cars and in different stairways looking for her for about an hour.

I spoke to my father and a few friends, and they all gave me advice as to what I should do in the morning (i.e. put up flyers, ask the neighbors, etc). However, I feel as though I've checked out mentally, and logically. I feel like if I don't find her, then I'm going to give up on my life because I don't know if I can live with the thought of her cold and starving out there. I know this is extreme, and I hope I don't offend anyone with the triviality of this problem. I have been fighting some very deep depression for some time, and I've been working hard to keep busy and be productive, but I simply don't know if I can give myself anymore reasons to keep going after this.
