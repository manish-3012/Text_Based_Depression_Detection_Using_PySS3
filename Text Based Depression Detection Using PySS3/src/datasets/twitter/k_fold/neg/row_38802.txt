How do i stop wanting to dieIt's just this... magnetic pull towards death. Constantly. Sometimes i feel okay but it's always there in the back waiting for me. I dont know how to make it stop. I just feel like this blob of social anxiety and awkwardness and.. just this sad hopelessness. It doesn't even feel worth it anymore. I want to feel better but i don't even think it's possible at this point. I don't have friends, i just feel alone except for this fucking God awful pull to this bag of old meds i should have gotten rid of way too long ago. Meds in general. I just keep playing it in my head over and over. 

Fuck. 

Fuck. I just need to sleep, man. That's all i want.
