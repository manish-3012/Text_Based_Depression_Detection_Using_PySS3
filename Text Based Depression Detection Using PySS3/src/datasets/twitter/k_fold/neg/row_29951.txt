No second thoughts.I'm here sitting in a locked bathroom in my childhood house. My blades are beside me for the final cut, and a bottle of bleach as backup. I'm 14 and my life is already over. I want to do this. I have no second thoughts. But here I still sit like an idiot. Like I don't know what I'm doing, like I haven't been though this before 100 times in my head. What the fuck do you do.
