I can't love or be lovedWhether it is giving or receiving, I'm too void emotionally to be human. This depression isn't situational. Nothing happened or there is no story, really. I'm just mentally very, very unwell with a long history of medication, hospitalizations and treatment 



"It gets better" is a phrase that is laughable. It's been a slow downhill trajectory for 18 some years. Now, I'm alone, homeless, passion-less and held hostage by addiction that robs 5-10 or more hours of my life every day. I'm missing therapy appointments because I'm too exhausted and oversleeping. I've had HR talk to me. I'm sleeping with vomit splatters.



In January, I hope I muster the courage to make the decision I know I need to. My sister just had a baby and my only concern is how the whole being dead thing is going to take a toll. She lives 13 hrs away and will probably be in charge of funeral/memorial issues. Maybe I'll die closer to home, who knows. 



I want to be forgotten, just cremated and gone in a blink. But funerals or for the living. And while death is my choice, I have no say in what should be done the moment I am gone. 



I so badly wish I could die with inner peace and dignity. I want someone to hold my hand and respect and understand and let me go. 



But instead, I will opt for a moldy motel. But I guess it's a fitting place.
