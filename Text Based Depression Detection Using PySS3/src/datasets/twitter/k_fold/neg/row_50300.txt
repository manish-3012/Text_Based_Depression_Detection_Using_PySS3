I should have came here a lot soonerWhere do I begin?

I am a 24 year old male living with depression. I have been on medications for the last three or so years. I've done therapy before, and I have an appointment to begin therapy again at the end of the month.

I used to be in school. I dropped my classes this semester because my depression became overwhelming and I couldn't handle the course load. I have a semester left until I can graduate with a degree I'm no longer planning on using. I don't even think I could use it if I tried. Instead, I'm changing careers and I've spent the last few months learning programming and web development.

Which leads me to my first big problem: I don't think I'll be able to find a job as a self-taught web developer. I've looked for jobs online and everyone wants a degree (in computer science!) and a couple years experience. My time at college has left me in what feels like a lot of debt (30k). I know this amount is not the end of the world, but I can't pay anything without a job.

The place that I'm in right now is severely overwhelming. I feel lost, I feel like I'm wasting my time, and I feel like I've got nowhere to turn.
