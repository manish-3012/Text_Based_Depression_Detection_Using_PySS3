Fuck itBeen homless since I was 20. Sofa surfing, sleeping on benches, illegally squatting and homeless shelter for 2 years. Moved into a home through a housing scheme. fucking useless. No help. No idea what to do. I don't have previous electric meter readings so I can't set up an account. The bank put a restriction on my account for my money because I didn't tell them I moved because I kept moving around so much trying to stay away from abusive family members. 
I have no idea what the fuck I'm doing. 
Waiting to get evicted from the new property because nationwide won't lift the restriction for 3-5 days meaning I can't pay the housing company. 
I have no readings, no activation numbers so i can't set up account for electric. 
Trying to set up water bills but same problem. 
No heat so I'm freezing every day and night. 
Waiting for the water to shut off. 
Waiting to be evicted by housijg co. 
I have no where to go. No family or friends. 
Nothing. 
The various housing associations don't want to help just bleed you for money from the council before kicking you down the road to the next group to do the same. 
I have severe anxiety, depression and PTSD and right about now with all this shit I really don't see a reason to keep going. Just waiting to be evicted and be back on the streets again. 
I'm Sure you had fun reading my dumb ass whinge. Have a good one. I'm just going to close my eyes and try to forget my life for a bit.
