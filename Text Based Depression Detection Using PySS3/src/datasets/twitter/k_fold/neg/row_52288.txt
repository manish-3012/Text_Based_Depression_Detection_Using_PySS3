What do you recomend?I'm gonna kill myself. I've decided it's time. I'm not enjoying this place very much. I'm currently 30. I have had these feeling since I was about 15/17. If I stop assuming it's going to happen eventually and actually plan for it. I think it will actually happen finally. Then I don't have to think about all of this anymore. I want to go as easily as I can.

I'm thinking an opiate like heroin or fentinal. I'm a heavy guy tho, what should I try to take. And how much will I need? I'm selling my insterments and video game collection. So I can afford it I just have to chose an option and find it to buy. 

Then a good album and a few drinks. And hopefully off too sleep forever.

I don't wanna botch this up. So any suggestions would be great. Thanks.
