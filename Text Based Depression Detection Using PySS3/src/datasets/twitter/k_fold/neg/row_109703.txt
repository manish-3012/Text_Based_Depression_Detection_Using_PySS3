I want to die but my career keeps me hereI know it might sound stupid, but itâ€™s something that I feel. Some days I just want to stay locked up in my room and prepare everything for a quick farewell but then I start thinking of my patients in the hospital. (I work in the medical field) I want to be responsible of my own death not others. 
Depression has been getting worse by each day, the fights with my bf are more common, I get angry for every little thing, I just want this to stop. But this stupid career that I chose.
I know Iâ€™m just an insignificant pawn in this place but I canâ€™t stop feeling some guilt if one day I just disappear and one of my patients die. I donâ€™t trust my coworkers.
Is it stupid that I feel this? Should I just leave those thoughts about my patients and just die?
