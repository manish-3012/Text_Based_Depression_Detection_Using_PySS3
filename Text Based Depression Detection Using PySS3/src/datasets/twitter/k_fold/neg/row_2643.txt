Dont Talk About It BE ABOUT ITYSame post as before but it got deleted previously.  To summarize it:  All you attention whoring drama queens that claim/pretend that you're going to kill yourselves know damn well that you are too scared to actually pull it off.  All you "failed suicide attempt" people know damn well that you didn't succeed at it because you purposely wanted to fail.  If somebody wanted to really kill themselves, they wouldnt come here posting about it, they would just do it and be dead by the end of the day.  You guys know EXACTLY how to kill yourselves.  An 8 year old knows what could kill them.  But you guys choose to inflict non-lethal damages on yourself so it seems like you tried to kill yourself and people will give you attention.
