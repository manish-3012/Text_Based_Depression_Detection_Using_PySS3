I almost ended my life last night because I lost everything. Is anyone out thereHello friends, Iâ€™m in a very dark place. Iâ€™ve been homeless since February after my ex took everything &amp; am waiting &amp; waiting to get disability &amp; medicaid but the process is never ending. I am in severe chronic pain that will get worse if not treated. I mentioned a while back I was diagnosed with a tumor on my ovary. Now, my kidneys &amp; bladder are suffering &amp; I will most likely have to have my bladder removed. My heartless dad ended my health insurance &amp; now I cannot pay for any of the medication or surgeries I need to live a somewhat normal life. I just want to give up &amp; end my life because of this. I feel like I have no choice. I have no friends or family. Should I start a fundraiser? I really need some help &amp; advice, thank you. And just someone to talk to.
