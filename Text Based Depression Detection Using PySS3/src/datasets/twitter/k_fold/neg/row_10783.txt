I don't understand what's going onI can't understand what the fuck is going on in my head. I don't know who to talk to since I don't have a fucking friend. I am angry with myself. I am constantly depressed and with suicidal thoughts for years now. I madly fall in love with random girls with whom in many cases I just exchange a few words. I have millions of thoughts in my head and I can't give myself peace. every now and then I joke that I can open and close 10 different businesses in a minute. I do periods where self-destruction is the only thing that keeps me going. I tried drugs, prostitutes, alcohol, nothing can give me peace. I can't reach any of my goals because I change my mind in seconds. I have trouble sleeping, I always eat until I burst or I don't eat at all. the thing that pisses me off is the fact that I'm never focused on what I do. I seem to be living on a different planet. what the fuck can i do? last year I tried to resort to a specialist after a few sessions I didn't go anymore because according to him I was looking for medicines. last week i booked a new appointment but now i think i'm fine and i seem to be wasting his time. I do not know what to do. I just want to stop thinking
