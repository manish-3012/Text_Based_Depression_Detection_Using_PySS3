Surviving emptyI recently survived a suicide attempt, i took over 45 times the lethal dosage of a slow release medication in an attempt to end myself and was taken to the Intnesive care unit and incubated in a coma for a few weeks and survived. Now im the other side of it and i know i should be thankful, but i just feel empty, i feel worse than before because It didnt go as i planned, people found out and got hurt blaming themselves for my actions, my partners distancing himself from my, my landlords kicking me out and I find myself taking late walks in the rain asking myself why im still here. Every reason I can think of to continue is to make others happy, i cant think of a single reason that i want to carry on that is because of something that makes me happy. I just wanted to know if anyone else had any similar feelings after failing a suicide attempt.
