Intrusive thoughts.I don't think I'm really suicidal at this point. Not right now. I've made attempts. But I'm struggling really hard with these stupid thoughts. 

The big one that I'm almost obsessive over, hell, maybe I am obsessed, is walking in front of a car on the highway. The only reason I haven't followed through is because I'm worried about how it will make the person I choose to kill me, feel. 

Life is not great. I work for a monster of a boss, I live in my van, I rarely see my kids. I don't get to talk to them. The days I'm with them is heaven. 

But it's just, more and more, I want to quit. I don't know how to handle this. And these thoughts, take all my pills, jump in front of a car, cut again, how can I hang myself, buy a generator and suffocate.... There are so many, and they're constant.

I don't think I'm suicidal. But damn. I want these to stop.
