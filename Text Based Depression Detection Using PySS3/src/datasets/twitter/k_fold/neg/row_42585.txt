A 13 year olds last wordsIâ€™m done. Iâ€™m just done. Fuck this. Fuck my life. I want this to be over. I want someone. I need something. I need something to go on. Yet Iâ€™m here. Canâ€™t wait for tomorrow morning. Nice little accident on the highway. Cant wait! 
(*â‰§âˆ€â‰¦*). Seriously though if u know me, and this is all you find. Iâ€™m sorry. I canâ€™t go on. I canâ€™t live like this. Iâ€™m sorry. This isnâ€™t your fault. May you continue and do more then I ever could love- Jacob
