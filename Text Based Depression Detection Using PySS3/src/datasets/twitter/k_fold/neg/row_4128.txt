How do I get the guts to do it?Just done, no friends, no girl friend, never had one. Been home-schooled for 2 years high school, never left my house for 2 years (except store) spend time on internet all day. Practically scared from all the people I've met and am done with this world. I'm through. Lost all faith and will in it. I just keep posting here and doing the same things over and over, what are some methods? I can't fucking take it anymore.

All girls I talk too, are silent when talking to me, they read my messages and then close the app. I'm not a human, I want to get hit by a train if there was no pain involved.
