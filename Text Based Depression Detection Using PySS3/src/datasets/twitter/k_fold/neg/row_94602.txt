Done. Just done. (long)So I've been pretty severely messed up and depressed for the last year. In January I began thinking about driving into embankments but always said "next time." I moved with my wife and kids to what should have been a better place/situation and went off my meds because of financial problems. I have been angrier and more guilty/ashamed than ever. I took around 200 tramadols over the course of a week. My wife kicked me out. I purged all the bad things I've ever done in a 70 page dump. I started going to counseling and two separate addiction support groups. I've been honest and open in all of them. Since September I've been "good" and then would get hit with serious suicidal thoughts, each more intense than the other. I've called the help lines, I've reached out, I have no one. I've done everything I'm supposed to do and I don't care. I'm just done. I'm tired and I can't take any more false plateaus that only get yanked out from under me. Hope isn't enough. Love isn't enough. I'm just done. Even worse, I don't even know why I posted this and I feel like there's other s who need support more than me because I don't want to be a burden.
