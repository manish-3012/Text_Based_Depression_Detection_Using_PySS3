Is it just US hospitals that suck?I think the main reason why I personally never enjoyed any mental health facility treament is because they treat you as just a general crazy. You'd think they shouldn't be allowed to say stuff like this but it happens. I had an incident where I was breaking down because of a trigger in the presence of one of the "doctors" and they looked at me as I was collapsing to the floor and went "Are you insane?"
Also, they don't personalize their treatment. I understand that many people who are admitted to hospitals have committed crimes or acts of violence, so I can see why the placement of rules and strict guidelines is beneficial to them. But there are also, especially in pediatric facilities, people who's last thing they need is to be treated like a criminal. 
I feel like with more personalized care,hospitals would actually be worth the effort (and money).
That's just my thoughts. 
Maybe it's just American hospitals? What do you guys think?
