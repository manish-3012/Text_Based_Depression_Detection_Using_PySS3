so what do you do when you lose your will to live?iâ€™m genuinely just confused. iâ€™ve lost the will to live and I truly would like to just die. Iâ€™ve tried killing myself before but clearly that didnâ€™t work out. I am too much of a pussy to try again but I also know that just praying and wishing for death isnâ€™t gonna work. 

how do you suicidal people cope? how can you live when all you want is to die? 

what do you do when youâ€™re so depressed you donâ€™t do anything but lay in bed, jobless and friendless, fantasizing about your own death?
