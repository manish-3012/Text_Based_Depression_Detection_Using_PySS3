Advice for after attempting?Hello, I'm currently recovering from a failed suicide attempt. Most of the immediate, intense support I had is now over and it's time for me to go back to normal life. Something I'm really struggling with is this time 3 months ago I thought I'd paid my rent, gone to work, commuted, done my weekly shopping etc for the last time, yet here I am, back in the same life I was living before. I feel like those who know expect me to get back into things like nothing happened - I went to hospital, had some real intense therapy, and am now on a waiting list for CBT so in their eyes I've been treated and should be better now? It's really hard. I get told all the time about support networks for when you're feeling suicidal, even for those dealing with the grief caused by suicide, but in my experience there's not much for when you're in that weird, recovery phase. I feel like I'm living in a dream world at the moment, sometimes things don't even seem real, any help would be much appreciated.
