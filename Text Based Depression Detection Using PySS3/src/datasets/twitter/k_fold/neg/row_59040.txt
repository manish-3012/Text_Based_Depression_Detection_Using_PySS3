Hey! Itâ€™s the US government reminding you youâ€™re not allowed to kill yourself!Just your reminder from the US government, weâ€™ve taken away your gun rights so you have no safe avenue to kill yourself and would have to rely on astronomically more dangerous and traumatic methods!

Also, if you try to kill yourself weâ€™re gonna lock you up against your will, treat you terribly, and then release you when we feel like it and saddle you with thousands of dollars of medical debt!

Oh, but also, we wonâ€™t pay for therapy or medication! Sorry!

But also donâ€™t think of taking street meds or weed. Well arrest you and send you to prison and your life will be worse than ever! Then, weâ€™re gonna disenfranchise you and it will be impossible to find work!

Oh, and weâ€™re absolutely not gonna work to fix any of the issues hurting you like racism, climate change, low minimum wage, unemployment, but donâ€™t kill yourself because we say so!
