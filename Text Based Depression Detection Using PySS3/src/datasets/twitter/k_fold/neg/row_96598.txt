I give up.I don't know why. Ever since I've been little I feel like people hate me. My family, my teachers, my "friends". It's like nothing in my life is right. On top of that I'm bisexual and my parents are super homophobic. There's no point in me being alive.  I'm a waste of money, air, and natural resources. I'm fat and I don't deserve anything. I just want to lie down and never wake up. I hate these feelings and they're really overwhelming, but I have no control over them. One minute I'm fine and happy, suddenly I feel hated, and shameful even though I didn't do anything wrong. I just want to take a bottle of Tylenol and sleep. 

I knew no one was going to take me seriously. Depression and self hatred has no age...
