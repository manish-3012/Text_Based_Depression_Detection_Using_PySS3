Sometimes I wish I had succeeded that Wednesday...I was so close. I was hanging. I had everything ready. But somehow, I got back up, out, and failed that attempt. My last attempt. And I wish I didn't. I wish I died. I wouldn't have caused so many people the pain I do by existing now. I don't know why I can't bring myself to do it again...
