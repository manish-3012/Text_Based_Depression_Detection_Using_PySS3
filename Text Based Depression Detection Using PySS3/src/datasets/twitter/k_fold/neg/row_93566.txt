Tried Every Coping SkillI tried every way to cope so that I wouldnâ€™t cut or think about suicide. I tried going to a cafe I like, noting the things completed, removing myself from triggering situations, taking a break to go for a walk, talking to a close friend who reminded me of all the reasons to stay, etc:.. and at the end of the day, I still cut myself. I tried to remove myself from the source of stress but it just wouldnâ€™t stop, even after I said how close I was to hurting myself. I feel like a failure. I tried to hard, I didnâ€™t want to cope this way. It just felt like the only option at the end of the day to punish myself and make amends for being an awful partner and person. It seemed like I could either cut or find the closest high tide garage to walk off. When I spoke to my partner about how much I was struggling, he simply got mad and told me I was acting like a child and that I was ruining his chance for a new start in his new apartment. I just want to disappear. Maybe then the world will be ok and the people around me will no longer feel miserable.
