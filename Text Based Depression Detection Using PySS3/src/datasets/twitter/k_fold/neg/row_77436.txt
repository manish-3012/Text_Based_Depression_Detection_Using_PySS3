Better off dead than sober [xpost from r/stopdrinking]The title should say it all. My fiancÃ©e thinks drinking is no good for me, but after I gave up benzos and opiates, booze is the only thing that keeps me from killing myself.

"Oh, but there's so much life has to offer! Sobriety is freeing!"

...

For me, it's really not. I have so much social anxiety, that even with an advanced degree, all I can manage to hold down is a minimum wage job that is so stressful that I'd rather be dead than continue working where I am. I've literally tried jumping into and hiding in a cardboard baler, hoping that someone would turn it on and crush me.

What is there to enjoy from being sober? I'm better off dead than living the rest of my life in this state.
