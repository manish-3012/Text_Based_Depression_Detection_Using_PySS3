Why do we take everyone with usWe can't just die an isolated death. We have to die knowing that dying will fuck everyone around us. Everyone will feel grief and guilt over us been gone, they'll say they could have done or said more but it never would have. We suffer alone and, when it continues to get worse even during treatment, we take our life. I don't want to be here anymore oh my fucking lord.
