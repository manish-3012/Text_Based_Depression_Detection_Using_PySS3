Im tired of this life.Im tired of this life. I feel like I wasnt really living my life to the fullest like everyone else. I have wasted 27 years of my life just feeling miserable. I'm an introvert with absolutely no personality. Im boring. I bore myself sometimes. I have a few friends who can tolerate me. I meet with them rarely and talk to them rarely. The way I speak hurts other people even if I dont mean to. I have a broken family. I havent met my dad. My parents separated before I was even old enough to speak. I dont have any siblings. My mom died 7 years ago. For the past 7 years, I have been struggling to please my dead mother because I was such a disappointment. I was a bad student in college. I failed way too many subjects and got addicted to online games. When my mom died, i felt the need to at least fullfill her wish for me. I tried my best to get into med school. I was accepted at a third rate med school who would literally accept anyone as long as they had money. I finished med school, did my internship, took the licensure exams. I have been a doctor for 1 year. Some people would envy me but I would give everything up in exchange for a happy family. All this years, I have been doing my best to at least be an average med student. I ignored everying. I focused solely on my studies. Now, I have no one. I have a few relatives but they live continents away. Sometimes, I even envy some of my highschool classmates who got pregnant at 16. At least they have someone. They have a family. I have nothing. I have little to no experience when it comes to dating. I had a boyfriend in highschool. Our relationship lasted till the first semester of college. I didnt really like him. My present relationship is not that good either. Its toxic. But I'm afraid to let go. I met him at work. He's 14 years older than me but I dont really care. I was satisfied with just seeing him at work everyday. We had little to no interactions except maybe during meals. One night, we had drinks. I had one too many and we ended up in bed. I lost my virginity to him. Over time, we just casually met, had dinner, checked in to a motel and had sex. That was the drill. It came to a point where we were having sex at work almost every day for several times. We never really talked about the current status of our relationship. I dont even know if this is a relationship. We were just hooking up. Im just his fuck buddy. I know he's in a relationship with someone else. Im not okay with that but the thought of being alone again hurts me more. Just the thought of him breaking up with whatever this is suffocates me. I'm just tired of being alone. I want someone to kiss and hug. I want someone to listen to my stories even if they were boring. I want to be with someone who is comfortable with my silence and awkwardness. I know im not sweet and im not a lovable person but I want a happy family like most people. I hate him. I hate him for making me want more. He gave me hope that maybe someday, I could have what they have. I dont know If I love him, but I know I wont end up with him. It hurts. The thought of being alone again hurts. I want to kill myself and just end everything but the thought of my corpse being a nuisance to other people bothers me. I hope all this pain goes away. I just want to feel numb.
