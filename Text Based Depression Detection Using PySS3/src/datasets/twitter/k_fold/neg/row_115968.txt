I'm 19 and I've already had enough of this lifeHi,

I'm a 19yo European girl. I'm supposed to start university this year. But I'm not looking forward to it at all...
The thing I miss the most is my childhood. I miss the times when nobody expected me to behave "responsibly", when I was cared for and could just have fun. I also wasn't aware of all the bad things in this world.Â 
I've never said I wanted to become adult, mature and responsible. I feel so helpless because nothing could be done about this.
I'm so young, yet I feel the best years of my life are gone.
I feel like there's no such university degree, no such job that could give me happiness. There's nothing that could bring my childhood back.
The thought of functioning in "adult world", dealing with career, insurances, doctor appointments etc. makes me SICK. I'm also petrified when I think I'll have to take care of my parents when they're very old.

I've always had practically no social life. People said I was a shy kid. But that wasn't a big problem because adults did things for me. Now any interaction with a stranger gives me anxiety.Â 
When I look at my peers or other people, I feel I'm so "wrong" and out of place that I'll never be able to live a normal life. I feel useless. People at my age have jobs, serious relationships, plans for the future.

I don't have a social life, but I don't feel lonely. It frustrates me that many people think one can be happy only around others.

Sometimes I also feel a sort of guilt - I know many people have gone through traumatic experiences, like domestic abuse, sexual harassment or toxic realtionships. I've been brought up in a safe, friendly environment, getting almost all things I wanted, yet I feel depressed, anxious and helpless.

Everything's OK as long as I'm isolated in my own world. My fave activities are reading, listening to music and playing video games.Â (The world in games is so simple and restricted. I love it that I can have everything under control.)

But almost each time I have to step out of my safe space and do something in the real world, I feel nervous and upset. This wasn't a trouble when I was a little girl - it's understandable that a child can have their own world.

There are times at which I think about ending it all. But I know my family love me and would be absolutely devastated (which I find a bit ridiculous because I don't think I present much value).

I think that if I am to have even bigger problems when I'm older, I prefer to die now because there's no way I can cope with the troubles of adult life.

I'm sorry if this post is a little chaotic. Also, English is not my first language, so sorry if there are mistakes.

Anyone have an idea on what I could do?
