Planning to kill myself tomorrow.Before going to work to tomorrow, I am going to jump off a bridge. I have nothing really going for me, so I dont see the reason for living. My family will be crushed but I think I've had enough. I don't wanna live any longer. I have nothing and I am nothing. Who's gonna miss the invisible man anyways?
