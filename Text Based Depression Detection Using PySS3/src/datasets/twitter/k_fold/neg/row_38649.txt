There is nothing for me to look forward to.Edit: I appreciate all the mail I've gotten. I'm still not the best, but it means so much to me that you all took the time to talk to me in my time of need. You're all very kind to do this, I've made multiple new friends as well! Thanks. :)

I'll be fine, just have to go through a lot of stress right now.
