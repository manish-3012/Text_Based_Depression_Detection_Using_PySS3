Some suggestions for an honorable death?I dont want to kill myself, but given my uselessness and the general depressing future of this world, i would very much like to die soon, for a good cause. 
I dont really like my own country, so i wouldnt want to join its army. Could anyone suggest a few other high-risk professions which could get me an honorable death? Should i attack a gathering of right-wingers or religious extremists? Thank you.
