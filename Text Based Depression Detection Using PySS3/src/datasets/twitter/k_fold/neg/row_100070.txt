Thinking about it almost every weeksSince I lost my job in September, I'm just trying to get back to a state of equilibrium but I'm failing at every attempts I made. I have project but I need to vent because right now, I tried to get back to work at least three times, I had more than 10 interviews and I sent countless number of applications with no results. I worked for a brief amount of time until I was told I couldn't fit in their "dynamic team" and now, I'm slipping into a state of apathy. I stay indoor almost all the time, just eating because I need to and filling my basic needs but I don't feel I could do anything else. It took me all my energy to get into a new job and I just lost that job after two days. Beside doing a low wage job at a McDonald at the end of my unemployment insurance, I fail to see any hope. School would be great, even if it's part time but I can't do it if I fail to lift the veil of depression inside me. Suicide was not an option but then it started creeping in my mind, as if it would be an easy solution to remove an asocial guy who's depressed and out of job.
