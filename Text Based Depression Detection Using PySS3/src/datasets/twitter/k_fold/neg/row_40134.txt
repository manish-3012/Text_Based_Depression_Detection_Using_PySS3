Imma be straight upIâ€™m not necessarily sad I know I might be taking things for granted but man my life sucks. Parents got divorced siblings to young to understand I have to hear both sides when they shouldnâ€™t talk to me about it, I go to school have a fake ass smile the whole day then go home donâ€™t do nothing my life is boring I have no purpose. The only reason Iâ€™m on reddit and telling ppl about this because I feel disgusted with myself Iâ€™m healthy tall and decent looking but that doesnâ€™t even matter I feel so nasty on the inside Iâ€™m constantly looking around like someone has it out for me I canâ€™t even speak my mind I just go with the flow Iâ€™m really smart and have talents and stuff but I canâ€™t do it anymore I donâ€™t think any 15 should feel this way Iâ€™m just done I havenâ€™t felt this way in a while Iâ€™ve never tried to harm my self. I just know that Iâ€™m going out on my own terms
