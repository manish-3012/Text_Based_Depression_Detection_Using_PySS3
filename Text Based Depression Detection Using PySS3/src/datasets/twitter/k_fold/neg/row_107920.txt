IÂ´m not going to get the help I so desperately need.Hey yÂ´all.

So this all started ~18 months ago when I made some terrible life-decisions. Around mid 2013 I started to change up my diet a little bit whilst excercising because I saw that it helped me improve some small issues. This slowly but surely developed itself to an eating-disorder like thingy where I started to eat a third of the calories I'd usually eat whilst excercising 4/5 times a week. Seeing short term improvements I thought I was doing great.

Fast forward to the beginning of 2014 and I'm starting to get all these weird digestive issues (constipation,diarrhea,terribly smelling gas,green stools etc.). Ofcourse at first I refused to see the link between this and my excercise/eating habits, but within a couple of weeks this changed and I started to see how ridicilous it actually was what I was doing, so I started excercising less and change my diet back to a more normal kind of diet(paleo-ish).

Whatever I did, my digestion didn't improve shit and after tons of doctor visits the only thing they could find was a gut-parasite (Blastocystis Hominis) off which they weren't sure if it was actually the cause of my problems. But to be sure they prescribed me an antibiotic (Metronidazole, also called Flagyl).

After contemplating taking this antibiotic for a long time (the chances of the parasite being my problem was rather low) I took it, being as desperate as I was, around november 2014.

This is when my already shitty situation gets really bad. The week after which I finished this 10-day antibiotic cure, I'm starting to get these weird mental confusion symptoms. I since went to a neurologist, a gastroenterologist and some other physicians, all to no avail. This incredibly frustrating mentally sluggished state is going on for about 3/4 months now and it doesn't seem to improve at all and nobody seems to be knowing what my problem is, let alone doing something about it. And I'm still having all of my digestive symptoms on top of it.

Man, I used to love life so much and as a 19 year old decently intelligent and good-looking guy, I thought the future was mine.
All I can think of right now is how this is not going to end well.
