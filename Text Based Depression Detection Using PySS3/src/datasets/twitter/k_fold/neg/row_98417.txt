Husband is suicidal, im barely finishing a treatment so I wont beI knew he needed  help as bad as me but i went first with the keatmine threapy. He always acted like I was worse but he was just better at keeping it in.

Im not even on my feet yet and it feels like Im getting bombarded,  everything is trying to knock me down and its working.

I feel isolated, alone, scared. So many new emotions have been flooding back and i was already struggling with that but now everything is getting worse. A new type of worse. Im so alone. Only my fucked up mind stuck in repeat.
