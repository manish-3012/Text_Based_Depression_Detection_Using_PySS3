I'm done. I want the darkness.Ive lost so many friends over the past year to car accidents, suicides or most recently getting beaten to death, in my own home. I have no feelings anymore. No emotions, I cant feel the pain im in and i want this state to end. My family left me years ago, havent talked to them since, Dads an alcoholic and mothers in jail. I have hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt from school. I just want to wipe my slate clean, tombstone that reads something rather than nothing. Im a pathetic excuse of a human. Contribute nothing to society and never will. I just want to fucking end it. Close my eyes and never feel pain again, never wake up again.
