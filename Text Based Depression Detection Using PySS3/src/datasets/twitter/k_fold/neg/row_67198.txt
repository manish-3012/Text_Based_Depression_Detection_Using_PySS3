My dad told me..My dad told me, one night, that he sometimes feels like blowing his head off but he's able to fight it off because hes the sole bread winner and doesnt want to leave us struggling. I dont think he knows that I remember him telling me that. At the time I was pretty stoned. I almost told him that I did too but I didnt and now Im trapped with this knowledge... Its getting harder and harder to not attempt to kill myself
