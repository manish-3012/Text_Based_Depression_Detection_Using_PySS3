This is it. I've been here before, the last time that I tried to kill myself I felt just like this.This crushing emptiness. I know this feeling. This swirling fog in my mind, unable to formulate any thoughts of significance outside of "I need to kill myself". I could really use someone to talk to. Anyone. About anything. I need this to stop. I can feel something horrible on the horizon. I don't know what's going to happen. But this end. Today.

I made a post to r/veterans describing a little bit about where I'm at right now. Woah nelly, has my condition worsened since I posted that. If you're interested in knowing about me then read that. I cant, I physically feel like I cant, talk about my depression or suicidality anymore. I just cant. Ive been going over it again and again and again, trying to reach out to different people and orginizatons. I have woken up demons from my past recounting it all that are at this moment preparing my passage beyond the Veil of life. Whats the weather like where you are. What did you eat today? please help me stay distracted for a little bit while I continue to try to reach out for help. I dont know how much longer I have. I don't know how much longer I can take this oppressive silence...
