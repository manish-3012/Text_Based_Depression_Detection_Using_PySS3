Living for other peopleI realized a few years ago I had only been living my life so other people wouldn't be hurt by my death, ny siblings, my parents, my children and grandchild, Im a very young grandmother she was born when I was 38, I was a single Mom for 15 years, escaped an abusive marriage, I know alot of my issues come from my bio father basically kidnapping us and keeping us away from our mom from the time I was 5 until I was 14, I know our Mom suffered horribly and went through hell to get us back, I spent my teenage years trying to be normal and make her happy, I should have been in therapy. My kids are now grown and out of the house on their on doing fine and I'm an empty nester, I didn't know what to do with myself, I had lived my whole life trying to please everyone else and they were gone living their own lives, I felt devastated I became more horribly depressed than ever before, I had been suicidal as a teenager and had several near brushes with death, I began to feel those feelings again, I began planning to leave this world I didn't have anything else to live for, no one needed me and I wasn't able to take care of myself anymore, my job was shit, my friends weren't there for me, I didn't want to be a burden on my kids, I started giving my stuff away, my son picked up on this and I know the little shit put me on suicide watch, suddenly my daughter started showing up out of the blue insisting she needed me to take the baby for the day, my Mom started calling me everyday, they knew before I did what I was planning, I felt so embarrassed I didn't know what to do, I failed at everything I tried to do to make it better, that was last year, then a woman I barely know got me involved in a social media business and I failed at that too but I learned somethings along the way, I learned that this whole time, my whole life I had been allowing all this negative shit in my life, all these bad romances, I chose shit because I felt like shit, I became angry, finally really angry at myself for allowing people to hurt me, I wanted to stop accepting nothing for everything I do, I give everything I got and I deserve everything I want, I started believing that I should be valued and loved and important and it changed the way I let people treat me. It does mean that you lose some friends but if you lose them because you dont tolerate garbage they weren't worth keeping. I started reading about mindset and how you can change your story, you can change the way you think and literally rewire your brain, I'm still a work in progress but I don't let anyone gaslight me or bomb me with their narcissistic narrative, I don't let anyone tell me who I am anymore, I tell them who the fuck I am. I'm finally living my life for myself, if you knew me you wouldn't see my pain, no one does, not anymore, now I'm intimidating as fuck and I don't take the shit people try to hand to me. I finally realized all the people that tried to tear me down in life were garbage bags of shit who saw someone good and wanted to destroy them because they are trash people. I stopped thinking people were innately good and realized most of them just want to use you, I started protecting myself from being used, bullied and trod upon. I see my worth now and it's not because I changed, I changed the way I think about myself! Here's a link that kind of talks about what Im doing, there's definitely more out there but this is like an introduction
