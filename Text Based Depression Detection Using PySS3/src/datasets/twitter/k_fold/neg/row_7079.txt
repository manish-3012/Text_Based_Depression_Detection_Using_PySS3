I can't stop thinking about it. I apologize if this comes off as scatterbrained and missing connectivity, I'm just writing as it comes to mind.

I am sitting here in my room alone and the only thing I can think about is ending it. I feel tired, and for several reasons


 I haven't been happy in my life for a couple years now since a bad break up with a girlfriend who I loved very much. It dealt a huge blow to my confidence and emotions. Since then i've had a tough time being secure in who I am. This has caused problems in relationships i've had since.  I don't even try anymore. 

 I grew up being placed in the Gifted and Talented classes being told I was extremely smart, reaching genius levels. I have never felt like I can never live up to what is expected of me. I sit and watch myself fail, not because i'm not smart, but because of my own self destructiveness. 

I feel like I am losing my friends, I rarely talk to my best ones and it seems like the only time any of them wants to spend time together with me is when other people are there to drink. This is coupled with that I kissed on of my best friends accidental while we were drunk new years eve and we haven't talked since. 

I'm just so very very tired, I want to escape it all and be free from all of this.
