Suicide dreamI have been thinking of suicide for long know.
And especially suicide by jumping.

My thinking led me to a dream related to suicide.
It was scary I almost felt the scare of Jumping off.

Life is just full of possibilities but I guess this is a false hope for me.

The way my physical appearance has changed due illness, depression and anxiety and continuing life despite would be a disaster in its own.

I am wasted I have to go ASAP.
