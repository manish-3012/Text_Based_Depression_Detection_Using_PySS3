Failed even at killing myselfI've just spent 5 min with a hockey strap extremely tight around my neck lying in bed hoping it would cut the blood supply of to my brain and cause me to pass out and die.. eventually I'm like damn this just isn't working, why wouldn't that work? My neck is bruised from where the strap, as tight as I can possibly get it.. wtf.. wish I had a shotgun .. ez
