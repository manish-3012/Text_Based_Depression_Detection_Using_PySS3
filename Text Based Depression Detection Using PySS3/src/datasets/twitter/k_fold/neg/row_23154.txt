i donâ€™t want to die but i think i have to.iâ€™ll just shortly summ up whatâ€™s going on: basically, the rona has made me 1000% more depressed, i used to be a straight A+ college student (got published research, top of my class, mission work, etc), but now iâ€™m probably going to get expelled since iâ€™m failing all my classes and thereâ€™s no coming back from this. deadass looking at the end of my life rn. i find it so stupid how just ~4 months of severe depression could fuck up my life this bad. life is so unforgiving lol. 

itâ€™s so sad, thereâ€™s so much i want to live for too. i have a puppy i want to watch grow up, iâ€™m in a great relationship, thereâ€™s still things i want to do but the semester is ending in 2 weeks and i canâ€™t bear the thought of having to deal with this shit, when i get expelled my loans will go into repayment. oh and on the topic of finances, iâ€™m pretty sure iâ€™ve lost my job. it was a casual job at the hospital where you were just required to work a shift every 2 weeks, but i havenâ€™t come in in a month now so iâ€™ve likely already been fired from it. losing a job over stupid shit like this in the middle of a pandemic... cant get more stupid or lazy than this. anyways, it looks like i just canâ€™t do anything for myself anymore. rereading this all, it looks like i just want to partake in all the fun parts in life, but iâ€™m not willing to put in the work. but even if i did now, itâ€™s too fucking late. my parents wonâ€™t forgive me for wasting an entire semester. they donâ€™t help pay for college but they did co-sign my loans . even if i want to cut them out, it looks like weâ€™re bound together until my loans are paid off so i might as well go to hell even tho aside from co-signing loans, iâ€™ve been 100% independent financially and have lived alone since i was 18. . school is the main reason i have to die rn, my parents donâ€™t give a shit about me and shit is really going to hit the fan when they find out about this. i really wouldnâ€™t mind just being a waitress or something until i have my life figured out more but my mom has anxiety that she doesnâ€™t manage and sheâ€™s just gonna flip. if i kill myself, the loans are forgiven (iâ€™ve checked.) i feel so trapped now and i wish i killed myself earlier in life when i really had nothing to lose and doing it now will be so bittersweet. iâ€™m not ready to lose my life but iâ€™ve reached a point now where continuing it will not be a life worth living, itâ€™s so shitty i have to kill myself because my parents who are barely in the picture at all will make my life hell. iâ€™m really worried about where my puppy goes since none of my friends are going to be able to take him in and i donâ€™t trust my family will take good care of him. iâ€™m so regretful right now, i just wanted today to have a good last day with my dog but iâ€™m just sitting here crying and he can probably sense iâ€™m sad rn
