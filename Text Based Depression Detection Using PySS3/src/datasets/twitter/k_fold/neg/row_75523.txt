I can't think about a single person that would be sad about my deathMy parents don't like me, the people at my new university think I'm weird, I'm lying to my therapist that I'm not suicidal because otherwise they won't fucking help me. I'm just on the internet all day and even here I don't talk to people. I keep imagining one day people will like me but they won't I'm not even capable to make a single friend. I'm sitting alone in my living room drinking wine, not even having the guts to just end it.
Can someone please tell me something fun about their day or something so that I can distract myself from this absolute mess, thanks
