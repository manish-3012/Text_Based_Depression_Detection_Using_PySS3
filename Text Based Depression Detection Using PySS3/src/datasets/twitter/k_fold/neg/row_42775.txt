Almost Died TonightI've never had such intense feelings until recently. Was on this subreddit while I was at the bar earlier this evening. About 30/45 minutes later, I'm outside walking home. Standing a little to close on the street. A van came so close to knocking me into oblivion. I flinched. 

Moral of the story - I'm not ready. I think about it all the time, but in reality I don't want to. It's time to figure out how to deal with these feelings the right way.
