Some tell me you relateI feel like no one understands that for me suicidal thoughts don't go away. Like I'm not gonna kill myself but it's not like I never think of it. My psychiatrist knows and says it's common for people who have survived traumas and suffer from a multitude of mental and physical problems. I'm always afraid to tell anyone though or my therapist bc every time I talk about people get concerned. I don't know maybe I am alone in this but the best way to describe it is:

like a fly in a contained room. You'll always hear the buzz, and sometimes it constant and droning in your ear, but other times you can barely hear, like a soft quick buzz.

I mean its never gone away. I am only 18 but I have never had a time where I didn't think about killing myself. I'm okay now, the fly is rather quiet but like is this normal?
