My dad said people who take their own lives are selfish.A few years ago, I was considering suicide, my parents found out and my dad said that people who take their own lives are selfish. I mean, I get where he's coming from, but, ive been shit on my people my whole life, people have been selfish and assholes to me... while I just sit there and accept it and not say anything back. Now, I can't be selfish one time, while all these fuckers can be selfish and assholes to me everyday. Yeah, ive improved over the years but.. sometimes.. I feel like I can't go on, I'm so depressed and tired.. I guess. At night, I cry myself to sleep listening to Al Green and Alicia Keys. But, there's still things keeping me back.. my best friend (who's kind of a dick sometimes, but still a generally cool dude) and my boyfriend, who's amazing and everything, but my parents don't approve of us and I don't really see him often or talk to him often as much as we used to.. *sigh* maybe I'm just being some little, depressed, piece of shit teenager who just needs to suck it up and accept it. I don't know, what to do. I go see a therapist, but I don't really see her often.. and my parents and I are currently at odds with one another right now and I've never felt comfortable coming to them with my problems.. maybe that's something I can work on.
