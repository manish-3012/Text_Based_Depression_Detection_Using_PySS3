The guy I love wants me to commit suicide with himMy heart is breaking. After finding his suicide notes saved as drafts in his email account the other day (yes, I was snooping but I hadn't heard from him in months and was worried) I've spent the last several days trying to convince him that he doesn't need to die. At the end of our phone call tonight I got him to promise to hold off until January because I'd go with him. I don't really mean it but I had to say something. And he suggested that if we  both died together, that we could be together in the afterlife.

He's let internet stories and books about death and heaven consume him. He believes in psychics and mediums now. He believes the people that claim they've died, went to heaven and came back again. Heck, I believe in God but I don't believe this is right at all.

The reason all this is happening is because his mother doesn't like me. She claims I'm not rich enough for him. I wish I was kidding. Despite all the love I've given him the 6 years we've been together, despite all the times I've forgiven him for cheating (not to mention in his suicide note he actually wrote to another girl and said she's the only one he's ever loved...), despite me sticking by his side no matter what... I'm apparently not good enough because I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Her nagging and trying to please her gave him a straight up mental breakdown. He started hearing voices. Of course she put him into a mental ward for several months.They got him on a drug called Risperdal and it's pretty much ruined his life.

He says he can't feel anymore. He is completely numb. He can't cry, feel happiness, can't get an erection even with viagra. He says its dumbed him down so much that he had to drop out of college because he couldn't follow along. He thinks he's useless and will never be able to be the man I need. I've tried SO hard to convince him that I will love him no matter what but it's not working. And his mother has got him trapped in her house. He's now allowed to go anywhere without her. She tries to confiscate his phone so he can't talk to me. And he's 23! I told him to find a way here but he said she would track him down and pay off the doctors to put him back in the hospital. I wouldn't put it past her - this woman is nuts. Apparently she even hired a private detective to come spy on my family. 

He's currently going to a shooting range with his dad and has been for several months. He said this is the way he's gonna kill himself. He wants me to do the same. I told him he'd have to be with me before I could do it... obviously right now I'm just trying to buy time but who knows... by the end of it all I may just eventually give in. I'm already on medication due to depression of not having him around. 

I can't call the police to help him because they'll just stick him back in the ward again. He doesn't need to be there yet he also doesn't need to be around his mom cause she controls his life. He tries to stand up for himself and for me but he says she "does things to him."  She's killing him and he's scared he'll never get away. The scary part is she is so wealthy that she could pay anyone off to say anything about him (or me) in order to keep her claws sank in.

I don't know how much longer he can last. His spark is gone.



**TLDR:**

- Guy I love has wealthy crazy obsessed mother who has hired private detectives to spy on me.
- Doesn't want me with him because I'm not rich despite me loving him and forgiving him unconditionally for 6 years.
- She gave him a mental breakdown from the stress.
- She threw him in a mental ward for several months.
- The medicine they put him on (Risperdal) has gave him brain damage (I hope not permanent but he thinks so.)
- He can no longer go to school, can't feel emotions, can't get erections, can't cry - feels useless.
- I spied on his email because I was worried as he had disappeared for months.
- Found suicide notes saved as drafts to his parents and to some other girl who he claims is the only one he's ever loved (heartbreaking)
- Despite the above I try desperately over the course of the past few days to convince him to continue living. I am failing miserably. 
- He is tricked by people saying they've been to heaven and returned to earth... he thinks suicide is the right answer. He wants me to do it with him so we can finally be away from his mom. 
- I finally agree to do it but that I need time to get ready. I don't WANT to but I had to say that to keep him breathing for at least another month. 
- I'm scared I may actually go through with it if I can't figure out a way to help him. He can't go back to the ward and he can't get away from his mom either... I'm at a loss.
