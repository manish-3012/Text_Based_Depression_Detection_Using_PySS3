There's just no point to life.Why should I stay alive when nothing matters? When everyone dies and everything will be for nought? In 150 years nobody will remember me, so why should I keep trying??   
Everyone tries to give me reasons but they're all bullshit. Nothing matters so it wouldn't matter if I died.
