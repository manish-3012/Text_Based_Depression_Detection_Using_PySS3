I found the most painless way to dieAnd honestly, its making me even more sad, I've wanted to off myself the most part of this year and I have finally created a plan to do so. The thing is that I will leave behind a wife, a child, and other people who care about me but I just can't anymore, I can't go on with this constant baggage. The method I have planned is an agent that causes respiratory arrest, I'll just get myself really drunk, take some of these pills and die in my sleep. 

Can't be worse than waking up in the morning to just keep on doing the same shit over and over
