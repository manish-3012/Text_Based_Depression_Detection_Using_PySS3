I don't want my life to be a lie.I pretend im fine, I pretend what I have is mine.
I know nothing of the outside.
Only what controls me inside.
I wish I had the flesh to do.
What it is that makes me feel alive.

Too many times I am taken back.
Only to be scared by the reality.
I take a knee.

I have a lot to give.
I love a lot of people.
I climb a daily steeple.

A breath for the sake of breathe.
I let it consume me.
I let it berate me.
I let it take me.
I let out the fake me.

The tote, the rot. 
What is mine, what's not.
What is left, what is mine?

There isn't much I wouldn't do.
To let my mind speak.
To do what I know is true.

I can't leave behind a legacy of the one that gave in. Is answering im fine to an 'are you okay?', just a lie? I don't want to lie. I just can't burden them with the truth. I can't say what I feel. I can't say no because im scared they won't have the answers. If they don't have the answers, does that make them liable? Im too concerned by what others think to end it. Irony is that the very thought of what others think of me makes me consider it.
