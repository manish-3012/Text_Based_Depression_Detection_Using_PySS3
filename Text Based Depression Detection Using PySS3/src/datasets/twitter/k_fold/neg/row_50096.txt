KmsThink Iâ€™m abusing meds too much now.  Been taking codeine x temazepam as itâ€™s a great numb.. only problem is this was my last batch and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to get more... I should have saved it for a proper dosage so I could painlessly stick a knife into my upper arm artery, thatâ€™s how I think Iâ€™ll go. 

I always picture overdose or bleeding myself will be how I do it. My family member hung himself but I donâ€™t think I could do it that way.
