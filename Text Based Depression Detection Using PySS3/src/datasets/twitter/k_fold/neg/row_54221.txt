My piercing was the last dropI've been depressed since I was 12, I've finally reached the bottom at 20. I am so disgusting and fat because of all my comfort eating, but I'm too depressed to even keep mold out of my sink, so going to the gym feels mentally impossible. 

I do nothing but isolate myself and don't respond to my friends and family. Everything drains me. Everything makes me so fucking anxious. I panic just hearing people outside my apartment, it's exhausting. I just feel trapped in my own rotting mind and body, unable to help myself.

Long story short, I had to remove my septum piercing yesterday because it had healed so horribly due to me getting sick early on in the healing process. I am not happy with it, but I feel so fucking disgusting without it.

I've been fairly suicidal this year, but after removing the piercing yesterday, I got instantly suicidal. To the point where I didn't even feel any hope at all. Everything seemed absolutely pointless, and I felt like I could have gone through killing myself that very night. I always know I don't *actually* want to die, I just want an easy life. But fuck me, yesterday all of that went out the window. It was almost a bit calming feeling how much I wanted to seriously end it. 

I felt pretty fucking stupid about it because it was all over a piercing. I just felt like my whole self worth went with it. It was like the straw that broke the camel's back.

Now I don't trust myself. I always felt like I'll manage despite my depression, but now, I feel so on the edge. Like anything could push me to killing myself. I'm so done. I booked an appointment with a therapist next week, although I've gone through 2 already so I don't have much faith. But I feel like it's gonna be a struggle getting to next week. I just need meds or some shit...
