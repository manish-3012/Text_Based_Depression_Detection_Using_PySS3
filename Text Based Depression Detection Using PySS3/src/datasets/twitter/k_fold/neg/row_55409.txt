I know it sounds patheticBut I truly canâ€™t live my life without her in it. She is the one for me and sheâ€™s gone, instantly moved in with someone else, and tossed me aside like a piece of garbage after 5 years. And Iâ€™m not even mad Iâ€™m just so fucking sad without her... she is the only thing I want and if she isnâ€™t in my life I canâ€™t find any purpose anymore. I know itâ€™s sad. But I canâ€™t shake it. I just want to be gone.
