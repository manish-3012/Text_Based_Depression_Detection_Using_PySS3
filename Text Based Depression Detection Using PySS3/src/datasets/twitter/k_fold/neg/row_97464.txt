Iâ€™m socially isolated and it feels too late to fix it.I (24f) was severely depressed through most of junior high and high school. I made friends easily but lost them just as quickly when they realized how depressing I was to be around. I also have social anxiety and always declined any offers to hang out outside of school/work. So after high school I didnâ€™t really know how to socialize with people my age and just kept to myself. I didnâ€™t go to college (I did actually but I kept dropping out a couple weeks into the semester due to anxiety/depression). I mostly just worked all the time or helped my mom with her home daycare. I lived with my parents until I was 22. Now I have coworkers that Iâ€™m friendly with, but no actual group of friends. Or even one real friend. I just have a lot of people Iâ€™m friendly acquaintances with. Itâ€™s depressing. I live with my sister (20f) and she has friends over constantly. Itâ€™s honestly embarrassing that she has people in and out of our apartment all the time and all I ever do is sit in my room and watch tv or play on my phone. And they all know it. I said something to my sister about telling my friends something and she jokingly replied â€œwhat friends?â€ I saw the guilt cross her face right after she said it as she realized itâ€™s not a joke and I literally have 0 friends. 

It feels too late at this point to make a group of close friends. Even just 2-3 people is all I want but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible. Everyone already has their circle. I donâ€™t even have one friend to introduce me to new people. And I think about going out to meet people, but I honestly donâ€™t even know what people my age do or talk about anymore. I have no stories to relate to anyone because this has been going on so long. Iâ€™ve done nothing with my life.

I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m fucking. Depressed. I can hold a conversation. Iâ€™m kind of funny. I donâ€™t think people in my life would guess that I feel this way. Like extended family that barely sees me probably assume I have a lot of friends. But I honestly donâ€™t know how to connect with people beyond small talk. I donâ€™t know how to fix this.
