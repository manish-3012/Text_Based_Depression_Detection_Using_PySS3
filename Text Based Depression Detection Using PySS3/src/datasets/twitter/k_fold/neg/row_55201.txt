I wish I never met my boyfriendHe is the perfect man for me in almost every way. Kind, adorable, funny, driven, passionate. He's survived so much but he's still the gentlest soul I've ever known.  


Last night we cuddled in bed and I asked him what he would do if "something ever happened to me". He knows me well enough to understand what I meant by that. He told me he'd probably survive long enough for the funeral but wouldn't be able to go on living much longer.  He's had his fair share of challenges in life and my death would be breaking point for him.

I've made a huge mistake in dating this wonderful, perfect man when I know what's coming for me. I can't kill myself as long as he cares about me, but I don't know how long I can hold on.
