20 year old newly wed with a 3 year old, but no one to talk to.I wouldn't necessarily say that my thoughts would cause imminent danger to me, but it's pretty much all I think about right now.

I'll give the tl;dr version of my background and fill in if need be.

* My mom is a narcissistic overlord who has caused me and my three older sisters tons of psychological damage over the years.
* I had a baby at 17, married his father after dating for 4.5 years about 6 weeks ago.
* I have no friends that I can confide in. My sisters have nothing to do with me because I'm seen as a major disappointment, and all of my childhood/high school friends abandoned me during or shortly after my pregnancy.
* Our marriage was brought on by me getting kicked out of the only home I've ever known and almost having my son taken away from me (not because of negligence, but because of guardianship issues due to me being a minor at the time of his birth).
* We live with his parents. I adore them a lot.
* Even though I'm a teen mom, I went to school for several semesters before being unable to keep up with work and school work.
* When I left my parent's home, I was worried about losing my insurance through them suddenly and unannounced, so I weaned myself off of my antidepressant a lot faster than normal. For three weeks I had to deal with nightly panic attacks and a horrible physical uneasiness 24/7. Finally past the withdrawals.


Right now, I just feel so alone. My husband tries to comfort and help me, but I can't confide in him the way I would be able to a close girlfriend. I try my hardest to maintain friendships, but I can never manage to. I bend over backwards to try, but it's never reciprocated, so I eventually stop trying. I'm about 90% sure my husband's love for me wouldn't exist without us having had a child, which also adds to my feelings of loneliness. I have essentially no genuine relationships, and my future just seems so bleak. I have no hope that my current situation will ever get any better. I know I'm a shitty mom because even though I do the basics (bath, feeding, teeth brushing, etc.) I never feel like being in the same room as him. I have no hobbies that I'm good at/enjoy, so I occupy my time with reading or Netflix. If I'm not doing those things, I'm thinking about the way I could leave this earth that would leave the smallest impact on my child.
