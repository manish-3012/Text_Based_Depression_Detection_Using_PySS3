Why the fuck does it take so long?I laid on my floor this weekend. In the sunlight that was coming through the window. I laid on the floor with the bullet and I just kept looking at it. Just thinking where to put it. Under my chin? Side of my head? In my mouth? I have a large field behind where I live. Iâ€™ve decided thatâ€™s where Iâ€™ll go to do it. Wonâ€™t leave a mess in the house. Body bag, carry to the truck to the trash. Well, after Iâ€™m cremated that is. 

I have another lawyer call this week moving closer to the final divorce. Hoping next month is where itâ€™s at.  As Iâ€™ve said in other posts, I have to wait until the divorce is final so I can change the insurance so she gets nothing. My life is over. Each day I wake up, Iâ€™m acting. I should get a fucking Oscar for this performance. If only they all knew that Iâ€™ll be gone one day.
