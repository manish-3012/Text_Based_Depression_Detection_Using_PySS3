My friend is in an awful spot and I don't know what to do.Hey reddit, never thought id be posting here. So i have a friend that I play LoL with and I'm sure she's serious because we've shared pictures of each other over text. A bit of background about her: She's trans (Male to Female) and EXTREMELY depressed and suicidal almost constantly. She trusted me enough to share that she got raped a few years ago and this is where her problems stem from. She also grew up with an abusive step dad and had an abusive ex that i helped her break up with. Now, her current boyfriend is verbally abusive but she says that they really have great moments most of the time so doesn't want to break up with him, and he's only bad when he's angry. She tried hanging herself again today. She's had a lot of failed suicide attempts in the past, and cuts her wrists/arms frequently. I assure her how much I care for her, but she has an awful self confidence and self esteem, possibly the worst i've ever seen, and doesn't fully believe me. She thinks she's hideous, fat, dumb, and bad at anything she does. She's skinny, cute, seems at least somewhat smart from what I can tell, and is good at what i've seen her do. Whenever i tell her this, she says i'm lying. On top of all this, her mom is neglectful and hardly feeds her. She has me, 2 close friends in her life, and her sister that she actually trusts fully. I don't know what to do anymore, and i'm getting scared that I won't be able to stop her sooner or later. She refuses to seek help or find a therapist. This is longer than i wanted it to be, but i just need to know. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
