Iâ€™m so scared of people that the idea of getting a job makes me try to kill myself but I need money to live. Iâ€™m scared and donâ€™t know what to do.Iâ€™m so anxious about being around people that I literally just canâ€™t do it Iâ€™ll start applying for jobs and then Iâ€™ll think about being around all those people and I try to strangle myself. I have someone to keep an eye on me but idk what Iâ€™m supposed to do. I need money to live but thatâ€™s not really helpful if I kill myself and Iâ€™m pretty sure if I somehow do manage to make it through an interview Iâ€™ll just kill myself at work. Iâ€™ve been trying for months to look for a job and the idea of working with people is so scary to me that I would quite literally rather die. I tried to look for resources but all I can find is essentially people saying youâ€™ll get over it eventually just get a job. I tried that but it just made it worse. And my state gives a whopping 25 bucks a month to people who canâ€™t work because of mental illness.
