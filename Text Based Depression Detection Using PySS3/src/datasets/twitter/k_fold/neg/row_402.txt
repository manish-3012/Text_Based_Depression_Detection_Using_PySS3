I guess this is it.I always knew that Iâ€™d end up in the obituary section of a small town newspaper. My grieving parents would find a picture of me (maybe one from high school) and it would be pasted in grayscale between â€˜Doris Smith, 88, survived by seven grandchildrenâ€™ and â€˜Emory Deacon, 56, who succumbed after a long illnessâ€™.  People would see that I was only 24 and wonder what happened. *Was it a car accident? The poor dear probably had something terminal. Itâ€™s a shame to see someone die so young.*

Is it? Iâ€™m 24 years old and I donâ€™t remember what itâ€™s like to be normal. This dusty room and my elderly parents are all that I have left in the world. The anxiety is constant and the panic attacks even happen when Iâ€™m sleeping. The doctorâ€™s office smelled like Lysol and the nurse didnâ€™t mind when I cried. The white pills make me drowsy and the small green ones make me sweat. I canâ€™t stop grinding my teeth but they say Iâ€™m getting better now.

I accept that Iâ€™m dying and offer this as my final testament: Paradise is understanding. Words are better wasted than unspoken.  I would have named my daughter Adeline. I canâ€™t stop grinding my teeth and I would have named my daughter Adeline.
