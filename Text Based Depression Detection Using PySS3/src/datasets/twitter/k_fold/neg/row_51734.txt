Feeling terrible/PTSD after accidentI got into a car accident yesterday and I feel absolutely terrible, I accept responsibility for it but I cant help but to feel bad, I can't eat, I cant sleep, i cant focus on anything, the accident just keeps replaying in my head. No one was hurt thankfully but I just hate what I have put the other person through having to deal with insurance and getting her car fixed or a new one. I feel like such a terrible person because I'm usually very careful when it comes to driving and I dont know what happened yesterday, I suppose I miscalculated how fast she was coming and I ended up turning too fast. I know theres nothing I can do now but the pain and guilt are terrible. Not exactly sure why I'm writing this here but I could really use some support right now, I feel so bad.
