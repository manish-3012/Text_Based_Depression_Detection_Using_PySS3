Going through a divorce, bankruptcy, and looking at losing my homeI bought a water hose and duct tape this morning. I'm currently sitting at the location where I will take my last breath. I connected the hose to my exhaust and ran it in to my vehicle. I turned the vehicle on and stayed there for a couple of minutes. I couldn't finish it. I turned my vehicle off. I'm building up the courage to finish. I think I've almost got the courage again. If I'm not mistaken, it only talked about 15 minutes and is painless. I wish I had another choice. I don't know if I'll respond or not.
