my birthday is in two days, I don't want to be here for it.I turn 28 on January 8th and do not want to be here for that. I have nothing to show for my life that justifies deserving another year on this planet. I don't have a career, boyfriend, friends, nothing of merit. I have been on this earth for 28 years and have absolutely nothing in my life. People my age have so much going for them in multiple areas of their life, and here I am just a worthless loser. If I go out now at least it will be over.
