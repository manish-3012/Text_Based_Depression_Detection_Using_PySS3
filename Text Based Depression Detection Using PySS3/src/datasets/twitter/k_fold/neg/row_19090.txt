Just not okay, frequent thoughtsI've had therapy and it helped for a while - have a boyfriend who I love but who is deep in his own depression who is regularly horrible to me now if I try and raise the love and support I need ( after supporting him for months) .

He knows I've been self harming , given myself bruises constantly to the point I can't walk properly.

Can't tell my family because they worry and have contributed to a lot of my bad mental health.

Can't tell work as bf works at same place and I work with vulnerable people helping their mental health.

Can't tell friends.

Just frequent thoughts now and no one thinks I'll actually do it. If I express feeling suicide I get shouted at.
