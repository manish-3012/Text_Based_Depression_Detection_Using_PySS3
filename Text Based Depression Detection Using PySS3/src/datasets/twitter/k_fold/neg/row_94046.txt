Have Passive Suicidal IdeationI just wanted to start out saying. I have alot of good things going on in my life at the moment. However it seems like every other weekend I have thoughts of wanting to kill myself.

Background:

Lived in my grandparents house with my mom, sister, grandparents till I was 22. 

(never knew my dad but he beat on my mom and nearly drowned my sister as an infant, country records declared him dead)

Mom was doing her best to get a home of her own and move us out of grandparents house. Became disabled from drunk driver hitting her. Had enough money from settlement to put down on a house and sister and I moved with mom and stepdad into house.

At Grandparents house Have worked since sophomore year of high school. Money went to pay medical bills for mom, groceries and gas. Had to drop out of college to work full time. Work takes my mind off of what's going on at home. 

At New house working and paying off mortgage
And still helping mom pay off medical bills. (house is in her and my name) mom is disabled can't get job. Sister had mental breakdown and left. Stepdad has been living off grid for long time hard for him to get work. I joined the military and send half of my pay to pay mortgage and help them out by sending extra cash if emergency pops up. 

Grandparents took in sister and she is in serious debt and blames my mom and stepdad for kicking her out this has caused a huge divide in my family. Neither side wants me to speak to the other. 

Now I'm 24. I have no credit card debt or student loans. Mortgage is covered every month have my own vehicle (payed in cash) , live on base, and food is covered by meal card. I'm in a much better situation after joining this year. Even though I'm living paycheck to paycheck. 

 I drink heavily to not think about my current situation. Maybe I feel guilty for being in a good place for the first time in my life. While every else is still struggling with debt. I don't know. Part of me wishes to deploy so I can die and have my family get payed out to pay off debt. But because that isn't likely I just want to end my own life. 

I just don't have or see purpose in my own life at the moment.
