I just want the pain to stopI am really tired of all this pain. After going through years of gender dysphoria and depression, I just can't get the pain to go away. I feel like I wasted years of my life trying to obtain something just out of my reach and that all of my efforts to be a normal girl are failing. Everytime I look down at my body or open my mouth to speak I want to die. I tried hormones, I tried vocal therapy, and it never feels real to me. I can't sing and I can't laugh and I can't reach out to people the way I want to be.

At least I want to wait until after Christmas; I don't want my family to think it's their fault. They honestly tried their best but I was born broken.

I'm really scared.

I'm scared of what will happen to my soul if I commit suicide. I want the pain to stop so I want to go to heaven or at least reincarnate as a normal girl, but I'm scared I'll go to hell. I don't think God would put me through all this suffering just for more suffering though. That's why I'm praying to God for forgiveness. 

I just want to be normal. I just want to laugh and sing like a normal girl but I know I can't. I can't detransition either because I was more miserable as a guy. I'm really scared and tired and just sick of pain. I'm really sorry guys but I don't think I can do it anymore.
