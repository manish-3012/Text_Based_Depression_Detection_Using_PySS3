Think i might set a dateNever used to understand the posts on here saying theyd set a date to kill themselves but i think i get it now. I tried the old going to a bridge to jump off thing earlier, i just collapsed and wept on the floor before i even got over the railings. Plus it was a motorway bridge and i didnt want to hurt anyone else. So i think im going to make a plan and do some proper research to find a way to end it, set a date, maybe write some notes. Theres no end to my panic attacks and the intrusive thoughts just wont go away no matter how hard i try. I miss my old voices. The new ones arent nice. The world is so unkind, i think the sooner the better
