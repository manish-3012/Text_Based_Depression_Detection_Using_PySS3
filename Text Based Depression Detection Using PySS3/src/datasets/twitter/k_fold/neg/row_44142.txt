Is it too late for help?Today, I really want to kill myself. I havenâ€™t felt this weak in so long. It makes me feel disgusting. I hate myself. I hate my weakness. I hate that i canâ€™t just live a normal life. I replay in my head taking his gun and shooting myself over and over again. But once itâ€™s over, thereâ€™s no going back and that scares me. I know this feeling is temporary but it feels like it takes over my soul. Like Iâ€™m nothing but this anxiety. I canâ€™t imagine my children finding me tho. I canâ€™t imagine them losing me and thatâ€™s literally all that keeps me hanging on. I love my kids more than anyone could ever imagine. They are my life and my reason for living. I wonder if people would love me more if I were gone. Would they think of me as a good person? Or would I just be some chick who blew her head off and nobody gave a shit about? And Iâ€™m alone. With all these thoughts. And Iâ€™m scared. I fear him leaving cuz idk what Iâ€™m gonna do to myself. I feel extremely hopeless. Like I havenâ€™t felt in forever. And I just wish I could die so all these feelings would stop. So all these thoughts were gone. So the struggle was over. But itâ€™s never over.
