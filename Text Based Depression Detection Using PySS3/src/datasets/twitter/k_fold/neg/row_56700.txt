"Friendly" and calm breakup has turned bad.I posted a few days ago and got some positive replies, but now things seem to have gotten worse for me.

About two weeks ago my partner of three and a half years left me. She was unhappy in the relationship due to mistakes I had made and probably due to boredom as well.

She has been trying to be nice and friendly about it all, trying to explain where she can why she feels this has to be done. Trying to be my friend still and help me out when I need it. But due to my ever needing ways she has decided to block me out completely.

I am at a great loss here, I do not know what to do. I feel like there is very little in between how I am now and me attempting to take my own life.

So many people have told me taking your life over a girl is the worst reason ever to do it, but there are other factors, but this is my biggest issue with life right now.

I don't know what I'm expecting from posting here. I find it helps me a lot to vent to others, and I can go into a lot more detail if anyone asks.

I don't want to feel miserable any more, but I want to understand why this has happened, why she feels the need to make us both unhappy by doing this.

Thanks for reading.
