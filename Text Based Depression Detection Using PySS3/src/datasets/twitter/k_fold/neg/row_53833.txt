I'm 16 and my parents have gone through divorce and I cant copein 2019 my parents decided to divorce, along with other family issues (that i don't want to talk about) tore me down bit by bit, late 2019 I found that i did nothing but watch Youtube on my bed for hours straight, I didnt study, and hanging out with friends and exercise helped me believe I was mentally stable, 

My 2 sisters and my mother left, while i decided to stay with my father, I feel like im to blame for this because I was a mistake and my parents married to take care of me instead of love, For the longest time I thought i coped well but looking back I never was productive and wasted my time a lot, My Dad told me he wants me to live with my mum because he could also tell I was not coping well and that he dislikes living in Australia, as it reminds me of my mother and my relatives, so he wants to move out of the country, The divorce was inevitable and both parents told me things were off  right after the marriage, I didnt see this so when they told us I broke down, I had a moment late last year where i realised, Oh shit im really fucked, when my teacher told me i didnt do my homework for 3 weeks straight, I had a mental breakdown after school but my friends helped me that time, 

Today my dad told me he should leave as it easier for both me and my dad and makes both of us happier. I broke down as soon as I got to my room, I dont think ill commit suicide but im very close, hence me posting here. how do i cope? please help. please help.please help me/
