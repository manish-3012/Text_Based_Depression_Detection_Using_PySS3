Wanting to die, but at the same time, not wanting toThere's no in between, and both options suck. I wish I was dead, but I would meaningless and just another stupid statistic that people will recite in their mental health power point one day if I did. And yet, I'm tired. I don't have anyone who cares about me in the long term, and I really don't want to be here anymore. My whole life has always been awful, and it just keeps getting worse. Im hurting a lot.


However, no one cares. I've tried so hard to get people to notice (and have even told them) that I'm hurting, but everyone just ignores it or jokes about it and me always being cheerful and kind. I've only told my therapist about my suicidal thoughts (not wanting to be here, being tired, always hurting, stupid emotional stuff like that), and she told me I wasn't suicidal and if I was I would have already killed myself and not looked for help. 

I don't know how to get others to understand, and the only way to truly make them is to actually do it. However, I don't want that. I know I'm already meaningless, but I don't want to be as meaningless as I will be if I died.
