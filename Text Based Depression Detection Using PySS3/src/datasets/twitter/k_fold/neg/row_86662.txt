My momI was having a meltdown in front of my mom and she said, just kill yourself already. I know she didn't mean it and only said it out of frustration, but still. It really hurts and only made me want to do it more. This happened several times before but she only showed disappointment and walked out in those times. I don't hate or blame her for being like that. I understand her frustration. It just affects me worse because it keeps echoing in my mind.
