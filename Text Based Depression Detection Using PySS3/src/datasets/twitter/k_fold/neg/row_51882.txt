I'm scared I'm approaching the point of no return.I've been battling with depression and PTSD for years. I don't think there's a day that goes by where I don't think about suicide at least once or twice.  I never really considered myself as someone who actually might carry it out until recently.

Lately, it seems like I can think of nothing else. I'm just so tired of it all. I don't even want to get up anymore. I get up and plod through the day, doing the things I need to do to take care of my kids, then I find a quiet spot where I can be lone and cry.

Still, I never believed I was at high risk of actually doing something.  This morning, I had a revelation.  I have been unconsciously selling or giving away everything I own.  I've been getting rid of everything I have of any value, and I haven't really even been aware that I was doing it. I was just cleaning house and getting rid of the clutter. But in the last few weeks, I've managed to get rid of nearly everything that makes me "me".  My collection of 1st edition Stephen King books? Gone. My tools? I have a small toolbag with some common household things in it, but the rest are gone. I have almost nothing left that defines "me".  What's left is stuff that could fit in a handful of trashbags and be dropped off at the local goodwill.

I tried to go to a crisis chat line to talk with someone. There was a queue (I was #16 in line). I know I need help. but I don't  know what to do. I've been on medication for years, I've tried mental health counseling.  Nothing seems to work. I think the only reason I haven't already given up is because of my kids, but I'm afraid that soon even that won't be enough to hold me back.

I just wish I had someone I could talk to so I didn't feel so alone.
