Iâ€™m feeling like life is just fuckedIâ€™m in the process of getting a restraining order on my father, and Iâ€™m 100 miles away from home in the town of my best friend, sitting in a hotel alone every day spiraling further and further into a psychotic mess. 

I canâ€™t even begin to think about what to do to stop the spiral.
