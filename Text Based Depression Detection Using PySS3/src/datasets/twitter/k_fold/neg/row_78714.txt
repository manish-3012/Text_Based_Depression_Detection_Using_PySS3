I'm feeling incredibly suicidal lolI finally got another interview for full time at my job. Something I've needed since October. 
I don't want it anymore.
I officially loath my job.
I love my coworkers. I love the job itself, but my managers are garbage and it literally gets harder and harder every day to force myself to go....
I'm DREADING going in tomorrow...
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to find a new job and start over and deal with new job anxiety all over again.
I don't want to learn new rules meet new people.
I want my store to stop being shit.
I want to enjoy my fucking job again!
I hate this world we live in.
I hate people.
I hate retail.
I hate myself for giving every ounce of my life to a boy who broke me in the end anyway.
If I hadn't met him... Maybe I would have done better in school. Maybe if I'd cared more about myself I wouldn't have considered his unhealthy controlling bullshit love. I wouldn't have put all of my focus onto him. Idk.

I just know that I want to die.
