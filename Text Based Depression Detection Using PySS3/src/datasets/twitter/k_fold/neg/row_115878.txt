Should I go back to counseling?I get constant mood swings and in a happy one I decided to go and quit. Now (month later) I've relapsed and my depression is through the roof. Don't know how I'll survive till the end of this week tbh.But I don't wanna go back to counselling. I feel guilty for taking up his time, don't want to accept I'm a failure and I quit and told him I won't be coming back. I don't want to seem dependent or weak by going back either. Don't know which way to go.
