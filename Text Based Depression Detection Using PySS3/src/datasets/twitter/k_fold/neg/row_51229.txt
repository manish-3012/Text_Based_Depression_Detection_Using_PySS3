TiredIâ€™ve basically been comatose for two days. I donâ€™t have any friends. I have nothing going for me.

Now since my ex-best friend is gone Iâ€™m able to go back to my eating disorder without feeling alienated. The next time she sees me sheâ€™ll be astonished and wonâ€™t recognize me. Iâ€™ll be skinnier than an ironing board.

Then next is suicide. Sheâ€™s going to be the first one invited to my FUNeral. Sheâ€™ll be the one in my Will to receive all my belongings. I hope she takes them. Especially because Iâ€™m going to call her while Iâ€™m in the middle of dying.

Iâ€™ve read about what it feels like to die. I honestly canâ€™t wait until I do. Whether youâ€™re in pain or not at all, I hear in your last moments is like a sigh of relief. I know Iâ€™ll be taking that route.

So for right now Iâ€™ll be safe. This long-term plan is in the making.
