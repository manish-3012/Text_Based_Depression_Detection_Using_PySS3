Why canâ€™t we just kill ourself? Why is it that everyone forcefully tries to keep us alive???Like, itâ€™s my life and my choice, so why is it, that if I (for example) talk to my doctor about these thoughts or if my attempt fails people force me to go into a clinic, even tho itâ€™s not my choice and I wouldnâ€™t harm anyone but myself.
I thought we had a â€žfree willâ€œ but this world just feels like prison.

It almost feels like abuse, forcing us to something we donâ€™t want.

And how is it that people who end their life are called â€žselfishâ€œ but isnâ€™t it even more selfish to force someone to stay alive even tho all they want is to die just so they donâ€™t have to â€ždeal with their deathâ€œ??
