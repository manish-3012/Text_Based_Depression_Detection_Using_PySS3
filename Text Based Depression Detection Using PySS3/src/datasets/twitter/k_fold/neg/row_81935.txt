I am going to kill myself in 4 Years, and 17 days.I am turning 31 on the 16th of September. I have struggled through life the entire time, I had friends in highschool and for a while before they all left for the city, but I was never popular. I never had a girlfriend, or even went on a date with anyone, I have crippling shyness and cannot talk to girls without making a total jackass out of myself. I have grown up being  insulted and abused by my family and peers. I have a god awful job that I cannot quit because I care for my parents/have commitments. I will never own a house of my own and so constantly live in fear of eviction having to find a new place for me and the folks. I lost some weight, I started going back to church, I tried approaching some women and all it got me was nothing, nothing but more heartbreak. In summation my life is a total waste and not worth anything. I am giving it 4 more years, if nothing happens for the better by the time I am 35 then I am checking out. Hopefully I will die of natural causes before then.

That's it. This will be a marker in 4 years time I will come back here and either write I was wrong. Or Sayonara.
