Back to LifeIt is a bit strange to post here again... 

I'm here to report, that i failed hard on commit suicide. Kinda funny if you ask me. Well... i thought my life would be better after i visited a clinic last year... 
That ended up in being more depressive and more self-hating. Last year november i had enough. I was very unstable and my bf left me. I ended up in taking around 200 - 300 pills and cutting my wrist. I thought i was really going to die. But little me was to stubborn let go of life. So i'm here. 
I tr to turning to a new leaf and embrace my life but it's really hard. Learning to love yourself is the hardest thing to do for me. I still hate myself but slowly i want to see the nice side of me. Idk if that helps... or justify me to rant here about my life... :/ 
But yeah well. I'm struggling... 

The worst thing about surviving is that no one trust you anymore in being not stupid and re-read some convos about your family being helpless.

Yeah... if you want some more rant details just shout for it...
