I shouldn't have gotten a girlfriendI started dating this girl that's always really liked me, and I realized that if I end up just impulsively killing myself she'd get hurt even more. I absolutely love this girl. When I'm with her, I don't even think about killing myself for a single second, but once she's away, it comes back and it feels stronger than normal since I'm not used to not having suicidal thoughts at all. Is it wrong of me to keep dating her, knowing that I'm a ticking time bomb?
She knows about my condition, and helps me as best as she knows how to, so it's not like she doesn't know, but if feels so wrong to put her in a situation like this.
