light switchSome of my earlier childhood memories include me wanting to die. Well, not necessarily die, to be fair. My therapist told me children dont usually know suicide. And it is true, i still remember the moment in my early teens when i realized suicide was ''a thing''. Before that moment i never thought of the idea that people actually had a choice in ending their lives, so i would just watch action movies with die hard type of heroes and think to myself: why would they keep going? They could just let it go and fall on a pit or get shot, anything, and it would all be over, they wouldnt *have* to live anymore. I dont know where or how i got this idea that life was so hard. Wasnt anybody else feeling it? I mean, we have to wake up every day and do so much things all the time. Its so tiring and the world is so shit. And i was a middle class white kid form a happy loving family, so trust me, life wanst hard for me. 

Anyway, i would sometimes imagine a light switch. In my head, if i turned that switch then i would have never been born. As a kid I always thought that i would do it if i had the opportunity, just for the convenience of it all, you know. Since ive grown up it became so much more complicated. There are so much people in my life, so much possibilities and i keep telling myself that i cant give up because maybe in the future things will be great and i wont think about it anymore, so if i were to turn it i would regret not having the happy life i might have. For a long time i thought i would never use that light switch if it was in front of me. But today i would like to use it.
