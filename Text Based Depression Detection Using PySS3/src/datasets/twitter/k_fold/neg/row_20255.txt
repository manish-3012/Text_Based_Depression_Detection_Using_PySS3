I'm going off the deep end.I've had depression since 5th grade, and I'm currently a junior. I've never been this bad. I'm just getting out of a ~1 year relationship with a guy who did nothing but torture me the past few months of it. I've been dealing with a lot of law shit because I decided to go to the police about my molester. My father lied to me (again) about giving up alcohol and his girlfriend who destroyed my family. I'm failing classes when I thought I was doing better in school. I've isolated myself, hurt myself, and tried to kill myself multiple times, all resulting in throwing up the pills involuntarily. I can't bring myself to talk to anyone or eat, and can hardly get out of bed. My depression has never been this bad in my entire life. I started smoking cigarettes, and it feels really nice, but only for about a minute. I hate going to therapy, and every medicine I've tried makes me feel like a zombie. I don't know what to do anymore. People are constantly asking what I'm going to be when I get older, and I honestly have no idea because I'm not good at anything, and nothing makes me happy. I honestly just want to end it all. People would be so much happier without me, and I'm not doing much while I'm alive, so why not, right?
