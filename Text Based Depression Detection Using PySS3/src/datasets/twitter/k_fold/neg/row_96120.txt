I keep making regrettable mistakes. Kill myself ? [SERIOUS]My old high school teacher invited me to lunch and i made up an excuse. i dont think she bought it and now she wont even respond.
my point? i don't have one. similarly, i dont have a life.
I've tried to improve it but my relationship cycle is in a loop.
Make good impressions &gt; become friends &gt; drop them when the going gets tough.
i cant f*in handle it. I'm so weak. My new job? The 2nd day, I didn't show up for work. I didn't call-in either. I didn't even call to quit. I don't know wtf to do. Depression wills wont cure my cycle of bad actions. I seem to be out of control too. Im just sad with these struggles.
