I'm giving myself until May to go through with it.So I have several months where I can pretend things might just happen to get better.  But I'm too beaten down to work for it, so I don't think that they will.

I'm graduating with my second degree in May, and I'm going to be $80,000 in debt.  I was long-term unemployed before this, and I've been grasping at straws trying to get an income or anything at all and I'm failing.  I don't anticipate that I'll be able to get a job after this - and it's funny because my degree program has a solid employment percentage, it's not like I chose someplace that was total shit.  I just don't have any real-world skills.

This is just me getting up the courage to kill myself before I end up with nothing.
