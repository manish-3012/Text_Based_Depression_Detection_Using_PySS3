Already took the pills and am just kind of waiting.My entire childhood was spent being sexually and psychologically tortured by various people, my teenage years were much the same.  I've spent the last five year being pushed from one parents house to another and no one really wants me around.  I live in the middle of nowhere. I can't drive. I have no friends and my family doesn't want anything to do with me.  I'm too smart for my own good and just can't see any possible future.  I don't want to live like this anymore and am very tired.
