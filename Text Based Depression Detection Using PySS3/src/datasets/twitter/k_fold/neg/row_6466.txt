Would this count as a suicide attempt?I was cutting my wrists last night and i was trying to cut deep enough to hit a vein. I wanted to die. I wasnt directly trying to kill myself but i was hoping i would. I cut pretty deep but didnt hit my vein like i was hoping:/ i dont know if it really counts as a attempt though because i didnt hit the vein.
