I hate feeling like this every dayI've tried committing suicide at least a few times a week with the same method that isnt going to seem to work. I can't tell my parents how I'm feeling cause they are both sick and already stressed. I have barely any friends to tell about this. My partner dumped me and im still not fucking over it. I just want to kill myself. I'm 15 and I already know that life isnt that good. I just want to be hugged by soneone I love...
