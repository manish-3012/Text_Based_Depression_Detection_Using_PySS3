The EndThis is not the end. So things arenâ€™t great in my life as of this moment in current time. Living is not easy. Not for myself, not for anyone. I think about the days of my past and how I would rather go back to childhood. Then I think about how the scariest parts of my existence have been childhood. But then, to my imaginative state of mind, I think differently. And maybe itâ€™s not so bad after all. This is not the end.
