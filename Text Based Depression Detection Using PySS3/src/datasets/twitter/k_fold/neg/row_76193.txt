Feeling NumbI think Iâ€™m gonna go through with committing suicide. Iâ€™ve been planning on it for a while. Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for 3 years now. Itâ€™s getting to me I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to live the life I want because of it. Iâ€™m a little afraid Iâ€™m gonna get interrupted and not die, because it will just fuck things up for me more. Iâ€™m trying to talk myself out of it but I canâ€™t. I feel numb and apathetic. Iâ€™m not crying right now like I usually am when Im considering suicide. Not sure what that means. Iâ€™m afraid of who I am right now, Iâ€™m gonna kill my self and I feel nothing. I do wonder what my life couldâ€™ve been. I think in some ways Iâ€™m already dead. I donâ€™t know if this is the place for it, but I just want someone to hear who I really was not the fraud I played. Iâ€™m sorry mom itâ€™s not your fault thank you for your kindness and my little brother I know youâ€™ll miss me Iâ€™m sorry I wonâ€™t be there for you when youâ€™re older. Thank you for listening.
