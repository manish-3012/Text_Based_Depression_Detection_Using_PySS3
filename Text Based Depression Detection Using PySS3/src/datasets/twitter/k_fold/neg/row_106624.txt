Everyone hates meWhy does everyone hate me? I didnâ€™t do anything wrong to you guys. Everyone refuses to be my friend irl and no one wants to be my girl friend. Why does everyone else has friends and all the guys have girlfriends except me? I just donâ€™t get it. People online always leave me even when they say they wonâ€™t. The best friend I ever had left me almost 2 months ago and I really miss her.
