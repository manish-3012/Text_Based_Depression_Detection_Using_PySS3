Kinda just done ig.Sorry about the new account and 0 karma this is a throwaway.  


Basically I have depression and they think I have bipolar too. I'm on sertraline and the meds don't feel like they're working. Last night my dad and mom both got insanely mad at me over a small stick and poke tattoo I gave myself a few months ago. Which is understandable ig, bcs like its a homemade tattoo but they said a lot of really really triggering things to me and idk it just sucked. They basically told me my depression isnt real and that I should just grow up, that my cutting was stupid and if I really want to cut I should cut them too, stuff like that. They got me help but they don't understand which is what pisses me off. My grades suck, my social life sucks, I barely talk to my friends, I can't sleep, I can't eat, I don't ever feel like waking up, basically everything sucks. In addition to that I have fucking derealization and nothing feels fucking real. I don't feel fucking real. I'm done with being misunderstood and being sad and being not real. I'm done with everything. I've said goodbye to everyone except my parents already. I'm gonna make a short video for them tonight then take all the tylenol in my medicine closet. I'm fucking done. That's all that's my rant. Thanks for listening.
