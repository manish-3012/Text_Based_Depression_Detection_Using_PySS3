I think Iâ€™m gonna do itCanâ€™t stop thinking about it. Nonstop. 

Incessant intrusive thoughts. I am so tired. I canâ€™t keep going. 

Thereâ€™s a CVS a half a mile from me. I think Iâ€™m going to go buy a bottle of tylenol and just take the whole thing. 

Iâ€™m on a campus. Donâ€™t want anyone to be traumatized finding me. Should I just wait 24 hrs and call the police then? Or longer?
