I have a feeling guys get no attentionI'm in no position to help anyone cause I feel miserable all the time but generally people flock to me to listen and give me shitty advice.

Whereas I think men don't have that option cause even though I thought they were treated equal, they always say that no one cares to even listen which at first I thought they were just delusional but it may be that I was the delusional one.
