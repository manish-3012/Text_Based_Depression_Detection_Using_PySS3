Ready to goThere just doesnâ€™t seem to be much to live for anymore, girl I love moved to New Zealand for 3 months and is going to Hong Kong for 3 months, I thought sheâ€™d be back in 6, but now she may go back to New Zealand, I start college tomorrow and Iâ€™m just so scared, I wonâ€™t know anyone there and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be good at the course Iâ€™m taking, and it seems like all of my friends have left, I just think itâ€™s my time to go
