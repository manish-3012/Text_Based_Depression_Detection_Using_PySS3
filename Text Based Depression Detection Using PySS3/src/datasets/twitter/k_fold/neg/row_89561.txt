Fuck dude.I hate writing these because of all the backlash I got on my last post asking for ways to kill myself. Iâ€™ve searched high and low for multiple different pills that would end me. Idk why this shit has to be so difficult. Iâ€™m so tired of living. Iâ€™m so tired of having to be awake. And when I sleep itâ€™s even worse. Because i have these really vivid nightmares about everything being in shambles in a life where Iâ€™m the main character and usually at the end I find myself sitting somewhere with a knife in my hand debating killing myself. Whether I should slit my throat, or my wrists. And Iâ€˜m trapped in my dream watching myself contemplate which way Iâ€™m going to die. Iâ€™m  laying in my bed right now and all I can think about it how fucking peaceful I would feel if I wasnâ€™t here anymore. If I was just - nonexistent. No brain function. No nothing. I wouldnâ€™t sleep and have nightmares, I wouldnâ€™t have to be awake and live a nightmare. I just wish for death so bad. Itâ€™s all I want out of life anymore. Do any of you ever feel like this? Like thereâ€™s literally nothing else you wish to do but die. Like everything would be solved if you could just go to sleep and your brain stop working for the rest of forever. I canâ€™t even properly explain the feeling. I wish you could all step inside my brain and feel what Iâ€™m feeling for a second so I didnâ€™t feel like I had to find the words to make people really understand the utter dread and desire of death that I feel. Words could never do the way I feel justice. I just want it all to end. Itâ€™s just all I want you guys.
