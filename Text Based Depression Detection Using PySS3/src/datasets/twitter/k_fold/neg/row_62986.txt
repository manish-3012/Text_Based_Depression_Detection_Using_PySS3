How to muster up the strength to end it allSo long story short, Iâ€™m rounding out the last semester of my senior year. I did pretty well the last couple of semesters and got accepted to a really big university and everyone is really proud of me and my achievements. I go to early college so Iâ€™ll be graduating with both my HS diploma and Associates degree. Parents are planning a big graduation thing for me, family and friends are coming into town, parents are taking me out of the country for vacation, etc. Problem is, Iâ€™m currently failing one of my classes with a 63%. If I donâ€™t manage to bring this grade up to a 70% I might as well die. Think about all the things that will be fxcked up: no graduation, university rescinds my acceptance, everyone disappointed in me, parents wasted money on college deposit and other fees, and will overall change the course of my life from being a successful college graduate to being a low-life failure. Wish I had the strength to go against my natural instincts and kill myself if shxt goes south to the point of no return, but I simply donâ€™t have the courage to do so. If I donâ€™t pass this semester I will have to find a way off of this earth, I obviously donâ€™t want to die, nobody does, but it may be my only choice
