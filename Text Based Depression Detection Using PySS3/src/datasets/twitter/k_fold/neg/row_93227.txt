One of my acquaintances came up to me today...I was walking by myself in school and he happened to pass by me and he asked "Hey man! How are you doing?"

I gave the typical answer of "Doing okay."

He jokingly replied saying "Only okay? Well at least you don't hate everything and want to kill yourself. haha"

I didn't know how to respond to that so I just gave kind of a nervous laugh. 

Little did he know.
