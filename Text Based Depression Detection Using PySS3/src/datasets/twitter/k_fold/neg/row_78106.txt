Iâ€™m not suicidal right now but I feel like I am at risk of actually doing it at some point in life...How can I stop feeling like this? 
My moods are unstable, I go from feeling great to feeling shit every few days/weeks.
Now that Iâ€™m legally an adult itâ€™s like who can I even talk to for help as my mental health is nobody business or responsibility.. and I donâ€™t want to put the burden on them to help me or whatever.
Iâ€™m quiet as fuck in social situations, I look forward to going out but then I end up feeling like shit because how quiet I am.
I would love to change and become healthier in mind. 
This constant cycle of feeling like shit is one day going to get the better of me and I want to prevent that
