Feeling more dead than aliveJust spent the weekend with my only relatives who really love me, my grandparents, one of whom was just in the hospital with pneumonia for the past month and a half, and the other of whom is in hospice with late-stages Alzheimer's.

When they go, I want to die too. I feel like my parents would get over it, my aunt never liked me in the first place, my other aunt is estranged from the family (for which I don't blame her), and my uncle is dead (suicide, about ten years ago). My friends are either shallow dipshits obsessed with money or sex or just themselves, or else they're just too busy to deal with me because they have their own problems. 

I've never had anyone who really loved me, the way an SO would, and have instead been raped and abused by the people I tried to love and be loved by.

I am dead inside, a living dead girl. The only thing "worthwhile" about me is that I have a "good" job, but in the end, who cares about that? I've been depressed for years and have seen more than I ever wanted to from humanity.

This sounds like a suicide note, but I haven't decided how I want to die yet. But it's only a matter of time.
