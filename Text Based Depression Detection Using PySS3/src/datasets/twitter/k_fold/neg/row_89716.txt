I'm scared because it's getting darker by the minute.I'm just so done. I just can't keep going. I tried everything I can think of, for as long as I can. I just can't take it anymore. Living every day as a huge disappointment to myself and everyone else, it's easier to just kill myself and let it be done. Everyone says that I'll just be hurting everyone else, but no one seems to care how much it hurts and how much I suffer every day just being me. I can't take it anymore, I can't fake it anymore. I'm just done and I'm scared because I just got out of the hospital a short time ago and I don't want to go back. Being there just made everything worse. I want to end it all, I can't keep arguing with myself all day everyday. The meds, the therapy, none of it helps. I don't want to exist anymore, and I just want to sleep.

I'm scared because I want to just let it go, but I'm so worried about hurting other people because that's how I live my life. Always trying to take care of other people and not let them down, but that's all I do anyway, so I may as well just get what I want in the process, right?

I just want to sleep and not worry, not be sad, not think. I think that time has come.
