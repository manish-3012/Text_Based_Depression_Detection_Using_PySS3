There isn't a single person who gives a damn if I exist or not. So why shouldn't I just end my life and fi b ally be free of emotion and stress?My parents told me I should kill myself because I have no future. Girl I was in love with told me I should kill myself because I am a waste of time and not worth caring about. Best friend banged the girl I was in love with in front of my eyes and now I'm on the edge and ready to finally just give a big old middle finger to world and say good riddens. If anyone wants to help be my guest but I don't know what I should do beyond ending myself.
