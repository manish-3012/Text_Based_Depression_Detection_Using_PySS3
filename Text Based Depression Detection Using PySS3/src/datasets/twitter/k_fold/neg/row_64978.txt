Some thoughts.23 M here, been suicidal for nearly a decade but Iâ€™ve always told myself that there was no way I could put my family through the pain of burying me, lately as of the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve had a much darker outlook on life despite things technically being better for me than they have been. I feel like I should be happy with the events that have happened in my life recently, I have every reason to enjoy myself, but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t know why, I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been more depressed than I ever have been in the past, and nothing directly happened to cause it that I can think of. I just woke up one day and my barely existent will to live wasnâ€™t even there. Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending my life constantly, literally envisioning it with any object I see thatâ€™s capable of it. I donâ€™t know how much longer Iâ€™m going to be able to hold on anymore.
