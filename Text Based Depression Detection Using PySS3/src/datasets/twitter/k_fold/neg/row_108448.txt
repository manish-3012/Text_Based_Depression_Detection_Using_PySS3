Why bother?I wake up everyday, go to school and deal with a vast majority of people I donâ€™t like with some good people now and again. Then I just go home and do homework, sleep, and start all over again. 

Itâ€™s gotten harder recently because I am the one who helps others when they are stressed or feeling depressed but now I feel as if there is no one to turn to. 

I want to just end it and let everyone else continue on with their lives, not like it will affect them that greatly. One less student to grade for my teachers, one less child to feed for my parents, and one last person people have to bother with at school. 

Why should I bother to keep getting up and doing the same boring routine every single day? Why shouldnâ€™t I free myself?
