Tomorrow is my birthdayIt really upsets me to think about it. I'm almost 20 and i live with my parents. That wouldn't be a problem if i actually contributed anything to their well-being, but i don't. All my online contacts hate me because they know how useless i am.

I was hospitalized and went inpatient a year ago. All i wanted to do was go inpatient so somebody could confirm something was wrong with me. Something is wrong with me. Quite a few things. Schizotypal personality, major depression/dysthymia and psychomotor issues, GAD, i'm codependent, i have no money and no friends, no car no job. I have migraines (cluster headaches but they're functionally the same thing) and neck pain, scoliosis. I have gender dysphoria too. I dissociate a lot and doubt myself. But then i go outside and realize i'm not normal.

I've tried and failed to get my hands on drugs. I wanted to try something medicinal and therapeutic, but never wanted ssris. Can't get weed. Alcohol only works in the moment. Wanted psychs or ket but can't get it. Therapists prescribed wellbutrin and citalopram. I don't know if wellbutrin worked because i took it slmost a year ago and my memory is bad. Didn't take citalopram. Took buspirone but it had too many side effects. Anyway, i was thinking about killing myself by spring. I'm not particularly worried about dying, but i know one of these days it'll be my fault when i don't wake up again. I guess i'm supposed to be sad but i don't feel anything right now except for an achy body, foggy mind and stinging eyes.

Anyways, i didn't even think about making a reddit account until i googled "i don't care about success" and "i'm too far gone" and found some posts from here. I don't know why i'm making this post. It's not gonna change anything to make a post on reddit.
