nothing makes me happy and iâ€™ve lost empathy towards everyone and life itself. i will never be happy and think everything is meaningless? is all hope gone? should i just do it?and i feel that everyone deserves to lose me because theyâ€™re  not doing as much to keep me in their lives.

i feel too sick to live but like mentally, you know? like my brain is just too sick to feel happy and alive and reasonable and functioning again but no i hate the world, i hate humans and i hate our society? what more reason do i need to NOT leave the thing that makes me suffer in the first place?! i have no friends, my family hates me because iâ€™m gay, i donâ€™t have anyone i truly emotionally connect with, and iâ€™m lonely as hell.

whatâ€™s the fucking point? whatâ€™s the fucking point to keep on pushing a wall?
