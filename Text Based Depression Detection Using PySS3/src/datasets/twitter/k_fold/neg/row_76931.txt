I honestly cannot cope anymore. Someone help me.I have posted here before ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dmcxq/hello_sw_this_is_me/) , [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dspaw/hello_sw_this_is_me_2/) )

For the past 2 weeks, I have been feeling VERY depressed. I got kicked out of my sister's house, and now I'm struggling hard, financially. I feel like my girlfriend is going to break up with me soon, the only person I truly love in my life right now, and I honestly feel like I don't deserve her in general.

I went to the movies with my girlfriend and 2 friends of her last night. Afterwards they went to a party while I went home (not much of a party guy). On my way home, for some reason, I drove through my old town where everything with my family happened. It was a very weird/depressing experience and I spent an hour sitting on a bench in the park crying in the middle of the night (2AM)

I woke up very depressed and I can't even be bothered to get out of the bed. I am supposed to meet my girlfriend in an hour, in which I wanted to talk about our relationship, but I have been crying for the past 3 hours and my eyes look like an absolute mess.

I just want someone to talk to. Sadly, I have lost all of my social circle within the last 2 months due to them getting girlfriends/moving out.

I'm sick of everything, and I honestly can't stop thinking that ending things is the best decision right now.
