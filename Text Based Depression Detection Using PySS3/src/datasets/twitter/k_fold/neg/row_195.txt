I feel ready, but Iâ€™m not brave.Iâ€™m ready to go now. I feel it... I imagine this is what older people feel like. I feel like I have lived this long life but thatâ€™s because itâ€™s been hard...I have PTSD Iâ€™m a pussy though cuz I never went to war... just with myself and my life. Every time I cry it bring back every other time Iâ€™ve cried and every bad feeling that came with that crying... so whenever I do it ... it goes out of control.... Iâ€™m in a relationship thing and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m being abused or if Iâ€™m abusive..l itâ€™s probably both but when I say we should separate Iâ€™m a evil person.. itâ€™s not like he wants the same life I want.... Iâ€™m not even sure why Iâ€™m writing this .... Iâ€™m definitely not going to be here in 3 years...I have this feeling that me trying to get a second degree and a better career will still not work out in my favor as it didnâ€™t with the associates in business....or working in mental health.
I want to do it right now but Iâ€™m so scared but I need to be with my grandmother... she loved me the best and Iâ€™ve missed her this past 4 years. She left me here like this though so Iâ€™m mad...oh and on top of everything Iâ€™m a black female...
HAHAHAHAH what a wonderful life to be living now at days....  google says black woman are the least desirable of all women and we still fall behind Asian men on this spectrum...my dad has never been a good parent to me because I made a bad decision to not live with him at 12 and I have like no friends of my race because Iâ€™m not the average so I can even find any sameness in my race.... I feel like I have to prove Iâ€™m black enough to receive black love and community.it makes me anxious if I canâ€™t afford to tip because I am black my hair fell out too ... I could keep going but Iâ€™m feeling like crying now and Iâ€™m supposed to wait at least 3 more years... but idk if I can that long.... maybe Iâ€™ll be brave someday
