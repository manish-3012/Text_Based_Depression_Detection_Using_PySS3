I don't know anymoreI am really not okay right now. I am considering killing myself right now via belt on doorknob.
I am having a really hard time overcoming a gambling addiction that has taken all of my money, and I feel like a complete outcast at school (under 18).
I was sexually abussed by a family member as a child and I really need this hell to end.

No one listens to me when I need it the most.

Please help
