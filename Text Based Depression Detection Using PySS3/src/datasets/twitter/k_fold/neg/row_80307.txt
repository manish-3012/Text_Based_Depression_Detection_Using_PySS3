I'm back to this point againI almost killed myself 2 years ago, the only thing that stopped me was the lack of means to do so in a fashion I deemed acceptable. I didn't want for it to be painful and slow, nor did I want a high probability of failure, and nothing I had access to fit both criteria. Eventually, I pushed past it by focusing on finishing school, and some other artificial things.

But here I am now, back to the same place. I've graduated. I don't have that as a goal to push back the dark thoughts. All I want is an out. I don't want to see the world, I don't want to move somewhere else, I just don't want to be me anymore. I hate myself. Everything about myself. I just don't see a reason to stay my hand. I have no job, no prospects, no girlfriend, no friends within 7 hours of me, and honestly, only a handful of people that would care if I died. 

I'm even forcing myself to post here because I don't want advice, or "friendly ear" or to be "talked down", I want a solution. I know what the end solution is, I just don't know how to do it.
