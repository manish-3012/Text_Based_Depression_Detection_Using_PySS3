I'M DONEMy 'friends' don't invite me to shit, any girl I talk to becomes immediately uninterested once they talk to me for more than a minute, and the [only girl I've ever dated/loved chose a different guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/ewdm6z/fuck_you/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), and I'm just fucking tired. I'm so fucking tired, not just physically, although that too. I'm tired of trying, I'm tired of staying alive for other people's bullshit reasons. I love my parents but fuck why did they have to have me. I don't enjoy this anymore, I miss being 5. I'm done. I'm just done. I'm gonna go get drunk and hang myself in the woods I'm done.
