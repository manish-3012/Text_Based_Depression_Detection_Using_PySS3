I'm tiredEveryday for the past 2 years I haven't felt anything accept for regret and sorrow. Each time I try to do something that make me happy, it just becomes more background noise to add to the constant drone of life. The only thing that makes me happy anymore is being with friends, but the second I stop the feeling of being an empty vessel comes back. I don't consider myself a suicide risk, but I think about it at the slightest inconvenience and it's starting to scare me.
