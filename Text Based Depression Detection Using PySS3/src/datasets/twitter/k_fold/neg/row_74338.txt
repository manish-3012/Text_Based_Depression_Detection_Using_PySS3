Anyone ever wonder how they'd be remembered?I'm pretty sure, if I killed myself now, I'd be remembered as this slightly smart quiet nobody who no one liked, but the news would call me a young "genius" or something like that just to get views. 

I'd only be remembered fondly by fakers and liars. 

Really shows you how wanted I am.
