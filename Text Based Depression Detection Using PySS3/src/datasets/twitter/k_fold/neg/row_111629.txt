I'm slipping. I want to be special to someone so badly. I don't even know why I'm crying. Nothing changed but I feel so so empty so empty and hopeless and I don't want to feel anymore.Why can't I just mean something to someone the way they mean something to me? Why am I crying? The last thing I said to him before he left was "are you taking your shoes?". How silly is that. I'm just a fuck toy. I'm just a doll and I'm not doing well at anything either so I'm a doll without ambitions or hopes or dreams or talents.
