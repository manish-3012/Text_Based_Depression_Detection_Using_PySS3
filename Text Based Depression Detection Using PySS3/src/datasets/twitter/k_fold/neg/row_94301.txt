I don't know what to doI.... Don't really know where to go anymore.... I don't know who to talk too... 

I feel whiny going anywhere to anyone about this and now I'm sitting in my room with a razor a bottle of vodka.

My dad today told me I'm worthless and he regrets having me

I haven't been able to find a job in 3 years

Ive been cheated on by the woman who I thought would be there all my life.

My sister's don't want anything to do with me

I have no friends

I have nothing to my name except this beaten down phone I got for free and free WiFi I'm stealing from my neighbors.

I've... Got nothing.... I don't know where to go... I... I want the pain to stop but... I'm afraid... I... I just want it to stop
