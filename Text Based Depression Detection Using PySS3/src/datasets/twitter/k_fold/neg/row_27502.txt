Is anyone able to tell me what its like interacting with the suicide hotline?I've always considered this out of list of options, but I'm just.. I'm running out of time here. I've fallen so deep into this hole. I havent gone to work in almost a week now, and I don't know what else to do because I just dont have the energy to fight this anymore. 

If you cant describe it, please just talk to me because I really don't know what else to do.
