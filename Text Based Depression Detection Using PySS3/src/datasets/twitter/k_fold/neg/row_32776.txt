I am so sad and I do not want to existProbably you will not understand me. I seem to have everything, a loving family, a supportive SO and a good paying job, but lately I feel so TIRED.

I do not go to office, even though I know it will ruin my career. I just feel that it is dragging, even breathing is too hard for me now. 

If only life has a reset or pause button, I will gladly push it to get out of this misery. The problem is that I  do not know the reason of this sadness or emptiness that I am feeling now.

I do not want to die, but I think that is what my mind is seeking.
