Hilook, im new to this subreddit, I am not really good at explaining how I feel, whether its on the internet or in real life, I just want to say that I know my problems may not be as big or as stressful. I would like to say thank you for the people who have managed to get through shit that I possibly could not have dealt with as easily, life is so fucking painful, I cannot list all of my problems I wish I could, but I think people might just judge instead of support. Moderators might remove me for some dumb shit, I just need to get this shit out, HS sucks, I really hate being sad, it makes me feel like im being edgy, I dont know if I am, I dont wanna look edge, I dont want to look like a weird kid, people might think im faking, fuck, I have nothing else I can do to express, I cant even fucking cry. My mind is so fucked, so many thoughts r rushing through my brain, fucking help.
