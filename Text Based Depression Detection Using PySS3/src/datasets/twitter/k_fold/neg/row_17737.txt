i wanna die and cease existing but i canâ€™t do iti feel like life is very unfulfilling. iâ€™m 21 but i can never see myself reach the age of 30. i utterly hate my existence. i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™m currently an architecture student and ever since i began my course, i feel more anxious, sad and bleak. i donâ€™t have that many close friends but im used to the loneliness. i can barely go a day without several suicidal thoughts from outright stabbing myself to buying sleeping pills. i hate the feeling on being on edge or just feeling extremely sad and i donâ€™t want to exist. life is full of despair. i get overwhelmed easily and i donâ€™t want to live anymore but iâ€™m too coward to go through with it.
