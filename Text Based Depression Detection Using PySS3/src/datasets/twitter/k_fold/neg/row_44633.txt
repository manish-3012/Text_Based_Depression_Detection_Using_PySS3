Iâ€™ve been thinking of killing myself since my GF left meNow, I realize this looks bad, but please listen. The gf in question was my first serious gf, and in the process I got very attached to her. We always exchanged I love yous and our sex life was great.  But then she broke up with me, said this was it and she liked someone else and didnâ€™t love me anymore. When that happened, I felt a surge of anger and sadness. That amplified when I found out she began dating two people. Turns out she told me to fuck off, because apparently she was getting bullied, and because of that she told me to fuck off.

I donâ€™t know if I believe it or not. But ever since then Iâ€™ve wanted to just end it. Just make it all stop because ever since then I canâ€™t ever just stop being angry and sad. Everyday I wake up pissed and go to bad feeling sad.  I donâ€™t know anymore. Iâ€™m sorry.
