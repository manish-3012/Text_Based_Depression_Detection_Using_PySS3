I need advice, bad. PleaseMy girlfriend was threatening to kill herself  last night. Something shes done before but there was not an accompanied "im not going to." She said i wouldnt call the police, and i dont think she thought i would because i told her i was going to and i asked if she was sure i should and that we could talk, but she kept saying  she was going to.

I called them and met them at her appartment. They went i  through  her window and talked to her. She said she didnt want to talk to me so the officers had me go home. I couldn't sleep. I didnt know what was going on.

 I fell asleep this morning around  7 and woke up to a.missed phonecall from a psychiatrist at the local hospital. After multiple calls without getting to tslk to him i went there ans was sent all around a massive hospital looking for her when they finally called and told me he was callimg me for collateral (idk what that means) and she was transfered. 

But she didnt sign a consent form so they couldnt tell me where. She doesnt have a phone. Ive called her over and over on hangouts and messenged her and emailed her. Her  grandma said she talked to her this morning,  and shes okay, but sje doesnt know wbere she is because she was at the hospital  that  called me when they  spoke. 

I regret calling the police. I need to find out where she is. I dont know what's going on. I feel bad for falling asleep and missing the call. Im so sad, idk what  to do
