I don't know if i can do it. I feel alone. Soon I'll be more alone. I don't know if I can end this though.I'm sorry for posting and re-posting things. Please just ignore me if I'm stupid and annoying and attention seeking. I don't even know if i sould reply for wasting other's time. I just like feeling like someone in this world knows. 

I'm so tired. Everyone would be better off if I was gone maybe. If they woldn't I still want to go. feel so guilty and so tired and so alone.

I have no one to blame but myself for not caring about getting better anymore. it's my fault for wanting death more than a better life. it's my fault.

i'm the lazy one. i'm the stupid one. i'm the childish one, even though i'm not a child. it's my fault for not caring about getting better, just caring about dying.

i'm a terrible person and deserve every bit of my own suffering. it's my fault. i don't deserve the release of death.
