I want to have a plan.I'm not at risk today or in the immediately future.
But I decided I should make a plan, have it ready and tie up loose ends. Such as what will happen to my dog afterwards.
6 years ago I thought college would be my ticket out, but in the end I ended in my parents place, in debt and just as bad as in hs. I don't want to be here when I'm 30; 6years goes by very quickly.
