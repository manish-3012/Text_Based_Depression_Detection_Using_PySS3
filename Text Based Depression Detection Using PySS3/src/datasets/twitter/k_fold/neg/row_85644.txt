i wish someone would help mei want to die all day every day. no matter what i do or how hard i try it gets worse, not better. iâ€™m pretty sure of my decision but itâ€™s so hard to actually end it. i hate having to do the research, sneaking around to try and get the stuff i need, figuring out how to do it making sure itâ€™ll work and i wonâ€™t fail, how to write my suicide note just everything. itâ€™s so hard to kill yourself and itâ€™s the last thing i will ever do i wish my best friend would just help me. i tell her everything. but i have to keep this a secret from her or sheâ€™ll stop me and tell someone. i donâ€™t want to plan anymore i want it to be over.
