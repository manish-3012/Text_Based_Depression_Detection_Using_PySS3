I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m lovable.In all kinds of ways. Platonic, romantic, etc. I always fuck everything up. My own mom killed herself. My dad always gets mad when I get like this. But Iâ€™m just so lonely. And if I say Iâ€™m lonely, I get shut down with â€œyouâ€™re only 15â€. So what? That doesnâ€™t change the fact that nobody loves me. But Iâ€™ve made too many suicide attempts and now everything is secured. Pills, rope, sharps. All gone. But, there is a bridge walking distance from here. Maybe someday Iâ€™ll have the courage to finally jump.
