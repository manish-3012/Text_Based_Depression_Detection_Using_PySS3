I always fuck things up and push people away. I can't live with everything that's happened and the way I feel. It's too much. I can't even get upset anymore, I'm just done.I can't live with the shame, regret, and embarrassment I have. I used to be happy. But all the relationships I had and all the things I had going for me I either pushed away or squandered. For years I always blamed other people but now I've finally just realized it's probably me. I'm sick of wasting the few I have's time.

Fuck this disorder. I can't deal with the mood swings anymore. I can't deal with how it leads me to treating others sometimes. I used to be proud of myself and thought I was a good person but it's clear to me now I was just deluded. My ego and self esteem are crushed and I'm constantly ashamed of myself and the things I've done.

Thank you guys. I've never posted but lurked here for months and was always encouraged to keeping trying. You all deserve the best. I appreciate and am grateful for everything.
