I've decidedThat within a year I'll either get rid of my smartphone for good or shoot myself. 


I know that sounds like a joke but I'm dead serious. I have a ruger. 


These things have ruined not only my life but society in general. And we're all so brainwashed into thinking we NEED them and if we don't give one to our underage children then we're bad parents...


Seriously I've had people tell me I'm making my son an outcast and he's going to hate me. Because I won't give him a powerfully addictive life waster. Because having a phone in his face constantly won't ruin him socially.


 There's no such thing as privacy anymore.
People share the most dreadfully mundane aspects of their lives with literally the entire world. 


They do God-awful stupid things for internet points. Lick an ice cream at the store and put it back. Throw a chair out the window and several stories down into traffic. Why not if strangers give you temporary validation. 


No one leaves their social media echo chambers. You can't disagree or have rational debate anymore and it's put my country on the verge of civil war. 


The individual revolution and it's consequences have been a disaster for mankind. 


I don't sleep good because of this thing. I don't read or make art anymore because who gives a shit about meaning beauty when you've got buzzfeed's latest top 10 yassss queen stupid bullshit listicle. 


I did, ironically enough use it to buy a half acre in the middle of nowhere and a ton of books on off grid living.

 I think the next purchase I make on this phone will be an old school, no-internet, Nokia. 

Because if not, I am going to blow my fucking brains out and I don't think that's too unreasonable at this point.
