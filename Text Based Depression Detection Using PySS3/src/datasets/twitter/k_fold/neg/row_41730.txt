I feel like I don't deserve anything anymoreBasically, that happened when I was 14-15. 

There was this guy in my classroom: he was quite awkward, didn't really cure himself, had a strange way of spelling some letters, got angry quite easily and was let's say.. naive. 

The 14/15 years old be who wanted to act cool thought he was funny, so I'd often make fun of him. I wasn't really insulting him, but rather I was being a jerk: I would imitate his speech, I would ask him for jokes that I already knew that weren't funny just for that cringy situation that would come out as a result, and made stupid jokes. I was being silly, making stupid stories that I thought were funny, and even if I didn't mean it to directly offending him or shit, I'm sure I did, and I'm sure I tormented him. It must have not felt good. 

At the time I felt like after all I didn't offend him, and he kind of did nothing for that by not accepting the joke and having fun. I was a dickhead.

Now I have apologized to him and he forgave me, but I feel like it's not enough. I feel like this is a burden I have to take with me for the rest of my life. I also feel like all in all I'm just a selfish bastard, who is apologizing not only for him but for a relief. 

And this thing really made my dreams, my thoughts of the person I am and all just disappear. I'm hopeless and I feel like I deserve it. It feels bad. 

And there's so many people out there who really have no mercy of bullies and I can't really put the blame on them. I'm not sure myself I'd forgive my bullies as well, as their stupid apologies won't bring back my tears, my happiness and my self esteem back. 

The idea that someone might reject me or hate me for this stuff, and the idea that they might not be wrong, really hurts me. And now I feel like I don't deserve anything anymore and I'll have to carry this burden forever.
