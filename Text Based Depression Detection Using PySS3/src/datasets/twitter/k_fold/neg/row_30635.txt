im closeI have really been struggling with my grades and really am not doing good and just a mess. I'm bi and my family  is conservative and I just really want to come out but I know I will just end up as a disappointment and a failure and probably disowned. I don't want to dishonor my family but what else can I do. I think I'm close to really doing it but I just cant bring myself to do it but I'm so close.  I think I've already hit rock bottom but I feel like I've fallen further. Idk anymore
