i want to diei felt like this last weekend and now its come full circle with me just constantly remembering that ive lost almost everyone ive cared about. the only people i talk to are people at work when im at work and sometimes texting my family but ive never held family as closely as i hold friends so it doesnt mean much to me. 

right now im overwhelmed with emotions and i told myself i would wait to kill myself till new years to give myself a chance but living alone like this is SO painful i cant sit still i punch myself in the face till i have a huge bruise. i dont know how im going to get through this day i just wish i had an effective way to end it right now
