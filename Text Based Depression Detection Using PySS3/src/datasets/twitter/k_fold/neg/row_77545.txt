My only goal in life is to feel happy again. Close to throwing in the towel, and hope someone can relate.I may sound crazy, but this is pretty much my only life goal. It's also pretty much the only thing keeping me alive, at this point. I don't have any talents or true friends anymore either. I've also been severely depressed for the better part of 4 years, and I thought it was just a "phase" at first, wtf. Now i'm almost 19 and nothing has changed.

Yesterday was prom, and looking at my facebook feed depressed the shit out of me. I just got hit with this massive tidal wave of suicidal thoughts, guilt, and reminiscing over past memories. I saw old friends smiling who are (unfortunately, but understandably) no longer part of my life.

I wasted all of my potential so far in my 18 years of life, and it's been a recurring theme throughout my life too. I ended up dropping out and getting a GED and I was "diagnosed with unattentive adhd". While my old acquaintances go to colleges like UC Berkeley, Davis, get jobs, get laid, and move on I'll be stuck here. Or worse, I'll be some homeless bum or junkie who's "Happy now" and sprouts philosophy all day long in San Francisco (I'm not too far).

The truth is this, I want to be happy. But I also don't have any motivation or goals that I want to reach. Any goals or skills I want to learn/reach are all creative, and it's not a guarantee you'll be successful. At all. 

**I'm not suicidal, but I'm close to "Giving up" or escaping on real life. The last time something close to that happened, I was smoking and popping pills. I felt "happy" (or somewhere closer to that word) and I had an okay social circle. Today, I barely have any friends. The only people who want to hangout with me are people like me, lol. I don't want to reach out to all my old "friends" because they'll ridicule me and shit, basically.**

Holy shit. Sorry that was so long. As I type this, I'm close to doing any(or possibly all of these): 
*Call a doc and get help for "issues", whatever the fuck that means.
*Kill myself(or do something dramatic)
*Pack my guitar, clothes, some other useful shit like a razor to shave, and move to SF.
