I'm having ideation again.I've been more depressed than usual but I've been having more thoughts about suicide the last few days. I feel like if I display that I'm hurting, people don't care or they can't let it bother them. I feel like if I were to act in a way that is a call for help or make myself vulnerable, they'd think I'm just attention seeking. I know some people already think I'm pathetic and have no empathy or compassion for the agony that I am in. I feel like if I just committed suicide, then people would finally know how hurt I've been. It would prove that I wasn't a coward. That I was really hurt and pushed past my limit. Maybe they'd respect me more for following through. I just want the people who hurt me the most to care about the impact they've had. But some of them won't and they'll think I'm disgusting no matter what. 

As much as I want to do it, I can't. It would crush my mom. I have a dog that I love that depends on me. And I'm scared to forfeit my life even with as much pain as it causes me sometimes. I wish people really understood the level of pain I am going through. I wish people could see how much the impact is weighing down on me. I wish people took me seriously. I wish that the people who hurt me the most would finally understand how wounded they left me. But one of them will leave me if I ever attempted. I've also thought about how ending my life is beating them to the punch before they could abandon me. Maybe one day they'll understand.
