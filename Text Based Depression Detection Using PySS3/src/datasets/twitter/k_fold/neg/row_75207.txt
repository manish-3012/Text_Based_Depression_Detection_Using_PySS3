There is no point anymoreI don't feel like living anymore, and I don't see how I can. I wish I was brave enough to just take my life, but I am a bit coward-ish, however I reckon soon enough I will just do it. I am battling depression right now, it f'ed me up, had to quit my electrical engineering school last year since I felt no more interest and had no more goal even though attending engineering courses was my dream when I was a toddler. My family is extremely disappointed with me and I get very little support. Due to becoming depressed, I became very introvert which led to me losing my social life and a whole lot of friends. I am not even from this country ( France ) since I am a foreign student from Morocco. Since I am from an Arab &amp; Islamic country, I get some racism and discrimination due to recent terrorist attacks and to how a lot of arab immigrants act here. I am not even muslim, I am an atheist and bi-sexual , which creates another big problem which is that my family are hardline muslim conservatives and they will never accept the fact that I am like that, will probably get disowned. And since I already failed my last Uni year and this one as well due to lack of motivation and depression, I am bound to get kicked off France and sent back to Morocco, where I will have to deal with a discriminatory society that hates on gays/bisexuals and atheists/agnostics and where you can jailed for that. I have no one that cares for me right now and I simply don't have any purpose in life, and I rather die than go back to my family... This is too painful for me now and I wish I was never born.
