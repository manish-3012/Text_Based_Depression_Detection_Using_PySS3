F*ckMy anxiety is spiraling out of control tonight. I'm fucking sick of it. It seems like if it's not anxiety, then it's depression, or some other variant. Fuck this. It's been so long that I've been dealing with these symptoms and I am seriously worried that it's never going to get better. I've been in therapy for over five years. I can't keep going on like this. It's unbearable. And fuck medication. I wish I could smoke weed to help me sleep at night, but it's illegal here. Fuck life. I know that I sound like a whiny bitch right now, but I don't even care. I'm fucking sick and tired of everything. Fuck the world. Why do humans sucks? We have so much "potential" and talent, but we fucking suck. I hate that people hate and continuously fuck ourselves and the rest of the planet.
