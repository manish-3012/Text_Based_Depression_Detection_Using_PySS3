I sometimes fantasize about disappearingI wish I could get lost, just start walking one day and never ever return. Never stop walking. Never turn back. Never be found again.

I know it's not exactly a suicide fantasy, but only because I am a coward to do it.. I tried.. I wanted to. I still very much do.. And I will never be able to because I am an incompetent pathetic piece of shit..

But if I can't kill myself, I wish I could at least disappear.. I guess. I would eventually starve to death but good..
