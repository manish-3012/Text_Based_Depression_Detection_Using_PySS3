We are not irrational. I'm exhausted from seeing people say things like "why would they do that?" "why do you think of doing it?" Like... HELLO? Nobody is born wanting to die and nor do we say or even think it's an easy thing to just end your own life. It's messy, it hurts, it will hurt some people in your life even if they have been long gone from it! Of course, we know that. That's the hard part about suicide, our own pain, and unwillingness to fight anymore and everything is so bothersome that we just want to have the courage to put an end to our misery. Suicide isn't an easy choice nor the first one we think of.
