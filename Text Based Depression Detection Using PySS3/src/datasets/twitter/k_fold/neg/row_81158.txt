Iâ€™ve decided. If my relationship doesnâ€™t work out then Iâ€™m just going to end it.I know what everyone is going to say. â€œIt will get betterâ€ â€œYouâ€™ll find someone elseâ€ but see, itâ€™s not getting better and I donâ€™t want anyone else. I canâ€™t live like this. It hurts way too much. Iâ€™ve been self medicating with vodka (which I know isnâ€™t healthy) but nothing else seems to numb the pain. I keep praying that we will be able fix our relationship but my hope is dwindling. I just canâ€™t live without him.
