Planning my suicide and my will.Today I feel like I really fucked up. I don't want to go into details about what I did cause most people who say I'm over reacting. To put it simply; I annoyed the person I love and care for the most in my life and I don't know if they'll ever treat me the same. This is honestly the last straw for me. 
After realising this I had a mental breakdown. It started an avalanche of negative thoughts. I thought things like "nobody actually loves you", "you deserve to feel like this", "are you going to cut yourself again? This time I want you to bleed", ect. It was the most I had cried in years. I finally thought, "should I actually kill myself?". 
Through my tears, I searched and searched for the best method and place to do it. I researched what was available to me. I searched what was the most painful and least painful death. Once done, I started writing my will and what message I want to leave behind for everyone that impacted my me. 
This world would be a better place without me. I only bring others torment when I'm myself. I am incredibly desperate to be loved when I am no where close to deserving it. I am so fucking selfish. I'm fucking useless. I'm the dumbest bitch I know. 
Of course, the person who started my thought process is not responsible for me and my irritational decisions. It was my fault for even annoying him and just thinking these things.. 
Unfortunately, I'm not going to kill myself yet... Its a permanent thing. I'm not ready to kill myself. I have the tiniest shimmer of hope left. I want to live because my mum wants to see my on my graduation day. That's the only thing keeping me on my feet. But, if things get worse, I already have a plan.
