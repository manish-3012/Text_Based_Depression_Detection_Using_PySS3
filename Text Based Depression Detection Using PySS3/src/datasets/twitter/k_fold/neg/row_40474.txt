Today is my birthday. I'm probably going to kill myself tonight.I'm using a throwaway because there is personal information on my main account.

Today is my 19th birthday. I don't have any friends, and my family has either cut me off or has passed away, so no one knows. I bought a piece of cake from the store but I don't like eating anymore so I'll probably just throw it away.

I got a cat 2 months ago to deal with the loneliness and depression but he's very aggressive and mean and I don't want to say it but... I hate him. Every time I try to pet him or pick him up he scratches or bites me. I had to go to the ER one time because he bit though my fingernail.

I don't have anyone in my life, and I went through so much abuse &amp; a bad drug habit as a kid/teen that I doubt I could ever bond with someone. It doesn't help that I'm ugly. People don't talk about it so much, but being an ugly girl is crushing. It's like people see me as something less than human.

I feel like I don't have anything to live for. Every day is a challenge for me, and I break down in public places more and more frequently. It's embarrassing.

Tonight I will probably go downtown to a spot I saw before that looked good for committing suicide. It may sound weird but this is the first time I have felt good about something in a long time. I am looking forward to dying.
