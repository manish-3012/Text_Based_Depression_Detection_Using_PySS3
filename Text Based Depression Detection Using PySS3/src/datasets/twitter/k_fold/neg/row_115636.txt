My girlfriend attempted a day ago. I need advice please.My girlfriend's family is a bit on the conservative side. Well respected in their community.  They can be strict from what she tells me.  For a second time, nudes from a life before with me were just leaked online. One hit Instagram and was a MEME.  Two people she knew from her family's place of religion messaged her about it. The effect was worse than imaginable. She feels embarrassed, destroyed. Said she felt like she ruined her family's life and so on. I tried to console her over phone. I really did. I thought it worked but I was wrong. 

To make things harder, we've been in a hidden relationship for some time because of her family and how they would react. On top of this, I moved for work to the midwest \(she is on the west coast\). I feel useless from here.

She called me from a hospital yesterday to tell me what had happened and that she was brought in before she could make her attempt jumping off a bridge. I have limited contact with her. She doesn't want her family to find out about us.  Right now her sister and another friend are the ones who know of her condition and no one else. She's on a 72 Psych hour hold by the hospital.

I want to be there for her. I can't do anything from here. She told me not to go over there because it will make matters worse. Please, please advise me. I feel like I'm loosing her and I really just want her to be happy and healthy before anything.

What can I do from here. What should I do? Will they really release her after 72 hours? I'm looking for white hat hackers to help scan and remove the content from the web for one.. \(little luck &amp; knowledge\). Sorry to go on and on, but I don't know who to talk to. I really just want to hug her tight and tell her that I'm there.  

\-My sister is a nurse and knows my girlfriend as does my entire family. Do you think I should tell her? Are there key words I should use when I get to talk to my girlfriend?
