Does anyone else have a lot of rage?I hate everything about life. We think life is important but its not, we are just a bunch of chemicals. Once we die its all over, you wont rember a thing. So why keep living? Who will remember you when you are gone? Who will remember the people who remember you? 1,000 years max before we are all forgotten.
