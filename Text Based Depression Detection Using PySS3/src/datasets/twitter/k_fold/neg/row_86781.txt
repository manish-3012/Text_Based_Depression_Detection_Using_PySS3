I donâ€™t want to live anymoreIâ€™m 22 years old, been in the army for four years I have 3 months left with no idea what Iâ€™m going to do when I get out . I am deployed currently. Tonight I ruined things with my girlfriend and she left me. Iâ€™ve had depression my whole life and thought of suicide often for as long as I can remember and attempted it once with pills in highschool. I only hurt the people Iâ€™m around and I constantly lie to the ones I love and I make people feel bad about themselves and them bad for me with pity. I donâ€™t want to feel pain anymore and I wonâ€™t want to give anyone any more pain. I wish i would get killed out here so the burden of suicide wouldnâ€™t hurt my family and loved ones. I donâ€™t want to feel anything and I wish I could stop existing without hurting people as well.
