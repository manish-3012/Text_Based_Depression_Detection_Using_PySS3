I bought the rope and tied the noose. Angry at everything.I posted on here a couple of times. My mind hasn't changed one bit. After returning from my trip, I got very sick and spent the whole week in bed, not being able to muster the energy to kill myself. Now, however, I bought the rope and learned how to tie a noose. I prepared some towels to wrap around my neck to make the whole ordeal at least a little less uncomfortable. Today, I'll go into the woods to scout for a good, secluded tree and tomorrow night I will go out there and do it.

The closer I get, the angrier I become. Why did I have to become the world's biggest loser while all those poeces of shit out there get to be happy and successful? Why am I so broken and alone while others get to be fulfilled?

I've been so depressed for so long and I wasted my whole god damn life and I can't live with the shame, loneliness and pain anymore. Fuck everything and everyone.
