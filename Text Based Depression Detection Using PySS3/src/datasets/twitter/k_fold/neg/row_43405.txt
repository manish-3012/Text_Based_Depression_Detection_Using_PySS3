Being bald at 20 isnâ€™t fair.Being a 20 year old, Iâ€™m supposed to be out having fun with friends, finding the girl of my dreams and looking for the job I want to work for the rest of my life. Instead, Iâ€™m losing hair day by day and soon Iâ€™ll have to shave it off. (Very soon, probably two months.) itâ€™s unfair and I donâ€™t know how to handle it. Iâ€™ve been suicidal before and now itâ€™s all come rushing back. I dread waking up in the morning. Iâ€™m going to be known as â€œthe bald guyâ€ for at least the next 20 years. Life is unfair and I seem to have lost the genetic lottery. I wish I could just be a normal young man but that will never happen. I miss the person I used to be and I miss the things I used to do. Nowadays, Iâ€™m an empty shell of my old self. Hair loss and depression have taken everything from me and I donâ€™t see any other way out.
