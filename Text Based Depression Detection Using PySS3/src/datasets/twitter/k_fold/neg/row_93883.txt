How do people live in this world without contemplating suicide?I seriously don't understand. Sometimes I feel like I'm being selfish for feeling this way. It's funny because no one in my inner or outer circle know I'm suicidal because I'm scared of their reaction, I know they would never understand because they've never contemplated killing themselves .

My family, my relationship, my whole existence makes me wanna kill myself. I hate this world because most humans only do bad things and are on it for themselves. I know this sounds like the typical rant you find here, but this is literally the first time I admit to anyone I've been suicidal for the past 3 years.

Almost every day I look up on the internet "effective ways to kill yourself" and I can never find something useful. I wish there was less of a stigma about suicide because some people out there would just do it no matter what people say and there's no information on safe and painless ways that you can effectively end your life.

Right now I'm not about to do nothing crazy or anything, it's just this things have been building up inside of me and I needed to vent somewhere. Thank you for reading and I'm sorry for spelling or grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.
