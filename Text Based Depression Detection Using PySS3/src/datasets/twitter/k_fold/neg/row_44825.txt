After promising some people that I would call them if I was on the edge of sucide makes it even heavier for my head
I feel like it's a constant ongoing fight inside my head. A part of me wants to give up but then the other parts try to put barrier and makes me feel guilty... Having no friends or family wouldve made it easier for me I guess.
