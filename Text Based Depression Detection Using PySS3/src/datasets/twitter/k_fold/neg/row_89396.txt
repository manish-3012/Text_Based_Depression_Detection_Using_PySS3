I don't know what to do anymoreI've always had "nightmares" from a young age but they then developed into hallucinations and eventually id start to get panic attacks and they would even happen in the day or any environment where I felt safe even around family and friends. I have been to counsellors and they all say there's nothing going on and that I will grow out of it. well I'm 16 from august and i started having the nightmares at 10. sometimes I think I'm still dreaming and I cant wake up which causes me to feel withdrawn from my own family and sometimes I think I don't love them because they're not real. I'm just very worried about my life in the oncoming years and I don't know what to do.
