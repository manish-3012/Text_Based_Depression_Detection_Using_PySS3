i applied to 3 jobs in a high crime area on purpose.thereâ€™s a town 5 minutes from me that has a few jobs up for grabs and iâ€™m desperate. just overheard my mother complaining about my lack of a job to her boyfriend, even though iâ€™ve applied to over 11 in the past week because i want and need a job desperately. made me super depressed and threw me back into the downward spiral i figured iâ€™d gotten out of. 

anyway, the town 5 minutes from me is constantly riddled with violence and murder and part of me wants to work there on the off-chance i get killed one day. i know itâ€™s not normal of course but it sure does take the burden and effort off of me.
