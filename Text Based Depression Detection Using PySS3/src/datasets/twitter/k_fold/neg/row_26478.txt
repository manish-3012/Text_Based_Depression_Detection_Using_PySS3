I'd rather die than live as fatI've been yoying for the past five years. I've crash dieted and then binged hard and gained weight rapidly. I was also a fat child so I have lots of fat cells and it makes it impossible to get and stay very lean.

I'm also a virgin, unemployed and nothing interests me except eating and lifting weights. But now that I know I will never look and be fit I want to end my life. There's no point to live anymore. I go to therapy but I don't want to get better anymore.

I hate my mother for letting me become fat when I was a young child. I think cutting my wrists is the way I will kill myself.
