Medication withdrawal after an overdose. I canâ€™t cope. Iâ€™m begging for help, Iâ€™m so alone.Two weeks ago I took an overdose of my meds as a suicide attempt. 

After that I just gave up on my medication as it obviously wasnâ€™t working. Three days later I saw my doctor, he suggested that there was no point restarting my meds in order to withdraw, just to ride it out. 

I hate him. I feel like Iâ€™m dying, which sounds dramatic, but it feels true. Itâ€™s been two weeks, I can just about walk to the toilet and back. Iâ€™m nauseous and dizzy, cold sweats, crying continuously. The symptoms have NOT lessened. Not even 1%. Each night I feel worse. 

I desperately want to commit suicide. Iâ€™ve just been lying on the sofa staring at the walls for days. 

Iâ€™ve searched for help online but Iâ€™m stuck and so desperate for help. Death seems like the only relief.
