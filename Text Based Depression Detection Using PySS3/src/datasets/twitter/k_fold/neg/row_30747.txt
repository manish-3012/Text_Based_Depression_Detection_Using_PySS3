Why don't pills work?I tried a multiple times to take some sleeping pills. My highest dosage until now was yesterday. But they don't seem to work. Does anybody know why? 

On the other hand, every time I take them, I don't even sleep late, but rather I wake up earlier than usual. Would appreciate if someone tells me the reason for it.

NOTE: please don't lecture me about other things. Really appreciate if you'd help me only with the answer.
