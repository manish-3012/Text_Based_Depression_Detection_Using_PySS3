F(22) long term hair loss issue have been making depressed for yearsI have been suffering from hair loss since I was 13. After a stressful event that happened around then I shed a bunch of hair. I believed this type of hair loss may have been caused by stress which usually grows back after a few months. This time it didnâ€™t grow back for me and got worse over the years. The mental damage from this long term event did a number on my mental health, added fire to my already existing severe anxiety and depression that I have had for as long as I can remember. Since then I felt I was the odd one out from everyone in my age group that all had beautiful thick youthful hair like all young people should. I was young but I was experiencing the opposite, constantly depressed and hella suicidal about it for years on end. To this day those feelings never changed. I feel worthless and less of a person experiencing hair loss, everytime I look in the mirror, feelings of extreme self hatred would just boil up inside me and at times make me want to rip my hair out. I have seen a dermatologust and found out I had Female Pattern Hair los. I have started medication this year to treat my hair loss and currently on month 5. Theyâ€™ve told me that it take 6 months to see a difference and so far I have seen none and itâ€™s getting me so down most days. I get so angry when I see other people who donâ€™t give a shit about their beautiful thick hair and just always wish they want thinner hair  because it takes too long for them to dry or some shit. People with thick hair are suffering because it takes to long to dry their hair and me with thinning hair have suicidal thoughts every single fucking day about it. I am so sick and tired of feeling this way and wish I had never been born. I feel so worthless with my hair loss and it doesnâ€™t help when most of my family all have no problems with their hair. Idk how Iâ€™m going to live with this for the rest of my life.
