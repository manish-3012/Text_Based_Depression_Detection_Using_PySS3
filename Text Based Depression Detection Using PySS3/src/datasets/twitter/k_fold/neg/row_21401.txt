please helpso my friend is really depressed and i'm trying to help with the whole friend group but it's getting worse by the day. the problem is that when we give advice and just try to talk and stuff it helps for 1 day and then it gets worse again. a few people dont want to help anymore because it is annoying when he talks about it, he doesn't stop and we don't know what to do anymore. please help!

btw, we think it started when 2 people in his family died and then his girlfriend (also in the friendgroup) dumped him because she's gay but he thinks it's because she hates him (she doesn't.
