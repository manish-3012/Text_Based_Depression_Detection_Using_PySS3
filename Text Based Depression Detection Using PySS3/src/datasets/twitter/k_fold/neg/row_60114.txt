My heart is a growing voidI feel so empty, and I don't know where to turn to, so I decided to come here. I have had severe depression for years and have grown up abused beyond belief. I have tried so many antidepressants and am currently on a dose of Prozac but I feel so void. I feel like I have no purpose. I have never self harmed before, but I want to if only to fill myself with any feeling. 

I have tried telling my friends that I am not ok, and they have all told me to fuck off. They call me a depressed burden. I have nightmares every night of abuse and I can barely crawl through the day. My friends hate me, I know they do. I can feel myself developing an eating disorder, and I just feel like I'm not worth much anymore. 

I have been checked into facilities before when going to therapy and all I've wanted was just to talk to someone, but they treat me like a monster. I want to feel himan.
