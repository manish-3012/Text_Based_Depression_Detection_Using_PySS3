idkI've already been trying to improve for years, I'm 22, and it's gotten me no where. I'm physically fit, working on a management degree, trying to find an internship, still I feel the same. Honestly it feels like such a waste of time. The only enjoyment I felt as a kid was making other kids laugh; so I know I wanted to have some sort of positive influence on others around me through my profession. I got ill at 17 lost all my friends and my confidence went with them. Since then I've been trying to push myself, gone out to events and societies to try and get to know people. Nothing works, I've tried to be a good person, offering support and help wherever I can and still have no friends, I know somebody for a day at most and then never see them again.

I've applied to over 100 jobs and I can't even manage to strike one of those. What's the point of somebody like that living? Why is it normal for people to just live to survive, doing the same shit for 50 years until they rot and die, to me it just seems selfish and mundane. Decades of pointless torture.

Wish I wasn't such a bitch and that I could just go ahead and do it already, I fucking hate this shit. 

When I do it, what should be something I plan ahead for to not leave any debt behind?
