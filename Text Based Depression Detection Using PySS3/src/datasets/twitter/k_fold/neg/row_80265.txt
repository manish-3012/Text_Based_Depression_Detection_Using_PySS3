I've made my planI just have nothing keeping me going. I look for the negative in just about everything. I'm always left out. And I'm awkward and weird as fuck. I absolutely hate who I am. I have three bottles of pills that are full. I'm all alone. The only people who will know if I killed myself other than family will be my coworkers, and that's it. I joined the Navy back in August 2018 which is the worst fucking thing I've done. I'm in a job I hate, at a duty station in which I can't deploy, and I'm just hearing about how everyone is going overseas and here I am in bumblefuck Oklahoma as a paper bitch. I'm going to kill myself on July 1st. The reason I'm giving it that long is because I'm hoping something or someone comes along to open my eyes.
