Hi thereIâ€™m going through a bit of a rough tine where my family are just constantly down on me and seeing me as the instigator of every single problem we have since I was age three (apparently my mother remembers so fat back). 

I have the means and the note, but donâ€™t want to give my family the â€œsympathy farmingâ€ if you get my drift. My going on setraline was the worst thing I could do according to my mother. My sister touts herself as he savour of mental health but in lockdown has destroyed any stability I had 

Please reply reminding me my I should stay alive (to ask strangers on the internet for such reasons feels so wrong but itâ€™s all I have right now)
