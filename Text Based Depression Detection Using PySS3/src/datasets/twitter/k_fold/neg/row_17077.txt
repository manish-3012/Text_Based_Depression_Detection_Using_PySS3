If I tell a mental health professional that I have suicide ideation will i automatically be sent off to some psych ward?I hate admitting this but for a really long time I've had suicide ideation. I don't intend to harm myself in the near future but there are certainly days I feel trapped but even in those moments I don't intend to harm myself. I tend to think of it as something that I might have to do in the future: if and whenmy family passes away, if I go blind (I have glaucoma and other vision issues), if I can't find a job and end up on the streets. I'm sure that I should probably tell a professional and I should probably see one anyway because I have horrible self-esteem. I'm terrified of my family finding out, I don't want to hurt them as they already have enough stress in their lives. I'm terrified of talking a professional about my thoughts of ideation because I don't want them to ship me off to some psych ward
