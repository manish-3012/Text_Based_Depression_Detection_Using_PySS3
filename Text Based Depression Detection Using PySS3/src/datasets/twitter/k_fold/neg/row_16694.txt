Are there any live chats or IRC channels devoted to suicide prevention BESIDES Crisis Chat?I'm in an extremely vulnerable place and I really need someone to talk to. I don't/can't do phone calls and every time I try to get into Crisis Chat I sit in queue for like a half an hour before getting kicked to an error message.

I just need to talk and I'm tired and I am so sick of going to bed not wanting to wake up.
