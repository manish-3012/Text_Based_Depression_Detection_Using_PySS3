Even when I'm in a great mood, suicide is still on my mind!I lately have been seeing suicide in an extremely positive and exciting light. Even right now, I feel calm to think about me being gone from this stupid fucking shit world! I'm happy or something, maybe! Not sure what happiness does feel like. Probably makes sense since I don't want to escape pain, I want to die.
