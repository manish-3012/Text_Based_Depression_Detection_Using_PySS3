stuckit feels like it doesn't matter what I do it can be exciting or fun for others but I feel like I'm just walking through it while gravity crushes me i was already going to end it but the only thing that stopped me was I couldn't get to the top of a tall enough building I have tried to work hard exerciser  and put effort in but I still feel the same I stopped my self harm but everything is just fading to a blur I can barley sleep at night I'm tired all the time and have just kinda numbed out where stuff isn't even worth it or they feel awful.
