I fucking hate my familyI hate the fact that my parents were super strict in raising me and breathe down my neck constantly. As if it isn't embarrassing enough being 24 years old, living with my family, still haven't finished college, and don't have a license. My mother worries about EVERY.LITTLE.THING. and it has caused me to have severe anxiety and I cannot complete simple tasks without having a panic attack. I struggle to have any kind of relationship to the point where I just gave up doing that so I just focus on school and working while I spend all my free time on my phone wasting away.I fucking hate that they brought me into this world full of suffering where I cannot be taken seriously by anyone and will always be inferior compared to someone else. I don't want therapy, I don't want drugs, I am sick and fucking terrified of the half-assed condescending bullshit phrases that people say like: "It gets better". No it fucking doesn't and it never will so what is the point? If you are not fully equipped mentally to have children, do society a favor and don't fucking breed.
