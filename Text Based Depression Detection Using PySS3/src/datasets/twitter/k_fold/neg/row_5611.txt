I can NEVER get a good sleep anymore, please helpI used to sleep for hours, at least till 11am. But now I keep waking up at 5, 6 or 7. I went to sleep at about 3:30am but my body keeps on waking up. I want to sleep but I canâ€™t. I also want to eat but I canâ€™t, whenever I do I feel sick and what to throw it up. Whatâ€™s happening?
