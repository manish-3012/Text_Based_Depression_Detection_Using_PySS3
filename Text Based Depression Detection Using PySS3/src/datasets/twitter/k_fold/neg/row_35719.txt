Im so sick of thisIm so sick of crying every fucking day. I just want this to end. Today is an even worse day for me, and i have nothing and no one to help me through the day and help me try not to cry so fucking hard, but its fine im used to being alone. But its still heartbreaking, it always will be. I hate this day, and i wish i could just die and never have to wake up to another miserable day.

Hope you all are having a much better day than me.
