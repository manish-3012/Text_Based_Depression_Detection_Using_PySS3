My final push for helpSo, I was on an anti-depressant that was really helping, but my psychiatrist office changed policies suddenly so now I'm off of it until I can get back home, which is next week. So my suicidal thoughts have gotten a lot worse, and each bout of depression leaves me more willing to die. I graduate in 2 days so I figured if I die tomorrow it won't be my mom that finds me plus I can spare everyone the time from going to a ceremony when I'm like this. But I don't want to hurt everyone I care about, so I figured I'd give myself one more fight to live. So I figured I'd post here and contact professionals that won't baker act me and try to get help from strangers, and only worry those I care about if it gets dire enough. I know how I'd do it too, it wouldn't be easy to access what I need but not impossible either. I just feel lost and hopeless.
