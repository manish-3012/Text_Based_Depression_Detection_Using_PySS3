dumb brainiâ€™m so tired of being suicidal. iâ€™ve been consistently suicidal since i was 11 (iâ€™m 21 now) and i canâ€™t shake it. i try so hard to work to be better, be positive and it fails every time. bc of adhd, i have an inability to execute a lot of things. both my parents have/had depression and my mother drank while pregnant with me so it feels like iâ€™m just inherently doomed to hating myself. iâ€™m at a point where i know i canâ€™t kill myself because thatâ€™s just awful to my boyfriend and family, but i canâ€™t take being me anymore!!! i feel so alone all the time. i canâ€™t take medication because itâ€™s no better than a placebo for me... i donâ€™t know what to do. i had a therapist, but she was a student therapist which is all i can afford so sheâ€™s moved on from the clinic. i donâ€™t know what to do!!!
