Depression/anxiety for years, and the person keeping me going has left me. (xpost from /r/depression)I've been depressed for over 15 years, since some time in middle school. A couple of years ago, I finally went and got diagnosed with depression, plus anxiety and ADD to go along with it. I did therapy for a year and a half or so, and tried pretty much the entire range of medications, all with no noticeable benefit. One of the anxiety medications even introduced me to panic attacks. I never had them before, but it was a potential side effect of that medication, and even after I went off of it my body seems to have realized that now it can do that.

The depression eats everything. I've excelled at pretty much every job I've had, but I haven't been able to stay in one. The anti-motivation I feel, the lack of energy and dread and avoidance I feel for every task and activity inevitably makes me hate every moment of being there and doing that, and makes me desperate to escape, so I quit. Hobbies go similarly. There are a lot of things I love to do in theory--car/motorcycle stuff, video games, playing music, reading, mountain bikes, racquetball, weight lifting, etc.--but the combination of mental disorders first makes it nearly impossible to get myself to actually DO anything, and then sucks all the enjoyment out of them if I actually do.

Aside from that, I've been feeling more and more alone over the years. I'm 30 now, and at this point pretty much all of my friends have vanished into the folds of life, what with their jobs, significant others... their own lives. I don't blame them; that's what happens in life. I've also done my share in letting friends drift away, what with the depression and social anxieties and such causing me to neglect those relationships. I've been really bad about reaching out, and I'm suffering for it.

So much of my time is spent sitting here, trapped in my own mind, doing nothing and being painfully aware of the minutes and the years passing by. I'm caught in a giant web of obligation and guilt and despair and avoidance and emptiness, barely motivated enough to eat and drink water and sleep.

The bright spot in my life was my girlfriend. For the past seven years, almost a quarter of my life, she's been pretty much the only thing I ever actually got excited about. She was always so understanding and supportive about the things I was going through, and I could manage to get myself up and do so much more if it was for her. We had a great life together, and that was the life I wanted to live... our wonderful life, not my bleak life.

Two days ago she broke up with me. She said it had nothing to do with me, that I was a wonderful boyfriend. She said she had just realized that she needed to be on her own for a while. We'd been together so long, and she had never really been single as an adult, and she wanted to find out what that was like. There wasn't really anything I could say to that, so she packed some of her stuff and left to stay at her parents' house. There wasn't any warning to me that anything was wrong... I thought it was any other day, and then my world collapsed around me.

Since then I've been alternative bouts of crying and panic attacks with messaging/calling basically everyone I know, trying desperately to find some shred of... something... to hold on to. And my friends have been wonderfully supportive, some of them dropping everything to come be with me. But everyone has their own life. They come and try to help me, and then they go home. With my girlfriend gone, I'm alone.

Amidst all the usual ravaging emotions of a breakup, all the despair and loneliness and hurt and confusion, my main concern is that I don't know how I'm going to survive on my own. Even before this happened, my depression and other stuff are the worst they've ever been. I've never seriously contemplated committing suicide, because I know that if anything's going to get better it's going to be in life. But that only works as long as I actually have hope that things will get better, and right now I don't see that hope. Even trying to consider doing something, anything, something so simple as turning on some music, just causes my brain to go blank. I can't even make myself eat.

It's hard to talk to my friends about this, because most of them already have a hard time understanding mental illness, and so much of what I feel just sounds like the usual cliche melodramatic breakup crap to them. They have the best of intentions, but to them the answer is just to "make yourself do things, distract yourself from the pain". I couldn't even do that WITH my girlfriend here. She was the one I could talk to before, who could calm me down, get me through panic attacks, help me see why I should keep putting one foot in front of the other. And she's said that she still loves me, and that we can still talk and be friends, but how can I tell her this? How can I tell her that I think I might literally die without her? Even if I thought it would help in any way, that wouldn't be fair to her. She deserves a fair chance to go find what she needs, and I don't want to ruin that chance for her.

The lack of help from therapy and medications from before, the string of new jobs in new fields and new activities that I can't stand, the confusion of everyone around me as to why I just can't be okay... everything I've experienced is making me feel like all my options are disappearing around me. I would go and try another therapist, more intensive therapy, but with no job all I have is my cheap self-bought insurance with a local corporate HMO, and their mental health department is the one that wasn't able to help me before.

So essentially I'm running down on options, time, hope... and the person that was keeping me going has left me. I feel like all there is left to me is to kill time... but for what? Until what? I can't see the point.

Crossposting this myself from /r/depression because... I don't know. I'm lonely and want more exposure I guess. Sorry.
