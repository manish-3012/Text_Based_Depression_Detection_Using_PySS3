Im in a bust.Normally I'm a really big optimist always soaring and pleased. But the past two days I  feel terrible the week before I got into an accident and I'm bed ridden I can't walk or move. I'm always in pain, and when I decide to get on my console to speak to my crush it always feels better. But today and the one before just makes me feel like I'm just a bother to her. And our mutual friends too. Now I feel like I'm bothering them all, that I'm just done. Worthless and someone worth forgetting. It's a tough pill to swallow but I just don't know what to do with myself. If I could, right now I would take the bullet anything. I feel like they all could do better without me. That I could be replaced just as easy. I never really talk about myself to anyone other than my brother but that's all. I lost a friend yesterday too, I can't cope anymore. I just don't feel like I can keep going, I'm just embarrassing myself...
