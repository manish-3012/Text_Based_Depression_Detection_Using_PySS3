I think Iâ€™m suicidal again and it scares meRecently Iâ€™ve gotten out of an abusive situation and begun living with my mom. While Iâ€™ve been here Iâ€™ve had to watch her spiral into these crazy conspiracy theories and listen to her rant about how Democrats are the problem in America and that all of these recent events have just been a set up. Iâ€™m a democrat, and it hurt hearing my mom say this. Sheâ€™s also told me on multiple occasions that sheâ€™s suicidal and wants to drive into a tree or jump out the window. My stepdad refuses to listen to her and she refuses to get help. He doesnâ€™t want to help raise my almost 2 year old half sister, leaving my mom to do almost all of it while he works on his car. So Iâ€™ve felt as if itâ€™s my responsibility to keep her mentally healthy. She still freaks out randomly and every time she does I get filled with a deep fear sheâ€™ll snap and kill her self. With all these things happening recently Iâ€™ve begun to lose hope in having a happy future. I feel out of place at my dads house and my moms house, I canâ€™t move out anytime soon. I canâ€™t tell my mom Iâ€™m suicidal because sheâ€™ll take it personally and itâ€™ll make her feel worse. Maybe Iâ€™m just not meant to make it, survival of the fittest  and Iâ€™m not fit.
