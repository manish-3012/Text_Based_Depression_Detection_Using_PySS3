A message to my sister who is very ill at the moment...I don't know if you will ever read this post, but I know you read Reddit and you are going through some very tough times right now that could bring you here.  

I want to start by saying something that us siblings never really say to each other and that is I love you and really care about you. It seems silly that we don't say it that much but our family isn't exactly the best at talking about touchy-feely emotional stuff haha. I mean it genuinely, I still remember all the times growing up when we would play space ships in my room and I winding each other up at school by being associated with each other, and they definitely make me smile.  

The times I've seen you at Christmas I've wanted to talk to you about what has been going on to make you so sad, to do anything to try and make you feel better. But I get this feeling that it's better to pretend it isn't happening, to not bring it up, to show that what is going on doesn't change how I care about you and my little sister. There is probably an element of our family not being emotionally adept in that too. But then again it is a big important thing that can't be ignored and I feel like you might want to talk about it as you mentioned being in the hospital when we have talked.  

This post isn't well written because I am just a bit lost with it all. If you see this then let me know.
