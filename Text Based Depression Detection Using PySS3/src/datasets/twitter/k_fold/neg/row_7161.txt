The past me, is going to kill the present me.I am 26 years old. Been going to college for 6 years like a dumb ass and still hasn't graduated. I recently had to move out of my dad's house because we got into a fist fight.  I am going to college and can't pay for tuition because my credit fucking sucks from all the shit spending I've been doing when I was younger. The young me took out student loans and blew it, and now that I am actually trying hard to study, I can't get any more loans because I met the aggregate limits. My mom's credit is too shit to cosign me for a private loan. I'm living on my own and I had a pretty girl friend. It's sad because when we first got together I was such a put together person. But now I moved out and I couldn't manage my finances and so I am 2 pay day loans in the gutter and with no money for rent. I'm so fucked, and I don't know what to do. I feel like just quitting with life. I know it's the cowards way out, but I'd rather do that then be homeless. I just don't know what to do. I hate my younger self for being such a stupid shit head and fucking over my present self. My family would always call me smart and that would make me feel accomplished, when in reality I am worthless. It took me so long to develop any work ethic, and at 26, I have no idea how to live on my own and afford it. The only thing holding me back right now is knowing how devastated my mom will be. My cousin killed her self not long ago. I feel like my family is just fucked to begin with. I've been on craigslist trying to pay someone to cosign for my student loan for weeks.  Which is a ridiculous notion, and I've been somehow hoping that someone would actually do it. But now I've come too late, and everything is toppling beneath me. I've been in so many interviews but can't get a job because of my shit credit. I've never been so depressed and suicidal before. I feel like I want out.
