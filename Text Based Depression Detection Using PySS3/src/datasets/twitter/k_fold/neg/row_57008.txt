Right now after I post this, fate will decide if I die or surviveRight after I click the post button I am grabbing a coin and throwing it. I want fate to decide if im worthy enough. If I get heads I am going to end myself. Overdose on some pills. If I get tails I will give myself a chance and try to find help before itâ€™s too late - maybe the world wants to tell me iâ€™ll be able become better. If iâ€™m too weak to make this decision Iâ€™ll let fate do it for me.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Letâ€™s see if I deserve to keep on living. If thereâ€™s still hope for me.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Goodbye :)
