Feel guilty when i read this sub.Alt account because of obvious reasons.
Sorry for the long post. tldr at bottom.

I dont really know how to say this properly. I'll start by saying that i'm from a third world country. In my country it is normal for parents to have high expectations from their children and want them to become engineers/doctors, etc. Same applied to my life sadly. Since i performed pretty well in high school my parents had high expectations from me however lets just say i screwed it up from there. I have been barely passing my exams for the last 5 years and now finally i failed in my last semester of graduation. I held on to my sanity till that point through all the taunts thrown at me by parents, society, etc. However now its becoming almost unbearable since i'm a "failure". My dad looks at me with utter disgust because he cant hold his head high in society anymore. All this led to me feeling that i'm too fucking worthless to be of any use to this world so might as well end it.

But when i read posts on this sub I feel like such a piece of shit because people go through such sorrow that my situation actually seems like a piece of cake when compared to them. So yeah, I basically havent commited suicide yet because I know people brave through much harsher situations than me. So thanks reddit, hopefully i can make it to the end.

tldr - I havent commited suicide yet because when i read posts on this sub i realize that people go through much harsher situations than me, so maybe i can make it through?
