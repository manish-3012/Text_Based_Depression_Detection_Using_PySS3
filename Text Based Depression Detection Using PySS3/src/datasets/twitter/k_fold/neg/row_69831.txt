;It's gotten to the point I can't take it, my mom's a drunk and my dad screams constantly. I'm only fourteen and am prepared to die, scared of blades so there's that, I think I might OD but am not sure, I've been bullied throughout middle school and my friends sister just died, I think I'm ready to finally go.
