Iâ€™m just tired of having these thoughts come upIâ€™m just sick of having these ideas of ways to go and my reasons to stay just keep dwindling down. Iâ€™m sitting in my car on my lunch hour at work in tears because my life is caving in and I have to get my shit together in the next 10 minutes in order to go back in to this mind numbing minimum wage job that is making no dent in my debt, I donâ€™t know if I can even afford to drive to work next week and all I can think about is how great it would be to go to sleep and not wake up.
