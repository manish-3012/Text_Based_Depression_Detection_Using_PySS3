Looking for someone to chat to kinda help a bitIâ€™m a 39 yr old male. Been wanting to end it all for quite a few years now. 
I grew up working and living in pubs and itâ€™s turned me into an alcoholic. I donâ€™t have many friends that I can talk to. For about 15 ish years now I have just wanted to end it only problem I have is 4 children. My wife hates me and at the moment we are starting/finishing a divorce which is making me feel worse and the only thing stopping me is the kids. Now itâ€™s kinda all starting again and have kept it under control now but just need a chat. Have tried all the rehab stuff but I canâ€™t afford the proper help I need even tried Jeremy Kyle as a last resort. Because of the drinking it is putting a strain on budget and my life in general it just seems no one cares. Not out for attention or anything like that just need someone to talk to help me make sense of it all if that makes sense
