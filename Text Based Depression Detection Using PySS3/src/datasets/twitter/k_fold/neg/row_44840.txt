Death is beautifulThis may be a bit controversial but this rant is coming from the heart. 

So I know very little about the world and the things in it. But one of the few concepts about our universe that has always made sense is balance. Action - reaction. In all aspects of life this is present, even in death.

Idk what happens after you die obviously, but I know it'll be special. 

Its the end of a cycle, one that was perfectly balanced. Which could mean that death is just the flipside of life and that both lead towards eachother in their own way. Life leads towards death and vice versa. 

Then every life will have its balanced out, tailored death. And I for one am just curious about all of it.

I probably wont like dying itself as im only human after all. But I imagine it being much like a psychadelic trip. Except one made by your life spent living, tailor made for you by death itself. As good as every second you have lived and suffered. 

I can hardly think of death as a bad thing anymore.. yes people would be hurt but that part of death is quite hard to avoid anyway. 

It just feels right in every way. Everything that lived has died, we are but a small part of life compared to that. 

So very often I find myself thinking that i want to die. Not even feeling that sad or depressed. Though yeah negative thoughts lead me to this place of my mind more often of course. 

Anyway rant over have a nice day. Unrelated question you think hope is a good or bad thing?
