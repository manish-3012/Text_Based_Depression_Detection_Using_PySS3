I think tonight is the night I end it.I have tried to fight this feeling for years, but lately all I can hear in my head is this voice telling me to end it all and to put myself and the people around me out of the misery I cause. So tonight is the night I think I am finally going to give in. 
I'm not sure why I'm posting here. I guess I just want closure. I feel empty. I don't know who I am. I'm unsure of what I stand for. I hate everything I do, and I'm failing at everything. Even my family has told me I'm a disappointment. 
I never have and never will contribute anything positive to society. All of my actions are self destructive and I'm tired of hurting myself and the people around me but I just can't stop.
