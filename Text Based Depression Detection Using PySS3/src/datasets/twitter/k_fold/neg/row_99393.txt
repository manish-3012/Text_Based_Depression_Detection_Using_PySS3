Nothing ever gets betterI donâ€™t know how I can carry on when everything just goes to shit. Iâ€™m constantly irritable and getting in fights with my mum, our relationship is shit. My schooling is shit I have 0 qualifications or anything I stay home all day feeling shitty, friends all abandoned me years ago. Canâ€™t finish school because I feel so empty. I think I should just do it and get it over with. No one cares about me even family. My mother even admitted she doesnâ€™t spend time with me because I push her away. I push her away because she pushes me to aside and itâ€™s only ever on her terms. All she does is talk shit about my dad and she says she enjoys it even though she knows it upsets me, because of how much she hates him. I just wish one person would fucking care. 

Just one fucking person.
