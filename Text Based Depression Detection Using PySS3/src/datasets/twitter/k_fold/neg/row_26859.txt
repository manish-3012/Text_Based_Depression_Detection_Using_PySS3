Iv lost my way I'm a struggling engineering college student (I think) that has slowly come to the conclusion that I end up loosing interest in anything I once had some in(school, relationships, games, life). This past year has been rough as it has been for many and does(n't) look like the futures getting brighter but that's life or so I've been told. As of current I question my career choice and have no life goals nor any idea where to start dreaming some up. I often find I am better at improving or fixing things others have made than creating my own (this applies to coming up with ideas too which often are dissmised as dumb, non-useful, or are plain wrong) which deep down troubles me (both due to my career choice and life in general)as I tend to be of little use as nothing more that a tool. 

I don't eat because I get hungry but because I know if I don't I'll die 
I have no wanting to die if anything that's the one thing I'm sertan of
I just wish I could live long enough to watch the universe do it first, hoping some where along my travels I get hungry
