I'm so, so tired.I'm tired of waking up in the mornings and not being able to think about anything but killing myself. I'm tired all the goddamn fucking time. Sleeping doesn't make it go away. I don't want to sleep anymore, but all I have the energy for in the days is going back to sleep.

I don't know who I am anymore. I don't like myself. I just. I don't know. I want to be a different person, someone who could wake up and be happy without lying to himself. 

I don't know how to deal with life anymore. I don't want to. I don't want to wake up again another morning and spend the next four hours THINKING about suicide. I just want it out of my head, even if that means I'm going to die.

Please please please.
