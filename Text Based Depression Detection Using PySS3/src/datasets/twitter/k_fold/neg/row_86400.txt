Iâ€™m so tiredIts not that I want to die...itâ€™s just I want sleep forever, like in a coma. Im scared of what happens after death...so I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t want to live either. I just want to peacefully sleep forever. I have no motivation to do anythin, not even the things I like. Im getting bad grades and I feel like Iâ€™m worthless. I probably sound pathetic, Iâ€™m only 15. I donâ€™t have responsibilities, I should enjoying high school right? But no....im intimidated by everyone, I canâ€™t even ask the teacher when Iâ€™m struggling bc I get anxious and scared.  I just want to sleep....Iâ€™m so tired of living this boring pathetic life.
