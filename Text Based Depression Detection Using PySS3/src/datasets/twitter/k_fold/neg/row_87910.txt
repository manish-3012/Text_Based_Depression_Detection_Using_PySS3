No immediate plan.. but an abstract planMy mind keeps returning to it. I donâ€™[t have an immediate plan to kill myself but if I think for long enough my mind always circles around to it. That the easiest way out is for me to die.
The only thing that keeps me here is the one person that loves me. I donâ€™t feel like that is right. One person keeping me alive. It isnt enough. She is everything but it isnt right that I exist for one person. So then I want to cut myself open and leave.
