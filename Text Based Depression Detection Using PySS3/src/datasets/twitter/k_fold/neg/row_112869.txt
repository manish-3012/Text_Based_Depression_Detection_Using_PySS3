More help for a friendI made a post here yesterday and the responses were immensely helpful and I thank everybody who replied. My reason for posting is because my friend who has told me she has suicidal thoughts and I've been comforting to the best of my abilities. She found out today she had been denied for something and I comforted her but then said "I'm sure they'll be another opportunity just keep hope" and she replied with she doesn't have hope anymore. This makes me a fair bit more worried as I don't see the topic of losing hope anywhere online so I'm hoping someone who isn't as emotionally dense as I am can help me to instill hope or tell me how I should proceed. She is also completely against going to any type of psychiatrist or psychologist or anything similar despite heavy encouragement from me.
