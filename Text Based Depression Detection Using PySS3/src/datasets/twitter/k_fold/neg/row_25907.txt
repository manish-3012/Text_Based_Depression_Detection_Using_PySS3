Just lost my best friend. Its my fault. Cut again.I just spent the past 2 hours crying my eyes out in my car, and resorted to cutting for the first time in quite a while.. Its my fault, and I don't now how I will do this anymore.. I want to do this and not feel anything so fucking badly. 

I'm sorry, fucking hell :'(
