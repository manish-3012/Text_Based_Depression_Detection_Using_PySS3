Seeking solutions to avoid the oneHey guys. I'm not excited about life, but 2 things would make my life more peaceful and ease the struggle.

1. Free and good medical care to solve my back problems and stomach problems
2. Free place to live (no rent/mortgage)

If I could get #1 I could then at least work more enthusiastically (don't like working, but at least I wouldn't be in pain 24/7) and try to achieve my goals (which would get me #2)

But, if I could get #2, then my daily back/stomach, etc. pain would be lessened and I would have more peace of mind and time to do things that might help it like yoga, etc. After working, I am too tired/in pain/stressed/and have no energy to do anything.

Any ideas for one or the other?
