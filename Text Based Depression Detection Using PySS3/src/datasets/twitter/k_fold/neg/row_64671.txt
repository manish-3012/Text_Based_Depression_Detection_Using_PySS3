Just can't seem to live in the real world. Cannot find a job. I feel like a failure.I graduated college in the summer of 2013. Since then I have hardly had any professional experience in the field I want. I have had a few jobs here and there. 

Last few weeks were looking good, had 3 interviews for a job. Two over the phone and 1 in person. Haven't heard from the ones who called me and most likely won't. Heard today from the interview I did in person. They liked me, but said I just did not have enough experience. By the way there are people who work there where I went to college who I worked with.

I feel like a god damn failure. I told my mother and she said the reason they did not hire me was because they must have looked at my facebook account and saw the political posts I posted. I freaked out on her, yelled at her, and said that is the most bat shit insane reason to think of considering they probably couldn't even see my facebook account. Whether or not they would give a shit what I posted on there.

I just want to drink although the last time I got really sad and drank a lot, I went to the hospital I guess because of alcohol poisoning. I feel alone and can't seem to dig myself out of this hole.

I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I feel alone.
