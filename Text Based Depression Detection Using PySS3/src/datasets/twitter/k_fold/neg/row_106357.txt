Lived through five attempts so far, debating on a sixth.I'm a total waste of space that saps the life from everyone around me. I hallucinate, experience delusions, have horrific anxiety, and have focus issues. I almost never leave the house, live a pathetic existence off of SSI/disability, and am a drain on my family. They'd never tell me that, but I most certainly am exhausting to deal with. My friends can't help me, all they ever want to say is "Oh, be positive. You're a great guy." 

I'm 28 and I've only been in one relationship. The odds of a schizophrenic male getting married after onset are something like 30% the last I looked. "Oh, there's someone out there for everyone, just keep your chin up." This is the real world and we all know that's not true. Nobody wants a 28 year old schizophrenic with crazy baggage who can't work and has no useful skills. 

This world is unimaginably cruel, and I'm getting sick of it again. I don't like the thought of being alive right now and would much prefer the cold grip of oblivion. Maybe I'm just a failure at suicide too, maybe that's why I can't get one to stick. I'd rather die before I get tossed out onto the street when my mother dies. My brother doesn't have the job or the funds to keep me afloat. I'd bankrupt him. Disability doesn't pay shit, and the only reason I'm grateful I have it is for Medicaid. My life before medication was literal torture, and I'd rather not return to that again. 

I'm just running out of reasons to live again.
