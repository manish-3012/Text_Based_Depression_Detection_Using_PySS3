I give up on my lifeI'm 15. I know it seems like I'm young, and I have so much ahead of me, but it doesn't feel that way. I've been hospitalized 6 times in the past year. My family isn't supportive and they don't understand mental illness at all, despite psycho-education. My grades in school have dropped and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. Everything seems... robotic to me. Recently, I've been getting paralyzing anxiety. I can barely make it through a week in school without leaving a class. 

I get a brain fog sometimes... I just can't think. I just wish I could disappear... The past medication and therapies that I've tried haven't helped to get rid of my suicidal feelings, even though I put effort into my treatment. 

Everything seems to be going downhill. I guess down is the new up for me...

Edit: My parents are forcing me to go to sleep early... I guess this is bye... I just don't know if I will make it through the night.
