I don't want to die, but I keep wishing for/thinking about grievous injuryAlso, I don't know how to tell my husband that I'm struggling with these thoughts. They're worse in the mornings, where I fantasize about jumping off of a short building or stepping in front of a car, or a new idea last night was taking just enough pills to get sick but not too much to actually die. At what point does ideation become a true danger to self? I'm a little afraid my husband will freak out if I tell him, and drag me to the ER. I've been keeping my therapist and psychiatrist in the loop, though, and we're trying to manage it otherwise.
