I really need helpSomeone who means the world to me isnâ€™t responding and I have a dehilabatingng fear of being replaced despite being online and I donâ€™t know what to do. I wouldnâ€™t be able to handle it, earlier today I overdosed on my lamotrigine and of course it didnâ€™t work and Iâ€™m suspecting serotonin syndrome and Iâ€™m super sick feeling but my parents are refusing to take me to the hospital. Iâ€™m desperate and need help please. Another thing is that this has happened before and I understand that heâ€™s busy too but I suspect that sometimes he leaves his computer and phone on without refreshing it so it shows him as online. I know Iâ€™m repeating myself but Iâ€™m desperate and on the edge and Iâ€™m going to try to kill myself again. I canâ€™t do this anymore.
