I just need someone to understandI want to kill my self. 
But I donâ€™t want to die. I just want to vanish, I want everyone to forget I existed so that nobody is hurt. I want to feel less guilt for feeling this way. I want my friends to understand: I love them, but I hate me. I want some reassurance. I want to give up. 
But I donâ€™t want to die.
