ComfortI know this has been said by countless people by countless ways and countless eras but....im glad people are suicidal just like me. It gives me comfort knowing that there are people like me. There are people going through different things but sometimes the end game is the same.....suicide. Its not something i wish upon people. I don't want people to die by it but...it makes me feel normal that we think a lot. Recently my CSM said i had a dark cloud above me and im...."distant". For awhile i didn't know what he meant by distant. To be honest i still don't but i like to think he meant im not close to people and hes not calling me a space cadet.....but i cant get my mind off that. Does he think im stupid. Do everyone think im stupid? I hate it here but only a few people stop me from thinking this way....well...three people but they arent around all the time....i try...my best. But i guess it doesnt matter as long as people still think the same of you. A dumb fuck that tries and does weird things. 


Im not looking for a response i just need to type this out and get things off my chest. Tomorrow when im done drinking and back to work ill be "normal" but drunk me says to anyone that reads this. I think you can beat whatever yoy are trying to beat.... Especially your meat. Col (chuckles out loud)
