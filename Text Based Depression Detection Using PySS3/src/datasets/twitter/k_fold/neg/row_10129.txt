I lost everything... (including 200,000)Last year was my first year in college. In a month of college my father died. Well he died physically. He mentally died like 6 years due to health and I had to watch him everyday growing up and seeing my father in agony for so long was nothing but sad. I had problems myself, abnormal problems children shouldnâ€™t have. Complicated stuff. 
Anyhow when he passed away I was in shock and it didnâ€™t feel real. Before the pandemic my friends introduced me into the stock market. I put a considerable amount in. Timeline is around spring break and students couldnâ€™t return to dorms and had to continue our study at home. I had my mom take out a loan, almost 6figures. Initially I wanted to invest. I did invest. But my brother introduced me to options. 

Being so detached from reality due to pandemic and after shock phase I used money and the stock market to compensate this. Problems and more problems kept building up. My mental health kept deteriorating and I shut down all my friends I literally blocked them all now I have nobody. My family doesnâ€™t really hate me they just feel sorry for me. But I also have adhd so I have these repeated thoughts of me losing money. Everyday I wake up and I keep thinking of money. I lost nearly 200,000. 

My mom tells me not to worry but I do. I overthink a lot. Its December now and I feel a single day hasnâ€™t passed by because losing so much money so quickly and experiencing death is terrible and I donâ€™t know how to get through this. Also, I thought I could make it back this semester, so I decided to revamp my schedule for this semester and took 3 classes all gen Edâ€™s instead of my major classes so I feel like I lost a lot of time and money. So in all I lost time money relationships and my identity. I was such a kind caring passionate person. I used to love saving money and shopping. Now nothing excites me anymore. Literally nothing. Because I keep comparing everything to the fact I lost this much money itâ€™s so bad. Honestly looking at this from another perspective itâ€™s not even the money that was the most haunting, itâ€™s losing who I am. 

This is fucking crazy, pandemic I felt affected the people who were going through some crazy shit but enhanced the effects. Iâ€™m going through some crazy psychological event. Iâ€™m a very open minded person so I like looking at all perspectives but damn man. Itâ€™s hard looking at yourself because itâ€™s you but when evaluating other people itâ€™s clear as day idk why the hell im so complicated, this sucks man I wake up everyday so gloom I want to get better I swear but everything I associate is so toxic now a days and I donâ€™t know how to get out of this phase god damn it
