Today's my birthdayToday's my 21st birthday. I live at home, don't have a car, am sort of drifting through university, and don't have any friends. Like really no friends. I am the most uninteresting, awkward person. No one wished be a happy birthday outside of my parents. It's my 21st. You're supposed to go party and have a good time. I've never even been to a party. I don't know a single person outside my immediate family.

No one talks to me at school. No one sits by me or even notices me. No one invites me to do anything with them. In labs, I am always the awkward kid that gets assigned to another group of people that already know each other. I used to rock climb, but you can't do that without friends. I have no hobbies. No skills. No passions.

Really, there's nothing here for me. No one would miss me if I was gone. The world wouldn't even notice. My parents would cry, and then they'd get over it. And my chapter would be done. I don't make any affect on anyone or anything. I am a pathetic, lonely, friendless, uninteresting loser.

I've never been so close to actually going through with it as I am right now. No one even knew it was my birthday. I didn't do anything today except sleep and play xbox. On my 21ST FUCKING BIRTHDAY. If ever there's an indicator that no one cares for you and you don't make the slightest difference, it's that. I'm fucking done with the bullshit of pretending to be interested in anything. Pretending that I don't just go to school and hide in a study alcove instead of going to class. Pretending that my grades aren't atrocious and that I'll be forced to drop out with 25k in debt. Pretending that I come home every night and lock myself in my room and cry. I have no one to talk to. It's all bullshit, and I'm done.
