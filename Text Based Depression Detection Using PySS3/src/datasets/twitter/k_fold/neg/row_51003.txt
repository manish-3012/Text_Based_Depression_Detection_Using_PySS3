In the Slow Process of Ending itI'm doing it all. 

I'm writing the suicide note. Researching. Collecting supplies. Saying goodbye. Giving away my stuff. Gave up therapy and meds months ago. Pushed away my family. Slowly pushing away my friends.

I'm just done at this point. I don't know when I will do it, I just know I'm gonna.

I hope I don't survive. But at that same time I want to.

I feel like shit and don't know what to do or think anymore.

I'm just tired at this point. 

I feel so guilty and ashamed and angry for feeling this way and I've wanted to tell someone. To say something but I can't.

So instead I plan my death.

The part that is the worse is that I'm gonna hurt my fiancee and my siblings, who at this point I treat like my own kids. I'm just a shit person. I can't do life anymore. I don't deserve life anymore.
