Whatâ€™s the point of continuing school when you know nothing is for you after schoolme and my parents argue every single day about my schoolwork. As a sophomore with 2 Dâ€™s I honestly donâ€™t care. They argue with me about something there is no hope for. I cannot care less about education, because there is nothing special about me or something I find interesting enough to go into as a profession. My mom yells at me every day that she just wants me to get the â€œlegalâ€ stuff done so then I can drop out when Iâ€™m 17. Everybody is pushing me to the limit and Iâ€™ve about had enough. There is nothing for me in this world, and nobody that cares, and I should end it all here.  Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to kill myself though, because I donâ€™t want my sister to feel bad.  Iâ€™ve already tried to cut myself a couple months ago, but all I ended up doing was getting scared and running to my dad.  Please help.
