I'm dying youngLife is pointless, I am 24 years old stuck with the mentality of 14 years old and I can't go back to being a child. My parents are old and when they die I am out of this place.  

I'm scared as hell of death but the only consolation I have is not to die on nature's terms. I refuse waking up around my 60 in the middle of the night to be afraid of death. If immortality would be worked on then I would be a little bit calmer, since it's not oh well. 

I will opt out for euthanasia and then cryofreeze myself in hopes I might see another century where society cares to cure death. I am so depressed I realize that my potential was wasted and it will continue being wasted because I just can't do anything. I wish my mom had me a bit later, I would have friends, better school, better life, but she didn't have me later and now I barely even see the end of this century. Thanks to death I can't find anything meaningful in life, my relationship with my boyfriend is basically gone since I can't bring myself to care about him since when he dies then I would deal with shit ton of pain. I can't take care of myself nor I even want to, I can barely wake up in the morning. I am seeing therapist, I have tons of pills, nothing helps.
