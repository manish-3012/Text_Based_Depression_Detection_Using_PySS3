I don't know what to fucking do!!!!ok. Let me start by saying my hand writing is bad and that is because I am fucking incapable of doing anything right ok. my brain is completely on fire! It feels like I have all these issues fucked together and know way of know how to express them. I can't seem to fully understand what is wrong with me, I feel like a 5 year old in the body of a 15 year old, I have basically 0 friends, my family does not understand me to the point where I am breakdowns because I am so tired of being misunderstood but like I said I don't know how to explain myself. I have been diagnosed with adhd but I am pretty sure I have OCD and BPD and probably more because I'm so fucked up. I'm also in high school and I just wan't to be normal. have friends, be smart, have hobbies and interests, confidence in myself, socialist etc.. but I can't and I feel like positivity is just being unrealistic, I can't take this anymore each and every day is hell. I doubt anyone here will be able to really help me and I understand that sadly I'm basically unfixable. killing myself is becoming more and more on my mind. anyway thanks 4 reading this I know its horribly written but idc anymore lol.
