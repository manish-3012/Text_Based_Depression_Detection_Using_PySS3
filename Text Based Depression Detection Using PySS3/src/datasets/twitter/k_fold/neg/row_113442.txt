I have too many reasons. Drug problems, rape, emotional abuse, alcoholic parents, no friends. My family has emotionally abused and neglected me my entire life and for the past 10 years I have struggled with suicidal ideation, believing that I would die by the time I was 18 or at least hoping I would because I "knew" I would not be able to handle life as an adult after constantly being discouraged by my dad who is a successful stockbroker. My dad is an alcoholic. When I was a kid drinking and doing drugs like ecstacy, vicodin, and cocaine was acceptable and done in front of my sister and I before we were "old enough" to know what it was. Most birthday parties consisted of my family drinking while my friends and I would enjoy the lack of supervison most of my friends probably didnt have at home.  everyone in my family has graduated college with a degree except for me. I still havent finished my associates in psychology at a junior college. Those who havent yet are my younger cousins who are still in highschool. When I was an adolescent I struggled with encopresis but it was unknown to my friends and I rarely was put in situations which I was emarrased by it, though I know my behavior ashamed my parents to the point they would have killed me if they could get away with it. My mom was the only person who paid any regular attention to me as she was a stay at home mom and looking back I know she smoked weed to be able to handle the boredom. When I was 13 she went to school to become a paralegal, convinced my dad to buy her a BMW, then got a divorce. The bulk of our child support was spent on clothing for her. I remember the few times I would hang out with my dad (I had alot of questions growing up) no one to pay attention to me or answer me. The same time my mom started going to school I started smoking weed. I continued smoking weed while my parents went through the divorce process. My mom used to read to me and my sister growing up, i would be in my closet smoking, too afraid to go outside because I knew my dad would more than likely catch me out there. The smell traveled to my sisters room where my mom would read to her( i am 3 years older than her). Our destroyed relationship probably stems from her memories of that.

Once I hit puberty I had fetish for Omorashi( pee desperation) abdl, and the worst one... encopresis. The final was one that was the most compulsive and overwhelming at 13-14, I was embarrasingly was caught masturbating by my sister and father on multiple occasions but the fetish reminded me of the only time in my life that I felt happy and loved. My drug use also continued as I was so self-destructive and ashamed of who I was( I probably would have recognized I was attractive and had gifts if I had loving parents, but that is a 1st world problem) that all I wanted was to escape from the reality of who I was.
 After two years in an outpatient treatment center for kids with "addiction" problems, I was sent away to treatment center after treatment center, the final one starting at 17 and ending at 19. Luckily I lost my virginity before getting sent off to this awful place.I was so suicidal while there t that when someone brought in heroin I deliberately gave myself hep c in the hopes that my family might care about me or give me any kind of positive attention. I was an attractive baby and teenager, I dont know If I am attractive now, I am at least average. I am now 25, my family has nothing to do with me "because I have had a drug problem" which they have always had themselves i:e alcohol. 
 I have been to jail once for a year ending with a felony charge of theft, and another time for a misdemeanor;jail time lasting 6 months. Though I was once attractive or possibly still am( the only thing keeping me going right now) I have never been in a relationship. Most of the reckless decisions I have made in life were preceeded by a strong belief that I would kill myself within the week before making the decision or before I would go to jail. I doubt I will find anyone who will compromise with me or have the same intrests sexually. I need to be with someone that I am at least attracted to. I know I am not ugly, but I have been on suboxone and clonazepam for over a year, and will not be able to get off of these medications without severe consequences. Pretty soon I will be off my dads insurance and unable to afford treatment or the medications themselves. The side effects of these withdrawls are very debilitating and the medications help me to stay positive and sober. Once I run out, I will not being able to work, get out of bed for months. My aunt and uncle are currently letting me live with them because they are devout christians who dont believe in making someone homeless merely for injesting a chemical, I have a truck in my name, and a job starting on the 31st that is 40 hours a week. I have no freinds, and am clearly too stuck up to settle for someone within my "type" range. The reason I say this is because I need someone to be with or who needs me. Without that I do not feel alive. I genuinely have no friends I can relate to or feel any emotional connection with that I trust. I have hooked up with guys just to feel loved. I have been fucked in the ass just to feel like I am valuble to someone. Yet I havenet been laid in years. I could have had sex with two beautiful women but my self esteem was so low I didnt realize laying in bed with them or on the floor meant that we were going to get it on. Clearly I am a sex addict as well as a drug addict. Things will not get better when I get off my meds. I cannot concentrate long enough to accomplish any goals or leave the house because of the shame I feel just being and looking the way I do. I am a different person while sober, and most people take my severe social anxiety as proof that I am slow. I believe for the majority of my life my family has thought of me as slow and ignored me because I was easy to deal with. While in prison I played that card in order to avoid conflict and be alone as often as possible because my life experiences as an adolescent differ so much than other people my age or older. I have no Idea who I am. The list goes on but I wanted to be as honest as possible as most other posts dont give any detals. I probably gave too much. Please respond. I plan on suicide by cop, or jumping off a building. I dont have access to guns. I could overdose on my medication but it is likely that will be painful and I will survive stupider than I am now or as a vegetable. Again, please respond. Right now I am under the influence of my meds which give me the clarity to write better and am having some hope, but I know that lonelyness and memories will eventually become the forfront of my thoughts and emotions. I have just recently become estranged from my family, and the way they went about making me homeless made it so clear that they have only cared for me throughout my life because they felt obligated to. I really will kill myself. I will find a painless way to do this that will not result in me ending up in jail. If anyone has time to respond please give me a reason to live.
