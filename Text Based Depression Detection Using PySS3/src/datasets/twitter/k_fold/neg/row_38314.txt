Birthday Today.So today I turn 19. I don't know how to feel. Just empty and apathetic. In the past week I started to have depression naps for the first time. In the past few years I've struggled with depression. I've never had these. I don't want to feel this way. I want my emotions back damn it! I just want to go back to sleep so I won't be awake. Sleep is the only thing I look forward to. Depression is *hell*.
