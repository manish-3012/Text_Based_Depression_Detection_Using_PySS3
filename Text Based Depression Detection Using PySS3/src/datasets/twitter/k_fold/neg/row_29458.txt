Why should i live?I am 25 No education, no job, obese, no friends or close ones.. 

When i was 23 i did a fake suicide to make my family take my mental health shit seriously but nothing happened like nothing no for real from then and now nothing changed.

All i do is day dream either every day i marry a girl with diff professions and personalities or i think about my grandfather and the fact i must die before him i won't be able to take that pain don't even brush, clean my bed i do take a bath tho.

Don't see a point in life like this not a rich person either just feel suicide is better. Because dreaming about a more happy and positive life only upsets and family isn't interested in treating my mental health problems and to be brutally honest neither i am. 

I honestly think i am better off dead. I do nothing and anything i promise i will change i forget it next day no point.
