Why do we live to suffer every day?I wake up every day wanting a car to hit me on the way to school, bc I just cant a single reason to justify my existence. If I'm going to die anyways, why shouldnt i just end it right now? It would be so easy, i have a few pills + a noose, i just dont want to continue on anymore.
