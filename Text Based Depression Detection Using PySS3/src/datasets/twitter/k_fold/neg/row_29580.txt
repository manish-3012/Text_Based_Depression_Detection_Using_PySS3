You know Iâ€™m just so fucking lost, and I donâ€™t want to deal with this anymoreIâ€™m just not happy, I havenâ€™t been. Iâ€™m almost 17, and yeah I guess thatâ€™s gonna open up a lot of people saying Iâ€™ve got my whole life ahead of me but I really canâ€™t seem to find the reasoning that waiting will be worth it. Iâ€™m shoving everyone I care about away. Iâ€™m starting to become dissociated to almost everyone and everything again. Iâ€™m used to that at least. I havenâ€™t self harmed in around half a month. I donâ€™t feel like doing the math. I know that some people will miss me. Truth be told I think thatâ€™s all that has kept me going this long. My family life and upbringing has been pretty shit according to everyone else outside of it. Itâ€™s been all Iâ€™ve known so itâ€™s not like I knew Iâ€™ve had it rough. But it pisses me off how everyone says Iâ€™m strong and how Iâ€™m so resilient. Iâ€™m nowhere close to strong. So many of the people I know donâ€™t know how bad it is. Iâ€™m a fucking wreck, a mess. I just want to stop feeling like this. I want to stop hating myself and my friends. I want to stop hurting them. I want to stop hurting my sister. Iâ€™ve been a burden and a pain for the past few years. And yeah Iâ€™ve helped all of them a bit. But I think Iâ€™ve given all I can. I canâ€™t help but think this is for the best. Iâ€™ve always had the idea that Iâ€™d be perfectly fine if I were to go and everyone else would be ok. I used to be the therapist type of all my friends. People would come to me with their problems and Iâ€™d give my best to help them all. But I havenâ€™t done anything recently because Iâ€™ve just been so screwed. If Iâ€™m honest I donâ€™t really have a plan or anything. But with my Momâ€™s extensive history with medications I could find more than a few ways to get the job done. I guess this is close to a last cry for anything? I donâ€™t really know when itâ€™s gonna happen. Maybe before the 22nd, so Itâ€™s not on my birthday. Either way I just want everything to stop. Itâ€™s too much work to keep myself going. I just have nothing left to offer anyone let alone myself. Iâ€™m just tired. Tired of it all. Say what you want, I know this is all jumbled and not really cohesive. Should I write a note? I donâ€™t know I guess thatâ€™s something Iâ€™ll figure out when I put more thought into all of this. I just figured Iâ€™d put this in to see if itâ€™ll do anything
