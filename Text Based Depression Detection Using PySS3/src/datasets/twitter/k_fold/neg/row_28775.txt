I want to die, but I'm terrified of death.I tried to do it 13 years ago, I stopped midway through because I got so scared, more like terrorized.
Things got much better since then, but there's not a day that goes by without thinking about doing it again.
Whatever you might say, I cant shake off the feeling. It's always been there. I appreciate all the nice things you want to say but they won't help. I just want to know how to live with it without beating myself up everyday.
