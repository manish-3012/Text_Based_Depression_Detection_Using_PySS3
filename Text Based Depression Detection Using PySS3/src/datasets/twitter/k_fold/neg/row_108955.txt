iâ€™m in a bad spot between better and worsethis is just gonna be a vent because imn ot doihg 100% rn. i have a good life that iâ€™m incredibly incredibly lucky to have. evem my issues with depression are controlled to an extent. i have a good social life and a lot of friends but no connection. i need to feel like i can deserve to be loved i think because i donâ€™t feel like that. i know my entire group would be fucking broken but they donâ€™t give me quite enogh connection to actually help me through it. they donâ€™t really know iâ€™m struggling bad. i want to kill myself a littl bit rn. i have everything right now and i want to kill myself. just to have nothing. iâ€™m not mad i think itâ€™s the in between moments or the bad feeligs from tonight or the fatigue but i want to attempt. again
i know i need to talk to someone f iâ€™m getting into the actual considering.
i canâ€™t tonight even if i wanted to.
i donâ€™t think iâ€™m really considering it honestly because i donâ€™t have a reason to. itâ€™s like people â€œneedâ€ me but only because the absence of me would be felt, not because i actually add anything to their lives.
if i could get myself alone i could but iâ€™m fortunate enough that that wouldnâ€™t really work for me.
so iâ€™m stuck.
