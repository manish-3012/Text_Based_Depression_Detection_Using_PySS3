Life is a prisonDoes anyone else feel this way ? That they're trapped in this prison called life or is it just me ?

I really can't help but feel this way about life, I never consented to being born and I'm finding it super hard to kill myself atm. 
I feel stuck in this prison that I didn't ask to be in while there seems to be no accessible way out of it either. This feeling of being trapped is absolute torture and I hate it.
