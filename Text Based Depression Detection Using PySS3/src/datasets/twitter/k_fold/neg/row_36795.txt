I was doing so good.I donâ€™t get it. I was doing so good, still am. Iâ€™m starting to catch up on my school work, regularly going on walks with my childhood friend, starting to develop close bonds and connection with my new classmates, opening up to my best friend about how insecure Iâ€™ve felt in our relationship for the past months. Me and my brother started getting along more. I hadnâ€™t had a fight with my parents in such a long time. I even had the motivation to get out of my bed and draw or read a book or play Minecraft. I was and still am doing great, so what is happening?! 

Because my sleeping schedule is messed up, I usually go to be at around 3 am or just pass out watching YouTube. I tried to force myself to put my phone done at 1 am and just started trying to fall asleep. 

And here I am. Three hours later and I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m doing so good so why canâ€™t I fall asleep? Iâ€™m doing so good so why am I crying at 4 am? Iâ€™m doing so good so why am I overthinking my past decisions and convincing myself that I am a burden to everyone around me? Iâ€™m doing so fucking good so why am I in my bed, crying and thinking about how much happier I would be if I just ended it all?! I want to die. I wanna do it so bad. I do r care how I do it, I just hope I donâ€™t wake up in the morning. Please, God take me out, and please. 

What is the point of doing good and getting better if when the night comes and I am left alone with my thoughts again this happens? Ugh, fuck my life, Jesus.
