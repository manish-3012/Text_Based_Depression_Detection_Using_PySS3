im sorryi made a post a while ago (a few days ago i think) already so sorry for coming back. im in the middle of class rn but i cant get my mind off this. last night i vaguely attempted suicide, and by vaguely i mean while i was driving i tried getting a car to hit me while i was taking  a right turn. i feel so stupid. after doing it i wanted to kill myslf even more becuase i just realized i also put someone else in danger just because im stupid and suicidal. i feel extremely guilty about it and i dont know how to stop feeling thing way. lmfao i should fucking kill myself for even attempting that. i feel like whoever i fucking cut off has my license plate or whatever and is gonna report me or something. when i looked back to see where the driver was he was super far behind. i legit just feel so guilty. i shouldnt drag people into my suicidal shit, that was the worst idea ive ever had
