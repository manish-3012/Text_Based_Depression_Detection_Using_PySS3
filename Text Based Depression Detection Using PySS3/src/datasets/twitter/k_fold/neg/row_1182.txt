You can't fix what was built broken. I hate myself for things that are out of my control. For being a broken pile of fuck that canâ€™t even decide what sex I am. For being 27 and never having a relationship, for still living with my mother. For getting a rare disease that will kill me but not before Iâ€™m tortured by the depression passed down to me through genetics. For the color of my skin that makes me a target no matter what I do. For having a heart big enough to care but a spine small enough to not be willing to fight.
