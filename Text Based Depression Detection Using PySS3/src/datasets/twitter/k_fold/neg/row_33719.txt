the moodthe mood is visiting again tonight, the one i get when i feel no one is listening or will listen, no woman will ever again see me as sexual, no children will ever have my genes, no fun is left to be had.  i know the mood is a liar but this does not diminish its voice.  self-sabotage is the continuum of my being and my broken wasted body just wants to rest forever.  contemplate paying a prostitute for temporary bought affection then hate myself more for wanting that, needing that validation, having to purchase it.  the future looks so lean now, so empty of possibility and a climb i lack the energy to complete, when for cheaper than a whore i could buy a gun and, had i the guts, i could step off the ride and see the mystery.  i don't live, i just exist, and so tired of this loveless foolish place.
