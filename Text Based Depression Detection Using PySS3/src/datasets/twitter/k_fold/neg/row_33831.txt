Dieing is honestly the best option for meHere's the situation. I'm about to age out of my parents health insurance and therapy is extremely expensive. I always feel alone. Like something is missing from my life. It's been this way for a long time. At this point I genuinely have nothing to live for. The only reason I haven't ended it thus far is because I can't think of a way where no one gets traumatized or hurt. Who would have thought ending it all would be so complicated.
