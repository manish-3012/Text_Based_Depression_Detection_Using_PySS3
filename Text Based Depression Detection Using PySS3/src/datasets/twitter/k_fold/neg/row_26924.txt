I need helpI just cut myself for the first time in many many years. I also choked myself, which was my go to when i self harmed about 5 years ago. I am so on edge. I need help. I want to do it. My boyfriend hates me and everything about me. I want to end this. I haven't been scared of doing something to myself for about 2 years now. Tonight its like it all snapped. I want to do this, I feel ready. I dont care. I have this extremely pure feeling of I dont care. I want to die.
