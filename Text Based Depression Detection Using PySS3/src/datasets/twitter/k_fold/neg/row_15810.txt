So confused...!! Why?Im really struggling a lot probably the most intensely almost Iâ€™ve had all this week but i have know clue why itâ€™s really rally hard to handle right now... i donâ€™t understand I have absolutely no reason to be upset? I just got back from seeing and spending time with my mother in sister at the park/ creek from around late afternoon.. I donâ€™t know I guess really I donâ€™t remember the last time my mom included me in a family outing or when she seemed this calm when Iâ€™m around her and I donâ€™t know i donâ€™t know Iâ€™m flooded with very very very very intense need to hurt myself so bad an feel like I donâ€™t deserve to be here and my body physically hurts with all the emotions happening and I donâ€™t understand I should be great full I should be happy I had this peaceful moment with them that I havenâ€™t experienced since I donâ€™t remember when  but here I am. I donâ€™t deserve there love I donâ€™t deserve life I deserve pain and I donâ€™t remember I time that I i have ever had a moment with my mom  like this in my life since childhood and Iâ€™m so so confused... why am I so upset , what did I do to be allowed this expieriebce with my mom, why canâ€™t I just be greatfilul for this, why do I want to kill myself so bad right now ???
