A thought.I am me and I am him.
He's insane, I am not.
I'm not insane, but he is.
But if I am him and he is me then I am not me and he is me,
Which means I do not exist and he is me.
But if he is insane then I am insane.
But I'm a figment of my own creation.
I defined myself as sentient which means the idea of me exist while the physical me does not.
But he does, he exists.
