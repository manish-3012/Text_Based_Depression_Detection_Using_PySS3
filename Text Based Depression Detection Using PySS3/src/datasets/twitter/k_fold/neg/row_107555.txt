Academic Suspension and my MotherI just recently finished my first semester at college, which for me was incredibly difficult. I struggled juggling my diabetes, social anxiety, and all the other stresses that come with college. My struggles were amplified from the constant long distance arguments I had with my mother. Throughout my life I have always battled with her, whether it be about what I wear, who I talk to, the music I listen to, you name it. She was always ashamed that she couldn't use me to brag to her housewife friends at the local starbucks or PTA meetings, because I've been nothing but a screw up since I exited the womb eighteen years ago. Combining this all together has taken an extreme toll on me mentally and physically. I stopped caring about my academics halfway through the semester, and my grades plummeted.  Because of that, I have been put on academic suspension, which means I will not be allowed to return to the university for the spring semester. I am ashamed. This has done nothing but make my family hate me even more. I can't even stand to look at myself in the mirror. I've started to grow grey hair. I can't live with myself. Everyday I see less of a reason to live. I'm not sure what I'm trying to get out of this, but writing about it seems to help.
