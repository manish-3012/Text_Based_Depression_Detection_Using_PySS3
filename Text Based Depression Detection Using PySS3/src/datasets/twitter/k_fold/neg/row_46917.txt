"this is just temporary"I hate hearing that this is just a temporary time of affliction in my life and it'll pass. Yeah, then I'll live a life of unhappiness. It's either end things now, or continue on suffering. I don't see any other way.

I'm just so fucking scared of doing it. There's no painless way, is there?

It's not like I'll hurt a lot of people. My parents will be sad, my brother will. Obviously, I'm a part of their family so whatever. But who else? None of my fake-ass friends give a fuck about me. None of my teachers. I've got no one besides a therapist at my school who I'm seeing who I only kind of trust. No one fucking gets it and ever will. I've met one person ever who "got it" and understood and that whole thing is over.

I'm so fucking sick of pretending like I stopped cutting and that I'm OK now to my parents. And the thing is that if they find out about my cutting or if I fail at killing myself, I'll be back in the psychiatric hospital that I was at a month ago and if I end up back there, I will hang myself using the curtains there.

I don't know what I'm looking for out of posting this here. I guess that it'll make me feel better if someone were to read this. I don't know.
