I have a question..I'm hearing a lot of "nobody really cares about you" and stuff, not directed at me, just in general. Like saying nobody really cares what you're going through and about your problems and stuff. So if that's the case, if you're really all alone in this world and I'd TRULY nobody cares at all, why am I still here? Actually no I was under the illusion that someone would care. The real question is, why do I *have to* be here then? I mean nobody really cares, right? Nobody cares about my problems or if I live or die, then why the hell should I even live? Because sure as shit, I don't care if I live or die at rhis point, practically and emotionally. So by that logic, I don't have shit to live for technically.

Something to think about.
