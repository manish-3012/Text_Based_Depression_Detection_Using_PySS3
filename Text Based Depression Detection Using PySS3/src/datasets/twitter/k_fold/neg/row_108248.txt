A curseI feel like I've been cursed.

I've been cursed with a skin,
made to protect me,
but I cannot be protected 
from the cruelties of this world. 

I've been cursed with a heartbeat, 
I hate its rhythm, its musicality.
I'd rather have no music, 
Than this cruel ballad. 

I've been cursed with a brain.
So big an intellect, 
only to feel pain. 

I've been cursed with lungs, 
filled with the breath of life,
I wish I could stop their dance. 

I've been cursed with legs,
made to run and explore, 
but I don't want to move anymore.

I've been cursed with eyes, 
To make tears, 
good to show your woes, 
but not to drown in them,
 just as I wish.

Must have been
quite the bad man, 
to be inflicted
this much pain.
