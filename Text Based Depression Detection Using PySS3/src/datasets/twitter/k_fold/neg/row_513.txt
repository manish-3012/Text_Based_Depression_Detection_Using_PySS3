when you have to accept that your parents will never accept youmy mother is probably one of the most invalidating human beings ive ever met. when i first asked her to see a therapist she told me to work out because that would make me stop feeling so sad. when she first found out about my cuts she yelled at me. when i attempted she got angry and told me i was selfish. 

i will never understand the people who say they stay for their moms. if anything, she would be the reason why i couldnâ€™t do it anymore. shes the catalyst for so many of my problems and everytime i even mention my depression or ask her to set an appointment with my psychiatrist she asks â€œdo you really need it?â€ and â€œwhy are you sad? youre happy when youre around us. â€ 

she doesnt even notice when i wear hoodies in the summer to hide cuts, when i isolate myself all day, when i cant even eat. sheâ€™ll ask me â€œwhy dont you ever leave the house?â€ and then get mad at me if i do. 

ive accepted that she will never truly care about me. she will never validate me. she will never be there when i need her to be. 

im gonna go listen to mitski.
