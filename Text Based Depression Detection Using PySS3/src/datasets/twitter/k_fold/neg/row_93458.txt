I wish that the suicidal urge would stayJust this afternoon, I had the strongest suicidal urge I've had for several months.  I was so ready to literally jump off a cliff.  Now I'm ok again.  But fuck, the constant cycle of intense emotions is so exhausting!  I don't see the suicidal urges ever going away.  So I wish they would stay for long enough for me to get the job done, fuck it!
