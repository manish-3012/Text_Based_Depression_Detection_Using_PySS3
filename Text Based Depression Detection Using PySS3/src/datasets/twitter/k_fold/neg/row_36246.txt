Don't know what to doI'm not sure what to write, but I'm feeling like I might kill myself. In the past year and a half my mental health has deteriorated greatly. I don't really feel much now, I don't enjoy being alive. When I do feel something it's usually rage or disgust that I can't control. Even towards my girlfriend and family. I'm not a nice person to be around but my girlfriend won't leave me and find somebody nicer. I don't enjoy anything and can't do things. I don't really work as a human, there doesn't seem much point. For the past year I've been kept awake fantasizing about jumping off a motor way bridge and in front of a truck, but I've resisted the deep urge to do so. I feel like I can't really fight it now, or that I don't want to.

I repeatedly see my doctor, but it's been over a year and I still haven't had any treatment or diagnosis. They just brush me off and one doctor laughed. I don't really have any other options. Just help me or something, I don't want to trouble my friend or girlfriend.
