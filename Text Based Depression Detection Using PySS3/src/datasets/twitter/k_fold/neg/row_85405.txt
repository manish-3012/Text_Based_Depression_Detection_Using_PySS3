I'm a mistakemy mom was on drugs 24/7 when pregnant with me, drank alcohol every day, and was homeless. I came out alive, and more than that, healthy and smart, without any of the doctors even knowing how much drugs my mom had taken during her pregnancy with me. She got clean after I came out healthy, so props to her for that. But what were the chances that I came out alive, let alone healthy? I don't believe in God, but if I did, I'd say he messed up that day. The only thing saving me right now is the fact that I'm too poor to afford a gun and there's nothing in my house high enough up for me to tie a rope to.
