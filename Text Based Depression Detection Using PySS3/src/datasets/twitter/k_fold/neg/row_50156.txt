I hate myself for not having the guts.I know myself, i know I've got years of agony ahead of me. I'm just an unhappy person. Antidepressants only go so far.

I want to die. But i know when the moment comes, i won't be able to pull the trigger (metaphorically)... I've been there before. 

I can't tell if i just don't want to hurt my friends/family. Or if I'm just too stubborn to give up... But i really want to.

I'm stuck in this limbo. It's hell. How do i get out.
