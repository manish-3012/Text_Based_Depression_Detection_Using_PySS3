Defective, should have never been born.I feel like a defective human being.           
No one is good at all things at once, I understand and accept that. But it being bad at everything is too much for me to handle.              
I fucking suck at socializing. So I gave up on it, no reason for me to keep trying, I am socially retarded and I accept that. So I decide to only focus on my studies. Turns out I'm no good at that either. I make too many fucking retarded mistakes during tests no matter how many hours I spent preparing beforehand (yes they are REALLY stupid mistakes like writing 1/2 and thinking it's 1.5 instead). I have no social life to speak of so I spend all of my free time studying - there's no excuse to do poorly.                          
I've taken IQ tests online (not very accurate, I know) so I can have an idea if I'm mentally retarded or not. But they tell me otherwise. So I don't know what's wrong with me.          
Now I am socially and academically retarded. No reason for me to keep going if I'm just going to suck at everything. At least trash can be recycled; I can't unless I die first, so currently I am more useless than trash.
