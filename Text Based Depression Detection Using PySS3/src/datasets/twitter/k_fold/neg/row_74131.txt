I realized I don't have any motivation to live and that's not likely to changeI think being on Zoloft for the past couple of months has cleared my mind of many pointless thoughts. Now I realize why I really want to kill myself, it's because I don't actually have any motivation to improve myself and I don't know what that would even mean. I don't have any goal in life. I don't want a partner or kids (I'm asexual), I don't believe in God, don't have any hobbies that would amount to meaningful progress or justify my existence. Sure I could spend the next however many years of natural lifespan eating, shitting, going to work, sleeping... But why would I want that? Just to survive? Most people have some thing driving them forward, but I don't. I don't have any close friends and I'm distant from my family. Continuing my life is a burden I would willingly put on myself, for no reason whatsoever other than to perform mundane and bodily functions until I naturally can't anymore.
