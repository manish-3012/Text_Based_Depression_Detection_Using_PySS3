Real spooked, real sadI should be happy as fuck, utterly vibing right now. I have my own place, I'm clean off hard drugs, I have a solid group of friends, but still fukin sorrow persists. 

I no longer think happy is a place, a person, or a accomplishment, but rather a state of mind. And that sucks dude. Like I've gone to therapy for years, I've been on a multitude of antidepressants, and still nothing changes this sinking empty feeling.

 I think I know how to fix it, through a change of mindset and behaviors, but hey it's so fucking comfortable retracing my old behaviors and reliving my same mindset.

If I'm too fucked in the head to hold a job how am I supposed to fix the contents of my brain. Fuck bud, I love life and think it's a miracle and I'm blessed to be alive, but I also wanna deep throat a magnum. Fukin a buddy. 

TL;DR: Haha what the fuck? A crippled mechanic can't fix himself.
