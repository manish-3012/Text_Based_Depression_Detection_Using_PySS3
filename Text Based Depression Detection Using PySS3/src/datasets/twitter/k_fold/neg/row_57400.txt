I'm tired of watching my family and myself being abusedSorry it's just been a bad day and I didn't know where else to go. I can't get therapy my parents control where I go and my finances. I can't call a hotline because they will see my phone records and make things worse for me. I just don't know what to do rn. I'm tired of pretending. I'm just tired of getting hurt all the time. I really just want to die rn.
