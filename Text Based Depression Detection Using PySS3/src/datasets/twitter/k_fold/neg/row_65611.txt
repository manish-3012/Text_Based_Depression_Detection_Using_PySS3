Trigger warning..Ill start by saying I'm probably not in the right sub but I can't find any others. One of my closest friends took her life just over a week ago. I was the last person she was in touch with. She asked me to make two big promises; that I wouldn't see her beloved dog put down and that I would pass on a message to her mum.

She sent me the message for her mum and immediately passed away. I've been overwhelmed with grief and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, passing on her message.. I did it in person at the funeral because I couldn't do it by text message. I typed it out and put it in a card.

I couldn't get to her. If I had been able, the last memory I would have had was finding her. 

I'm not okay. The guilt I'm feeling every day is overwhelming. I know it's not my fault. There was nothing I could do but call the police. I was home alone with my son and I couldn't get there. 

She'd been a tortured soul the 11 years we were friends. I find peace knowing she isn't running away from her demons anymore, but that doesn't help me with my guilt and grief. I miss her but I know shes okay now... 

Not even sure what I'm trying to say now. It just hurts so much. 

Please talk to someone. Anyone. She had a light at the end of her shitty tunnel but she couldn't hold on anymore. 

Always reach out.. you're worth it.
