Feeling more and more suicidal. Should I stop playing it safe?Currently unemployed, married (going on 2 years, been together 5), no kids just 2 dogs and a cat.

Between my ongoing depression, anxiety, and job search I am feeling pretty worthless. I've been thinking of ending it all. 

I just read or skimmed a post on this sub and someone said (paraphrasing) "have you ever dated a guy? Do you want to know what it's like?" and this got me thinking. I've been trying to live my life based on not messing up my existing life and just trying to get back somewhere around where I was. But maybe this isn't the right approach. I mean if I am really thinking about killing myself, what have I got to lose? 

Is this completely crazy? What would I even do with this opportunity? I live in so much fear all the time, I wish that would just go away.
