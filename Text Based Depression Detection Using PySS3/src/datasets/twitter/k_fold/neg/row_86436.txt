I think it's timeI am in way too much trouble and I don't think I can handle it anymore. I have no more will to live. I ran out of gas a long time ago and I survived this long just by inertia. Hopefully the next life, if there is one, is a bit more easy. 
I am scared of the act itself but I feel like I have no choice. Hopefully the people that loved me will forgive me for this selfish act.
