My mother married her abusive boyfriend despite my siblings and my pleas and I'm spiralingI've struggled mentally bc of her. But this has just wrecked my world. We told her we wouldn't go back to her house if they didn't split and instead she married him without telling us. I took a shit ton of pills the other night. My boyfriend got me to throw them up. But hes asleep and I'm just done with everything. My own mother has abandoned me for the 3rd time but this time she's doing it worse.
