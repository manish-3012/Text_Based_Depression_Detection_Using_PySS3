Thereâ€™s no point to any of this...I feel like shits never going to get better. 

I think Iâ€™ve always struggled with mental health stuff. Tried committing suicide a couple times with I was 16. I started self-medicating pretty heavily with drugs &amp; alcohol. I got sober in February of 2013 &amp; since then Iâ€™ve been dealing feelings. 

Iâ€™ve been doing therapy a year &amp; half after getting sober. Tried out patient programs, DBT, meds, TMS, the list goes on. 

Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of always trying. I want to drink, I donâ€™t want to feel. I donâ€™t want to exist. 

My life feels super fucked right now. Iâ€™m on permanent disability &amp; canâ€™t find a place to live. 

I just donâ€™t see things getting better, ever.
