Has anyone here had a near death experience after a suicide attemptThis is what scares me the most, where will I go afterwards?  Will I be in trouble?

I need to escape my life somehow and there is literally no other way out for me now.  There are things that I am too ashamed to tell people but I'm in huge trouble here and there are powerful people after me.  I'm sick of hiding from them and I'm sick of hiding these secrets everywhere I go.  The person I need to trust the most has let me down again today. I want to go home but I can't. I just want a normal life. I don't want god to punish me and I don't want to go to hell.
