I should go to the er but I don't want to irritate the staffI know er folks hate half assed suicide attempts. I haven't been brave enough to do serious damage. I hurt so much inside and there's an endless screaming voice telling me to try again, do it. Do it do it do it you dumb bitch. Stop being such a princess, go for the lethal method.


 I know they hate people like me. I don't want to be a pain in their ass and a waste of space. I don't want them to make fun of me. If I don't go somewhere where people will keep me from killing myself, I will give in and try again. I'm not trying to attention seek from them, I really really really want to die. I've never been to the er for a suicide attempt or psych issue before and maybe they will see that and take me more seriously. I'm scared they will laugh and send me home and if they do that, I will definitely end it for certain.
