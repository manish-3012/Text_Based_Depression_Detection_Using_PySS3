Everything's going right, but I feel so wrongI should feel "blessed" with the life I have. I had a shitty childhood but everything changed when I got married. I have a beautiful child and an amazing husband. 
The only problem is me. 
Why, even with everything so seemingly perfect, do I just want to rip into myself. I feel so dead inside. But I can't leave them, it would destroy my family. I just can't shake it. I just...I don't want to be here. Sorry...just had to talk to someone. Anyone.
