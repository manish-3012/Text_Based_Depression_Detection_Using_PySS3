I'm fifteen and I have no real reason to liveI don't have the capability to do the same thing over and over again I don't want to go out into the world slaving away for things I don't want or actually need the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I can't convince myself to put the twenty people in my life who are actually good and decent in so much pain
