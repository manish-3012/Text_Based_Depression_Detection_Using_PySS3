Suicide for the good of my kids...I need to make them money somehowHi everyone -

I'm sorry to report that I've been seriously considering suicide lately, but not for the typical reasons.  I'm really not a depressed guy for the most part, besides one thing.  I'm a 40 year old with a wife, three beautiful kids, and a big house in one of the wealthiest and nicest areas in the country.  We've lived a good life thus far.  Unfortunately its all been falling apart recently..

I lost my job two years ago, which paid a good amount of money.  Since then, for the last two years, I've worked 7 days a week looking for jobs.  I've submitted more than 2000 job applications, had more than 250 interviews, and have advanced to mid-round/final-round stages with companies 84 times.  Unfortunately I just can't find work.  It would seem that I'm doing well enough to attract interest, but not good enough to close the deal.   I've done the mathematics on these numbers and it seems like there is an exceedingly low probability of having no hits with as much activity as I've had.  Now unemployment insurance has been used up.  All my contacts have been milked at this point.  There is nowhere else to go.  

Given that we're low on funds, I'm planning to commit suicide soon (over the next few weeks) in order to cash in on a big life insurance policy I took out, that would insure that they have enough money through college while living a swanky life.  I'd rather not do this, as I'm a formerly happy guy who loves his family, but I see no other option to make money. 

While this may seem a bit extreme, many counselors in my life think it makes sense.  My rabbi thinks it will be a noble sacrifice.  My career coaches and life coaches are stymied as to why I can't find work, as active as I am, and one believes God has a plan for me to sacrifice myself.  

I feel happy writing this that this is the smart, and only move, possible given the hand that fate has thrown at me.
