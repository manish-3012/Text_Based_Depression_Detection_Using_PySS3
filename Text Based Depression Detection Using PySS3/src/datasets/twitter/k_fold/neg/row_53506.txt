I'm a waste of space and I'm sorry I'm still alive.Usually, I'm a strong person. I don't give in to depression very much but lately it has been very hard to actually live. The past few years, I dealt with it and I was fine. I even joked about how suicidal and depressed I am however, this is no laughing matter anymore.

Today was a bad day. Not because I woke up on the wrong side of bed but today nothing seemed to be going well. It was a series of things that didn't go well. In the morning, I got to work and shit was piled up. In the afternoon, my boyfriend and I had a fight and it's like it's not even a big deal to him. In the evening, I was making dinner for my family and every fucking thing was a mess. I have bigger problems to deal with and this day isn't helping.

For every 20-30 good days, one bad day can change every thing. Today, all I did was cry. Cry in my room, cry while working, cry while I was texting my boyfriend, cry while cooking, cry while typing this. 

Fuck this bullshit. I'm so fucking tired. Living is so hard, especially the life I live. Hoping before the new year starts, I'm already gone.
