Suicide pactIf someone is at the verge of taking their life and are too scared to do it alone. Please contact me. I lived with my love of my life for 7 years. I cannot see a life without her. For many various reasons she don't want me anymore. But what made it more worse is that the years we spent together is not making and impact in her whatsoever. Im done. I can't just move on. Im loyal to my love.
