I want to...because I hate this feelingRight now it doesnâ€™t seem like anything is going in my direction.  Wife had two affairs...despite this I tried to make it work, then she filed for divorce.  Now courts are ruling in her favor with the kids and child support.  On top of that, work is an absolute shit show and Iâ€™m about to lose my job.

I just...donâ€™t know if I can take it anymore.  I spent more time last night thinking through doing something to myself than I ever have in the past.  My only things holding me back are my kiddos and my religions beliefs and being scared of what the â€œafterlifeâ€ looks like with it.

But despite that, thereâ€™s part of me that wants to escape from here.  And itâ€™s getting harder and harder to push that down...
