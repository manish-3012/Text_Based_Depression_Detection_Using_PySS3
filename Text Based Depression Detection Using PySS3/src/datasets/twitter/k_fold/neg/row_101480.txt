The thought of going away helps so much to calm myselfIts like I dont want to really die, but idk just thinking that I can go whenever I want and all this suffering could end feels so calming and peaceful. Some might say, yea but you will die. True that but I am not thinking that much, just thinking about being at peace and free from this suffering helps so much.
