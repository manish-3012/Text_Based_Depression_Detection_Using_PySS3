Tired of being a jokeAnother girlfriend cheated on me. These girls think I'm stupid and they can somehow cheat on me without me finding out but it's happened so many times I know every trick there is. What the actual fuck.

There's also a crippling amount of student debt and not being able to get an entry level job. I was told college was important and it fucking isn't. Just like love. Was there ever a point where I was actually loved? 

Basically I want to be dead. I'm angry and I'm depressed but most of all I'm tired. Just tired of it all.
