I just don't know what to doMy life has been pretty much a mess ever since I was two years old, my mother died, I got abused by my aunts who I had to move it, in highschool I got a boyfriend who would physically, verbally and sexually abuse of me and which lead me to have a very bad depression and made my agoraphobia even worse, making me drop out on my last year of highschool because I couldn't handle the stress I was going through. I have been wanting to kill myself since I was 15, I am 21 now and I feel like I can't handle it anymore. I looked for psychiatric help, I got a boyfriend and amazing friends but I just feel like a bother, like a burden in people's lives just because of how broken and emotional I am. My friends have to often talk me out of suicide, my boyfriend just today said he is sick of me being so sensitive, my family doesn't really care and my therapyst just makes me feel worse.
I want to stop feeling like this.
