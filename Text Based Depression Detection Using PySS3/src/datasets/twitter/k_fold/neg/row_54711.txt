I won't dieI have long struggled with depression and 6 years ago I had a traumatic heartbreak that led me to lose my mind.  I was able to survive that by teaching myself to not feel anything. Even while not feeling I still never thought I was worth anything, I kept fucking up but for the most part it was under control. Fast forward 6 years and I met someone who completely captivated me.  This being me it didn't end well and I was shattered again.  I attempted suicide but survived, after that I completely lost my mind and saught any form of pressure which resulted in me financially crippling myself.  After hitting the new low I tried again but survived again.  I feel hopeless and trapped and I don't know what to do.  I have brief moments where I feel I can do this, but they never last long. I really just want it all to end but it won't. I feel I am destined for misery and despair.
