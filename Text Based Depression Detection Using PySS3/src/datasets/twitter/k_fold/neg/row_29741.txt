I'm so tired. I need someone to talk to.I made a post a few weeks ago. The basic gist was that my ex broke up with me back in June and that my feelings for him had not abated, that I didn't want to spend our anniversary day alone, and that I wish I were dead.

I said that it was all my fault and was assured that it couldn't have been, but the truth is that it really was. I was emotionally abusive and at least once accidentally hit him when I just meant to push him away.

I still love him more than anything, but I did the usual "right thing and deleted him from Facebook, started working out to exhaustion, etc. He still talks to me on IM once in a very long while and I'm cordial, but distant when he contacts me. It's extremely difficult, though, and just seeing his username makes me feel a sudden, uncomfortable tightness in my chest that lasts the whole day. It also seems like he only talks to me to tell me subtly how much better his life is than mine.

Yesterday would have been our third anniversary. I was planning on ordering a tank of nitrous oxide and a gas mask to breathe it in with, but I couldn't do it. I could barely even cry.

I feel like I've become estranged from reality. Nothing makes sense any more. I feel like the fundamental nature of reality is somehow illusory, but I can reason that this is not the case, or at least impossible to tell.

I can't believe I treated the man I loved more than anything in the world so poorly that he stopped loving me and never wants to even see me again.

I don't know what to do. I've tried putting myself out there and dating again, but it hasn't worked out.

I don't know. I guess I'm just wasting your time. I'm probably not in any immediate danger. I do wish I were dead, but I don't think I have the guts to kill myself. It's just that I've been living on autopilot for the last few months and I'm so tired and just want to land and rest.
