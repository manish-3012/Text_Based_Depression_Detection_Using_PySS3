Satan has blinded all of your eyes because he is working and you are doing nothingSuicide watch for the sluggards who will not get up and use their talents and gifts that God gave them...

What is wrong with your life?... no GF, car, lost years, money, lonliness.

But is that bad? Many people have all your  depression reasons and are as happy as can be 

&amp;#x200B;

So what really is the problem? Mindset. It's simply your mindset your inability to just plan your day out hour by hour and fill it with fun activities has landed your here 

&amp;#x200B;

Also your social medias instead of deleting your social media with or without telling people that you're gona leave (I left ghost, straight ghost, meaning i spontaneously deleted all my social media apps on my phone and just started living life )  you rather stay there and waste your one life looking at others live their life YOUR ONE LIFE.

I used to be depressed, it wasn't until I just completely stopped looking at other peoples life, took care of myself, and planned out my day with fun things that I got out of depression 

&amp;#x200B;

So go out and live life YOU ONLY HAVE ONE LIFE. First off, don't kill yourself, again, mindset.. You literally are not doing anything or your too busy with comparing your life with others, one or the other. Go plan out your day with things that you like and delete social media (social media is irrelevant it just seems relevant)
