Writing my suicide letter.I feel so ungrateful for coming back here and saying i want to kill myself again but itâ€™s so hard i really donâ€™t want to be here anymore and itâ€™s gotten worse so I wrote out my letter incase i do it out of impulse or actually go through with it. I had a terrible mental break down last night i was banging my head against the wall tearing my hair up and sawing at my neck with a knife and trying to choke myself out. Now iâ€™m awake and my head is throbbing so bad and my face looks swollen. I feel like i really have mental illness but i canâ€™t get it fixed because my family canâ€™t afford it so iâ€™m stuck like this until i get help or actually go through with it


With that being said.. What triggered it was my friend. One of my online boyfriends friend looks so much better than me but theyâ€™re just friends! Sheâ€™s super pretty and theyâ€™re just friends.. What is he going to think about me when he sees me? I know looks shouldnâ€™t matter this much but boys are very visual and i know that.  We exchanged pictures and i sent a picture of myself and she said â€œYour hair is so fluffy i want to touch it ðŸ˜‚â€ What does that mean and what are the laughing emojis suppose to mean..? 

She did say my face was cute but she made more comments on my natural hair than my face. My hair wasnâ€™t even suppose to be the focus.. I donâ€™t like being black. He probably isnâ€™t expecting me to be black lmao. We met in game and heâ€™s character is darker than mine (So was my friend i exchanged pictures with iâ€™ll refer to her as C for now on) so i expect them to be black. Now race really shouldnâ€™t matter i know but i let my other group of friend found out my race and now iâ€™m the butt of the joke. I donâ€™t know why itâ€™s so fucking hard for everyone to accept the fact that iâ€™m black.. My own mom doesnâ€™t even like it and she had me! She says my hair looks manly the natural texture it is so she permed it and now my scalp is damaged because she burned it and my hair looks thin. I missed my hair but iâ€™m growing to hate my hair and my skin. 

I use to love it and be all for black girls magic but iâ€™m going backwards.. Donâ€™t get me wrong iâ€™m in no way saying i hate my people or would disrespect them because how i feel but itâ€™s causing so much problems for me even in my hole life. To top that all of my mom is with someone colorist who doesnâ€™t like darker skin women but is somehow pro black? it makes no sense. And she talks about how weâ€™re less than her and says sheâ€™s nor racist and makes me agree with her or else shell act depressed and say she canâ€™t share anything with me anymore.. So i agreed. I had no fucking back bone but if this topic comes up again I WILL tell her how I feel and how itâ€™s wrong.

A bit rambling theyâ€™re but yeah i just wanted to talk about that for a bit because being black is really a problem in my house hold unless your a man of course then your seen as manly. I know itâ€™s not healthy to focus on politics but i canâ€™t not focus on it because my step dad constantly shoves down our throats that weâ€™re black and that we have it worse. I try not to get too much into that because i felt secure and i already knew this but iâ€™m really started to question myself and itâ€™s driving me insane not even he wants a BW. I just want to be seen as a normal fucking person. I just want to be seen as human and equal at least and i donâ€™t want my race to make me stand out and i keep seeing people on reddit say â€œnO ofFeNsE bUt i dOnT fInD bLaCk gIrLs aTtRaCtiVeâ€ Holyshit i get it okay! Iâ€™m not attractive you donâ€™t like me iâ€™m seen as a man okay leave me alone about it please..

Iâ€™m too weak to exist. I canâ€™t be like this and be black. And my online bf probably assumes iâ€™m white because i sounds like it and i guess â€œactâ€ like it..? Idk i really didnâ€™t want to make this about race but i feel like thatâ€™s all heâ€™ll see me as if i show myself. I donâ€™t wear any hair extensions or anything itâ€™s all natural because people say they donâ€™t like when black girls do it and were fake so i donâ€™t and never really have. But now my hair is a problem i donâ€™t get it ðŸ˜­ Just so much added BS for no reason other than my race that i have to worry about! 

I hope this doesnâ€™t offend anyone because iâ€™m just speaking about my experience what people said and how i feel about it and the only reason iâ€™m talking about it in this sub reddit is because itâ€™s motivating me even more to kill myself. I want to bleach my skin now.
