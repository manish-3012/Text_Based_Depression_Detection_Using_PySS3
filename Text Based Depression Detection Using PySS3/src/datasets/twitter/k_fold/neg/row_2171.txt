I want to give up.I feel selfish. I am told I am ungrateful for what I have. I don't do anything. I am only 15. I don' help around the house I just sit there in my room rotting away. Sure I have friends I guess and a girlfriend who I have been through this before but She's away in Mexico and with a difference of 6 hours I can't discuss something like this it's only like 10 am there for her, She doesn't deserve to hear something like this. It isn't fair. I sit here waiting for that letter to come through my door showing my shitty exam results. For my parents to shout and scream telling me what a waste I am. Thanks guys, really appreciate it. I have just failed to kill myself there with my tie not being tight enough and me breathing and deciding against it. I do not appreciate anything I have. Friends, girlfriend, good pc (actually has now got a new CPU but will be receiving a new one if I don't end it). I still feel lost. I am afraid of opening up to someone because I don't want to put them in a position like that. I've been in it myself after my friend almost died and told me he can't really talk for the next 2 weeks. I didn't even know. Tbh we kinda did lose touch for a bit but fucking hell. He tried to slit his wrists. My best friend could've died. I guess that puts me in everyone else's perspective, and I thought that would of been the biggest deterrent for me but I don't even care anymore. Downloaded this sarahah app and used it on snapchat just to be told I'm an asshole and people dont want to see me. I know guys and I am sorry. I want to have a future. I am very technologically minded I quite like gadgets and the sort but idk if I am university material tbh. I just don't care anymore if I die I don't have to stress anymore, heaven practically just silence. Peace and quiet, free. I guess I'll just have to try tommorow.
