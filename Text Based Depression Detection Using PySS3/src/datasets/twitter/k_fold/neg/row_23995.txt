I don't think I can do this anymoreI'm a 26 year old widowed mother of 4 children under 3.  The pain of being alive is too much for me and I can barely function, sleep, or care for my daughters.  I know how selfish I am, I know that my 4 little babies need me, but I think they would be better off without me.  

Today, 4 months after my husband's death, my best friend cut me out of his life because my emotions are making me so unpleasant and I'm not the friend he signed up to have anymore.
