absolutely hate my fucking selfSo I am 18 years old and a guy if that matters for anything. My life is not bad at all. Have good friends and family for the most part. I do prefer to be alone for some reason idk why. I've been suicidal for 3-4 years now. And I think I've finally had enough. I like to be nice to people and help others btw. So here is my problem my fucking mind. I always and I mean always see the worst in people. If they have a big nose, fat, ugly I always see these things first. This may not seem like a big to some people but to me it just fucking upsets the shit out of me. And next I'm a fucking physco and a freak and a pervert. My mind is so fucked up I can't take it anymore. I don't hate life and I would like to live. but the things that I think if in my head are disgusting and it would probably be best if I did die. 
To sum up why I'm going to kill myself in January is bc of 2 things

my mind being a sick physco pervert 

me seeing the bad in all people never the good and I can't fucking help it. fuck
