Why do I want this?I want to kill myself. But itâ€™s for a couple reasons. One is Iâ€™m so sick of the crap Iâ€™m going through. The second is because I want those who hurt me to suffer as I have suffered. I donâ€™t know why, but I know that last one is the only reason I havenâ€™t yet. Cause I donâ€™t know if I can watch them suffer. I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™ll even care. I donâ€™t even know who will notice.
