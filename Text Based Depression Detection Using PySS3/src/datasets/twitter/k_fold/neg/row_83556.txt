I just want it to go awayHi my name is Ryan and Iâ€™m on the edge and just want someone to talk to right now. Iâ€™ve already tried suicide twice and keep going back to it but donâ€™t know why. Well I do and I donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve had a lot of stress at work and at home and sort of distanced myself from others. I donâ€™t have any friends anymore and my family has enough to deal with as it is and donâ€™t want to burden them with my life. I feel like my life means nothing no even to my work.
