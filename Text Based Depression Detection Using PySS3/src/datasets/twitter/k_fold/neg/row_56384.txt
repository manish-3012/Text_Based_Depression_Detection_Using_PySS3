I wanted to kill myself in the bathtub, but I couldn'tI just sat there, with the water up to my nose.  
Every time I went down, I got annoyed by the water running in the back of my throat and came back up again.  


Guess I'm looking for attention, but I don't know from who.

I need help.  


I contacted the suicide hotline (by mail, I'm not good at talking right now) but I haven't received an answer yet. I have no real friends to ask for help and I feel so lonely.
