Really struggling lately.I've been having a hard time lately with suicidal thoughts. I don't know that I could ever go through with it because 1) I worry about the wrong person finding me (family), 2) I don't want to inconvenience all the people that would have to be involved (medics, police, etc), 3) I don't want my daughter to be know as "that girl who's dad killed himself", 4) I'd probably just screw it up anyway. I really don't have anyone to vent this stuff to. My wife has her own anxiety issues and worries enough as it is. I don't want to put this on her plate as well. The only other person that I have talked to about my mental health issues has her own problems to deal with (whole other story). I just don't know what to do. I don't think my meds are working any more but I always chicken out about asking for new ones when I'm talking to my psychiatrist. Maybe I just needed to get all this off my chest.
