Uphill constantlyThings just constantly seem like uphill battles. Iâ€™ll do ok and be functional enough, take care of my kid, and sort of keep house but after that Iâ€™ll loose the facade and everything back to being too much. Iâ€™m just constantly tired and shouldnâ€™t have existed in the first place. I really wasnâ€™t ever meant to be here and I donâ€™t understand why I am. Plenty of others could use the time better.
