Life is a constant stream of erosionNot of rock, but of lies. Lies of happiness.

Weâ€™re born happy because weâ€™re ignorant. But when we die, itâ€™s our choice whether to remain ignorant and keep lying to ourselves, or accept life for what it is: empty.

People may call that dark, but I would call it raw. Maybe Iâ€™m not depressed. Maybe youâ€™re the one with the mental illness. Maybe everyone else in the world who refuse to accept life for the giant shit pile that it is, are the ones who have trapped themselves in a masquerade or facade. 

I hate people who force â€œpositivityâ€ on me. People who tell me to just â€œnot give upâ€. 
I hate how if you tell someone youâ€™re planning on killing yourself, you can be put into psychiatric hold. Itâ€™s my life. Itâ€™s not yours to take reign over. Let me die. Just let me fucking die in peace.

I hate this world so much, and I donâ€™t blame it for hating me back.
