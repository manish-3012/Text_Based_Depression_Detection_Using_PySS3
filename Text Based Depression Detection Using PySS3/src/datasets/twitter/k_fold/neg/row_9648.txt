Itâ€™s mostly just dumb minuscule things but they keep adding up.I tried overdosing on a lot of shit my parents had in the medicine drawer last sunday. I get called tits (Iâ€™m a guy) daily. I love the cold, so naturally a nickname of mine is â€œBlubberâ€. My friends always go out together and never invite me anywhere. I have several projects due tomorrow that are too late to start. My parents think Iâ€™m so smart, but Iâ€™m not and they wonâ€™t accept it. I was supposed to be their best poster child firstborn. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and OCD, but my parents refuse to get me treatment for it. I have come to them and said that I want to die, and my dad told me to get over it. I have to dodge basketballs in P.E. because Iâ€™m a walking target. I had 10 friends, and then I pushed all but one away to make my girlfriendâ€™s life so much better because we were going through the same things. She then proceeded to dump me for my one remaining friend 2 weeks ago today. I loved her, and she told me that she loved me too. I just mentally and physically canâ€™t handle all of these things at once, and thereâ€™s so much more. My GPA goes to shit because of P.E. Itâ€™s all so minuscule but itâ€™s getting to a point. I know that I donâ€™t have to worry about a job or being homeless like most of you guys, but it hurts so much and I want it to go away. I have a stutter that comes out a couple times a day and people hate talking to me because of it. Iâ€™m tired of life.
