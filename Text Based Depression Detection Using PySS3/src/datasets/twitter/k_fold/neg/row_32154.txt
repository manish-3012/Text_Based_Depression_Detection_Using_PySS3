no one is coming2 year long distance relationship. left my partner for him and the associated health insurance- which didn't seem to matter at the time. moved and got a place that i really can't afford so he could move here and be with me. 
waited 2 years. spent every night waiting for him to show up to skype. which he did mostly, but some nights not. and when he didnt' show it was always "i'll be right there" i'll be home at 8. 
and "i'm moving there" .. which he did finally move here. about 4 months after breaking up with me. and guess what- his wife is shortly moving up to join him. yup. after 2 years with me and separated he want back to his wife. 
so i was just what he used. i don't know what for. sex? 
and then he moves up here and says he wants closure and i let him back in close. real close because i want it too. i want to feel like he did love me and he wasnt just using me and here i am waiting for him. so he comes here a couple times for "closure" and we end up having sex and he says he still has feelings but he is definitely not leaving his wife. and what does that make me? 
for being fucking a broken fucking mess? for wishing i had an off switch. where i could just shut myself down and not have to feel this pain?
he said he was coming here tonight. but no- he's too tired. so instead of telling me three hours ago so i could have done something with myself- i'm sitting here feeling so fucking helpless. because he has so much power over me. and i still feel like i'm in love with him.why? why am i so fucked up that i'm in love with someone that doesn't give a shit about me. 
every day i get in the shower and imagine slicing into my arms and letting all the blood drain out and the first couple times i thought about it .. i felt like it was about wanting him to hurt for hurting me. but now i just imagine the relief. the relief of death.
