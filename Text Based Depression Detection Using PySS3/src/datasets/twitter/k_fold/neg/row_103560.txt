Not sure if I can live anymore, going insane inside my own mindHey all,

I've been in a deep state of depression, and pain for some time.  Gotten to the point I feel trapped mentally and not able to do much of anything,  I haven't had a job in a year(I'm 23) before that I've only had seasonal work. My community is limited for work and I've had a hard time getting one.  I've tried a lot but haven't put my utmost into it because I'm really afraid.  Afraid of committing ad hearing to a schedule when I'm so tried and drained all the time I sleep during the day often and feel very weak.  

I feel like I'm going insane from boredom but can't do much about it.  I live on a hill on the outskirts of town and it's a neighborhood next to sage hills and is okay but I'm feeling like I'm trapped alone in it.  Like my environment is driving me insane mentally.  I've been mainly in my house for such a long time , only leaving to go out sometimes to town in the afternoon or do some stuff for mom.  Dad pushes me to go do stuff on his days off sometimes and causes me a lot of anxiety the conflicts I have with him.  I would try to excersize more but I'm afraid I have a mental block that I can't do it.  Hard to explain really.

I feel can't move on with my life, and I'm not mentally right, my dad is angry complains at me a lot is verbally abusive and my mom somewhat understands but doesn't completely.  I'm in therapy but it's not helping me much.  

Almost wonder if I need to go to the hospital or inpaitient therapy but I'm afraid and uncertain.  I asked my therpaist about it but says inpaitient is mainly only for people who are in danger of hurting themselves.  

I can't lay at home much longer but feel so unwell to even think in my own mind everyday.  I don't know what to do I'm suffering a lot.  I don't want to harm myself but I'm scared I can't go on this way.

Thanks for the support
