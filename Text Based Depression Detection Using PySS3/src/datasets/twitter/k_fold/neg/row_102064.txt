I don't know what to do anymoreI just can't do it anymore. My girlfriend just broke up with me because she just didn't like me anymore and wanted to be independent, my best friend just went through her own breakup and is so unstable that she refuses to talk to me out of misplaced anger. I'm only 18 and about to graduate. I know I should be looking forward to things but I can't, I'm not good at meeting new people and now I have to start all over in college, I am scared of living on my own and don't want to do anything. I feel so selfish because I know it could be worse but why doesn't anyone want me? I'm a nice person and always try to be kind, what did I do to deserve this? It isn't fair and I don't want to be here anymore, which makes me feel selfish so I only want to do it more. I don't know what to do. (i apologize for any bad spelling from my phone)
