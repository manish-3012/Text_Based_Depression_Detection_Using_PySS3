I cant continue to live my lifeI cant continue my school, I cant look for a job. Many times I tried to be a better person, with many failures. Many times I tried to be a more social person, many times I got (even aggressively) rejected. My familiy is torn apart, and the ones im living with doesnt care about me, just what I "could do" if I werent so shit. I tried to change me, my life, but in the end I always fall back into misery. I am all alone, and I want to be that, and always want to continue to be.

I dont want to leave my house, my room anymore. Ill just wait here to rot away and die, but I have to help to achieve that...maybe it will be the one time where I dont fail to change my life
