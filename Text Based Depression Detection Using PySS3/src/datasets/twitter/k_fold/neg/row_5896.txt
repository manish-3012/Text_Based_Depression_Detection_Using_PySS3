Final goodbye. â¤ï¸ - B.R.Thank you to everyone on this thread. Not only have your posts given me a temporary amount of hope in the past, but also they made me feel less alone. Donâ€™t ever give up. Life will get easier as time passes for all of you. Unfortunately after tonight, I wonâ€™t be here anymore. This isnâ€™t me trying to get pity at all either. I just want to try &amp; help people suffering before I go. Itâ€™s been a long road. Itâ€™s crazy how much Iâ€™ve changed the past couple years. Iâ€™ve had my highs &amp; lows throughout my life, but the past couple years have been some of the worst Iâ€™ve ever experienced. I accept whatever the afterlife has to offer me, if there is one. I just cannot be here anymore. Iâ€™ve made my decision. After years of therapy, medication, and hospital admissions Iâ€™ve came to the conclusion that it wonâ€™t get better for me. Everyone of you here has potential and a purpose on this earth. Donâ€™t ever give up. Be nice to everyone, you never know whatâ€™s going on in their minds. Live everyday to the fullest. If youâ€™re in a dark place, it will pass eventually. Youâ€™ll get through it. Iâ€™m so sorryðŸ’” Goodbye, see you again one day.
