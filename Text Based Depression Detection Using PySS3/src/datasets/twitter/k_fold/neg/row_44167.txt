I feel it comingThe best way to cure a disease is to prevent it and I want to stop this feeling before it develops more. I have my goals in life I have people and whatever but there's this feeling creeping up slowly. I tell myself "oh if I just give it more time I'll get where I want" but it doesn't and slowly the truth unfolds and I start to hate everything. Anything that could knock some sense into me? Besides the usual family, friends, goals I know all that I have ambition but it's something that keeps whispering "you may be eligible for suicide".
