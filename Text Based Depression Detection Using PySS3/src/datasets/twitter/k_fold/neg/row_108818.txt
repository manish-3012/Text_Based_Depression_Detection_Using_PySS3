How do i get sober and control my self harm urges? everything i try makes things worseIf you want more details drop me a line or check out my other posts. tonight is my first sober night in a long time. I'm not going to rant this time. everything i try makes things worse. i've been going to SMART recovery meetings and i just feel worse, well mostly. SMART is supposed to be more empowering than AA. everyone in the group goes to AA  and is new to SMART so im worried about AAs influence in the group. lots of things said there bother me. i talked about my suicidal thoughts and one lady twice my age told me she's suicidal for life. that's sad itself but i know that'll be me which hurts horribly. another one person said the only way to get sober is to view everything as perfect even when its not. that just adds  to my fear that lies arethe only thing out there for miserable fucks like me. they are still great people in don't get me wrong, i just don't think it will help. theres many many things my old therapist ssaid that mentally destroyed me and sapped me of any hope for the future. i feel a depth of self hate i never thought possible. I even cut myself a few times but i think i'm done with that.  when i read up on getting it's either religious propaganda, tellig my to get over it or something so ridiculous that it bums me out that this is the best help available. how do i get sober and control my self harm urges? why do i even bother?
