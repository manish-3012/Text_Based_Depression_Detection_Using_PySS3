So fucking sick of trying to keep anyone around me and getting forcibly isolated from people.Whenever I wanted to do something creative I've either been laughed at or left alone at any idea I had, always got that "sorry bro" thing. Same thing with any attempts at social life in the past two years. People do have other people around and can count on each other for fuck sake either professionally or just socially.
Never been a dick to anyone, always tried to keep everyone around happy as it's been an obsession of mine but for what? To be always told "sorry bro" at any suggestion or being flat out ghosted by every single person I considered a friend at one point or another? I've always wanted to be understanding. Yes, people have their own lives, their responsibilities and stuff but to avoid me at all cost and ditch every single time I reach out? To ghost me every single fucking time we supposedly make plans? I feel like I'm being forced by everyone to just fucking crawl under a rock not to bother everyone and im so fucking sick of it. This is just getting ridiculous and I think it's better just to off myself. Try and give me one good reason why should I keep going and putting up with this shit. I'm basically pushed under a rock already so noone's gonna miss me anyway and sure as fuck I won't miss this fucking world. I'm scared of doing it but the time is way past overdue, Think I'll go with pills or good old gas and lighter. And if anyone of you thinks im some fucking edgy kid I don't give a shit , leave a downvote and fuck off.
