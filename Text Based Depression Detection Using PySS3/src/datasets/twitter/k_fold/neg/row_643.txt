My friends explained my dream to me lolI showed my friends the painting I did of this lake in black and white and I said that I had a dream where I was stood at the side of this lake watching as everyone was drowning and looking on as they all drown because there was too many people and I didnâ€™t know who to save first and i couldnâ€™t choose and they were all drowning and there was nothing I could do and my friends said itâ€™s because I have been taking their problems into myself and maybe they are right but like, what do i do? Friends are there to support and help each other and itâ€™s not their fault they are all going through rough times and so I want to help but itâ€™s giving me nightmares or more â€œbus-maresâ€ i fell asleep on the bus home from college . What do i do guys? Iâ€™m just a kid, they are just kids, Iâ€™ve got my own shit but they are always there for me and I wan to be there for them but there is just so many and I have so much empathy and it makes me cry. Iâ€™m crying right now just thinking about the shit they have been through. 
I donâ€™t know how to fix all their problems and I need to because no one else will.
What do I do?
