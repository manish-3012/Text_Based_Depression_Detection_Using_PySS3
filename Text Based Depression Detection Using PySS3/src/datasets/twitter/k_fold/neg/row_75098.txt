I cry all the time.I'm lonely. I can't relate to anyone and making an effort to be friends with someone just doesn't even seem worth it. I thought about moving, in fact i've been dreaming of it. Maybe the change of scenery and people is what I need. But naturally all year things have been happening consistently to keep me here, in this depressive state (both mentally and physically.) 

So i'm done. I've decided tomorrow i'm going to end it. I've spent the majority of today and will tonight writing in my journal to leave behind. I want my parents to understand how I felt, they were *aware* but I don't think they ever fully got it. But I want them to know I love them, i'm crying now, but I really, really love them, despite all the absolute shit I endured throughout my adolescence. 

I already know how i'm going to do it too. Instead of going to work tomorrow i'm going to drive 2 hours away to my favorite hiking spot and i'm going to jump off of a cliff. I have fond memories at that park. It's one of the places that has made me feel calm and worry free.

Anyway, I don't know why I posted here. I guess I enjoy these subreddits because I know most of you relate to me on some level and it makes me feel less lonely. Thanks for reading
