Suicidal thinking as I wake upIâ€™ve just had a series of unsettling dreams that reminded me vividly of how in school I was ostracized, laughed at, unwanted because I wasnâ€™t talkative or fun. I thought I was over it but I feel kind of haunted by the experiences again.

I realized that it was my fault. It is my fault for not having the ability to fit in. I know some people say itâ€™s â€œcoolâ€ to not fit in but in reality it sucks. You canâ€™t relate to people, you have no support.

I donâ€™t know how but I manage to mess up all my chances. I wanted to be the extroverted likeable type but in truth people always found me weird and pushed me away. Itâ€™s a bit better now in my early 20s, Iâ€™ve learned how to act more â€œnormallyâ€ and be more outgoing but I still donâ€™t have any friends, or found my â€œtribeâ€.

I was thinking a lot about wanting to give up yesterday and now this morning. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family even though my relationships with them are not so good.
