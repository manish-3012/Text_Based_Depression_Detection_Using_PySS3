13 years of bullshitTo clarify, I'm not 13, that's how many year I've been depressed. It's due to social isolation and I'm just so done with trying. It's so exhausting giving up 3 times a day and trying to catch up with 13 years of instinctive and conscious social learning and I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm in agony, I feel trapped, I feel worthless and I sorta feel like writing my testemony and publicly executing myself.
I just feel so hopeless. I just want somewhere I belong, but after 13 years it feels like that will never happen and I might have to either get comfortable or get out
