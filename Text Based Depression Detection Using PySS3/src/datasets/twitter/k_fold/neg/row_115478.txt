28 year old US Army Veteran3 years active, a few min the reserves. Weatherboarded illegally, shot at my own battle buddies here in the USA at fort Hood, illegally.

I've been contemplating suicide for a long time, and I feel like the end is near. Deleted all of my social networks that mattered. Quit my job. My mind is no longer on my control. I never meant for it to get like this.

So, at this rate, maybe I'll last a bit longer. I dunno. Just thought I'd share.
