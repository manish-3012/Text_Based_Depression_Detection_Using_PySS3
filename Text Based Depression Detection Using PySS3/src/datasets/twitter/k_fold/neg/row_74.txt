Itâ€™s 3:50 am, and I am seriously contemplating suicide.Hey Reddit, Iâ€™m sure the post will get completely lost in the threads but Iâ€™m sitting here with a bottle of pills trying to come up with the best way to kill myself. Today I was slapped with realization that I have unfortunately surrounded myself with terrible terrible people. People who have lied to me, gossiped about me consistently and who have been downright fake. Iâ€™m currently in college and have been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 4 years or so. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide twice, and I havenâ€™t been successful. Part of me really wants to talk to someone but Iâ€™m to vulnerable and I donâ€™t want to waste peoples time and I donâ€™t want to be labeled as â€œdramaticâ€. Iâ€™m deciding if I want to write my â€œfriendsâ€ and family letters. Iâ€™m scared that if I fail this attempt I will be so judged and hated. None of this makes sense I feel as my eyes are blurry. But reddit if youâ€™re out there, if anyoneâ€™s out there Iâ€™m begging one last time for help before I Down this bottle of pills and climb to the top of my apartment building and succeed in finding some fucked up version of piece. I feel unloved, betrayed and downright worthless. But enough about me. This is where my story ends.
