AloneI really didnâ€™t know where to go, but I think I need help Iâ€™ve Been having allot of suicidal thoughts and have no idea who to talk to. I really want a girlfriend to be there with and have a laugh and good times, Iâ€™m a 23 year old British male who is really struggling on my own. I fear no one will ever love me and I fear I wonâ€™t ever be able to share my love. I donâ€™t want to be alone I really really donâ€™t. Iâ€™m so scared of being alone all my life I think thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m having the suicidal thoughts
