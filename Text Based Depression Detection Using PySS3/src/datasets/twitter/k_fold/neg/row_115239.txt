i really want to kill myself but i dont want to hurt my famillyi am alive but i dont feel like living. i started to think about killing myself 5 years ago (i am 23yo female )

i have no friends and my boyfriend brokeup with me 1 month ago. i live alone all my family is outside the contry. and this hollydays was soo bad for me. i feel so alone and i dont feel like i have a reason to live.

i at the university but i dont want to do homeworks. i cant. i just cant.

i am so alone. i cant handle this anymore.

i am so close to kill myself.
