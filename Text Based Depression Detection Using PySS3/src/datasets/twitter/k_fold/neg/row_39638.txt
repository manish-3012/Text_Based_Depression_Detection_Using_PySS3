19 today; Iâ€™m supposed to be happy, but I just wanna die...Hey everyone. Iâ€™m 19M and I wanna die. Like the title says. 

Iâ€™ve been desperately reaching out to people on r/needafriend r/meetpeople and r/r4r . Iâ€™ve had some success, Iâ€™ve met some cool people but I still feel lonely. 

I only have... (had?) on friend. Idk if she still thinks of me as a friend anymore. Iâ€™ve been pushing people away either deliberately or by the shear repugnance of my mental health symptoms and terrible social skills. 

She follows me on Reddit so she might see this. Whatever. While I probably wonâ€™t die imminently, much to my dismay, there is a moderately high chance in October. Iâ€™ll be visiting my uncle in Canada who has g*ns. I donâ€™t think I can do this anymore....
