I don't like when my parents get mad when I am depressed.This summer of 2020 I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) and whenever I'm depressed like everyday my parents don't exactly know. I hide it because they will ask why and say I act like that and I don't like explaining my feelings because I don't know why. I don't like talking about myself because I feel like I make it about me. It has been my fear for a long time. Sometimes, my family would say im depressed for a 1 reason and then I'd get over it.   


I feel kind of dreadful and I really don't want to exist anymore, I just don't know how to tell someone without being told to stop talking like that. It doesn't help my case at all but I also just don't want help. I've been so under the weather that my guy friend pisses me off alot. I know he means well but I have short temper right at the moment.

I don't know if I want to say this, should I? Eh, I really want to Kill myself but i'm gonna hurt people and I don't want to go to hell. I just don't wana live my life in fear but I can't undo the fear I have. I have fears that someone will assault me in a way. I watch murder mysterys to be safe. Also my mom was abusive but I dont live with her anymore.
