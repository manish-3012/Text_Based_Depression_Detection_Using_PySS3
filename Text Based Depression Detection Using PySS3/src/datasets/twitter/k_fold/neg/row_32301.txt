How I just learned to love myself and how you can too(this might help you this might not.)(you can read my previous post for more info)I used to be like you all I used to cut myself,chronically stress,and hate myself severely and overtime it's decreased but my past insecurities have never completely gone away.There is no point in hating yourself regardless of who you are whether you are simplistic,shallow,deep,complex etc because life was made hard.It just doesn't matter because I realized overtime that my self hatred wasn't getting me anywhere real self improvement is possible when you realize to love yourself.Self Deprecation is emotional self harm and emotionally harms yourself from the inside.All my life I have been misunderstood regardless of how I am.(We all have some misunderstandings from time to time though)Let me tell you this Misunderstood people are not like Onision or James Saroka. Misunderstood people are never truly based on morality,kindness,or even a higher power. Misunderstood people are not that simple and they often have trouble communicating with others without similar thinking processes. Misunderstood people should not be completely polarized they are not completely awesome and they are not completely awful like the examples I mentioned above. They are as human as human can be and they are in between just like you and me. We live in a polarized world that people are either completely awesome or completely awful. The vast majority of people I've meant that are misunderstood are usually deep and complex like me(it can also be based on perspectives) because believe it or not we don't just live in a polarized world we live in a simplistic and shallow world as well so these people are often not accepted by the general population. If you only think your complex because you have manners,have destroyed lives in several diverse ways,or are agreeable or anything related to that that is not enough evidence to prove that you are complex or complicated in an awesome way. Just like Avril Lavignes Song Complicated.There is the awesome type of complex and the awful type of complex.(and I've been in both types before)Also no one is born with true depth and complexity because it is just how certain people's brains naturally develop overtime.A truly deep person is someone who desires lots of closeness/love with others more than the average person.(they are very easily emotionally competent)They connect with others like a magnet because they fall in love with their character regardless of their flaws and often doesn't even see them.Deep people don't understand why others get judged or casted out for their demographics because they see beyond that.They don't understand why small talk is so overvalued and why most people's thinking are so polarized. They have trouble understanding true shallowness like why a lot of people nowadays hang out with others to simply benefit from them such as money,fame,and etc and not actually be happy or relaxed with any of the experiences they have with that person.They often see common complaints as annoying and way too basic and cringey. If they do complain it's often about the miscommunication they have with others or strong topics that most people tend to avoid.They often worry too much about how other peoples feelings are because they often have more emotional depth than most people do.They can behave selfishly like any human on Planet Earth because they can often complain/vent about how they are feeling too much(this is because they see directness/openess in relationships to be very valuable and don't understand indirectness very well)They don't excessively demand to receive compliments and gifts and when they are mistaken to be that way they get extremely frustrated because experiences such as quality time and seeking help is so much more valuable to them. Since they obsess over relationships more than the average person they often want to be popular(and no not the typical popular)the kind of popular where they are able to have several relationships without an excessive amount of miscommunication/stress/anxiety/depression.(They see this as extremely difficult but not completely impossible like most people do because they don't give up on relationships more than the average person).They can often apologize for everything and cry because they get really stressed when they believe they've hurt another person because they either have a lot of empathy or a lot of remorse.They use tons of body languages/facial expressions (shallow ones and extreme ones) when they speak to get others to understand them better and also because they have a large spectrum of emotions with tons of experience in them.Because of their large spectrum of emotions they tend to have difficulty stabilizing them as well.A lot of them have no issue in the musical theatre industry because they have no issue with Emoting,Body Languages,and etc.They almost never forget when they do something that hurt someone or their feelings regardless of whether it worked out or not because they still value some of the experiences they had with them and are extremely confused when things don't work out. They are also extremely confused about long term grudges because since they have several emotions it is quite easy for them to get exhausted from feeling grudges.However although they excessively care about others emotions they can also be impulsive and are not afraid afraid to tell others the truth if their ignorance is hurting them in some way.A lot of them have vivid imaginations based on their emotions while a lot of others don't.They often pay attention to their vocabulary and wording a lot to get others to understand them better as well.They seem highly interested in any subjects that talk about the mind,emotions,or people. Also when they fall in love they fall deel with someone and when that someone is with someone else they often back off as much as humanly possible because they don't want to ruin that persons happiness or relaxation.They can also be gullible which can be awesome/awful depending on the severity of the situation because if they are in a relationship with someone who is often direct/open they have a tendency to completely trust them. However there is definitely a downside to depth and it is that the depth can be excessively painful in a completely unhealthy/unstable relationship to the point that the depth turns into emotional dependency.This often happens when they want to get close to others but others don't want to get close to them(emotional incompetence).Now don't assume anything but not all deep people are like me hell most people don't even have all of these traits I just mentioned and not all deep people are people people.Some Deep People like me have learned that a lot if not most people desire excessive distance and not closeness with you because not everyone is going to be open direct or understanding of you and it's the saddest but most realistic thing that I had to learn and it's caused me to be more skeptical about people before I get into relationships with them now. As far as Complexity goes Complexity can also be based on perspectives and is also not completely polarized in fact it's not polarized at all. Complexity in it's awesomeness has to do with contradictory unexpected traits(quirky)and generally unaccepted ideas without being excessively hypocritical. Complex people are extremely diverse.There are Complex people who are ill/disabled or have no lack of ability then there are Intellectuals,Creators,and Etc.My contradictory traits is that I'm talkative in one on one conversations while quiet/disengaging in group ones,I'm detail oriented but I can also think large,I'm usually oblivious but I can also hyperfocus  on anything intellectual or artistic,I often drastically change my behaviors based on how I'm feeling so I do a mixture of overthinking and underthinking,I can be delusional in my maladaptive daydreaming but I can also see reality too by analyzing and researching,I can be extremely literal a lot but other times I can be extremely figurative,I have cross dominant hands so I'm neither completely a righty or a lefty,I have several different versions of myself,others,and places in my excessive maladaptive daydreaming.I don't want to carry on because I don't want to sound too extremely annoying or bore others with my rambling but hopefully some of you can relate to that stuff and stay true to yourselves about the things I just said but the key to loving yourself is to accept that you are both relatable/diverse human beings that have value and don't have to feel like you are dangers to society and that not everything is always in your control.
