July 16, 1994-June 4, 2020Hi, Iâ€™m new here. But....today is the day. Iâ€™ve been battling with depression literally all of my life. This past month of May has honestly been the worse. Motherâ€™s Day hit hard coupled with the 4 year anniversary of my moms passing which was on May 26. My girlfriend ended up breaking up with me and that was just the icing on the cake. Everybody always leaves with I need them the most. Thereâ€™s been 3 attempts in the past few weeks alone. The last one ended up with me being admitted for 5 days. During that time, I called my ex and told her I was sorry for everything. Her response was â€œplease stop contacting meâ€. Talk about a slap to the face and a stab in the back. Two days after I got discharged, I had one of the worse anxiety attacks Iâ€™ve ever had. I ended up breaking down and telling my aunt about the nightmares Iâ€™ve been having about my god brother and my cousin trying to touch me when I was little. Iâ€™ve never told any one in my family and I never even got the chance to tell my mom before she passed away. My heart is just broken, guys. From seeing my mom pass away in front of me to my friend getting murdered to the girl I love turning on me when I need her. Everything is just falling apart around me. I canâ€™t handle it anymore. I know some of this sounds silly but it hurts. Iâ€™d be better off dead than alive. Everyone would be happier without me and I know itâ€™s true. I canâ€™t do it anymore
