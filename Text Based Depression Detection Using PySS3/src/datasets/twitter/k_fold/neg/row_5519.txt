Hate everythingHate being part of such a vile group. Animals follow insitinct. Humans follow pleasure and it leaves destruction behind every one of us. Damage to the planet, to eachother, everything we touch.

Hate being white. Vilest of the vile. White people really fucked up the world. That's what I see in the mirror, ugly whiteness. The product of a disgusting history.

Hate being a woman. Hate being bombarded with how not good enough I am, not sexy enough, thin enough. I'm 26 with some wrinkles and my life feels over. Hate how many male friends I fucking hate now because of how casually they refer to women as sex objects, fetishize impossibly beautiful kpop stars and anime loli girls.

Hate the constant fear of getting raped and the terror of getting pregnant because doctors wont let me choose for my body to be sterile. Hate that I go outside fully covered with a mask and still get harassed by men in public and nobody says shit. No matter what I do I'm an object that will be abused again, because people are animals following their own pleasure and don't care who they hurt. You're just a meat hole for them to have a fun time with and then get thrown away.

Hate that someone on reddit once told me "men gotta nut" its fucking terrified me every day since that men really can't control themselves and I'll keep getting raped because MEN GOTTA THEY JUST GOTTA NUT

Hate that the good men I know have to deal with me in this shattered state. It's not fair to them

I'm disgusted to be a human being. Can't redeem us at this point just want to die and remove myself like a tumor
