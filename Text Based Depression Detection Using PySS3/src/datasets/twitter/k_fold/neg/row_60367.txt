Eh?Iâ€™ve struggled with depression since I can remember. Iâ€™m 24 now, had a daughter back in January. Iâ€™ve been married 2 years now, have a decent family, all that good shit. The only thing that keeps me going is my car (1995 Integra GSR), mom, and daughter. I feel like my wife doesnâ€™t understand and sheâ€™s always mean to me. But, I digress. Iâ€™ve attempted once when I was 16 and I woke up in a hospital, I took a shit ton of different prescriptions. But lately Iâ€™ve been feeling real down, I donâ€™t work, all I do is sell weed and coke, I make okay money but itâ€™s no life, always having shit on you, always having to have a gun when youâ€™re riding thru the city, and if you get caught youâ€™re fucked anyway. I just donâ€™t know what to think. One of my close friends blew his head off on the 25th so thatâ€™s not helping. Not saying Iâ€™m suicidal but I donâ€™t want it to come to that.
