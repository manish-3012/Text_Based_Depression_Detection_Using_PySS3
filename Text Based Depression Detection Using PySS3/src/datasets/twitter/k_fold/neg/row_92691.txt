I don't even know anymoreI'm going to delete this tomorrow because this isn't an alt account.   
I hate this shit. I'm not even sad really. ...just exhausted. I'm not looking for anything from anyone to tell me it will get better. It will, I know that, and then it will get shitty again. Etc. It's not like my life sucks I just can't seem to fucking pull out of thinking about suicide every damn day. And the worst fucking part is I can't do it. My closest friends mom jumped off a building last summer and I couldn't hurt my friend like that so I'm just stuck feeling resentful that she took that from me. I've always known I'd kill myself, I remember learning the word suicide as a child and realizing other people felt this way too, and I'm sure I will someday but it would take years of burning bridges and distancing so I can't do it now. I feel trapped. My body is fucked, I'm half blind and been getting dizzy again which means there's things wrong in my brain....again. I don't have health insurance so I can't get it checked out and I feel paralyzed to do anything about it. I just need to vent somewhere. I'll probably go to bed after posting this. Gotta be up early for work.
