Iâ€™m currently looking at train tracks from a bridgeOne moment I am so ready to throw myself on those tracks, the next the fear comes in and Iâ€™m terrified. Iâ€™ve been standing here for about an hour. I donâ€™t know how much longer Iâ€™ll be here. It is terrifying but the urge to just get it over with is so strong. Iâ€™ve waited so long for things to change and it just seems like itâ€™s not going to happen for me. I would rather not have to live in agony every day. I wish there was an easier way to do this. Iâ€™m just waiting for a fast enough train to come along so Iâ€™ll be sure itâ€™ll be instant. But Iâ€™m scared
