My maskTo be honest my life looks good to other people, but  I put on a mask. I am funny, decently attractive, and popular. I am 15 right now and had kinda a rough time growing up my parents had a terrible split when I was 8 and then lived together till I was almost 14. Home was in the least to say not a good place, when that was happening but my sadness made sense because my environment was awful. The good news is I have passed that. I genuinely donâ€™t feel like it effects me anymore. My mother is happy my father is so so, but is ok. Whenever I say how I feel everyone goes directly to saying itâ€™s because of my past, but thatâ€™s just not true. I realize now that my issues are that  I have many acquaintances, but  no true friends that Hmu, I am alone. I am also completely unmotivated; I canâ€™t get myself to do anything at this point even eat. I just lay in bed and play video games sometimes. I used to be an achiever with straight Aâ€™s, a star athlete and pursued my passion of stand-up comedy. I canâ€™t do anything anymore and I feel like my life is lost, Iâ€™m really not sure what to do. All I do is nothing, I am useless and alone, I have no purpose being on this earth.
