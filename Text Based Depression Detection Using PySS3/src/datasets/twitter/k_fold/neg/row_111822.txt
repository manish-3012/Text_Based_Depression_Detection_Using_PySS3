I'm doneI think this is it... I spend all my money on prostitutes and i'm finally done.  
For years i've been dealing with anxiety and depression, it has finally taking its toll on me. The only thing that is holding me back is the thought of my family living with me killing myself, it kinda pisses me off. I just don't want to live anymore but i can't do it knowing my family has to keep on living after i kill myself.  
I spend my last money on prostitutes while drunk and im really fucking done....
