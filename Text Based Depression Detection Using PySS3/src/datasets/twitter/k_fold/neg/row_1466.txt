This is pathetic, but I don't know where else to go.I've had a long history of mental illness, complete with one near-successful suicide attempt about five years ago. Recently, I was on the upward swing--feeling good, on a good combination of the right meds, and hadn't self-harmed in almost two years. I was on my way out of therapy, and had been transferred from a specialist to a GP.
Two weeks ago, it was my birthday. I usually hate birthdays, but I managed to have fun this year; I got myself balloons, went out to dinner, saw my boyfriend and got a piercing I'd wanted for months.

Two days ago, I started noticing signs of infection. I went today to get antibiotics, and was planning on gently and quickly switching the jewelery from a ring to curved barbell for comfort's sake. I snapped the ring against my cartilage while taking it out, caused a ton of bleeding and swelling, and couldn't get the barbell in. I am in hysterics. It seems this is all it takes to bring the flood of sadness and suicidal thoughts back.

I want to die. And not because I lost my piercing, but because I am a fucking pathetic piece of shit, who makes a big deal out of everything, ruins everything, makes everyone around me miserable, and generally is a worthless waste of oxygen. I have no future and no one would miss me who wouldn't be better off without me. I am a monster. I am a failure. I am ugly, fat, and volatile. I'm stupid. I'm generally a compilation of every awful quality on the face of the earth, and all it took to remind me was one little failure. Yay for being weak.

I've cried myself sick already, have ruined a late birthday dinner, and am on the verge of breaking my blades back out. The only thing stopping me is that my sheets are white and I don't want to have to clean up the blood.

I'm sorry, reddit. I know I'm being awful and that everyone else here has huge issues to deal with and I'm just really sorry I dont even know why I wrote this.
