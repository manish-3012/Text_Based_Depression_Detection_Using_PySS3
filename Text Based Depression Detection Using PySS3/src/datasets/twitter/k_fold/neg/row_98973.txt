I feel like itâ€™s about timeI am going to graduate from high school this year and I feel like my life is over already. I donâ€™t have a lot of friends and I donâ€™t bode well with any family members. My procrastinating behavior led to applying for colleges late and also not really applying properly which led to no acceptance and I clearly canâ€™t see anything in front of me anymore. Canâ€™t even talk about it with anyone; dad having some family problems and as my family values education very highly, they find me very incompetent for not getting any acceptance yet. Almost every time I am reminded that Iâ€™m useless and Iâ€™ll waste my life. I suppose it is true. So clueless as I am, this will probably be my last week. Ironic how next week will be my birthday and may as well be my last day.
