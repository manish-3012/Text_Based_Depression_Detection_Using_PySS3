Me and Arguments.Every time me and my sister get into an argument, she tells me things such as 'hang yourself in the basement' or 'go play in traffic' and also, 'I wish you would just die, I would never miss somebody as stupid as you.' She is 11 and I am 14. It really got to me today as I was playing a game where you Fight eachother, and I killed her in the game (its all online) and she got upset and told me "Im going to tell on you and if you dont get in trouble I hope you die so I dont have any siblings."

Im not really having any major suicidal thoughts but it has been making me quite upset every time I think about what she says to me all the time.
