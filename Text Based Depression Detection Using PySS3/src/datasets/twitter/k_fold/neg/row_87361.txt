Had to say something... and ask somethingHi,

I don't want to die, but death is on my mind everyday. I go to sleep thinking about it, and I wake up thinking about it. It gives me new perspectives and points of view of everyday experience, and it's looking bleak. Suicidal ideation serves as a consoling psychological crutch, and it's a little scary. 

I have dreams, aspirations... I'm passionately curious, but sometimes it's all I can do to just breathe. I love life but I can't deny that I've seriously considered giving up. The daily struggles of mental illness has had an accumulative affect on my desire to live. I can't tell my family about what I go through, they have enough on their plate. They're struggling too you know? Just in a different way I guess. 

I struggle to cope everyday, I can barely function. Infact... I'm a non-functioning member of society. I have done nothing to contribute to society. I've become a burden on society and on my family. I hardly ever speak to my family but I rely on them to survive because I can't work in my current state. I'm lucky I'm not on the street. Can't afford drugs or therapy. Family don't understand. I don't know how long I can go on like this. I've done a lot of personal research on my condition, and psychology in general and it's helped but... Idk. 

I'm alone day in and day out. I listen to the saddest songs with the saddest lyrics just so I can have something to resonate some of my feelings. I can't even leave the house. I don't think I'm agoraphobic but leaving the house does induce intense anxiety. I think it's related to c-ptsd. If I'm not in a state of intense anxiety- heart palpatations, uneven breathing, shaky hands, feeling like the end of the world is ontop of me - then I'm morbidly depressed. 

I hope it's okay for me to ask but does anyone know where I can read suicide journals? I've read one and now I really want to read more. I hope it's not inappropriate to ask.
