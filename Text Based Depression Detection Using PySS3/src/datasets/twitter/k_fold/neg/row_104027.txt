The love of my life ended things with me and I donâ€™t want to exist anymore.
My girlfriend of two years broke up with me today. She was/is still the best thing that has ever happened to me and I really thought she was the one I was going to be with for the rest of my life. I know Iâ€™m young and people may say that there are plenty more fish in the sea or that it will get better.

I just really donâ€™t think it will. Before we met I had depression and a lot of bad shit happened like an abusive step dad and being bullied etc. But everything started getting better and then I met her, and everything was perfect again. She was my best friend and we spent every weekend and every day together almost. We told each other everything and we had both been through heartbreak before and she had been through stuff herself. During this lockdown we stayed together every day and we started to argue more than we had ever before. Our arguments turned into shouting rows where she would shout at me and I would wrongfully insult her and call her names. She would sometimes insult me too or shout at me and we would just go back and forth until we see sense. I realise I am entirely in the wrong for doing that. She decided we should have some space and then today has decided for good that she doesnâ€™t want to be with me anymore. 

Due to us being so close and having gone through so much together and spending the most of the two years spending so much time together, this breakup hurts more than anything ever has before in my life. I feel like I havenâ€™t even got anyone who cares about me anymore. Nobody knew me like she did and everything just feels empty. I want her to be happy and I want the pain to go away. I donâ€™t feel like I want to carry on living on without her knowing that things wonâ€™t ever go back to the way they used to be. 

People may say Iâ€™m being dramatic or something. But sheâ€™s all I have and all I ever wanted and needed. And sheâ€™s just gone. 

I donâ€™t want to exist without her
