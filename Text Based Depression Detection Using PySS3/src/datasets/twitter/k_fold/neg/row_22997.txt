Why can't I do it why can't I just kill myself?The greatest problem I have is that I am transsexual. I hate it I just want to be a normal woman but I was born with the body of a man. I hate the Idea of surgery it scares me, I wish I could just be beautiful confident talented and creative. I'm not though I'm ugly, I'm stupid, I'm weak and I hate myself. I'll never be the best at anything and that's all I care about I want to be more than is possible for me I have high ambition but no drive or direction. Why shouldn't I just die if all I'm going to do is bitch and moan my whole life?
