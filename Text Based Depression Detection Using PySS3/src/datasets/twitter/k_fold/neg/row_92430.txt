Survival instinct prevents me from ending it more than emotional fallout.Is anyone else more frightened of pain and having an unsuccessful attempt than the hurt they will cause to their loved ones? Iâ€™m meant to feel blessed that people care about me but unlike most people itâ€™s not the last thing Iâ€™m hanging onto. 

I think that my parents will eventually understand that my death was a good thing as it is how and when I would have wanted to go. I also think if I articulated it adequately they would be able to live on without regret or thinking they could have done something different. Ultimately, my life will become less meaningful after a few years and everyone will forget me anyway. 

Probably very selfish but thatâ€™s the level of apathy Iâ€™m at.
