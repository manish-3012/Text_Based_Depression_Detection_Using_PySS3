Why is it when someone kills themselves theyâ€™re always labeled â€œmentally illâ€I know my title sounds ridiculous to some but seriously,  in my opinion being broke your whole life is reason enough too pull the plug. Yes sometimes the richest person in the world will call it quits and it of course is caused by depression because they had everything in the world and still werenâ€™t happy. Imagine having that Same depression and no car no girlfriend/wife or any chance of a future family? In my opinion thatâ€™s not being mentally ill you just didnâ€™t want to live in misery while you sit and see other people live comfortably. I guess Iâ€™m just trying to say a lot of times it makes total sense why people off themselves, The whole suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem is not always true sometimes we just have enough when thereâ€™s no light at the end of the tunnel.
