i want to die because of how ugly i amim fucking disgusting. my face looks disgusting. ive had people discuss me on the bus when i walked on, and talked about how if they looked like me theyd get plastic surgery. ive had my friends tell me im ugly without me prompting them. once i rested my head on a table when i was bored in class and my friend observed me for a moment and then said "you're ugly, you know?" 

people have fake asked me out and laughed about it because they'd never really date anyone as ugly as me. my parents know im ugly, my brother knows im ugly. i know im fucking ugly. i hate this face. i hate my body. i want to fucking kill myself and never have anyone laugh at me again, never have anyone stare at me again.
