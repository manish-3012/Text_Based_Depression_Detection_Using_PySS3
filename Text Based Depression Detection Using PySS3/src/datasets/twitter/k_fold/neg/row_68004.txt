19 and still not readylife is utterly terrifying to me and I honestly don't see me making it past 20, I'm supporting a lot of my family emotionally so i can't talk to them about it - i had a very abusive childhood and my mum was too sick to do anything about it, my sister has pretty severe depression about it so I try my best to keep them happy to the point where I do it subconsciously and it wears me down, I wake up every day and it takes me hours to get out of bed, not because im tired but because i can't think of a good reason why i should. my entire teenage life has been devoted to setting my own personal goals aside for other people and it feels like i have forgotten how to be happy.

the only thing at the moment that's stopping me from ending everything is that I don't think my mum or my sister would be able to handle it, but that thought gets thinner every day. I really don't want to talk to anyone or go and see a doctor because I don't want my family to see me for how i am at the moment, I'm starting to struggle with keeping up my act for the sake of others and im starting to get fed up of debating whether or not living is worth it.

help.
