Just started re-reading 'Veronika Decides to Die' by Paulo CoelhoTrying to convince myself of reasons why I would still want to be alive. For those who haven't read 'Veronika Decides to Die', you should check it out. I know the title sounds morbid but the book is certainly not. It has a terrific ending which always convinces me to want to continue.
