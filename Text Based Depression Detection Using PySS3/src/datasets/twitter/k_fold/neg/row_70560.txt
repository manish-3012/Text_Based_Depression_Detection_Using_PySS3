I don't have anymore energy, I just want to stop feeling.I don't have the energy nor the strength to go on. I wish I didn't have to stay alive, I just want it all to end. I'm just sick and tired of being alive, I just wasn't meant to be. I don't have the drive anymore, it doesn't matter what is given to me I'll still be exactly the same. I'll still do things exactly the same. My body aches and I'm just done with everything. I wish I could just kill myself.
