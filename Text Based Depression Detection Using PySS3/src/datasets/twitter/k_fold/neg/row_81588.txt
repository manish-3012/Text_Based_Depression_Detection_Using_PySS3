Finally back with a last updateWell...after 13 days of hospitalization including one day in the ICU and a couple days combined in a medical hospital and then the rest in a Psych Ward...I am finally home. I nearly died. I will not sugar-coat this fact. I nearly OD'ed on Metformin. I will spare y'all most of the details except that I was in tremendous pain and I dry-heaved for 4 hours straight before getting meds for nausea. I almost needed dialysis because my kidneys were shutting down. I made it out alive but barely. I was able to choose a hospital 30 minutes away that has a Psych Ward because I didn't want to stay local. My stay was hard on my heart being away from our 5 kids but I needed the help. I learned a LOT while I was there and I shed lots of tears...and I had lots of friends and had a LOT of laughs during my stay too.

Here is a tip for all who are considering suicide:

I saw Death. He was in my room as I was detoxing off the meds I'd OD'ed on. He was waiting for me, but I was lucky that a relative who had passed away some time ago stopped him. That was the scariest thing I have EVER gone through. 

I found that my problems were so not worth dying over. I encourage every one of you to GO TALK TO SOMEONE NOW. Your lives are worth something to someone...and that someone is me.

I care. A LOT. 

I won't be posting anymore as I don't need to. I am no longer suicidal and I have seen Death...and I am glad to be alive to feel the Sun on my face today and the warm breeze and all of Nature blossoming around me. I want the same for all of you. I will be around to post occasionally to help out but I will come less and less as I go back to life with my kids. 

I love you all.
