suicide by itself isn't good enoughThere are only two people who might be genuinely disturbed and have regrets if I killed myself (neither of them depend on me but they are family). Everyone else is either a family member I haven't talked to in years, a friend or classmate from *way* back, or someone I know from work. My suicide would have no real impact on them. They might be sad on a superficial level, but me being gone would not change their lives at all. "Oh no, plsvanish died. That's sad I guess. Oh well. Back to regularly scheduled programming."

But I don't want any of that. I don't want a funeral. They're a waste of money and an inconvenience for people who feel obligated to go and stare at a corpse. I don't want to be remembered. All memories of me will be of pity or disdain at how bad at life I was. I'm ashamed of that. What I really want is a way to erase all traces of my life from this earth. For anyone who knows me to forget that I ever existed, and for my possessions and bank accounts to just vanish into the wind. Then I can just go in peace without having to worry about implications or whatever sorry memories people have of me.

But that's impossible. So I guess I need to brainstorm ways to make suicide look like a freak accident.
