I'm going to do it tonightIts such a relief to know that there is a way out. I have tried so hard to fix things since my life fell apart over 8 months ago. But it hasn't worked. And theres no point in carrying on. I have to accept I cant change things, and my life is over.  Please pray for me to have the courage to do this. Not that God has every helped me before, but perhaps he's vindictive enough to help with this. I'm not sorry, I feel I brought all of this on myself, with my negative thoughts (law of attractions a bitch) but I can't seem to make it better. I'm going to go surrounded by the objects that remind me of the happy life I used to have, and thinking of the happy memories I made. I wish I had never been born.
