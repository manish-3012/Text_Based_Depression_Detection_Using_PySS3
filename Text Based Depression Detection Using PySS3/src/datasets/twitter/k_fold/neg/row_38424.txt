Everyone is moving on, everyone except for me..Thereâ€™s been too much sadness in my years to write about here. Too much. But I tried to work through it as best as I could. But now I do nothing. Now I sit in nothing. Nothing but remembering it all and the horrible decisions Iâ€™ve made while feeling hurt..
The worst part about being suicidal then recovering and going through it all again for a majority of my life is the destruction I caused. 
The decisions I made because I didnâ€™t expect to be here anymore to fix it up.

Debt. Deceit. No goals. Not looking after my health. Not being present in my sons life because Iâ€™m so fucking up and down. Nothing.

Iâ€™m alone, right now. Unemployed for over a year. Hating myself. Hating what was robbed of me. What is the point? 

Iâ€™m going to kill myself today. And Iâ€™m sorry to my son, to my partner and most of all- to the little me. The one who dreamt of being bigger than the issues around her.

Thank you for giving me a place to express my last words without hurting anybody.

Goodbye, Reddit.
