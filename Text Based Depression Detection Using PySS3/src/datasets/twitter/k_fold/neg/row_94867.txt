Death seems amazing right now. I just want to die.Everything is the worst. I can never have good things. Everything nice I've had is now lost. Being alive is useless. I am nice to everyone and it seems to do nothing. Egoistical people are always the most happy so lol. I am tired of the bullshit positive preachy stuff people answer my posts with. None of them know what it's like to have lost it all. Fuck everything.
