I donâ€™t understand the idea of loving yourselfIf you were the only thing that existed, existence would be meaningless, the way I see it. The only way you have value is in relation to others. Because of my thinking like this, I never understand and even get upset when people talk about how important it is to love yourself and how you canâ€™t love or be loved until you do. I can understand getting past disliking myself, to the point of toleration, but loving myself seems illogical and stupid if not egotistical.

I guess I posted this just because it connects a lot to my suicidal thoughts and I wanted to know if anyone feels similar??
