I don't hurt that much, I just don't think living is worth itThere is nothing really big that would give me a reason to kill myself. No massive trauma, no severe mental illness besides the usual depression or even any money issues. Life just feels boring and tiresome and everytime I imagine what the best outcome could be... it just feels unworthy of of all hassle it would take to get there. It seems so much easier to jump infront of a train and be done with it. No more boring weekends, pondering about the question how to kill my time the most efficient way. I'm not angry about the cirxumstances of my live, I'm angry that I got thrown into a conscious self that has needs, without my consent.
