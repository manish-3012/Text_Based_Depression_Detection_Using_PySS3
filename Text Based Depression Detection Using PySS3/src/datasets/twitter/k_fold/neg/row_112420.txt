How to stop self-destruct mode?Over the last 10 years (im 24) ive evolved in addictions from smoking, to weed, to gambling, to alcohol and then to self harm, with a bit of a sex addiction moved in. Near a year ago the alcoholism got real bad, I was drinking over a litre of whiskey per day and I started self harming, so badly that I would do nearly 2-300 cuts on one arm, Untill eventually I got real mad one day and real rea drunk and actually stabbed my hand instead, and then ran to the hospital asking for the mental health team, unfortunately I was way too drunk so they had to let me settle down, and during that time I was on and off awake and eventually asked the nurse that was watching me to get me water, and then just sprinted out and ran home. Later in the morning the police showed up and asked if I was ok and what happened  ect, but it was right in the morning, and I wasnt drunk yet and was very convincing, so they left. From there it was a wakeup call and I stopped for a while, but Ive been working my wya back there very fast. Recently I did a very deep cut on my hand and needed multiple stitches and actually broke my knuckle open in the process, and now in the last week ive done like 200 cuts on my forearm, and then moved up to my bicep and done another hundred. I just feel so guilty for so many things and I have no help and feel like its up to me to fix it myself. Ive gone to the GP ect in the past and been sent letters for meetings with MH specialists but just ignored them because by the time i got the letter, I wasnt in the right frame of mind to want help. So I dont see any point in going back to them. It will take 2 weeks to even get an appointment and then months more for the letter, and if I get drunk enough to build up the confidence to run down to the MH team in the hospital, they will make me wait again.

Im just worried as now I am nearly drinking a litre of whiskey a day again, my gambling addiction is going through thousands per month, my weed addicition and alcohol addiction is causing me to sell everything I own and also strip my partner from her salary, and the guilt of doing that is making it all worse. I just cant seem to stop myself though, everytime I work on one addiction the other gets worse, and the last thing I want is to stop the money costing addictions and up the self harm.

I just dont know what to do, I can definatey get help if I could pay for ti but I cant, and yes the NHS will give me free help (Which I really appreciate) but I know for a fact that by the time they offer anything that will matter, I wont be in the right frame of mind to quit my job and admit im crazy and move to a centre of something. I need to be in the right frame.

Anybody got any suggestions? I really did think I was making progress on these problems, but now that ive gone up my entire arm and are close to my neck, im getting a bit worried. 

and PS no, I dont want to die, in this moment anyway, but I enjoy the pain, its the only distraction to anything else and im really starting to reli on it, and its also a very good punishment for the money i keep taking from my partner. The searing pain throughout my entire arm really makes me feel like im atleast paying something for being such a monster, but at the same time its making me look like Ive been tortured alive (which I technically have been, by myself), but people are getting very concerned.
