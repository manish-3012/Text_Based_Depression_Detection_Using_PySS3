I'm over this.Tomorrow, forty-five minutes from now, will be July 15th. For the past two years, on this day, I have attempted suicide. Two completely different reasons. I'm having the urges again, and I genuinely believe I'm going to follow through. I feel as though me being gone will make this world 100 times better. I hope you all do well in life.
