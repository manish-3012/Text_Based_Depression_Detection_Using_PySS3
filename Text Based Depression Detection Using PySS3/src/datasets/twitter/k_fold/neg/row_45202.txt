my friends sister, A, moves back in with her mom, B, and A slips drugs to B, and then invites man, C over for paid sex to the mom, B. B doesn't know what happened until the next day.Just because this story might get complicated to follow:

A)Drug abusing/pimp for a day daughter 

B)The Mom 

C)Anonymous Man

D)My Friend



So she is quiet about this for a time before my friend finds out , he I'll call D. 

D just tells me this is confirmed with a follow-up conversation with B this weekend. 

D is super worried about B because B(mom)is now constantly blacked out drunk for these few weeks. 

As a friend, how would you interject. I'm a friend as defined by someone who is hearing this story second hand. But have seen first hand this mother drinking beginning early afternoon. With the reaction of my friend, D, getting quietly mad. 

After hearing this , the increased drinking seems as if it was brought on by this raping event. 

What to do !?
