I canâ€™t take the constant hate from his family. Theyâ€™ve broken me down. I want to dieIâ€™m dating this amazing guy, but his family absolutely hates me. I mean HATES me. My BF and I usually keep to ourselves, but every time Iâ€™m over, his sister finds something wrong. Today, I snapped and defended myself. Iâ€™ve been living on my own awhile, and I had to grow up fast. She claims Iâ€™m the baddest influence on her brother who ended up dropping out of college because he didnâ€™t want to do a degree his parents forced him into. Iâ€™ve done nothing but be nice to them, and my family always supports my BF. Iâ€™ve never seen such a dysfunctional family. But here I am. Questioning my existence. I live to make people happy, and his sister took so serious attacks on me today, claiming that I donâ€™t know anything about psychology (I got my degree is music therapy, where half of our classes are psych), I am apparently a freeloader (her BF doesnâ€™t work, and I work four jobs and never asked a penny from his family) and an addict (just because I had three beers in five hours at a birthday party). I really want to die. The anxiety is pressing me in. My BF is suppose to talk to her, but hasnâ€™t today. He doesnâ€™t realize Iâ€™m being crushed. I love him, but I canâ€™t take the abuse anymore. I lost my virginity to him and I want to marry him. But with his family always poking at my insecurities, I canâ€™t take the mental games anymore. I think Iâ€™m going insane. My suicidal thoughts are coming back and Iâ€™m thinking of ending it. The abuse has gone on too long, and my anxiety wonâ€™t settle. I love my family and would not want to hurt them, but I canâ€™t live with his family abusing me anymore. I struggle to keep up the perfect appearance, and his family isnâ€™t buying it anyway.  I feel I have no one to talk to. Iâ€™m trapped.
