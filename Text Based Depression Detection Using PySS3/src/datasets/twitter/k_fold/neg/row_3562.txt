My Dad is Depressed/Suicidal. Ready to die.I normally wouldn't ask for advice on this, but my heart is really hurting with this.. 

My dad has been depressed for a while now. Unhappy with where he is living. Unhappy with where he is in life and not being able to relax and having to be the sole provider of the house. (I currently have a job too and I help where I can, but I also have a buttload of bills and only make so much.) A few months back, he had left a job that had made him rather miserable; and pursued another job. Only to not get the job because of the insurance company learning that he was on pain medications and they didn't want to take the risk. He's been working in the same industry for years. No issues whatsoever. After this devastation and having to scramble to find a job to pay bills and make ends meet. He asked his doctor to take him off of his pain meds, they did.. and now he's in a lot of pain. The current job he has is really rough. So he's constantly having locked up shoulders and etc. (He broke his neck when I was younger, around 12. I'm 21 now.) 

Him and I've talked, he's expressed how he feels. It has made me scared for him, and how he is thinking. I can't fathom the idea of losing my dad. I know that life is inevitable and one day it will pass. I just feel like he's too young to be thinking about the end game, and that he has so much to live for. His newer wife, whom I cherish very much; has had two children with him. One being 6 and the other being 1 years old(along with an 8 year old from her previous marriage.)  Am I selfish for wanting him to be happy and to just keep on going? This is why I want to finish college.. I want to be able to pay all of his bills; and for him to be able to breath. 

Tldr: my father is suicidal, depressed and is ready to just pass on. He's unhappy with circumstances and its worrying me. I just want him to be happy. Any advice?
