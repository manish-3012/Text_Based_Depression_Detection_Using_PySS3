When is it okay to call it quits?Iâ€™ve been suicidal for over ten years and Iâ€™ve been holding on in the hopes that maybe things will get better, but they just wonâ€™t. Iâ€™ve made a lot of conscious effort to improve my life but the results are always fleeting. On drugs and off of them, married or alone, nothing seems to matter. I have no friends. Iâ€™m just so fucking exhausted. Obviously I feel bad for what this will do to my family, but I canâ€™t keep this up much longer. Does anyone else feel like suicide is just inevitable for some people?
