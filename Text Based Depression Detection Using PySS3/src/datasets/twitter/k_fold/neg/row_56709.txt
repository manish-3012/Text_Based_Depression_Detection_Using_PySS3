Lurker   Daily life plays like a movie in another room
   Unreal and droning, but just through that door
   Been bizzarro here before
   Think I'll go for a stroll
Rippling layered mounds of perception
Jangled piles of data input
Dripping cubist reality
   A shattering mind is an open one
   Vertigo existence
   Pulsating absurd humor and dejected agony
Bloody cracks in how it is
Unbroken sooty black snow on how it came to be
Peacefully there is no future...time for me has stopped
Apocalypse right now paused
   Feet swinging, this wide eyed tourist sits on the edge of the great divide
   Taking in the crumbling sights
   Incredible vistas destroyed, transformed, and then destroyed again
   The making of an unmaking
   Wish I'd remembered the popcorn
Kaleidescope crystaline splinters
Warped visions of the familiar
Beautiful rubble with sharp hungry teeth
   But this is is only the waystation
   Buying a ticket, Miss?
   Not if I still have the presence to ask
That's alright, the final destination can wait
It's pretty here, and I can't even hear the TV anymore
