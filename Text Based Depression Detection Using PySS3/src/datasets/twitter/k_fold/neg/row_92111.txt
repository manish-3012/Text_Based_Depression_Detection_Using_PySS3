How do I turn my mind off?I'm 31 years old. I'm healthy. Married, two young children. Three and one. I have a good job that I enjoy and pays me well. I have friends, hobbies and projects. I have a good relationship with my parents, brother and sister. My problems are menial.

Why can't I stop thinking about killing myself? It's gotten so much worse over the past year. Everyone has low points but every time something happens, even if it's minor, my first thought is finding a way to off myself without causing anyone in my life too much pain.

I spent at least an hour today thinking about it. How it would feel to stop existing, formulating a plan to cause the least amount of collateral damage. I found a belt in my closet and my thoughts immediately turned to how easy it would be to off myself with it tied to my bed post. When I get behind the wheel of my car it's "how can I run this into a ditch at 80 and make it look like an accident?" When I handle a sharp object at work or at home I think about how easy it would be to cut my wrists or my throat. 

I don't know why this is happening and it's getting worse. 

I haven't told anyone in my life about this. I can't be a burden to the people in my life because of this and I'm honestly not sure how my wife, friends or anyone close to me would react. And I honestly don't want to find out. 

I just want it to stop before it gets any worse. 


Does anyone have any experience? I think I need some help now.
