this isn't an emergency.. I just don't know how I'm going to get through this day and could use some help/someone to listenI've posted on here before. I need to make it through the next three hours of life so I can go to a therapist appointment. i just need someone to listen

I'm at a really low place right now and i am not entirely sure why..  Anxiety, panic attacks, depression, etc. I slept 11-12 hours last night. Right now I'm just feeling awful about myself.. I suck at my job and really want to be doing something meaningful and engaging. I went on a week vacation which was mostly a great time and then started getting anxious and pessimistic when I realized I had to come back to work.. I have no close family or friends, no girlfriend or spouse. I often think if I turned off my phone and my computer and stayed in my room and did nothing and talked to no one, it would take at least a month for someone to notice I was gone, except for my employer who would fire me. I am useless as a friend and a human being. Life has been one long disappointment and I'm only 24. I don't think I have ever honestly felt loved, or felt love for someone else. I can't even keep normal friendships because I get attached to people and I have a lot of anxiety, all of which makes me basically impossible to get along with. I'm not fun to be around, so I have very few friends. I think about suicide every once in a while, and I know I'm not serious about it but it is an appealing option sometimes when I feel like this, when there is nothing that can improve my mood and I seem to just keep slipping deeper and deeper into it. It feels like I'm drowning. My throat swells up and my arms and legs have this cold tingling feeling throughout them. Eventually I will crash and end up in a ball on my bed, crying like a fucking child, and after that I'll start to recover, but in the meanwhile I am a useless sack of shit that can't do a simple job correctly or find joy in anything.
