please tell me that there's something other than suicideI need help or reassurance so bad and I just don't know where to go. I'm a 16 y/o male, goingi nto my senior year. I've never had past issues with depression. I've been to a therapist when I was really young because I had problems with fear and stuff, but I haven't seen one in probably years. No one knows that I'm suffering, I've had such a normal life and no childhood trauma so I dont understand why I came out this way.

I guess I'll get to what the problem is. for starters im gay, closeted and nobody has any suspicions I don't think. my parents aren't super religious or whatever, they're pretty open minded, so I would have no problem coming out to them in my future. there's one thing however, that is a problem. I'm sexually attracted to something. Something that I can't be attracted to. I don't want to say it, but it's bad. I've \*never\* acted on this urge, and I never will, but just having it, just it being there is enough to push me over the edge. I would rather put a gun to my head than live like this. again im fine with being gay, but not being attracted to the certain thing I am attracted to. I'm not gonna say it, I feel like a criminal just thinking about it.

My mental health is crushed. nobody knows. nobody expects anything from a 16 year old boy. I have so many other mental prpblems, some can probably be fixed. this other problem, it cant. ive looked it up so many times. I don't see one story where it can be fixed. its messed me up so bad. im suffering in public but nobody even knows what im feeling. im menally ill and i have nowhere to go.

please please help me I know theres probably nothing that can be odne about this but I refuse to live like this. i feel like a monster. im so lost. i cant even talk about this to anybody. 

i want to live. I have things I want to be. I don't want to have to do it. but theres no other option. i have a lot of people in my life who love me, but they wont understand me if I tell them. theyll look at me like a monster and i cant blame them.  I need to hear that it will be ok but I know that I'll end up dead sooner or later.
