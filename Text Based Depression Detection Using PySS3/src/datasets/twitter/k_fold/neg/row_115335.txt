An interesting titleI don't really know what to say, but figured saying this is better than saying nothing at all

Recently left the mother of my child (after longing it out for 2+ years), who I feel like I was forced to be with from the start (irrelevant)

Im just numb, the world moves too quickly for me and I'm just lost in life. I can't even really word a sentence cohesively trying to talk about this, sorry

I don't really want to die, but life (or at least, this life, i guess) isn't for me, I try to talk about it to my colleagues in subtle ways like, when they ask me how I am, I'll reply "I haven't killed myself yet" and people laugh, which is great, the one thing I think I'm OK at is making people laugh
