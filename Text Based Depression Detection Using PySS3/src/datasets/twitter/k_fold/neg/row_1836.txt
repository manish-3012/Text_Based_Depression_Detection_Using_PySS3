I just need someone to talk toTonight I snapped. My life has been nothing but shit for the past two months. I was supposed to join the navy, but I got kicked out of bootcamp for separation anxiety. When I got back home, my parents resented me for giving up and my mom kicked me out. I'm currently living with my dad (who was in the navy for 30 years) he acts like it's okay but he feels the same as my mom. I am enrolled in college as a freshman, but that's all going to hell. I sleep through my alarms almost everyday because I'm too physically exhausted to wake up. I haven't gone to a class in over a week. My girlfriend of one year just told me that I have changed since I got back, and I'm just mean to her and our friends. Them saying that just makes me want to shut myself inside even more. On top of this my brother ran away last week because he hates my dad. My dad told him to never come back and had a loaded gun on the couch with him for if he came back for his car. Right now, I'm sitting in my garage, where I have been for an hour, with my friends inside. I don't know what to tell them. I hate myself right now. And if what they say is true, I don't deserve what I have. Someone please give me some advice. I haven't decided to kill myself, but i have been debating it for a couple days now. I'm 18 and just really need someone who knows how I'm feeling.
