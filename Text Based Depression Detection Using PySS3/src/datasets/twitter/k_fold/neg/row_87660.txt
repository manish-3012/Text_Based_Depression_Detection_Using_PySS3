Ex girlfriend thinking of suicideMy ex girlfriend has been threatening suicide, she is in a very bad place. Tonight, she sent me a text that her suicide note is on the table.
I ran to her house and luckily stopped her. She had a knife by her bed and was crying. I am with her now. I do not know what to do  - tomorrow, she will be alone.

Please help soon.
