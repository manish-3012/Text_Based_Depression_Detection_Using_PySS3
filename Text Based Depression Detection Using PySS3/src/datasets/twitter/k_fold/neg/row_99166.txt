How can I be happy, when no one wants me?I'm used to being ignored and rejected, that's all I've been my entire life. That doesn't hurt me anymore. What hurts is that nothing ever changes. Girls don't even look at me, not even if I accidentally trip in front of them. It's always strike up a conversation with a stranger/s, then get shut down some way a bit later in the conversation or she/they decide to leave. It's the same on the internet too, I send a polite message saying I would like to chat, and...no response. What am I doing wrong? I don't think I'm too forward, desperate, or obnoxious. I'm just your average nice guy looking for companionship. I even think I'm not that bad looking, imagine Andrew Garfield as a shorter, younger guy, that's kinda what I look like(loosely). I work out everyday, so I have the physique of a gymnast(again loosely). So what is it about me that girls hate? Am I just kidding myself? I see guys less attractive than me(in my opinion) with attractive girls, so why can't I? I've been at this for years, it's always the same. How can be happy knowing that no one wants to date me? I don't ever think about suicide, but if I were to die somehow any day now...I don't think I would mind.
