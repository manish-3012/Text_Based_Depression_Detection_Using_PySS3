Iâ€™m tired of being tired ( Iâ€™m so fucking funny )I hardly ever had a average night sleep in 7-ish years of my 18 years of â€œlifeâ€  Iâ€™m happy if I get one or two hours of sleep because most nights I donâ€™t get sleep, no matter how hard I try I just canâ€™t

So I decided to start being healthy, exercise, healthy food, going outside you get the idea and guess what the results are after doing al this for literally 6 months???? 

Nothing. Like literally nothing

And now I feel even worse about myself because  I spent all this time researching what food to eat and stuff like that and itâ€™s all been worth nothing 

I canâ€™t even say â€œ at least I tried! â€œ because I really donâ€™t have anything to show for it 

I hate everything, now I just canâ€™t get my mind off the fact that Iâ€™ll be able to sleep if Iâ€™m dead, it seems so fucking relaxing to shut my eyes and honestly the thought of never having to open them seems like a blessing
