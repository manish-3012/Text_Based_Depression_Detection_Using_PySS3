my momme and my bf have a great relationship. iâ€™m spending thanksgiving with his family in a different state from mine. this last week has really been amazing, iâ€™ve cried a couple times. his family is so nice and sweet and supportive, every family has its problems but they all genuinely care about each other and know how to show it. theyâ€™re all so supportive and want the best. my bf showed me something sentimental to him that his mom gave him after he said he wanted to kill himself 3 years ago. i started crying. when i told my mom i wanted to kill myself she told me to stop the bratty act and that anyone who wants to kill themselves will do it. thinking about going back home in 3 days makes me want to cry and die, i wonâ€™t kill myself or do anything bad itâ€™s just the thought of going back and living with her extremely depresses me.
