Am I ok?I always doubt myself whenever this question is asked.  I donâ€™t feel my 100% so I guess Iâ€™m not but at the same time Iâ€™m not doing anything to hurt myself so I am ok right? Well thatâ€™s not really true either Iâ€™ve been drinking pretty much daily now sometimes as soon as I get home from school.  Yesterday I went into the medicine cabinet and just took a swig from every bottle I could find because I couldnâ€™t see a reason not to.  I donâ€™t want to tell anyone how I feel because I donâ€™t want them to see me in a different way.  I also donâ€™t even know if I am depressed or whatever because sometimes I do feel happy but when it gets bad I just want to do nothing.  Even doing nothing makes me feel bad because historically Iâ€™ve been a good student and I donâ€™t want to disappoint anyone but Iâ€™ve noticed myself slowly slipping away from that.  Itâ€™s not like I have any plans for my future anyways. I donâ€™t want to get trapped by a boring job but I also want to have a secure and stable job.  It really sucks because Iâ€™m passionate about film but Iâ€™m too young to do anything about that besides watching movies and short films which also kind of makes me sad because Iâ€™m just wasting time.  Iâ€™m sleeping more during the day and less at night.  I wish I could just sleep 24/7 but I stay awake for god knows what reason.  The only reason I havenâ€™t offed myself yet is because Iâ€™m too scared of the physical pain and I feel guilty because I know my mom loves me and I donâ€™t want to hurt her and sheâ€™s also spent a lot of money sending me to private schools and shit like that.  Not that private schools are any good for your self esteem but thatâ€™s a different topic for a different time.  Anyways, I want to live or at least I want to want to live.  Anything remotely interesting to me feels unattainable or unrealistic so to me thereâ€™s not much of a point continuing.
