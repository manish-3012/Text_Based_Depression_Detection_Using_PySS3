Things need to end soonI feel like I'm reaching a boiling point. Havent had a full nights sleep in years. Colleagues telling me I'm cold and sometimes rude. No one cares. You always see these expressions of surprise from people when someone kills themself. That's not weird. Faking being fine is easy af if no one is actually interested, more than the common pleasantries. You can punch a brick wall all night and show up to wherever you need to be that morning and be fine and ready for another night of frustration fun.

 Something has to change. If nothing changes, then this BS isnt worth it, and I want nothing to do with this world.
