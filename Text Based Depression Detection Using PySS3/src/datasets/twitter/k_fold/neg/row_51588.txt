I don't think it ever gets betterBeen around 10 months since I vented here on this throwaway and my life has actually changed a bit. I have some friends who I'm quite close to and I go out a lot with them, but I don't feel like I could ever actually open up to them, even if they do open up to me about personal problems. The other day one of my housemates described me as someone who doesn't really get upset by anything and I really wanted to correct him but I don't want anyone to worry about me.

I feel like things are just constantly either getting worse or just not changing at all, sure I have a few people I could consider close friends but I still feel as if I barely ever feel anything and I'm pretty sure this shows through my actions quite a lot, I wish I could give specific examples but I'm really paranoid of anyone ever finding my posts.

I've fucked up again and self harmed for the first time since the very beginning of this year, I honestly have no idea where I'm going with this post and I have an inkling it'll get removed for how overwhelmingly negative it is but I honestly think it's just inevitable that I'll die by suicide, there is no other way. Everyone says things get better but I honestly don't think it can for me, maybe it can for other people who aren't giant fuck ups but I think I'm just a fundamentally broken person and the only reason I haven't killed myself already is because my family seems to be dropping like flies and I don't want to put the burden of yet another funeral cost on their shoulders.
