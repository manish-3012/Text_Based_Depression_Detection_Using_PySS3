I think im going to kill myself soonso basically im 20 and have no idea what i want to do with my life. i dont want to go to school i dont want to get a job i dont want to do anything. i have no motivation to do anything whats so ever. i have switch college majors several times and have failed each time. i have cost my parents alot of money and they told me i only have one option and its to pick one major and stick to it and if i dont they wont help me anymore. i have a really hard time picking something. im just not passionate about anything. i just dont care about anything. what should i do? i dont think i will do well in college and im find myself just thinking of running off and leaving everything. been thinking of killing myself sense i was 12 i dont see the point in doing anything. ive been living for 20 years and i have had enough. i some people might say you dont want to die you just dont want to be in pain anymore. but in reality bro i just want to die
