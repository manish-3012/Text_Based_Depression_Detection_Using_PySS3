I donâ€™t want to fight anymoreI have severe OCD and the medication helps me live a somewhat comfortable life but when I am in public I feel unmedicated. I havenâ€™t been able to hold down a job and I donâ€™t have much to show for my free time. I feel like I reached a expiration date. I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore so what is the point of continuing.. i am just tired of being a fuck up
