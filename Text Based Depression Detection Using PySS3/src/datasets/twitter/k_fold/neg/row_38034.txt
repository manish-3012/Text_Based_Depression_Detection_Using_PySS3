I fucking hate everything and especially everyone who's betrayed meMy parents say they love me, then verbally abuse me and each other. All the fucking time. So after feeling terrible I started looking to move out. First place that contacts me back, they need 3x the rent for income, and a credit score. I don't even have a fucking job or credit score. Everyone pretends that suicide is such a horrible thing but no one cares about trying to prevent it, or help you get out of the situation that causes it. Even my friend said "it's not like they molested me." Well I almost wish they did so I could get their asses in jail, and people would actually care about me. "Just" verbal abuse has made me want to fucking murder my dad and then fucking kill myself. I can't even get ONE FUCKING ENTRY LEVEL JOB and I almost have a fucking STEM bachelors, I fucking hate everyone and I don't blame the people who commit mass murders one bit, everyone is a fucking piece of shit.

I can't even buy a fucking gun to kill myself and if I really want to kill myself, I will have to risk permanent brain damage should I survive from more risky methods. I want to fucking strangle someone.
