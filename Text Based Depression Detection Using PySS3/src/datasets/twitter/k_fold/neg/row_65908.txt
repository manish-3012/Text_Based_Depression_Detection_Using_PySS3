I feel like the only way to no longer carry this pain is to die.I have never been happy. My entire life I've been plagued by feelings of worthlessness and loneliness. There have been brief times where I've been able to forget about those feelings for a little bit, but I always fall back into the same painful emptiness as before. I'm always an outcast, and from the outside looking into the groups of people around me...people who have friends and family that love them and they love back...they have something i don't think I'll ever be able to obtain. I don't believe I'll every manage to achieve any type of happiness in my life.  I want to die to end the constant aching and be able to let go of these feelings. 
Four years ago I tried to kill myself, but I just woke up delirious and disappointed.  They say people who fail at suicide tend to regret the attempt...but my only regret was waking up. I wish every day that I succeeded, that i was able to finally do something right with myself.
