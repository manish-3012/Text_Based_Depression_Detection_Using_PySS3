I don't know what to doI opened a cam on Chaturbate for the first time ever. I'm 17 with half a month until I'm 18. I was banned within 30 seconds of the cam being live. I'm incredibly afraid that I could be arrested. I literally just got into my dream degree after finishing high school. Does anybody know what the protocol is like? I won't be able to live with myself if I fucked everything up now. I don't know why I'm posting here, but I feel so overwhelmed and beleaguered that I don't know what to do.
