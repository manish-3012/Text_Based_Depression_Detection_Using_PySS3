Difficulties with going to different places.I just want to take a shot, but NO, my parents think we only need what is necessary to live, one of my school mates got an iphone 8 plus for her birthday, and what do i get on christmas? A stupid samsung galaxy a3, my birthday, pure childish stuff i don't need but my family still thinks i'm a kid, no money to buy new games, no new phone, honestly if i could switch families while i sleep i would, bring me to a better family please, or else i'll hang myself
