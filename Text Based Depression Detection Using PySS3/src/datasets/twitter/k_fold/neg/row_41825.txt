I know... I know... yet I still feel this wayI know that life will get better. I hated my life when I was 17 and i have come a long way since then.  I know there is hope.  Yet, at 30, even with all the accomplishments i've made in my life, i still have a pit of sadness -- and this seems to make everything worse. Even with my life going 'awesome', i still feel miserable all the time.  I really just want my life back - I want to go back to some of those times where I really was confident and enjoyed my life.  People liked me more, things went well for me.  I wouldn't want to be around a miserable fuck like myself right now either - but it seems to be a catch 22.  sigh. all i know is I am tired of feeling this way.
