Where to go for help?This isnâ€™t my first time posting on here, (and probably wonâ€™t be the last), but Iâ€™m really in need of some good advice. Iâ€™ve been feeling particularly bad lately, and I know I need to ask for help but posting here is the best I can do. As the title suggests what can I do to help myself?

Society is messed up because not everyone has access to mental health care. I canâ€™t see an actual therapist for three reasons,
1. I donâ€™t have any money or health care 
2. If #1 wasnâ€™t a problem, I couldnâ€™t be completely honest because I would certainly be involuntarily forced on at least 72 hour watch 
3. If #2 happened, I would be even worse than I am now because lack of money is one of many things contributing to these feeling

I want to help myself. I donâ€™t want to die.
