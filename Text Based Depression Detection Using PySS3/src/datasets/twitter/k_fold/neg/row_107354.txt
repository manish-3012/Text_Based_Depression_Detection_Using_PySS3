Itâ€™s not a matter of when but howIâ€™ve been in pain for years now . Sure there are times I am happy but it doesnâ€™t last for long . I thought getting things I always wanted and bringing more people into my life would solve my problems but ultimately no good job , friend or relationship has been able to do that . Therapy didnâ€™t help , neither did the antidepressants . I see no point in living in pain for the rest of my life . I wake up every day and before I can think of whatâ€™s happening my chest is already tight and full of anxiety . The depression soon kicks in after and another day of misery begins . Iâ€™m just too tired , I know I will kill myself Iâ€™ve been ready for it now many years
