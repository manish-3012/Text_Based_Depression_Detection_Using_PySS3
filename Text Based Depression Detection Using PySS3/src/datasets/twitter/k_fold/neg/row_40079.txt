All is gone, and I want to be tooHey guys, Iâ€™ll try to make this as short as possible so I donâ€™t take up your time. 

Recently, my life has gone to shit. The girl who I feel I. Love with left me and already found someone else within 3 weeks after dating for 2 years. I built an entire life with her in the time we were together, and now she just doesnâ€™t want me anymore. I live in the house we got together with the furniture we bought together and Iâ€™m surrounded by memories. 

I have absolutely 0 friends, not a single person who actually truly cares about me. Iâ€™ve been trying to talk to people all day every day but nobody seems to want to talk. Sense Iâ€™ve moved here, I lost all my old friends and my only new friends are related or close friends with my ex so none of them talk to me anymore. 

My family hates me, and are so annoyed at how Iâ€™ve been reacting to this. I try to talk to them for help, but they donâ€™t want to talk to me. They basically just ignore me and want me to deal with it on my own. Itâ€™s like theyâ€™ve never cared about me.

Iâ€™ve lost MANY people throughout my life to suicide, drugs, shootings, etc. Iâ€™m at the point where I feel like it isnâ€™t worth it to keep living through this failure, and pain. Every day is filled with nothing but hurting and tears. Iâ€™ve just been getting so fuc*** up that I canâ€™t even think straight. Now, today, I think Iâ€™ve finally decided to end it. 

Iâ€™m asking for opinions on what I should do, who I should tell, etc. Iâ€™ve already written a note apologizing to my mother father and younger sister, and to my ex girlfriend because I donâ€™t want her to think this is her fault. I just canâ€™t do this anymore.

Iâ€™m sorry for the rant guys, just hoping someone will actually take the time to listen to me.
