Almost cut yesterday and todayHey guys so as the title implies I almost cut I had a knife against my arm I was sawing at my arm waiting to draw blood but I was a coward and decided not to apply pressure so it didnâ€™t actually cut idk why but I decided to listen to Hurt by Johnny Cash while doing this anyways thatâ€™s it I might try tomorrow probably going to use some ice to numb it then do a small cut on my arm
