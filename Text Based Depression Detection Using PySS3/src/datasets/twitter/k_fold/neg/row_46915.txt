Financial problems leaving me with terrible thoughtsHas anyone felt suicidal or had suicidal thoughts due to money issues? I have severe, severe anxiety that makes it very difficult to work and the bills just pile on. I cannot function like a normal adult. I feel like no one understands the amount of anxiety that I feel just leaving the house. It's paralyzing and I don't know if there's any way out.
