Looking for a way out.I've had thoughts of suicide in the past. However they've been due to small things like losing a girlfriend or some dumb teenage decision. 

However now I'm 26 and I can't blame being a stupid teen anymore. I've made too many mistakes to fix.  
I've sabotaged all my relationships, I'm about $2000 in debt, with the collection agency right around the corner. I've got no money for rent, food or bills. 

I've come to peace that the only way out is suicide.  
I don't know how just yet, I might lay on the tracks behind my house, but I'd hate to scar the train driver, so maybe I'll find as many pain killers as I can and take them all while hoping it's enough to kill me.  
I've even thought of just going to the beach and walking into the water and drowning myself. 

I don't know why I'm here really.  
I know there's no way out of the hole that I've made, but I guess I really just want someone to come along and help fix everything. 

I don't know what to do. 

Please, help me.
