I don't even have the guts to do it.I used to tell myself I can always get out of my ruts.  No one would ever believe the amount of crap that I have been through and survived, just to fall ten steps back after all this time.  I promised my dear pet that her accidental death wouldn't be for nothing. I promised to live a prosperous life for her, but it's been really hard.  I can't take all this crap that's being handed to me...29ish years of it.  

I can't remember when I've had a full good year with no one bothering me with their dumb drama or a "friend" backstabbing me or being hurt by a boy or losing a job.

It's always some crap every year, I can't take it anymore.  I knew this last one would send me over the edge.  He was my last friend from childhood that I kept in touch with and now he's ignoring me and lord knows what he's doing behind my back.

I think it's because I don't have a job right now why I feel a little suicidal. I think things will get better once I get a job, but it's been taking a long time just to even get an interview.  I finally might be getting one soon. They asked me for times that I would be available.

tl;dr The thought about never having my own family is really depressing me because I can't find a guy to treat me right all the time, especially when I didn't do anything at first for them to be a jerk to me.
