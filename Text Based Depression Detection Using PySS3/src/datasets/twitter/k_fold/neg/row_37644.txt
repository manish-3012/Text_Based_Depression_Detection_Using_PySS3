HelpWell just to make this go by, I thought about offing myself. I feel like a failure to my parents and a disappointment to everyone else. They would just be better off without me to pester them. My mom loves me but is super harsh. My dad always picks on me and is an ass sometimes, but I guess he loves me too? I'm sorry if this seems like an attention stunt, but take it as you please. My grades in school have dwindled, and my mom gets mad if I get anything under a 90. I just feel everything and everyone would have a better, less stressful life without me. Not to mention my girlfriend who is amazing to me. She always brightens my day up. Im a freshman in highschool and I guess this is it.
