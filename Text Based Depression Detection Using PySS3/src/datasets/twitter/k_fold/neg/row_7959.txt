I am such a fucking FREAK
I need to get this off my chest. I can't tell anybody how I feel. I just really wish I was somebody else. I just hooked up with a guy and was super weird. I was shaking and came off as scared but he seemed to not mind???. I totally sucked even though he was super nice........ I just can't do ANYTHING right with people. I am useless when it comes to social situations. The weird thing is I can GET a man, I LOOK good I guess?? but I can't fucking interact with people. So what the fuck good is that?! I should've done myself a favor and offed myself like 6 years ago when I wanted then I wouldn't be feeling this way. I only done this twice. The first time the guy disappeared and I wondered why. NOW I KNOW WHY. I am 90% sure he couldn't deal with someone so strange..I suck at conversation and am awkward in bed AND in person. So why do I even try? I wish someone would just come along and shoot me...I'm a fucking failure anyway. It'll sure as hell make me happy and do the world a favor. Then if there's an afterlife I can burn in hell for being such a screw up.....  Do I apologize to the guy? What the hell do I say to him?? I feel like apologizing, I just don't have the words..Hey you were hot sorry I was so nervous..as if he'd care anyway. I wish I was normal, but I never will be. I wish I were dead.
