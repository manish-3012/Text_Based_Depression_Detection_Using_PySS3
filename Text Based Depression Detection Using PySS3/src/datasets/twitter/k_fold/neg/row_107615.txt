There will never be anyone else like her.She has given up on me entirely. I love her more than anything else that I've ever experienced and she just gave up on me. She says its not my fault. I told her I will wait however long it takes for her to figure herself out. She says she doesn't want me to wait because she won't promise a continued interest in me. I'm certain she hates me. She threatened a welfare check from the police tonight. Why should she care? She gave up on me. I'm useless shit and this always happens to me. I don't know what is so wrong with me. I want to hurt myself. I want the pain and the agony and everything with it. I deserve it. I don't want to be told there are others out there or that I will get over her because I won't. She was it. No one else will ever be like her and no one else will ever make me feel how she made me feel. So I think I should just die. Part of me just once you all to reaffirm and tell me this is the right thing to do. The other part doesn't care and will do it anyway.
