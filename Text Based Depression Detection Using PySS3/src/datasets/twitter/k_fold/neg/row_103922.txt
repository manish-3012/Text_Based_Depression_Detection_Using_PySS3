Just over it all.Iâ€™m a 20yo f. I could go into details but it wouldnâ€™t be worth it. Life isnâ€™t worth it anymore. Everything I thought I knew is a lie. I canâ€™t trust anybody anymore. My heart physically hurts from the emotional pain iâ€™m in right now but iâ€™m too scared to go through with anything. I can never go back to how I felt before all of the fucked up things in my life happened. I wish there was a restart button to life.
