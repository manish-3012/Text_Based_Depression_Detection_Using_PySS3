Anyone thought of purposefully getting infected by the virus?My life has steadily gone down hill the past few years after experiencing extreme physical and mental trauma from abusive relationships. Iâ€™ve always been opposed to life, not necessarily suicidal just tried to find little things about the future to keep me going. 

I moved to a new state six months ago with my fiancÃ©. Almost immediately we lost our jobs and our already unhealthy relationship took a turn for the worst and he abandoned me to go back home to Maine. I fought like hell to pick myself back up and for the first time in my life I was truly happy with who I was and being alone. Fast forward a few months later I got swept up in a relationship with the most loving caring person Iâ€™ve ever met. I self destructed that relationship tonight because I donâ€™t know how to communicate and push people away. I have been both mentally and physically abused in my past relationships before this man and I donâ€™t know how to be in a healthy relationship anymore if I ever did. Every moment with him was pure bliss and now that Iâ€™ve experienced a relationship like that Iâ€™m ready to go. 

I lost my job because of the virus, Iâ€™m alone in a state with no family or friends. My current living situation is hell and honestly what has pushed me over the edge. My roommate is verbally and mentally abusive daily. I canâ€™t even get back to my family on the opposite coast if i wanted to and Iâ€™d be terrified of infecting them. 

Iâ€™ve dreamed for years and years now what I would do it if things ever got this bad. Now I feel like I have a socially acceptable easy way out. I could be just like rest of the victims dying and my family would think it happened naturally. I just have no reason to live anymore and I donâ€™t want to. Iâ€™ve fought for so long and so hard and now all Iâ€™m left with is debt, ptsd, no hope for the future of my industry thatâ€™s collapsing. I just donâ€™t want to exist anymore. Iâ€™m a high risk patient so I donâ€™t think it would be terribly hard to catch if I want to a couple hospitals/dr offices/places where people are blatantly ignoring social distancing. 

Iâ€™m currently sick with strep, have severe asthma, and scar tissue in my lungs from almost getting wiped out as a kid. As I watch the death tolls rise. Iâ€™m sleeping outside tonight so as to avoid my roommate and itâ€™s already pretty chilly. I only have a thin blanket and foolishly left the house in shorts. I donâ€™t believe in god, but fuck Iâ€™ll pray to him if he lets me go to sleep and never let my eyes open. Iâ€™m so terribly ashamed of how I treated a sweet amazing man who didnâ€™t deserve it. 

My plan is to try and get myself infected and and sleep in a tent out in the wilderness for 2 weeks. If I havenâ€™t caught it yet Iâ€™ll try again. Just to make sure Iâ€™m not Asymptomatic and infecting innocent people. 

Damn it feels good to have a plan that will let my
Family grieve and know this will all be over soon. â¤ï¸ I know this option isnâ€™t for everyone, but I am so terribly ready.
