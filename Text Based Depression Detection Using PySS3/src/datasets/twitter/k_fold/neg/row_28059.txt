I just want to end itWhat an doing wrong, why is it to hard to normal, lately the thoughts of ending it all are invading my head once again and every time I see a tall structure I dream on jumping from it and think how it will end a the suffering my head is having... I just want to be alone and end my self it will end my suffering.

I cant do this anymore is so taxing
