Thought About it For The First Time Last MonthIve never though about killing myself for real in my entire life until last month. The thought of failing at school and having to work a pointless minimum wage job for the rest of my life is just too much for me. So I thought about it. I thought about not being able to afford enough to make it back, which I almost didnt. And I thought about just ending it all if that were to happen.

Ever since then, things have been so much worse. Ive lost all motivation. Recently its gotten pretty bad. I havent left my room for 3 days, and sat around sleeping or watching tv ive already seen. I dont want to be doing either, really but its just a way to pass the time.

I worked so hard over the summer to make it back. Now im here and Im just tired. I want to work, and I want to succeeded. But im just tired. 

I dont know what to do. Im scared of those thoughts coming back if I fail. But I just cant motivate myself to get up.
