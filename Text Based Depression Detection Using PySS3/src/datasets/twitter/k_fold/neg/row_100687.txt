I am not OKPosted in r/trueoffmychest, but I saw in their info section this subreddit and thought I should probably post here as well.

I have been holding in my suicidal thoughts for a long time, but lately I have been cracking and people keep asking me if I am ok. I always tell them I am fine and not to worry about me. I am in debt for the first time in my life and am barely scraping by for rent each month. I am truly worried that one night I might snap and kill myself. Every night I think about it. I used to be afraid of monsters or being killed in some accident, now I feel as if I don't care if something comes from the shadows and kill me. Before I was in debt I did see a therapist, it didn't seem to help at all mostly because I was just as evasive with my true feelings and thoughts as I am on my day to day life. 

Sorry for bad grammar and spelling. I probably made plenty of mistakes.
