What's the point?So I'm a NEET with no money, every job I try makes me lose my sanity (from the workload and the people I work with), I'm fat and gross looking (I have crooked teeth, acne scars and stretch marks all over my body, and if I did lose weight I would still have a lot of loose skin; I don't see myself being able to afford fixing these things anytime soon), I have no luck with women (and I don't see myself fixing that without physical improvement), I have no friends that I can confide in or do things I actually enjoy with, and I've tried therapy, mental hospital stays and medication with no real positive results. To make matters worse, I'm about 40 grand in student loan debt for a degree I didn't finish. 
I'm also convinced that I'll be miserable in life if I don't accomplish 
financial independence; I can't stand the thought of abandoning
my dreams to work for some a-holes. Or to live in mediocrity without a decent looking girlfriend/wife and a few close friends. I've also wanted to travel for as long as I can remember, I know it's possible to do this without being filthy rich (look up "digital nomads") but I don't see that being possible with my current situation either. 
The hope of someday being able to travel the world, finding a decent looking girl to be with and being financially independent are the only thoughts that have kept me going for the past year. Every day however I believe in these "dreams" less and less, my circumstances aren't changing, I don't see how they
can realistically change anytime soon, and I'm sick of dealing with depression and basically being a disappointment to those around me. 
I thought I'd make this post here as a last resort before I take my life. Maybe there's something I haven't considered. I'm not really sure anymore. Maybe my dreams won't come true, I have nothing to look forward to, and really am better off dead...

P.S. Sorry for the extra long post, thanks to anyone who took the time to read it
