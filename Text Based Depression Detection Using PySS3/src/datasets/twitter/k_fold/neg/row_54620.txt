I hate my familyI'm a freshman in High School. Reletivly happy guy and tend to smile, from 7:20 to 4:30 everyday. My father is a guy who never listens and always makes jokes about me frowning and makes it seem like I'm just playing around. My sister has a tendency to do whatever she can to make me unhappy whenever. My grandfather is a judging person who always lectures me for how I should be. I don't know what to do anymore...
