Help or donâ€™t, I donâ€™t care anymoreIâ€™ve been broken many many times and in to the point where Iâ€™ve given up on love. I feel manipulated and used and all thatâ€™s done is make my depression worse. Iâ€™m currently 11 days sober from self harm but donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep it up. Advice would be appreciated but if you donâ€™t want to give it thatâ€™s fine
