I don't want to kill myself. I just want to die.I will never be as successful as my twin sister. I will never be as successful as anyone. I suck. I'm terrible. Why did it have to be me who was diagnosed with autism and my sister is fully functional? Why did it have to be me who's socially inept? Why are people so cruel and selfish? My taste buds have gone numb due to the constant taste of salt on my tongue from tears. Why did boys hate me so much in school? Why did girls freeze me out? What did I do wrong? I feel like a retardation. I don't have one, I am one.

I want to die. Accidently, because then I know it wasn't my choice that I killed myself and it couldn't have been prevented. Killing myself is a personal choice. I just want to be rid of myself. My pain. My suffering. Not a single motherfucker understands this ongoing pain I feel. They don't understand how hard it is to resist the Devil's temptations. They don't understand how it feels to be a 
defect at birth. They don't understand how shitty I am and how I should've just died at birth. They don't understand how it feels to be the negative anti-thesis of their sister. They don't understand how it feels to have been treated as a socially incompetent idiot all their life by their sister. She doesn't mean anything bad. I know she doesn't. But she truly can't grasp the concept of how it feels to be a failure in comparison. I don't have a license. I don't have a job. I'm not active in voluntary work. She has it all. I think of her as a bitch, but I love her too. I don't know what I am, what I feel, anymore.

And to be rid of this confusion and musings alone in my room on my fat, disgusting, putrid, hateful, contemptuous ass, I want to die and cease to exist forever.
