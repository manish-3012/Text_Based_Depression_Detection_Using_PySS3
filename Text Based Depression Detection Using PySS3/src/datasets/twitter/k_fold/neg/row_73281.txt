Iâ€™m doneI canâ€™t take the agony of every waking second. Every breath hurts like fire in my lungs. Every heart beat shatters my heart a little more. Death is so easy. 
My note is written and I have already attempted hanging myself so I know what to do. 

Iâ€™m too tired to be here. I canâ€™t take any more, everything aches.
