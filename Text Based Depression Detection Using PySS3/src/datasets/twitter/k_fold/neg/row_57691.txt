i don't feel real anymoreit's like my life is a movie i'm watching. and it's so fucking boring. i barely even taste food anymore. i'm high all the time to avoid thinking. i don't want to be this person who i'm not, who i hate. something in my life is missing, like a person i know but can't remember. i can't help but think it's something i have in "real life," as in, outside of me. i know it's just dissociation, but it feels like i can't wake up from a simulation or something. i think i'm going crazy
