Iâ€™ve never felt so bad in my life.Iâ€™ve been getting like 3 hours a sleep a night all week. I canâ€™t fall asleep because of how much Iâ€™m panicking and I wake up so early once I finally fall asleep because Iâ€™m panicking so much. Iâ€™m exhausted yet my body is still finding the energy to shake profusely. I just want to end it. Iâ€™m afraid of dead, but at this point any relief is all I can think about. I need a friend. My wife is sleeping unbeknownst in the other room. I donâ€™t want to disturb her. She doesnâ€™t understand and Iâ€™ve already woken her up a couple of times this week. 

Please help me. I need someone to talk to to get me out of my own head. Iâ€™m desperate
