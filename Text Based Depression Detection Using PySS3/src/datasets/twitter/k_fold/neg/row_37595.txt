Thinking About Just Doing ItI Know No One Is Going To Reply But This Is Most Likely The End For Me , 20 Years Old And My Life Just Isn't Good

Ive Been Depressed For A While Over Lots Of Things Such as being in love with my ex which she doesn't love me at all.

Living In A Home with Roaches &amp; Rats With No AC , Barely Have Money &amp; Nobody Really Talks To Me At All.

For The Past Few Months Ive Been Really Trying to do better with my life but im getting no where and its the same shit that has my head fucked up.

Even When I Try Not to think negative i wake up and all these problems and this reality sets in on me.

I feel like im just a nobody , all my friends have girlfriends and social lives and im just always alone 

And i feel that my thoughts in my head wont get any better because they haven't &amp; i also have Porn induced ED which makes my life a whole lot worse 

Im a really good person but nothing but bad things happens to me , all ive ever been tryna do is better myself and it seems that god is punishing me or something when all ive tried to do is the right thing

I'd Rather Be Dead Than To Be Stuck With These Same Problems For The Rest Of My Life ....
