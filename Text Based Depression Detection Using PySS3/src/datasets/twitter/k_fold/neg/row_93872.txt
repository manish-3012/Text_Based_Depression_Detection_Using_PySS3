komm, sÃ¼sser todi've had two failed suicide attempts just in the past year. my life is objectively getting better. and yet i still think about killing myself at every waking moment. at this point i know that i'm too stupid and too unlucky to actually successfully commit suicide that i won't even really attempt it since i know that i'll just land in the psych ward again but. i guess i need to keep looking for the right plan of action.
