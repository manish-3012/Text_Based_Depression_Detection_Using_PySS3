I have nothingI have no job, no friends, no family, no love life, and I failed out of college. No one i knew knows how this pain feels like. I have no idea what to do with myself anymore. Nothing in college interested me. It has been 4 years and I'm still stuck at a community college. I just sleep 16 hours a day hoping I wouldn't wake up. I spend my time awake on steam and on Netflix. Fuck I'm just so lonely. I just feel so empty. Life just isn't ment for me. I don't know why I'm posting this... I'll probably get trolled, but whatever.
