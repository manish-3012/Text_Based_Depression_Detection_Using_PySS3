Scared about this suicide note I sawI was trawling through /r/lifesucks, because I was feeling sad, and I saw a suicide note from Deprived3568, who soon afterwards stopped using Reddit. I am scared and concerned that by reading the post I have become somehow involved in a person's spine-chilling death.

I shudder to think of how many people are refusing the help they are given. I feel really empty after seeing that post.
