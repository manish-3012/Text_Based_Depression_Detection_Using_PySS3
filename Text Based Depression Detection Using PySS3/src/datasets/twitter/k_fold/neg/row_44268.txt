After thinking about it for a while, my perspective on death has become more "positive". Have any of you experienced the same thing?Further explanation:

A few months ago, when the severity of my depressive episodes seemed to increase, I started making very  clear plans on how I'd go about dying. One obstacle I always faced (and an obstacle I know I will face to some degree in the moments before death) when making these plans is the primal urge to shy away from anything lethal. I know that no matter how much I convince myself I want to die, my body will always try, to some degree, pull back from the act. The thought of such hesitancy caused me a lot of stress, but over time my thought of death itself changed. 

Think about the time before your were born. Nothing. A total lack of consciousness. Almost like sleeping for a very, very long time. Now, death could be viewed simply as a lack of consciousness also (much like sleeping). As a side note, I think one of the reasons humans fear the thought of death so much is because death is impossible for our conscious minds to conceptualize (by deff'n death involves an absence of consciousness). In a way, death is just another really long sleep. And we have already spent billions of years in that long sleep before we are born. And no matter what we do, or make, or create, or love, we will all sleep again. "So why not now?" I sometimes think. "Sure, I could live for 60 more years, but life already seems dull and meaningless. I find it hard to be close to people emotionally, I'm not interested in very much, I don't have plans to raise a family, I don't have the desire to chase girls...etc.. In the long run, 60 years means nothing. I'm slowly moving closer to death every day. And if I look at things this way, it doesn't seem so bad." 

I guess the only thing holding me back is my parents and a good friend of mine. I just think I'd like to say the appropriate "goodbyes," if you understand.
