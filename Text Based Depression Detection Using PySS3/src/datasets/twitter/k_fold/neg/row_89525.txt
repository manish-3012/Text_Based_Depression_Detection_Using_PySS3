Please Help.I've been contemplating suicide for the past month. It's ironic how some assume bullying only comes from kids in school; I feel bullied every day at home. My parents constantly yell and throw items at me. I've learned to not take it seriously, but some of their comments are starting to get to me. Recently, both of them have taken to hitting me repeatedly. Feels fucking terrible, like every hit is trashing every memory I had of my childhood.

Today, I felt closer to death than I have ever before. Another conflict with my parents left me feeling worthless and empty. It doesn't show on the outside, but I feel intense bouts of pain inside. Attempted to slit my own throat, only to stop and go here.

Please help. I feel as if I might end myself tonight.
