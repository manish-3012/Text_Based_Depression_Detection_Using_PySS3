Last daysToday I have read that Ghandi passed away after 21 days of starvation, I felt stupid for eating a banana after almost two weeks of fasting only drinking water. 
I have decided to drink all the water I had left today and from now on, I will push myself to complete starvation in order to stop this pain and stop my mind. Everyone blocked me or are ignoring my messages, it will be better like that. He blocked me everywhere and said that thereâ€™s nothing he can do and I should break the cycle of always running to him, thatâ€™s the only way I could possibly do it.
