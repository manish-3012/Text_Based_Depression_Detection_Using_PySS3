I feel like everyone i bothered to care about ends up abandoning me.When I care about someone, I try to do my best to make them happy or always be there for them. I never carry any hidden motives or demand anything in return. But sooner or later they always end up ditching me one way or another. And they never really give a proper reason. Like yes, the people I run into tend be bipolar to some degree. But something would happen in their personal life and somehow it puts them in the mood to drop our friendship. 

I try to look in retrospect. Was I creepy? Clingy?  Rude? Inattentive? But I just don't get it.
