No energy left/VentingI've been fighting depression and anxiety for years - with anxiety being the main issue. I was sexually abused as a child, more than once, and ive had a very broken home life, along with much more that I wont get into. I've wanted to die since I was 11 years old. I used to hit my head on walls, and tie my neck to my bedpost. I've been in deep emotional pain for a long time, I'm almost 18 now, and I've only gotten worse. I can sleep for 8 hours, or even all day and wake up exhausted. I never have energy. Every day I feel sick, like I have the flu, or a virus; but I don't. I've been to therapy, very inconsistently, due to my mom's financial trouble. Same with meds. I have them sometimes, but when I run out, I cant get them again for months. I live with my girlfriend, and due to growing up in said broken home, I grew up a lazy slob. I was never disciplined for anything, so I never learned how to do things correctly. My girlfriend and I argue often, nothing too bad, in comparison to everything else, but it makes me feel like a terrible worthless person when our room is filthy because I'm too depressed and lazy to get out of bed. Today we got into another argument and all I can think of is how much of a burden I am on everyone here. I want to leave this place, and everything else. But I think about how much pain id put my mom through. She lost somebody before me, and I know she wouldn't be able to handle losing me. It's just a tearful day.
