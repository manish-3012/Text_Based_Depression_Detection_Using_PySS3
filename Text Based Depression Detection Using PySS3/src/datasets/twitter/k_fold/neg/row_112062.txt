a matter of when?Iâ€™m constantly occupying myself with things to do so I donâ€™t have to think of killing myself. The older I get the more persistent that voice in my head gets. Just like many of you, I know for a fact I will end up killing myself, itâ€™s just a matter of when. Iâ€™ve been trying to take things day by day, and occupying every hour down to the minutes of my day with something to do because I absolutely hate entertaining the thought of having to kill myself. Iâ€™ve been trying to give myself milestones to reach, so I can persist living another day, but truthfully I donâ€™t see a future for myself. Itâ€™s hard to even picture what the next week could look like for me.
