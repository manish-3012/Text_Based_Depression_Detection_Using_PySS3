How can i be happy when this world is horrible?I hate humanity, how we treat each other, how greedy we are, how selfish we are, how violent and just plain evil we are. The media is controlling us, our technology is controlling us, I feel like I'm being spied on. Everything fucking sucks I don't wanna live in a world like this. It's always fucking sucked. I dont see the point I feel no connection towards anyone and I don't see help as a possibility anymore. Not only is the world and humanity a horrible place but I fit right in. I'm a horrible person too and so are all the people surrounding me. I'm fucking sick of this living no one cares and neither do I
