I'm afraid either of my parents might kill themselves.I want to preface this by saying i love my dad, but the following actions have made me lose all respect for him. My role model, my hero, my dad, cheated on my mom for a year without telling her. Upon finding this out, we yelled at him to get the fuck out of our house. I'm scared that for this reason, he might kill himself; seeing as though "his kids don't love him," even though I still care about him but think he's a massive cunt. I think my mom might do it because for the past few months she's been talking about how "things aren't going well" and "all she wanted was for it to work out." Please kind words and/or advice only. I love them both dearly, but my dad is a fucking asshole.  
EDIT: Forgot to mention that his dad died of cancer recently.
