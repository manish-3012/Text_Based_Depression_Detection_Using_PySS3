Friend is suicidal. Please please help.My friend + her boyfriend broke up about two weeks ago. They had been dating for about two years but the entire time they were dating they fought + broke up a few tines but ended up getting back together. Their relationship was very unhealthy, he would call her a bitch and other names, constantly be grabbing her + he even hit + punched her a few times.

A few days ago she found out he was dating another girl already+ he was saying how much he loved her + she cracked. All she says is that she wants to kill herself because he doesn't love her anymore. She said she has no reason to live + she keeps on looking for ways to end it. We're both seniors in high school. She said she told her parents how she felt + they didn't believe her. I was going to call an ambulance to take her to a hospital so she could be under 24 hour surveillance but her family has no health insurance. I would tell my parents but they're out of town for the weekend.

What the fuck do I do. Any advice would be so greatly appreciated.
