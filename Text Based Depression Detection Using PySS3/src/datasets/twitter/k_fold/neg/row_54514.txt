How Does Everyone Do It?Small background about me for reference would be everyone who knows me would say Iâ€™m one of the most sympathetic, selfless and loving people they know, always putting others before myself and always positive even in the most dire situations. Grown up in a well off family and by no means had a rough childhood. 
A year ago today almost I was diagnosed with â€˜severeâ€™ depression among other things. Everything changed almost overnight it seemed as this all took place over the course of maybe a week. A few months into my mental illnesses I reached my â€˜worstâ€™ where I was sitting on the edge of a balcony 18 stories high, selflessness stopping me.
Iâ€™m not going to go into anymore details but after all I feel like Iâ€™ve been through over the past year I struggle to understand from reading posts from everyone how theyâ€™ve lived with mental illnesses such as depression for years, even decades, and not committed suicide (sorry to be blunt). 
Just here for some insight.
