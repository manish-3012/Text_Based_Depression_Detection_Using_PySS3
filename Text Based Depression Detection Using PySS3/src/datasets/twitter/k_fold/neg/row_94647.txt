I lost the last living being who loved meI moved to this city 8 years ago, and my husband died the following year. I have extreme social anxiety so I never made any friends here, and my family is on the other side of the country and doesn't really care.

Two years ago I adopted a sweet kitty and she was so affectionate, she loved to cuddle up next to me, and sleep at the foot of my bed. I have a small gated yard, and she loved to go out there. I thought it was escape-proof. It wasn't.

That was five nights ago. In the five days that followed, I've exhausted myself looking for her, asking neighbours, putting up flyers. And I've realized just how alone I am. I have some online contacts but they all have real lives to occupy them. 

My girl was always there for me and I failed her. I keep thinking of her alone somewhere, injured, sick, trapped, if she's even alive. After my husband died, in the following years I lost the cat he and I adopted together, I lost my mom, my sister and my nephew. I can't handle any more losses. Along with the state of the world in 2020, I don't see any reason to stick around anymore. 

I've tried talking to people about how I feel but they don't understand how devastating my loss is. I don't have any plans to take my life, the only thing keeping me going is wanting to be here for my cat when she returns, but as the days go by my hope is diminishing.
