Minor updateSorry for posting so much but I guess I wanted to say I feel a little better, thanks to those who reached out (sorry didn't really react, I treat this as more of virtual journel then anything). Suicide still isn't completely off the table but today's dnd session has sort of coaxed me into staying a alive long enough to see how the story ends (and we're still at pretty much the beginning so that could be a while). 

I guess if things go really belly up then I'll do it
