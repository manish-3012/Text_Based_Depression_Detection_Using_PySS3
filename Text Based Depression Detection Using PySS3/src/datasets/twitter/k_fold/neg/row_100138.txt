Iâ€™m Going To Kill A MonsterIâ€™m done feeding the monster inside me. Heâ€™s gotten so big and strong that heâ€™s been controlling me for over a year now. I havenâ€™t won a battle in 2+ years. But if itâ€™s the last thing I do, even if it kills me, Iâ€™m gonna kill him. One day at a time. One decision at a time. Every time I donâ€™t feed my appetite (food, sex, drugs, hating, schadenfreude), I feel a certain part of me kind of die. So thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m gonna do. Thatâ€™s how Iâ€™m gonna kill him. And heâ€™ll probably never fully die as long as Iâ€™m here, but till the day I die, Iâ€™m gonna be killing this motherfucker day-by-day, decision-by-decision. It wonâ€™t ever be about bettering myself. Itâ€™ll be about destroying and annihilating him. Heâ€™s a mirror image of me. Heâ€™s no stronger than me. Heâ€™s no smarter than me. He is me. And Iâ€™m gonna kill him cause heâ€™s hurting people.
