I can't stop thinking about how I'll die...Almost every day I think about taking an aspirine and cutting my wrists in order to die...

In less than a month I'll be 22, and I've done almost nothing in my life...

People won't take me seriously, almost no one cares to talk to me except when it's about college or homework, I've either distanced or burned bridges with almost everyone I used to know, I've broken many promises, some people look at me with pity, disdain or indifference...

I've been holding on, hoping that someday things will get better, but right now, I've lost most of that hope...

I'm nothing but a disgusting, toxic and annoying person... And I deserve it, for having done nothing to change or to improve...
