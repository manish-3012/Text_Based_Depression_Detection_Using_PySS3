I want to dieI feel nothing anymore I can't even feel happy. I feel like I have nothing left to live for and I just want to die. I'm re-reading a book series I read a while ago when I was in like 5th or 6th grade and for some reason, this is the only thing I can look forward to anymore I don't like to talk to anyone I don't want to do anything. I've always been extremely introverted and never even wanted to go to the store or anywhere with people. I would rather be alone. everything's just been downhill since April and I guess I can just never see my feature so many things just going wrong. I'm planning to end it all when I finish the book series but I don't know if I will be able to do it because there will be pain either way. I feel empty.
