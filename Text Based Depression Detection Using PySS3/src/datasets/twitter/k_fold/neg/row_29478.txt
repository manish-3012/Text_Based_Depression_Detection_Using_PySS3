I've already decided to end my lifeI hate the person I've become. I'm such a fucking asshole. No wonder why everyone hates me. I feel like everyone who tries to prevent my suicide wants to see me suffer and likes to look down on me. I honestly cannot wait to end my life. The only reason why I haven't ended it yet is because I don't have the means to. At this point, the only thing that makes me happy is cutting.
