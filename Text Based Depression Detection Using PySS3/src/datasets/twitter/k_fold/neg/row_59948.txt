How much is too much?I fantasize about killing myself at least a couple times a day. The thoughts get increasingly longer and more detailed. 

My life isn't as bad as it has been. I'm a recovering alcoholic/drug addict and still struggle with an eating disorder. I have a good job and some friends and a good family. (I'm single though). 

Everyday is a battle and I feel like every situation is fight or flight, life and death. I'm exhausted. Sleeping doesn't provide much relief, my dreams are more fucked up than real life and I wake up feeling dazed and freaked out. 

Suicide is becoming an increasingly attractive solution. Are these thoughts normal? I don't seem to have much control over them and they creep up and I can't seem to shake them. When is it time to seek help? My life has been way worse so I feel even more stupid. I'd appreciate any feedback. Thank you.
