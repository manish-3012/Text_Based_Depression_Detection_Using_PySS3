limboeveryday just feels like a never ending cycle of the same thing. wake up, feel anxiety, feel hungry, feel alone. feel nothing. sleeps like a taste of whats to come because my future adds up to nothing. 

i used to look forward to dreaming because at least in them I could feel something, but even thats starting to become numb. i have no friends in real life, no one to connect with. nothing to look forward to anymore. i don't want to die but i'm too weak and afraid to keep on going. i've been on 5 different antidepressants and seen countless therapists. ive tried to fix myself and other people have tried to fix me but it's hopeless. guess some shells aren't meant to be healed. i was brought into this world as an expendable hunk of flesh left to fade away into non-existence. i am no longer "human" anymore.

i am broken. broken and alone until death gives me some company and takes that loneliness away.
