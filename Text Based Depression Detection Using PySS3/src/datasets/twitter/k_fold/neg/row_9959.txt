It will pass.(paragraphs may or may not be interconnected)

What is the point of living if we all die in the end? I mean, after all the happiness that we will feel, what is the point? This is the reason why I see everything to be a waste of time. It's the little things - like playing a game. What's the point? I'll eventually grow tired of it anyway. 

Another thing that I've come to realize is that I will either kill myself, or something/someone will kill me in the end. The thought of it is amazing. It's like I have some kind of control over my life. My life may be shitty, but I have 'this power'.

I am not depressed or even remotely sad. Nor am I happy or 'enjoying' life. Yeah, I will laugh and feel happy about something or I will be bummed out and feel sad,  but these temporary emotions don't  define how I entirely feel. I have been floating for a while and I don't know how to feel about it. Enter my 'regression to the mean' mentality (which I got from a show I can't remember anymore). Basically, 'regression to the mean' means that  no matter how bad or how good things get, they will always return to the center. Everything will always come back to  being neutral.

With that in mind, I always come back to 'what's the point?'. If everything is never constant, w h a t   i s   t h e   p o i n t? Feeling sad? It'll pass. Feeling happy? It'll pass. Feeling depressed? It might take long, but it'll pass. Feeling like life is at its best? It'll pass. 

It. will. pass.

So why should I just not end it?
