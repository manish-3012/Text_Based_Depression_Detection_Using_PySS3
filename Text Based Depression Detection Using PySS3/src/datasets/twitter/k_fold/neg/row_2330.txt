Anyone have this experience...?TL;DR - upset that the cuts on my wrist from a failed suicide attempt have healed so quickly and barely even left a scar. 


Last week I tried to slit my wrist. 
I failed miserably. 
I was bleeding a lot but now it barely looks like I cut my wrist at all. 

In the aftermath of it all, I caused a bit of drama and got myself into a bit of "trouble" with my husband and our friends. Now, my blades are all taken away and I can no longer cut. 

I feel so angry that I don't at least have a good scar and that my wrist has healed so quickly. Why do I feel angry about this? I keep looking at my wrist and wanting to do more damage, but now I can't because I'm being watched so closely. 

I'm not sure why this makes me so upset. 

I feel like I needed a deeper scar.
