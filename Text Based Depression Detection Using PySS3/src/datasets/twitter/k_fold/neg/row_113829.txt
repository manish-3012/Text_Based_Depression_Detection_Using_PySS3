I got caught again, these dates hit harder than I thought, I'm lost.I haven't been able to see a doctor, or a professional who can diagnose and help me, I haven't been able to get up the courage to talk about this with anyone.

I remember there were nights when I would stay up crying until dawn, where I just wanted to die, where I just wanted to end this pain that I didn't understand where it was coming from.

This year there were people who helped me, I was in a very bad situation and they literally saved my life. And thanks to them I was able to help many people in need, especially many children, to see the smiles on the faces of people who have been having a hard time, to see the hope coming back in their eyes has been the best thing that has happened to me this year, I honestly did not think I would make it to the end of the year.

My parents don't know, I have to be strong because we have been in a very bad economic situation and I have had to be the man of the house. My younger brother tries very hard, he is working very hard on a sports project, where he has to be concentrated and training seven days a week, and he has me as his anchor, so I always have to be strong for him.

I've been holding on, looking for ways to escape from this, there were moments where I was able to escape although I really don't know how long I managed to avoid it, there are songs that calm me down and make me stop thinking for a while, they make me feel like I'm getting out of my head and going to other places, The song "Don't you worry child" has been one of those, the chorus that says "Don't you worry, don't you worry child see heavens got a plan for you" has been like a kind of anchor, but every day I feel it working less, the unexplainable pain is coming back out of nowhere.

I don't know what to do, I'd like to have someone to go to, I'm alone and I have no one to seek refuge in. I had been able to keep it away, but it has caught up with me again, this feeling of 

I'm afraid of falling back into the hole and spending every night crying and with that feeling that's like being stabbed in the chest or could get worse, I'm lost.
