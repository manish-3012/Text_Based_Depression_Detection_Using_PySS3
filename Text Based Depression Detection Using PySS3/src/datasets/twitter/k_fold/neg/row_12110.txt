She wants to kill herself. Do I call someone?My roommate is having a really hard time. Her mom had kicked her out of her house. Now her mom claims that she is owed 1500$ and that she is going to take my roommate to court. My roommate is saying that if her mom takes her to court she is going to kill herself, because she will be too far into debt and can't afford it. She just got a job and is getting her own place in September. If her mom did take her to court and win she would be very, very screwed. She made the suicide conditional, and I told her that if she has thoughts like that I'm going to get her help. She freaks out and said "sure, call the cops. then they'll put me in an institution and I'll never be able to have a real life." Is that a sign that she is just upset in the moment, or do I still need to call? Who do I call? Any advice on what I should do is appreciated. Ask questions if needed. 

tl:dr roommate says she is suicidal if she gets sued. she wants to say it was just in the moment and conditional but now I'm worried. ideas?
