Don't want to make a mistakeI'm going through a bad break up with a girl I thought for sure was going to be the one I married. We talked about our future often and she seemed like she was finally the one. About a week ago she vaguely states that she has become very depressed due to my depression (I had some anxiety about something and she was there for me) and that I've been hard to be around lately; says she needs time alone and goes silent. A week later with no response and active ignoring of messages, while I doubt myself and think of every reason I deserve this, she apologizes for what she put me through and invites me over. She doesn't specify why, just that she can't do it over text. What happened became a one sided breakup where she has decided that we need to get better and it will be better for both of us if we break up. When I argue this point she brings out a list of reasons why essentially I wasn't good enough, most of which she never talked to me about during the relationship. I tried to plead I could change and to give me a chance, but she said I should respect her decision. This blindsided me so hard and has been one of the hardest weeks of my life. She was the most important thing to me and meant the world to me. My friends and family are rallying around me, but it's hard when this has happened before. It hurts so much and I don't want to let my friends or family down, but I'm in so much pain and can't imagine dealing with this a lot longer. I've had a history of counselling and am on meds. I just don't want to do anything stupid, I need help.
