I have written this for people who are going through a lot. Maybe you can relate and feel warmth a bit. Please stay safe.Not making up an excuse

I've fallen prey to abuse

They say "go to therapy" I tell em

"I'm half dead, what's the use?"



When I look sad and bored

They can't hold back their words

"Don't be so depressed!"

And that's everything I'm told



Locking myself up in my room

I'm tired of staring at the window

Wish I could explain it to the moon

But my cosmos is my bed and pillow



I'm not wounded I'm tore

When the rain begins to pour

I can't run I cannot soar

But I'm so ready to roar

I don't want it anymore

I have suffered to the core

Everything is just a bore

I'm just gonna hit the floor



Don't you dare compare

Don't you be unfair

Don't you annoy me with useless speech

It's not like you care
