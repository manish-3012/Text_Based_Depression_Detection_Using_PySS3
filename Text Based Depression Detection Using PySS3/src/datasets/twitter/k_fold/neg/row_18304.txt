Just when I thought things couldnâ€™t get any worse, they did. As soon as I get home Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m in college. After a string of hate crimes being committed on campus, it all came fo a head yesterday with two school shooter threats in one day. It just makes me sad about the state of the world and confident in the fact that America will only get worse from here. I donâ€™t want to live in such a fucked up world. 

On top of that, the guy I lost my virginity too last week is a complete insensitive asshole who I of course caught feelings for. But he never wants to speak to me again and I canâ€™t risk telling him how I feel about him without coming off as a â€œcrazyâ€ girl so Iâ€™m just bottling everything up. 

I have a shit relationship with my parents, Iâ€™m broke, I donâ€™t have a single friend. But honestly the external factors donâ€™t matter. I could have a picture perfect life and Iâ€™d still feel suicidal and depressed. I canâ€™t remember a single day in the last 7 year where I didnâ€™t consider suicide. I always told myself if I got to college and I didnâ€™t feel any better Iâ€™d do it. So why stay? Whatâ€™s the point? No one would miss me anyway. 

Iâ€™m flying home in a few days for break. Weâ€™ll see what happens I guess
