I am struggling really hard right now...So I was pretty hopeful today as I thought I had a therspy appointment but I misread it and its actually in 2 weeks. 

So here I am with my self esteme at an all time low, progressively getting worse, Im bed bound with depression and overall Im just really struggling to be positive, Its just so hard.

Im on the edge, if I get pushed any further Im going to get suicidal again I know it. I just feel so worthless right now. I have no friends, I have no meaning or purpose anymore. Whats the point of carrying on? Just to exist? I just see little point and theres nothing I enjoy enough to live for. 

Just getting eaten away inside, everyone thinks I'm better as everytime I see family its the same "you look well" each time. Like do they even get thst this shits s mental illness not physical. 

Just want to die.
