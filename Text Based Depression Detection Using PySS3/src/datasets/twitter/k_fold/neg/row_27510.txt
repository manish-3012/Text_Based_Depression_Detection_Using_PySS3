This kills the manI don't see a future.  There is no point.  I don't even enjoy drinking.  I thought I could be a normal person but it was just wishful thinking.  I thought things were going great but it was just a trazodone dream that blew up in my face when none of it had ever happened.  Months of hiding later and I only see one way to make it stop.  It's so far past getting help.  That was 15 years ago.  At my very best I wasn't even close to a real person.  I don't know what that would be like.  I was told I had potential and every opportunity but I never saw it.  I never felt gifted.  The attention I got was to make fun of me.  None of those situations were real.  Everyday from 12 I've known I need help.  Everyday I know getting help won't do any good.  I can't be in a hospital.  I can't talk to a therapist and the shrink told me he can't help unless I tell him the truth.  I'm about to lose my job and that will leave me homeless.  Don't respond to this.  If you're still young maybe help will get to you in time.  If not then I'll see you on the street waiting to die.
