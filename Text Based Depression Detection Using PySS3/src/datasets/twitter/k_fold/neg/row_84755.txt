Why shouldn't I kill myself?I'm 25 now and I feel like I've lived my entire life for other people. I've never been able to fully express myself and I never will lest I bring shame to my family. I'm always the one making sacrifices, I'm always the one to uphold my families values so they feel proud, I lie all the time to make them happy because the times when I've told the truth, I've just been harrased to the point where I've developed a fear of anyone seeing who I am or saying my actual thoughts. 

I don't have the potential to make enough money, I'm never going to be pretty enough or stable enough to have a relationship or my own family - I'm doomed to a life of mediocrity and loneliness. I've lost all motivation and all I can do is sleep. I've tried for so long to develop a routine and become a better person because I disappoint everyone no matter how hard I try. But here I am, overweight, without a job, void of friendships or relationships, and no prospect for a better future. 

I see no way out or nothing and nobody to live for. I genuinely think life would be easier for everyone if I was gone. But everyone says don't kill yourself, it's selfish, it's cowardly. Why can't I do this for myself? I want to be badly injured to the point where I'm incapacitated or dead. I don't think I can go on. I don't know how I'll end it but I know I want to.
