I don't know how to title thisevery couple of days or weeks or so i stay up drinking and write something here, ramble for a bit to myself, then delete it and go to bed. i'm 21 years old, i can't remember a time when i didn't have suicidal thoughts. memory is fucked i know, but as far as i know i've been chronically depressed since i was seven years old, if i can believe my parents. i don't know how to make myself happy, i just don't. i've tried pills, therapy, exercise and proper diet, all the shit you hear. purpose is what it's supposed to give you, i don't feel it. i have a girlfriend, she knows how i feel, i'm honest if i'm asked, i don't like talking with her about it though, since it doesn't really help me and it just makes her feel sad. i fake how i am for so many people, i have been for so long, i wanted to get out of the psychologists and drug system. but i'm tired. i'm used to it but i'm so tired. it's like i've been tired for. i don't know if i can even care about other people, i don't know if i do the things just because it's what i'm supposed to do. i mean god knows i can't be like this normally, not fitting for a wage slave. doesn't sell well. i get that. fuck life man. suicidal is my normal state of mind. i don't know how to be any other way. i don't know why i bother writing these, throwaway, i'm not going to kill myself, i don't hhave anything besides this, but i doubt anything will change. i hate how melodramatic it sounds. it's funny. i don't feel any kind of satisfaction from anything. life feels like chasing a high i can't buy that other people have. i'm resentful of happy people, which is unhealthy. i'm a jealous person. c78
