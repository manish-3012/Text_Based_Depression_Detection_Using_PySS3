What do I do if I don't necessarily want to kill myself but I don't really have anywhere to go?I'm 18 and live in the US if that matters or gives perspective. Today I was fired from my job as a fry cook cause I wasn't getting it quick enough and I didn't have experience. I liked that job and before it I worked factories for my 9 to 5 shit that I absolutely hated. Overall I don't eant to work 9 to 5s I want to make things like music for a living and that stuff has been what's keeping my rent/bills paid.

Anyways, I have around $500 in the bank right now, I'm expecting $1,500 in tax returns and I asked my grandfather for a loan and that might sound like a lot but it wont last me long if I dont find work soon. I felt like that fry cook job was a shot at not hating my circumstances so much and I might have blown it. They said I could re interview Monday for a position as a host or a waiter but even if that works out I'm not sure if itll pay enough to keep me afloat.

So if it doesn't work out I'm either gonna have to try to find another job which theres a good chance I'll only be able to do some shitty factory again, or I'm not gonna find one in time and I'm gonna hit my last dollar and get evicted. If I'm evicted I'll either be homeless or I'll have to move in with my abusive mother which might not even be an option. Though with either of these I don't know how I'd be able to record music, I'm 99% sure I wouldnt be able to at my mom's house, I record in a closet in my apartment currently.

Anyways, I don't really want to kill myself right now. But if it all goes bad what choice do I have? It's either that or be miserable, probably a lot more miserable and depressed than I am now.
