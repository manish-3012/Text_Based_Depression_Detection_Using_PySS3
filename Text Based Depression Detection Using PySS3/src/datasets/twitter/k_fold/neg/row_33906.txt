I'm tired of everything and just want to end it all.Suicide sounds better and better everyday. 

---

I seriously don't know what to do anymore. All the time I constantly get bashed on by my parents for no reason. My mom tells me I'm retarded, Lazy, and all these other terrible things. I'm always the first to blame for everything. I don't remember the last time they did something or got me something I wanted. I can't even remember the last time they told me I did a nice job on something, or that they were proud of me. 

I am also convinced everyone hates; IRL and virtually. I'm slowly drifting away from people I used to talk too because of internet. I am just an annoying little piece of crap that causes drama everywhere I go. I always get made fun of for what I do, or what I like. I've been told by multiple people that they don't care about me. It's just gotten to the point where death feels like the best option.
