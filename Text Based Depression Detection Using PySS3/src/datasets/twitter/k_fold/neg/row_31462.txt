I don't even know why I'm posting this honestly (tw:csa)i was molested by my friends older brother from 3-6 and i was also sexually abused by my mother growing up. i'm 20 now and i still live with her and i've been working on moving out but it's so hard when i feel like my life isn't worth living. i can't keep living with her and moving out is taking so long and all i do is cry all the time and i'm so tired. i feel so alone. 
i don't have any friends and i want to give up so bad. I already tried to od when I was 19 but it didn't work I didn't even have to go to the hospital just puked everywhere and felt like shit for a couple days but...
I just don't think my quality of life is ever going to be at a place where living will be worth it
