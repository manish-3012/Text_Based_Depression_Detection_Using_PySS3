I'm hurting so muchAll the bad shit that has happened in my life is stuck flying around in my head and it won't leave. All I can think about is getting drunk and throwing myself off a bridge. I hate myself and life so much but I'm stuck here for now. I feel this way a lot but it usually goes away for a little while so I can breathe, but it's not leaving. It's like I'm lost in the darkness, I want to get out.
