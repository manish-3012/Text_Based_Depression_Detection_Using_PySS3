I want to still fight but feeling giving up.Ive been fighting my depression, mental illness and demons for about 5 years now, I'm currently 16 today, I have OCD, GAD, and social anxiety that I prevents me from living my life and I cant socialize like when I was younger when I am anxiety free. Whats keeping me on fighting is that I have the chance to change my life because someone bought my mom's company for millions of dollars and my mom always says that "Just hang in there after a month we will be rich" and says that I can buy whatever I wanted and have access to best psychologists and dermatologists out there but I dont know I feel like meds doesnt work for me so I dont know if therapy will work. I dont know but I feel like even money cant make me happy in life, I fuxked my life up and I have no friends and outsider in scjool and an insecure kid, even if I get rich I dont know where to begin in fixing myself. I need to wait for about 1 month until the transaction is finished, but I dont know if I can wait for that long because school and my mental illness is getting worse and worse. I hope I can last.
