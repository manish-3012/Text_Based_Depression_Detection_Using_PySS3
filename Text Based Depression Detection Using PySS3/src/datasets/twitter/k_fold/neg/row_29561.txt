I don't want to live anymoreI really want to kill myself. I hate myself. I hate my body, I hate my self image. I constantly feel like shit. I suck at school. I fail almost every test that I have. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I'm such an accident. I feel like everyone hates me, I feel like i'm alone always. The only things I do is coming back from school, playing video games, look at memes and go to sleep. I hate myself.

I want to hang myself. but i'm scared. I don't know what it will do to myself, my family or my friends. I lack the courage. That's probably the only thing that keeps me from killing myself. I hate this world. I hate myself. I hate everything. I wake up and i'm sad. i'm sick of school, i'm sick from my parents treating me like shit, i'm sick of living. I want to cry all day. I'm suck a lazy piece of fucking shit. I cannot do this anymore. I want to die.

My brother has cancer. he is dying. he means the world to me. I don't know what I will do if he passes away.

also, I am bisexual. My parents are very religious. I can't do this, hiding myself from everyone. I know they will kick me out or worse. I don't want this anymore. I want to finish this. I can't.

My mom is such a control freak. I can't talk to her. when I was bullied at school and I had no friends, she said I was exaggerating and saying  that I just want attention. I have no one to talk to. I can't do this anymore
