I could use someone to talk toBefore I begin I just want to say Thank You. I usually post here on my other account trying to help others but I really could use some advice right now and I will try to keep it short...

I am very scared right now that when I get home from work tonight my kitten will be dead and I'm on hour 8 out of 12 at work and I am doing everything in my power to just make it till I can go home. He got into a bag of almond flour that has been in the same place for at least a good 2 months and decided to try and eat some of it.. It looks like he threw up what he tried to eat of it and what didn't get thrown up passed through him but he wont eat or drink now. I am taking him to the vet as soon as I get off work if he isn't improving but I can't help just thinking about what I am going to do if hes gone when I get home. I've been trying to do research on if its dangerous for cats but I can't really find anything except that according to the ASPCA its not deadly but its not good either. I want to believe that he just has a tummy ache and will be ready to eat/drink when I get home but I can't help but think of the worst case scenario. 

I know it may seem silly, a post about a cat making me depressed but I have depression, this is a trigger and if something happens to him I know I will hurt myself. I rescued him from some bushes when he was barely able to open his eyes and spent days bottle feeding him and keeping him alive. His mother was hit by a car.

 I've gone through this almost manic feeling before when my other cat licked flea medicine off and was sick like this for a couple days but I had my fiance to help me through it. He is visiting his sister who has cancer so I really don't want to bother him with me being depressed over anything right now because I feel selfish when shes battling for her life. 

I know this isn't r/cats but I really just want someone to talk to because I am loosing my mind.
