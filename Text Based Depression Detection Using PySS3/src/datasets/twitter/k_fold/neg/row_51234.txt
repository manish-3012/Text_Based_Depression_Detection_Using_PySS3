There is no joy in my life.Everything that made me happy and brought me joy a while ago almost dosenâ€™t exist anymore and thoughts of suicide are really affecting me now. Just last week when the thought of suicide and just the absolute realization that nothing in life mattered really started to hit me, i tied a karate belt around my neck and just sat in the edge if my bed contemplating it, before i started thinking how my life used to have more joy and fun and the tiny but of hope that life may be like that came to me again, and made me untie the belt. Joy in the here and now though dosenâ€™t exist and i  just sit on my bed all day and all night watching YouTube videos and listening to music and the thoughts of suicide are still present in my mind. Sometimes i even have dreams where I actually hang myself. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
