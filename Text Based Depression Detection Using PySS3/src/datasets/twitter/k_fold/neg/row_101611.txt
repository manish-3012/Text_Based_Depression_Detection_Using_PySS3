i donâ€™t know how much longer i can take this, please help me.i made a post here probably around 2 weeks ago. you can go read it for more context. i didnâ€™t go through with it because i chickened out at the last minute. but honestly, this is just a cry for help. i donâ€™t have anyone anymore. no friends that care about me. i just hate myself so much and i wish that i didnâ€™t sometimes. but iâ€™m on the edge. i swear, any little thing could be the reason i just give up at this point. i need someone who can help me, please. please help me. i need someone, anyone. i donâ€™t want to do this, but i feel like i have to. please help
