Nothing like the realisationOf finding out the one thing you thought you were good at youâ€™ve failed at too. 

I thought i had always done my best for my boy but today when I weighed him I had the sudden realisation Iâ€™ve totally let him down too. Heâ€™s classed as â€œvery overweightâ€ and on the 99th centile. 

So yeah thatâ€™s the one thing I thought I was good at but no. Iâ€™ve totally let him down too. 

He was the only reason I was still here and this just shows heâ€™d be better off without me too. 

I really hope I go to sleep tonight and I donâ€™t wake up. That way everyone would be better off. I canâ€™t keep crying myself to sleep like this anymore. I canâ€™t keep letting people down anymore! Everyone would be completely better off without me making everything worse. 

I wish I had enough pills here to make me sleep forever
