Considering killing myself tonightI'm tired of this life. What kind of cruel joke are the gods playing on me? Why do they think this is funny? I can't turn to anyone in my family for help, especially my mother. Last time I told her I want to kill myself she yelled at me and told me she's tired of my shit. So did my nana. My friends will just tell my mom and they don't know how to offer support they just say it will get better. My boyfriend broke up with me a few months ago and he's all I ever think about now. I can't keep living like this. Thanksgiving is tomorrow and my fatass will just eat away it's feelings like it always does. I'm exhausted, mentally, emotionally and physically. I just can't keep doing this.
