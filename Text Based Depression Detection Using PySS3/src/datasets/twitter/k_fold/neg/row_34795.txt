Really rough dayI'm not sure what I'm hoping for but I tried calling the Suicide prevention hotline and the call got disconnected while I was talking and I just didn't have the energy to call back.

It's been almost a year that I've been dealing with my depression and loss.  Almost a year since I lost the love of my life because he decided he wanted to be with someone else.  And I can't handle hearing about how it's his loss and I will find someone else who deserves me.  

I don't want anyone else.  I don't want to move on.  I want the life I spent 10 years building back.  He was my family.  I don't have anyone else.  I'm anti-social and have difficulty making connections with people, even when I try.

I've cried so much in the last year that I am surprised I can cry anymore.  I beg God to let me die or kill me every night.  There is no such thing as a good day.  There are days when I am better at hiding my anxiety/depression but it's always there.

At the end of August I'll truly be alone in this house and I don't know that I'm going to survive it.  I spent 6 months alone before my daughter came for summer break and I'm afraid when she leaves to go back to school that I'm not going to have any reason to get up, or eat, or be alive.  I don't know that I can keep living with these feelings but I don't have anyone I can truly talk to.

Everything that I spent my whole heart on fell apart and I can't seem to find any motivation to pick up the pieces and put my life back together again.
