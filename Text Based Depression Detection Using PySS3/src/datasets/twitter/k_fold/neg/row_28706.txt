A sick mind and even more pathetic personIâ€™ll start by saying I am pathetic and worthless someone like me deserves a bullet to the head 

Iâ€™ve been in an long distance relationship with someone for about 7 months now, I met them when I was 18 and they were 15 Iâ€™m now 19 theyâ€™re still 15 but theyâ€™ll be 16 in a couple weeks, as it nears their birthday Iâ€™m having these thoughts again 

I despise pedophiles but I am one? is this age gap â€œjustifiableâ€? Even saying that sounds incredibly idiotic, Iâ€™d say I have genuine love for this person as this is also my first relationship with someone of the same sex, someone who doesnâ€™t like me off looks and instead likes my personality I guess I reciprocate this as well 

I have slit my wrists in a way to â€œrepentâ€ perhaps? Iâ€™ve also had a number of failed suicide attempts early on in our relationship because of the same thinking 

It isnâ€™t as easy as leaving this person alone too, at least I donâ€™t think it is I love them genuinely and I wouldnâ€™t wanna hurt them, Iâ€™ve told them about this as well to which they respond that theyâ€™ve never thought of me as a pedophile and donâ€™t want me to leave them 

This scares me also I overthink and my mind goes to what if I am a manipulator of sorts to where I let a child bond with me in this way without even thinking of it 

I constantly think of suicide and relapsing on self harm as a way to repent I am an adult in a relationship with a child so it is deserved Iâ€™d say, needless to say if I end the relationship I will kill myself, if they end the relationship I will kill myself
