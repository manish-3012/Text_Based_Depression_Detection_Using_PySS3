I'm not loveableI'm just a fat piece of shit that can't find the motivation to exercise and get better. My skin is horrible and scarred up from self harm and acne its not good. I look like a damn muppet.   
That's just one of the reasons of course. I can't take to people. I'm not good at explaining myself to others even when we're privately talking. There's always a way to get help and I know that but I'm just not ready at all. When people give me a hand i take it and i'm happy but i realize that they won't always be there and if i keep relying on them im just going to annoy them. I can't do shit for myself. Idk why I'm so lazy. I always pity myself. I honestly feel like theres nothing left to do but kill myself. I want to kill myself.   
Even though I'm too afraid. I probably won't. I'm just going to not do it because Im also too lazy to kill myself. God I'm so pathetic. I'm so pathetic and I hate it. I'm just going to disappoint everyone. Quarantine only makes it worse since I'm stuck at home doing nothing and my body is just deteriorating. Because no ones looking at me i just see it as a chance to let myself go i guess.   
But because of that now every time i go out I become more aware of what ive done to myself and i just panic so much.   
I cant do anything. Not even when i think I'm happy. Why am I so afraid of taking risks. Im so horrible. Im a horrible human being. Maybe I should kill myself. I just can't help it
