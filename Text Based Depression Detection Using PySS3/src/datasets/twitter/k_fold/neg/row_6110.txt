I've tied the Noose...I've got my best suit, I've picked out the most lovely tree...  
I can't do this anymore... I can't... theres no more Joy in my life... no more love no more fun... food all tastes bland... i'm never hungry anymore... I try to keep busy and work... but nothing I do can keep the thoughts out... not even talking with my friend helps anymore... I just... can't do this anymore... I'm not strong enough... theres no more help... I don't even know why I'm posting this... I guess I just want to post this see if anyone cares...
