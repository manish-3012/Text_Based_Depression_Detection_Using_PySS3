killing my self soon.i hate myself. my perception of reality has been warped over the years. i have anxiety and depression. no matter how much medication i take nothing works. i just canâ€™t have fun anymore iâ€™m always so stressed and depressed. iâ€™m 15 and i canâ€™t take this anymore. my mental health is decaying and i donâ€™t know if iâ€™m living life correct. iâ€™m ending my life soon.
