I don't know what's wrong.I'm planning on killing myself tonight. I don't even know what's wrong. I don't know what I'm crying about. Hell, I even managed to finish a tough requirement at school this morning. I should be celebrating. I should be happy. I don't know why I'm like this. I have a wonderful SO but I feel so fucking alone. I just don't see a future for myself.
