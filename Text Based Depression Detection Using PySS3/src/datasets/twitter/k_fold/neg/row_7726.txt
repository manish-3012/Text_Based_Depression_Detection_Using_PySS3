The unknown of when.. and the anxiety it brings.I've contemplated suicide for what seems like the past decade or so. Now that my mind is set.. all that's left is to decide a day.

I've struggled in the past in deciding when would be my last day. Even now, I try to pick a day, but nothing I decide upon feels right. I know what I want to do. I know how I want to do it. I just don't know when. And it's eating away at the last remaining shreds of life I have left in me.
