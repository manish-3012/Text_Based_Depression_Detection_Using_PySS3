I envy ppl who kill themselvesI think about it lots but can never go throw with it. 

When I think life is getting better, I got meds and stuff, but shit happens and just kicks me down again. I honestly think dieing is so much better then being on meds for a long time just to feel happy again.

I have done online (CBT programs) but those barley help, I am waiting for professional help covered under Ontario insurance (private is expensive) I'm on a 8 month to 1 year wait list.....
