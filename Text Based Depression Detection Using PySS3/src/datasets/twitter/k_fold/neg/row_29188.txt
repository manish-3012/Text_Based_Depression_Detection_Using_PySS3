I just don't knowI've been feeling really bad lately. I go to college but I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm wasting time and money. I enjoy doing art sometimes but I'm always so unmotivated, my classmates come up with great things and I feel like I'm not good enough. 
I keep making these mistakes that end up hurting people and myself. I feel like a nuisance. 
I also have a job but I have anxiety so lots of times when people come I just feel like I'm gonna cry.
I keep having panic attacks in the middle of the night and I feel like the only person I want to talk to about it doesn't even want to talk to me.
I keep having these thoughts that I should just end it because I honestly can't picture myself going further in life. 
I was planning on doing it this weekend when my mom goes out of town, and my sisters are gone.
