so much... with so little.....Unsure if something really happened or not.



Yesterday I think I told my older sister about my other sister being rapped by her uncle. This started a war between my mom and my oldest sister. She doesn't want to believe that he would do it, even though he was completely fucking plastered of booze and stoned as a motherfucker. So my mom told her that if she wanted to call my sister (who got rapped) a liar, she and her baby could get the fuck out. Or she could believe us and cut out her birth family (she's my step-sister but i don't count steps. you are or you aren't.) WELLLLL... She cant cut out her birth family. theres too much there. Although they are drug addicts, drug dealing, pill popping, coke snorting, needle pitnching, crack loving freaks, she loves them...

When she got the message she came in and showed it to me. She said it was all my fault. and it is... i shouldnt have told her i knew how'd she would react and still i told her i thought she knew but she tricked me and im so confused... I screamed, oh boy did i scream. Then i cried for hours as I ran away. So many people were looking..... laughing..... its my fault but i cant tell if its real or not and i dont know i just want to be sure but dont wanna bring anything up im not sure what to do or what to say i have no one to talk to which is why i post here... my mom doesnt believe i have schizo but she sees the signs and she says its just stress but ive read enough to know that it is schizophrenia and i want to be tested but she wont let me because then they'll stick me on meds and i dont want meds they dont work and i like to abuse the fact that i have them when i do... help me please..... im scared and i dont know what to do or think and every part of me just wants to buy weed, smoke 20$ worth all at once and just end it so i wont feel the pain.......
