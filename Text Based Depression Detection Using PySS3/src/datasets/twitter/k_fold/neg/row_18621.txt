I can't believe I'm letting a woman make me feel this way.....I truly don't want to continue my life without her. I've let friendships go because this was the woman I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I'm that guy that, if my relationship isn't going my way, I was gone. So why do I feel like I can't live without this one? I gave her my heart, I gave her everything that I've never given another. But now she has tore my heart from my chest and I have no reason to continue anymore. I've come to a point where I just don't want to continue. I'm tired of starting over and it would just be easier to be done with it. Everyone would be happier including my kids. Then they wouldn't have to be embarrassed or ashamed of me anymore. My parents wouldn't have to worry about raising a failure and everyone could just be happy with their lives. I feel all alone and that no one truly cares. I've never felt this alone. I've always fantasized about getting hit by a train. Can I get a toot toot? Tomorrow or the next day i hope to be gone. See you on the other side....
