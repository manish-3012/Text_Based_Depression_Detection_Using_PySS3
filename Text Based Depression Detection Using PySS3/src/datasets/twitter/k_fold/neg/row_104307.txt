Suicidal ThoughtsWhat most people do not understand about suicide is that the person who ends their life, most likely did not do this on a whim. It was not, as often touted, "a dark period." That dark period was their life. 

We know this because of the reactions from the survivors: I had no idea. They seemed so bright. I knew they were drinking too much, but I didn't know it was this bad. 

I have tried explaining this to many people in many ways, but have really only found success with one - and it is a metaphor. 

Suicidal thoughts are like water. Imagine you are ankle deep in water. Try to walk. You can still do so, but it takes some extra effort. For some, this is their normal day - the thoughts are there, but the person is able to overcome them with a reliable consistency, much how you could walk a mile in ankle deep water. 

Other days, they are knee deep. Financial problems loom - a spat with a lover - missing a deadline at your job; something that was running smoothly has gone awry, and those thoughts prey on those moments. 

The suicidal person will reach out for help, but not to you - or to anyone else. If someone you know has told you they are having suicidal thoughts, reflect back on the blank, sterile, know-nothing panic that you reacted with. "I have to do something, but what?"

This is the normal reaction to hearing about someone's suicidal thoughts - and it is 100&amp;#37; unhelpful. 

Instead, the suicidal person reaches out for: alcohol, drugs, adventure, a trist with a stranger, quitting their job for a new life, or quitting their life for their job. This is an effort to break the cycle of bad thoughts - and on these days, the water is waist deep. Try to walk.

How long do you think you could walk in waist deep water? I don't mean distance, I mean time. An hour? A day? A week? A month? A year?

Eventually, as with everyone, something seriously goes wrong: death of a loved one, cancer diagnosis, a Performance Improvement Plan, or the periodic unforeseeable economic downturn. Now the water is neck deep, but at this point the suicidal still manage to say "great" when you disingenuously ask them how their day is going. Try to walk. 

How long do you think you could walk in neck deep water?

I once read an analysis of the bible that drew the conclusion that the plagues beget each other: the floods bring the frogs, the frogs bring the flies, the flies bring the pestilence, etc... 

This is very similar. In neck deep water you don't reach out for help, you convince yourself that you are a burden to others - a belief not entirely inaccurate - and that the best course of action is to tough it out: bring on the flies. 

Fatigue wears you down in neck deep water, and in this delirious state you sink further - you are now under water. How long do you think you could tread water to stay afloat? An hour? A day? A week?
