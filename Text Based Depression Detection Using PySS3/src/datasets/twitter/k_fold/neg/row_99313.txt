I have such first world problems but I'm not happy with my lifeFirstly, compared to a lot of people on this subreddit I don't have it bad at all.  I'm not broke, I have friends, I have goals/hobbies, and I'm not extremely ugly either. 

But I haven't really been doing much in my life because I wanted to do it. All the stuff I've done was to make my mom happy (I'm her only child, and she's my only parent) but I can tell she's not that happy with me.  I'm taking my sweet time trudging through grad school while putzing around with jobs unrelated to my field and to have money for hobbies because I don't want to be that stressed. She is an iron firsted asian parent who has never really coddled me, so this isn't really something I can talk through with her. The last time I hugged her, I was probably 5. 

I can tell she's also quite jealous that her sister's daughters have all gotten married by now but I haven't even had my first boyfriend yet. I've made a few attempts at dating for her sake but it was just so boring to me, and not my thing.  

Last night I just got really drunk and especially depressed and kind of started making plans for all my assets and where they would go because I don't really have good goals for myself and kind of want to end it. I feel like I have all these great things going on for me, but it just feels so empty and meaningless. :(
