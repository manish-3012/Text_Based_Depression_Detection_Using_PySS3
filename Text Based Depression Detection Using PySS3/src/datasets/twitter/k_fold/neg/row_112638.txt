I just want to do itI have a rope. I'd have to tie it but fuck it seems like so much effort. It's crazy how a day can be going so well and then fuck up because of one little thing. It seems like it'll be such a relief. I won't have to think of anything ever again. Everything will just shut up. I want to do it so badly. No one cares about anything I do or say. No one cares about my interests or hobbies. Even if they asked, I couldn't tell them because they'd probably think I'm weird. Maybe I am just fucking weird. Still I wish I even knew what it was like to feel that people might care about your shit. I want to kill myself so fucking bad. I hate it here so much. One stupid thing can shove me over the edge just like that. Fucking stupid of myself to get so upset over such a small thing, but it happened, and now I'm here. And fuck, I want to get that rope so bad.
