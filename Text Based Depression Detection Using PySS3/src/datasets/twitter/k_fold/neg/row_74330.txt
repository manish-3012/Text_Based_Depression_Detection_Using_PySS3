Why live if you're not perfectI want to start over. I want to reincarnate as a perfect idol that people adore.

In this life I will never be perfect.

I don't want my mom to find me dead. I want to be found almost dying and transported to the hospital and die there. I don't know how to do that. Maybe cut deep into my wrists and lay down and take a nap and have people find me like that. I thought about overdosing on my sleeping medications but that could also not kill me and rather make me have a seizure or have organ failure. 

I'm very tired now, I'll go to sleep and then if I wake up and feel the same I'll write my will
