I just came to sayI love you. If youâ€™re suffering and alone know that we are out there, good people who do care. In the darkness I know you canâ€™t see light, I know, but just try to believe itâ€™s there. Itâ€™s just out of your reach but you will get there. I wish you the strength you need and kindness you deserve. Please hold tight, cry and know you deserve to be supported no matter what. Most importantly you didnâ€™t do anything wrong and you are a good person.
