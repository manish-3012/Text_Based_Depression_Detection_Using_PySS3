I failed driving test 6 times and probably in four hours I will fail again.It's killing me.I can't understand why everyone pass at first time or at least 3 but I can't ! I tried to be strong and don't give up but I just want to cry.Few minutes ago I was asked to move my family car and of course I misunderstood his words and my better-than-me-in-everything-brother has to come and save the day like always.Now I'm even more terrified than usual and feel like complete shit.WHY I CAN'T BE NORMAL AND HAPPY LIKE HE IS ? WHY I WAS EVEN BORN ? I'm his worse copy and I'm gonna end this tonight.They already have perfect son and don't need wasting money leech.I'm so sad that I will not be long alive to see new tv series ,movies and listen this beautiful songs on my phone but I can't stand myself and this world anymore.Goodbye ? 

tl;dr Fail=Death.
