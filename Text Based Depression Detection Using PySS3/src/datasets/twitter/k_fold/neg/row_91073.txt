Iâ€™m officially done. Iâ€™ve decided and I feel better, and so will everyone elseI tried to keep going after I tried to kill myself last week but itâ€™s no good. Iâ€™m a waste of skin and Iâ€™ve had no right to waste everyoneâ€™s time and money over the years.

Iâ€™ve sent off a load of emails and messages to the people in my life I need to apologise and say goodbye to. Itâ€™s early in the morning here so hopefully Iâ€™ll be safely dead by the time they read them. Theyâ€™ll be upset but soon theyâ€™ll see this was the only choice that made sense.

Iâ€™m really sorry to my parents most of all. They deserved someone better. I canâ€™t give them her but I can dispose of this one.

Sorry guys. Itâ€™s been fun here but itâ€™s time to stop selfishly hanging onto life.
