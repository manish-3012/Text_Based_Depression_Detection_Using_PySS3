Therapy failedKinda new here, think I've posted before in the past but so long ago that I dont remember the account. 
So.. it's really a long story with so many little details that I just cant be bothered writing. I'm tired. The short of it is that I've fucked my life and I'm too lazy or defeated or something to repair it. I dropped out at 14 (24F now), isolated, spent the last 10 years in a sinking ship of suicidal depression, ruining my body with self harm and an eating disorder. And now its like.. my brother [44M] hung himself last Oct and my family is all on their own sinking ships too. His kids/my nephews [8, 10, 12] are with his predatory sociopath (not said lightly) of an ex wife and are getting fucked up and my parents are going through another legal shitstorm with her. And idk I'm just on the outside looking in at everything .. and everything I see I don't really want to be part of anyway.
Like what even is the point lmao.
I did a year of DBT skills group and I'm still in ongoing individual contact and it's been relatively successful. I'm totally different than I was a couple years ago. 
But here I am feeling sick, probably with covid, and all my distractions at trying improve myself (electrical engineering course, gym, trying to make friends) have been stopped for at least the next 4 weeks because my country (NZ) is shutting down. And I'm looking at my messenger with a handful of randoms I hardly know in real life not knowing who to even talk to. Fuck being alone this long. 
And what has my mind gone straight to? Looking up how much codeine will do the job even though I KNOW od is one of the worst most bullshit ways to go. 
And when I'm at this headspace it's like "hahah dumb bitch, therapy failed and that was your last chance, so just fuck off now".
Idk aye. It's all fucked. ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸
