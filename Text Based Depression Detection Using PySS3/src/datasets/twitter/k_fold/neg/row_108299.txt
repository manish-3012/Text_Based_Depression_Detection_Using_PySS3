this doesnt make any sense and im sorryim a 14 year old girl and i was raped when i was seven and im feeling very. not good and i keep remembering things and hes out to get me i know it and im a burden to everyone and i havent felt like i belong somewhere since like 2011. i don't know im just so disgusting and im afraid of men and no one likes me at my new school. im nnot special or important or cool or pretty or lovable or cared about. i cant tell my family because they'll say im being overdramatic and i don't want to ruin their christmas... i just feel so alone right now, and i feel like no one really cares. 

im sorry for asking for help
