I was really happyI had a job in my field lined up for the fall and I had a loving girlfriend.
I lost the job a few weeks before the summer term ended because they found someone cheaper.
My girlfriend just left me, saying she had become alcoholic and didn't want me to be around that.
I had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria earlier this year and my family hasn't been very supportive, the only person who really was was my girlfriend. 
I just feel like I've lost everything I loved in life and I don't know what to do to get back on my feet. All I have left is that I love programming but unless I can find a job in a few weeks I'm going to be on the street.
