F15, I've planned out my suicideWhen I finish school I'm going to go los Angeles   for a short trip, I've always wanted to go so bad, I get a lifting sensation on sunlight when I think about it, I spend free classes walking around it on Google earth. I know I sound crazy and unrealistic which is one of the reasons I'm killing myself. I can't do anything my whole life I've been told I wouldn't amount to anything everyone has told me I'm stupid and so many boys have told me I'm ugly. I've never been genuinely liked but I've been asked out as a joke a lot. I can't do anything exceptionally well so I have no chance of successfully migrating, every time I go abroad in the sun I feel so happy but people always stare at me and laugh when I go anywhere. I just can't do it, I'm sorry
