GoodbyeAfter 17 years on this planet, I've decided that can't do it anymore.

Almost every day now is a struggle.

I'm done being a virgin with not ONE SINGLE friend to speak of.

My education is down the toilet, I've got social anxiety to the point where I now can't even leave the house, and I'm 100% sure that I've got asperger's syndrome.

Tonight is the night that I do it. I'll write a note to my mum, dad, 3 younger siblings, and some other members of my family. Then, once everyone's gone to sleep, I'm going to get a knife from the kitchen and sneak out to the alleyway next to the house where I'll end this once and for all.

This life isn't for everyone. Goodbye.
