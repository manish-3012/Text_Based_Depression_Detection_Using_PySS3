We're trapped in a cycle. Everyone's life is pointlessI want to kill myself. I really do. But it won't work. Obviously what I am about to say is my theory and what I believe: If we were nothing before we were born, we're gonna enter that same state when we die. So who says that we won't be reborn again? If we enter the same state that we were in just before being born by dying, we will just repeat. Over and over. I find that terrifying, that we will be reborn, over and over, no ending, and not remember a single life that we had before, and if we won't remember this life, or any other future life that we will have, there is literally no point at all in living. But since I will just be reborn into a new life and forget what I just realized it would be unnecessary to end my life because then I would trap myself again, and then I would need to re-realize this in my next life and so on.

My point is, I'm so incredible depressed, I really really want to die, but there's no point because in my theory, I will just continue to be reborn, reborn, reborn forever and will not remember a single life that I've had.

I have no idea what to do, I feel like we're all so incredible worthless and there's no escape. I've been depressed before, and suicidal, but then I had a reason that could be fixed, this, is literally a trap that we can't escape. I don't know how to cope with life anymore.
