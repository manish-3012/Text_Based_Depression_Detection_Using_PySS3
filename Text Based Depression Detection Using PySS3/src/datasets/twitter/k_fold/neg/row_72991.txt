i just don't understanddear you:

please explain this to me. please explain why you call me names. it hurts. even if i don't always show it anymore, it still hurts. please tell me why you tell me i'm so worthless. you don't have to constantly remind me. i already know this. i try to do better. i promise i do. but it never seems good enough. please explain why you sit silently by and watch others pick at me, hurt me, tear me down and do absolutely nothing. Don't 10 years of marriage mean anything to you? And why do you yell at me and call me names in front of the kids? Now they do the same. 

I feel ugly. I feel hated. I feel worthless. I feel the need to escape. Everyone I know tears me down. I know no positive. I know no happiness. My chest hurts. My stomach hurts. My heart hurts. I have nothing left.

I have finally hit rock bottom. Please take care of the kids. I know you love them. Please, keep doing the things you do for them. You are a good father. 

I took my vows seriously. Til death do us part. We now reach that point. Goodbye. I love you.
