Was just laid off today.As the title says I was just laid off from my job today, and I can't get the thoughts of killing myself out of my head. I know this isn't the end of the world or anything, but I can't seem to shake these thoughts as I'm filling out unemployment/browsing jobs. 

Despite my overall dislike for the amount of stress the it caused, the pay was much more than I deserved. Plus it feels like it was about the only positive thing I have going for me at this point in my life. I don't really have a reason for posting this, just wanted to get it off of my chest I guess.
