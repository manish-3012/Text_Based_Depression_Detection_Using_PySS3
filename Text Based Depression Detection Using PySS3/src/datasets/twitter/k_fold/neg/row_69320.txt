Am I the only one who feels like this?Hi,

Iâ€™m hoping that someone can relate to this as I can not express how I feel to anyone, so Iâ€™m an 28 years old, I have a decent job and have had a decent upbringing and social network of friends and family. So yeah perfect life right? So why do I think every day without fail if I could take a pill to end my life I would, even the good days I think about it. I have no idea if I have any mental illness as I have never seeked help. I have never attempted to end my life as I would not want my mother to go through any pain of me doing it or feel for any reason she may blame herself for my actions. From a young age Iâ€™ve have always had a feeling I would die young, I have times where I have spoke to friends and family recently about feeling low but brush it off as I donâ€™t want people to feel like they need to check on me. I work in a hospital currently during the pandemic and I have no fear at all towards the virus. I constantly when I get a symptom of anything serious look it up to see if I have an terminal Illness and this may sound weird but I hope that I do, I think this may be due to the fact it could end my life without people having to question anything. I canâ€™t help but feel selfish as I know people care about me yet I feel lonely. I feel extremely guilty for how I feel as I know people suffer much more everyday. Itâ€™s almost like I want to leave a room quietly without people watching me questioning where Iâ€™m going and not notice Iâ€™ve gone so it doesnâ€™t affect their life and feelings.

Does anyone else have any similar feelings?

I do not want to offend anyone as I know everyone has their own reasons and may think Iâ€™m very selfish for how I feel and that I have a pretty normal life which a lot of people would wish for.

Thank you for reading if you have got this far...
