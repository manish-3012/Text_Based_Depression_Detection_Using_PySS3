hiI said I was done coming here to vent every now and then but I'm back... things are getting bad again and I'm not sure what to do anymore. I was going to try and check in to an inpatient but I know it'd be a huge inconvenience for the people around me and would fuck up their schedules. I just am not sure what to do anymore everything feels so horrible and I just feel so alone. The people who claim I can come to them always seem to have an issue with me no matter what and I'm just making everyone uncomfortable. I don't even think they want me here either so what's the point? why is everyone so disappointed and upset with me? I'm so tired of being used.
