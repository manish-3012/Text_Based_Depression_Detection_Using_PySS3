An interesting journal entry.The first part is sort of me venting, but also sort of how I actually feel. The rest are questions I've been asking myself for a while now. 

Some Background: I'm an 18 year old music business major wrapping up my freshman year. I go to school about 5-6 hours from home. I made deans list first semester and probably this semester as well. I'm not bad looking or out of shape. I have two very supportive parents who are married under the same roof. I have a 20 year old brother that I finally get along with. I can talk to them about anything but this.

I know itâ€™s me and not everyone else. But Iâ€™m pretty happy with who I am. I seem to have reached an impasse... 
Iâ€™m done with exams. I just have to do this dumb shit in dreamweaver, play in the band for graduation, and then my ass is going home. Just in time too, Iâ€™m pretty sick of seeing everyoneâ€™s shit eating grins, pretending I donâ€™t hate them, and hearing all about their trivial bullshit like anyone cares. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing after that. Iâ€™m not really relieved to be done. Just ready to leave. It was a pretty non stressful year in terms of workload. But my faith in humanity is diminished. I donâ€™t want to be a drunken, debauched, douchebag, but Iâ€™m under a lot of pressure here to become one. Sounds pretty much like home. I guess thatâ€™s just life. 
I havenâ€™t brought this up before in writing, but I have some pretty persistent and pervasive thoughts of suicide. I think Iâ€™m better off writing about it than not writing about it. Perhaps in the name of being honest with myself. I donâ€™t know how run of the mill it is, Iâ€™m not crying my eyes out every night or slitting my wrists or anything. Iâ€™m mostly just not grounded to anything. I donâ€™t believe in a life or consciousness after death, but if, for example, everyone else died, I feel like I would only miss, say, my family. And I figure if I outlived them otherwise, the implication would be that I have to deal with them dying eventually anyway. I know some other people would miss me, but Iâ€™m just one person in their lives. It wouldnâ€™t cripple them to see me go. It would probably make them stronger. Since when is it about them anyway? This is me thinking about what I want. Do I even want anything? I feel like Iâ€™m being wasteful by existing. I donâ€™t need me, and nobody else really does. They may think they do, but I know they donâ€™t. The whole concept of â€œIâ€ feels burdensome and altogether pointless anyway. Fuck, â€œIâ€ never asked for any of this. â€œIâ€ wasnâ€™t around to do that. 
Why am I conscious? I feel like I donâ€™t need to be in order to do what Iâ€™ve been doing throughout my life so far. It makes me altogether less efficient. I could have been an EMT or someone that society needs, but no. I have to want things for myself. I have to consume and think about other things. Why canâ€™t I just be a number? Thatâ€™s what the rest of the world needs from me. Consciousness is just like a vacuum. That's what Sigmund Freudâ€™s "id" really is. He was barking up the wrong tree with the unconscious. Being evil and taking things doesnâ€™t make sense for serving oneâ€™s self in the long run. Rape? Murder? Robbery (unless youâ€™re truly dirt poor)? If they were anything but senseless, they would be more generally accepted by society. But they all do nothing for anyone, including the offender, once you think about it objectively. Harming the harmless doesnâ€™t help the harmful. I believe that there is a pretty high up level of consciousness that must make us do those things. Perhaps not the highest, but up there. Thatâ€™s where sense is made out of the senseless. Itâ€™s where rationalization and overcoming inhibition occurs. Numbers canâ€™t do that. Numbers are harmless. Numbers get shit done. But weâ€™re not numbers. Weâ€™re individual people with independent, trivial, unproductive, self destructive wants. I, for one, think thatâ€™s unfortunate. Beautiful, but unfortunate. Like a burning city.
	I wouldnâ€™t even call myself unhappy. Things are looking up. At least thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m told. And I got where I am by doing what I want. So itâ€™s not a ridiculous notion that I should be happy. Maybe itâ€™s not totally ludicrous for happy people to contemplate suicide on a fairly regular basis. Something is keeping me from actually pulling the plug. I guess because there are missing puzzle pieces. Iâ€™m kind of on the fence on whether or not itâ€™s sensible. Is it altogether not sensible? I am the owner of my body/personship. If I donâ€™t want that, then why should I stop myself from giving it up? I guess because I canâ€™t get it back is one inhibition, but my dead body wouldnâ€™t want it back anyway. I wouldnâ€™t have a mind to change.

I'm really pretty lost. But no more than the average person my age. At least I don't think so. What's different is that I know I'm lost. I don't know if that's a curse or not.
