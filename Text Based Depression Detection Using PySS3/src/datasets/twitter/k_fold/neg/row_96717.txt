I cannot believe I'm actually posting this. I don't really know where to begin. First of all, I guess it's sort of inconceivable to me that I'm on this sub posting something like this. But what the hell, why not add to the humiliation? I guess I'll start out by saying I'm a 27 year old male, currently in college for computer science. I'm a very proud person by default. I was raised by a single mother, but I'm a very masculine person. I believe in strength, tenacity, discipline and most importantly: purpose. My personal motto has always been "Suffering breeds discipline, discipline, breeds strength". I'm an old school traditionalist I believe in the natural order of things. although I'm a leftist, I absolutely disdain liberals or any qualities that exude "weakness". I believe that all human beings are equally worthless (myself included). I've suffered from depression in the past, but through sheer force of will was able to conquer it. I did this by viewing my depression in a martial light; depression is the eternal enemy, and it must be continually fought and kept at bay, I must consciously maintain vigilance for when one of those dark thoughts enter my mind and must vanquish it immediately with all available means to me. I am at a point however, where the elements of life have worn on me over the last four years eroding both my iron will and depleting my fighting spirit. I'm not going to go on about how I got my heartbroken by some girl although that is a factor, I'm am not so pathetic as to let that be the sole reason for not wanting to carry on. I should start by saying the only thing I wanted to do as a child was fly military aircraft. In fact, I still maintain that service to the state is the highest honor one can aspire to. I did attend flight school out of high school and thought I was going to accomplish my dream of becoming a military aviator. I however suffer from a bad case of ADHD. As it would seem: Academia is an insurmountable objective if I'm not medicated. I tried my best but ultimately was unsuccessful in my attempts to complete my college courses without medication. This was a crushing defeat for me, but I picked up and moved on. I have a knack for military history and writing (so I'm told). While I was fulfilling my gen ed requirements I took a 20th century European history class, under a professor who had been an army colonel for 20 years, he earned his undergrad at west point, and completed his PHD at U of M. His graduate thesis was on apache scouting parties. He was one of the strictest professors in the humanities department, having earned the nickname "pressure" for the sheer amount of homework he gave and the difficulty of his tests. I rather liked him immediately. He had excellent command presence. Additionally I thrive in environments where I'm held to standards of excellence, and this professor demanded nothing short of excellence.  I quickly became the top student in the class due to my rather vast repository of knowledge concerning the CCCP, Das Kaiserreich und das Dritte Reich, in addition to my knowledge of infantry tactics employed during both World Wars. and was even told by him "you do excellent work". This remains the highest compliment I've ever received. One day I approached my professor and informed him of my interest about becoming a military historian. He looked me dead in the eye and said "don't do it...it's very difficult to make a living in this field" Although this was another dream crushed, I deemed that this was acceptable because I wanted to pursue a career that would allow me to maximize my utility to the state. My professor had instilled in me a burning desire to serve and to be apart of something greater than myself. I deemed, that the future battlefield would be digital in nature. Stuxnet proved this to me. So I decided I would pursue computer science as my major, and vowed that henceforth there will be no compromises, no more defeats. 

 I knew going into this field I would have to conquer my greatest weakness: mathematics. I knew it wasn't going to be at all easy, but I deemed that anything was possible with courage and discipline. It was around this time that I met my ex, who I loved very much. I was attracted to her femininity, I honestly couldn't tell you want she saw in me, she obviously thought I was handsome. We both transferred to the same university and moved in together. When the relationship ended I was devastated. However, in my heart of hearts I understood why she left, and that I bore most of the responsibility. The break up was pretty nasty to be honest. Although I knew it was largely my fault; I felt betrayed. Yet, I was quick to find myself in the bed room of another woman. I soon realized however, that I had made a mistake. This new girl I was banging and I were on total opposite ends of the spectrum. Where as I tend to worship strength and discipline. She was at the very least hedonistic. I broke it off with her because I did not trust her. I should also mention at this point that I had a best friend I've known and talked to everyday since 7th grade. He was there as best he could be for me. I was still devastated from the break up, even though I'd been with women who were more experienced and in better shape than my ex. My buddy was there for me though, as always. I was grateful to have someone like him. I failed all my classes that semester, and I was completely and utterly ashamed. I felt broken, my family thought that I should transfer schools and move back home. To me though that seemed like admitting defeat which was simply unacceptable to me, so I tried again. This time though, I found out my ex had been fucking the entire computer science department. I'm ashamed to admit that at this point I decided that the situation was untenable and I retreated back home. I was ashamed, and broken. Once home, I quickly went about trying to recover from that defeat. I called computer repair shops asking if they were hiring technicians. No one was hiring. I got a job at a local restaurant. I of all people appreciate strong authority figures, but that job still haunts me. The chef de cusine was a total tyrant. My coworkers even noticed that I became his verbal punching bag. To this day I don't know why, I did give it my best shot. However he soon fired me. Only time I've ever been fired from a job. Honestly I was relieved at that point as I was having panic attacks shortly before my shift ended. I was feeling pretty low at this point, having gone from being an honor role student on the dean's list to a college drop out who just got fired for the first time. It was around this point that I started waking up and going to bed with suicidal thoughts. I got a job at a liquor store and worked there for the next three years. Although I liked my coworkers and my boss at that store. I couldn't help but feel disgraced. I felt like failure. It was around this time I started to hang around an old high school crush who seemed nice on the outside, she too had been through a break up and been forced by necessity to move home with her parents. However, she was an absolutely toxic individual. She had told me on numerous occasions that I was expendable and worthless. I'm totally ashamed to admit I stayed around as long as I did. I don't know why, I hate that part of myself. I had also been accepted to the university in my area: wayne state. However, only 15 of my 86 earned credits transferred so I was to start over from square one. This made me extremely bitter, having gone from being in precalc to prealgerbra. I however persevered, what else can you really do? Anyway I was still with that unbelievable bitch until I started to get stressed with finals, and my tolerance for her bullshit rapidly started diminishing faster than I think she anticipated. Ultimately, it took a game of hockey to restore my masculinity and my sense of self worth. I told her I was sick of her shit, that I was sick of driving her places and that I didn't want to talk to her anymore. This I think caught her off guard. The next day she texted me telling me she was back with her ex out of state. I told her that I simply did not care, and this was the absolute truth. I felt liberated, but at a cost. I started  developing a deep resentment toward western woman. Even still today I have aspirations to be with a foreign woman, preferably from the middle east. All I've ever wanted was a simple life for myself: a government job which will allow me to assume my role as bread-winner, a virtuous, intelligent wife that adheres to traditional values, and a family to call my own. However, I'm starting to lose my belief that such a vision is obtainable. Most people would call me chauvinistic or sexist for such a vision. I feel like a relic of a by-gone era, born a century off. I feel very out-of-place in today's society. It is quite clear I do not belong in this era.To add to my sense of displacement; My academic achievements at Wayne however are a shadow of their former glory. I take my education very seriously, so not having a stellar GPA takes a toll on my self esteem. Finally we come to the infamous summer of 2015: the year my best friend died 15 minutes after I was on the phone with him. This was a catastrophic  loss, one that has seriously fucked me up mentally. I knew this person and talked to him every day for over half of my life. He was my closest and most dearest friend. He was the Grant to my Sherman, the Stonewall Jackson to my Robert E Lee. I'll never know the specifics of how he died, what I do know is he fell onto the subway tracks as a train was coming. He was screaming before he died. This is something so profoundly horrible. To think of your best friend screaming before he goes out. I had to drive out to New York recover his ashes and bring them home to his parents. Which was the single most fucked up thing I've ever had to do. Now has you can tell with this post, a lot of shit was already going wrong but this did break me emotionally. I to this day cannot feel emotions. In some ways I think it's a blessing. I was kind of tired of feeling at that point anyway. While I was in New York I did meet my current girlfriend, who does appear to love and care for me. I'm just...not capable anymore of reciprocating in the same way. I've become very detached emotionally. She's also a western woman, not really my type. I know I should love her and I want to, but I just...can't feel anything I guess. That's not to say I don't care about her, I do. Something isn't right though and I have no idea what it is. I also did get a job in computer repair which has been slightly fulfilling but I want more than to just fix people's broken shit, or teach rich idiots how to computer. This semester has been rough. I've taken calculus and discreet math, and it's looking like I'm going to flunk both classes despite my best efforts. I showed up everyday to class, got help went to office hours. but still am failing. my financial aid is likely going to be cut. This has been the ultimate insult to me, to prove to me that hard work and discipline simply aren't enough. My situation feels futile. I just wish to be a model citizen and serve the State, but I feel like they'd never accept me at this point. I have no purpose, no pride. I cannot go on like this, I would rather blow my head off, than live disgraced, a failure. I will not be "the family fuck up" I simply refuse to carry on that way. I do not want to live to see myself become a failure: 35 and still living at home. Which is why I'm seriously contemplating suicide. Living without pride and without purpose is no way to live. Yet despite all my hard work and perseverance, the world seems determined to make me a drag on the society I wish to serve. While I have no issue with those who receive State-aid. To me personally, this is simply unacceptable, as it brings into question my identity as a male. I would rather die a man than beg from scraps like a dog. My existence feels like a joke: a string of disappointments and setbacks. I feel as though I'm a disgrace to my family name, we are family of warriors. My grandfather was awarded the iron cross for bravery, and here I can't even pass calculus. It's equally as inconceivable to me as it is embarrassing that I can work as hard as I have been and still have nothing to show for it. My life started to fall apart in 2013, it's been four long miserable years that I've endured hoping that things would get better, they haven't. I feel like I could spare myself a few decades of soul-crushing defeats and disappointments if I can manage the courage to end it here and now. "Aus der traum"
