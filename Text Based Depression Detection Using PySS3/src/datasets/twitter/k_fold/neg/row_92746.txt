Where I find a small bit of hope.I am suicidal.  Think about it every day, 1000 times a day, suicidal, for years. I have planned it out, have the means to do so, and feel so wonderful thinking about it that I want to cry, it feels so good. 

For me, it has always been an uphill battle (I am 35) and it all has just gotten progressively harder. I am just tired of pushing on. It's always something and I am out of energy to play the game, anymore.  

A year ago, I went and saw a therapist/psychologist. An interesting thing came to light.  Something I had never heard of in this way, before.  She said she thought I had a little bit of OCD. I called bullshit.  Anxiety, depressession, yes.  But OCD?  Fuck no. I never obsess about my oven being on or my doors being locked.  I don't wash my hands a million times a day. I shut out this idea, it seemed so ridiculous.  "She isn't even hearing me at all", I thought to myself.

I'm an inquisitive person, though, so I researched this a bit further. And here it is: It seems that OCD can also display itself with obsessive thoughts. Some people think of their child getting hurt constantly (this is me; I hate this), which causes them massive amounts of anxiety (also me).  Some people think people that they are in a relationship with is unfaithful/untrustworthy constantly (not me, thank god).  Some people over-think things, and this is a symptom of OCD. It's called (in part) **"Intrusive Thinking"**.

Some people **obsess about suicide**. They can't help it.  They don't want to think that way but yet, they can't stop. These people, the ones who think of suicide constantly because of this negative thought pattern, need help **immediately**.  This constant thought pattern leads otherwise healthy people on a frighteningly detrimental path, one that DOES lead to suicide at a greater rate than say, thinking about your door being locked (classic OCD).

I think **a lot** of people are out of energy and don't want to "play the game" any longer.  I don't think this needs to lead to suicide, necessarily.  I think suicide is a defense mechanism of the brain, a way out of this thought pattern that won't stop. That's  why it feels so good to think about it. It's a way out. A real one.  

Ever since seeing my illness from that perspective, I have felt less inclined to kill myself. I say less inclined as in thinking of it only 20 times a day instead of 1000. On some days.  Not all.  But it's helping.  Now when I think of a suicidal thought, I try and replace it with a beautiful possibility, instead.  It doesn't matter that it's not one I see as attainable at this time...it matters that **I can still see** something beautiful happening, too, at least in my head.

And that's saving my life. 

**Edited to say: Replacing a negative thought with a positive one is an effective therapy for changing the pattern of intrusive thinking.  It seems to be helping me a bit.  More than anything else.  I feel for you, out there, if you are experiencing pain. Hopelessness is the darkest hole Ive ever been in.  

This gave me hope. Maybe it will give you some, too.
