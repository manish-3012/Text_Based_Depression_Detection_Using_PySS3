Have been suicidal half of my life thinking about finally giving inThis is going to be a poorly formatted rant so I apologize in advance...

Iâ€™m 16 turning 17 in may, I have mo friends and am lucky to get out of the house once a week, My depression gets so bad I often canâ€™t get out of bed. Iâ€™m three years behind in school and currently in a hospital program that includes delegated time to do school work, but Iâ€™m on the brink of getting kicked out of that because Iâ€™m struggling to attend. This program is really my last chance at help before iâ€™m on my own when it comes to school. And if I canâ€™t handle school with help in a fucking hospital setting how can I do it on my own? Im fucked.

I also have no Idea how the fuck to get in a relationship, and even if i were able to most people are cheating creeps and I couldnâ€™t handle being screwed over like that. In other words Iâ€™m a miserable lonely asshole who will have nothing to look back to.

Between not having friends never being in any sort of meaningful relationship and having fallen behind in school I really just want to give up. Iâ€™ve been miserable so long it really doesnâ€™t seem possible to ever be happy. Once more even if I managed to get my life together and pass high school, unlike most kids who donâ€™t know what they want to do in the future Iâ€™ve known for as long as I can remember i wanted to enlist in the military, but thanks to my mental illnesses that isnâ€™t possible. What the hell is the point in living when my prospects are so fucked even if i were to succeed? I never asked for any of this shit... I genuinely wish I didnâ€™t exist.

Life is a sick fucking joke.
