Iâ€™m really scaredIâ€™m so scared, I think about suicide all the time, every day. I wake up and my brain fantasises about it without me even controlling it. It is so fucked up. All I think about is death. Sometimes I think no one in the world wants to die as much as I do. But I just canâ€™t do that to my family. Iâ€™ve had 10 years of mental health problems and theyâ€™ve witnessed it all. Iâ€™ve had 3 psychotic episodes that were so disturbing and I donâ€™t k ow how Iâ€™ll ever live through with those memories. With anyone that has suffered from psychosis maybe you will know, itâ€™s such a strange phenomenon. And all I want is a kid, it was what always got me through, knowing one day hopefully Iâ€™ll be able to bare a child. Itâ€™s what has always got me through but lately my mental health has been so bad I wonder if Iâ€™ll ever be capable of being a mother. Iâ€™m turning 27 in February and Iâ€™m absolutely terrified. Iâ€™m still living at my families because of my mental health. I just feel like my entire life is over before itâ€™s even began because of all my struggles with me mind. I just want it to stop. I just want to be able to get up in the morning and actually want to be in this reality. Sleep is my only escape. I spent Christmas Day taking zopiclone just so I didnâ€™t feel the pain. Because life literally hurts these days, I feel pain in my head itâ€™s like the sadness has manifested psychically. I feel like Iâ€™m pleading for help now because as much as I want to die I still have this strong will to live. I would do anything to save someone from the point Iâ€™m at now, so why canâ€™t I save myself. I just wish I could speak to people about this all. I come on this subreddit a lot and hardly see any positivity that I hope for. If youâ€™re reading this please, give me any reason to live. Anything nice that makes you smile, any reasons you have. I feel so utterly alone in this. Any help whatsoever would mean the world to me. I want to stay alive
