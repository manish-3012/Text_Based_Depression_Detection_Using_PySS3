NothingIâ€™m starting to feel nothing. I want to die but thatâ€™s a constant thought now not just one that pops up here and there. I feel insane I donâ€™t feel emotion like I used to. I laugh and I find it funny that this is happening. Iâ€™m starting to just not care, I donâ€™t get affected by much anymore which I guess is a good thing but Iâ€™m also worried eventually all feelings will go and Iâ€™m not sure you can bring them back. Had anyone noticed this happening to them and stopped it? Donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™d love to feel less emotional I just donâ€™t want it to disappear completely. I donâ€™t value myself anymore. I donâ€™t care what happens to me or what I say, how I feel, what others say to me. Iâ€™m scared but Iâ€™m also not bothered itâ€™s so confusing and I know I need to sort it. I started planning my last day a week ago and I did everything for the last time, obviously Iâ€™m still here but Iâ€™ve started doing that more often and just switching off. Iâ€™m slipping and I donâ€™t think I can stop it on my own
