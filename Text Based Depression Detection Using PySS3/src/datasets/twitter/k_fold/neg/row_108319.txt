Just woke up from a failed attempt, someone that has gone through something similar to me want to maybe talk about it?Iâ€™m 16 and ever since I started high school my grades tanked really hard due to mental illness and Iâ€™ve found out my gpa isnâ€™t that great and Iâ€™ve failed classes. Iâ€™m going into junior year and everyone around me is doing amazing in school. I wasnâ€™t always bad at school but canâ€™t get out of the honor kid mindset that has grown on me since k-8 grade. Before this I couldnâ€™t see myself making it to graduation or even 17. Finding out all of this makes it feel even worse, and Iâ€™m wondering have any of you failed a bunch of classes and had a bad gpa but ended up alright in the end? Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m expecting to get into an Ivy League school or anything but Iâ€™m just trying to make it seem like Iâ€™m deserving/can achieve an average life where I can be happy with how Iâ€™m doing. If any of you turned out alright and have a story to share I think itâ€™d really help me out, if youâ€™ve made it this far thanks for reading it was kind of hefty haha.
