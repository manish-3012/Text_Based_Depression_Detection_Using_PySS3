Support and SuggestionsI'm not planning on ending my life right now but I want to. I'm trying to fight it and some days are easier than others. I understand that my thoughts are lying to me but it gets so hard sometimes to fight back. My sister and my friends would be devastated if I killed myself and that helps to keep me here, but I still want to die. 


I don't think I'll live to thirty (26 ATM) but I'm searching and trying to keep going. I want someone to rob the place where I work so I can sacrifice myself to stop them. Help me to keep going. I almost shot myself on Monday but I couldn't figure out how to get the gun to work. I called the hotline, made an emergency appointment with my therapist and I'm still here but I very nearly wasn't. 


Why don't I feel better? My life isn't even that bad but I want to end it. I want a woman but that seems selfish. I don't love myself so no one will love me. I get it, but I'm never going to fully love myself. I don't understand why people are so much happier than me even in shitty situations. I'm loved and cared for by my friends and family. Why do I still want to end this? 


I don't think I'll win in this fight, so I'd rather kill myself sooner rather than later so the people in my life can grieve and get over it and on with their lives. I'm going to lose this fight, I know it.


Can someone please talk to me? I don't like to tell these things to my sister because it makes her sad. Some help would be lovely. But I'm still here, at least today.
