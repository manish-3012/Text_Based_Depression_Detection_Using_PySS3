give me a reasonmight fuck around and kill myself before my birthday (16 days!). i tried ODing last year but obviously it didn't work, my family just got mad at me. im sick and tired of living with my own thoughts. i hate my life and not because it was bad but when you hate your brain and body its hard to enjoy the rest. i honestly see no point in being here anymore and at this point its better to burn out than to slowly fade away. it hurts me to be here and i dont look forward to anything anymore. change my mind?
