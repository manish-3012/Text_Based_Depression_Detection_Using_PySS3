How do you deal with someone who is of sound mind, completely rational, and has made a careful, well-informed decision to kill themselves?Seriously, I don't know how to deal with this guy.  His point makes sense.  He's convinced that the planet is overpopulated (I agree), and that we are caught in a number of terrible traps, financial, ecological, political, martial, and every human on the planet is adding to the burden.  When I suggested that he strive to lessen the burden, he complains that there's no way to survive without currency, and there's no way to earn currency without in some way taking more of the earth's resources than we give back.  He claims that unless we soon take some kind of drastic action to reduce the population, we're going to end up in a future of abject poverty and never-ending resource wars.  He doesn't want that on his conscience or to continue to do the damage he thinks he is doing.

I've never subscribed to the cataclysm and extinction theory myself, but it seems that he has a lot of evidence to back up his hypothesis, and I'm somewhat humbled by his philosophy of "earth first".  

Edit: martial, not "marital".  As in military, war, etc.
