The only person I cared about left meThe girl I loved with all my heart left me. I tried, I really did. But I fucked up, I can only think about all the mistakes I've done. All the stupid shit I told her... 

I've been drinking and smoking weed heavily lately. I've slept about 2 hours in the past 3 days. I'm exhausted, tired, and depressed.

I don't have much joy in life anymore, my whole life has been going downhill for about 3 years now, and it never goes up. I suffer everyday from just being alive. Yesterday I had suicide thoughts, and it's strange that it seemed like a solution. It would end all my problems, erase my pain and let me free... I don't think I'll do it though.

**Where do you find hapiness in life? How do I get over her? What's the first thing you think about when waking up that makes you happy?** 
I just want to wake up with a smile once.. just once.
