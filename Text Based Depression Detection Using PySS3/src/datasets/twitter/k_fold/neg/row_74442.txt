Itâ€™s gonna be over soonIâ€™ve had major depression for like half of my life. Ever since I was 9 Iâ€™ve been self harming and attempting suicide. I am currently failing out of college, my girlfriend broke up with me, and I can barely keep up with rent. I canâ€™t even get help because I donâ€™t have health insurance. I see a school appointed therapist because of my previous attempts but I can just tell sheâ€™s over my shit. Itâ€™s not a hard thing to see. Everybody around me thinks Iâ€™m a burden. Iâ€™ve been trying to replace my ex by sleeping around, just desperate for somebody to hold me and tell me they love me, even if itâ€™s a lie. Even just for the night. Iâ€™ve lost all motivation, I canâ€™t keep up with my classes. Iâ€™m gonna do it tonight. Iâ€™ve overdosed before and it was very peaceful, so Iâ€™m going to do it again. Iâ€™ve collected pills and last time I didnâ€™t take them all, but this time Iâ€™m gonna take every single one. If that doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™m gonna slit my wrist and if that doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™m gonna jump off the bridge next to my job after my shift. I just need this to end.. My mom is dying and we barely even have a relationship and my family all thinks Iâ€™m a failure and a disappointment. The worst part is that nobody else understands why I feel the way I do. And they donâ€™t care to understand. Iâ€™m alone. Forever. And thatâ€™s how Iâ€™m going to die. I wish my mom hadnâ€™t found me the last time I attempted suicide and I would be free. I would of missed out on 3 years of constant suffering. This is the only solution. Thereâ€™s no way out and this world is not meant for me. Iâ€™m too weak, vulnerable, naive. Iâ€™m like a lost and abused puppy that you just kick and hurt, but Iâ€™ll always come back with my tail wagging, hoping that this time Iâ€™ll do something right and somebody will love me how I love them. Nobody ever does, and I canâ€™t expect them to. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m rambling. I just needed to tell somebody that Iâ€™ve made up my mind because I wonâ€™t be able to tell my loved ones before I die. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna leave a note. I donâ€™t think anybody would even read it. Iâ€™m sorry.
