Got denied entry to local university, lost my job all beofre joon today. Been drinking for 2hrsI need some help. I havent told my wife but im sure she will be disappointed. Ive been a perpetual fuck up for years. I need to let her go and be happy. What now im so lost.

I actually thought my jrcollege grades were good enough. Im such a fucking idiot and failure. I need some good advice and soon. Thank you.

edit: my wife found me in the garage and called 911. it was a half-hearted attempt and they said id be ok. they said the alcohol is what put me out and not the CO. my wife is pretty shook up and i feel worse than i did before but for a different reason. she is usually pretty strong but this shook her badly and i cant do that again knowing how it would hurt her. im getting a saline drip for the alcohol i recommend it for anyone hungover =) ive had two councilers come by and a shrink. i really hate all this attention and exposure but whatever works i guess. they told me theyd have a poor nurse watching me sleep to make sure i didnt kill myself. =( this wasnt worth it. i need to reevaluate my life. thanks for the help guys.
