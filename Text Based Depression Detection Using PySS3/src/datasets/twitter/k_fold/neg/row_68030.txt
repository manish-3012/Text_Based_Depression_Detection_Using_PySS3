Almost ended it all yesterdayYesterday I came so close to ending my life, I drove over to the Golden Gate Bridge to see if I could finally end it all. Though on the weekends itâ€™s too busy and by the time I got there, there was no parking so I gave up and went back home after searching for an hour. I originally went to the bridge at the beginning of the year (on a weekday) thinking about ending it since my life has completely fallen apart in the past year (long story). But once I got there I had gotten scared at the last minute and hesitated. A bridge patrol officer found me on the bridge before I could decide if I would jump or not and I got taken to a hospital. Iâ€™ve spent the past few months in therapy which helped me somewhat with some of the things that happened to me.

My family on the other hand wasnâ€™t very understanding or supportive and made fun of me after I was hospitalized. My mom has always been abusive, mainly verbal/mental (and used to physically abuse me when I was a kid) and still continued to insult me for it after. She stopped for a little bit after I got home but then as soon as they thought I was â€œnormalâ€ again she goes right back to her usual self. I want to leave this town, Iâ€™m so unhappy here only I donâ€™t make enough from my retail job to be able to move out. I have a degree (animation) and owe 100k in student loans but while Iâ€™ve had a bunch of interviews still havenâ€™t landed a job yet. 

Posdibly might be landing a better one soon but am still waiting to hear back from a few places. The worst part is I feel burnt out on my major and am somewhat regretting it (but I owe so much). I wasnâ€™t 100% certain what I wanted to do after high school but I had been pressured by my parents to attend a media arts school since Iâ€™ve always been interested in that area. Though now Iâ€™m wishing I had gone into something else since the field is so competitive and Iâ€™m not feeling as passionate about it anymore unfortunately. The loans start next month and Iâ€™m completely screwed. Some of my friends found jobs within a month of two of graduating and I feel awful that I still havenâ€™t landed anything else. I have so many regrets from the past few years and I wish I could change everything. 

The therapist I was seeing I only had four sessions with before she left the company and wasnâ€™t super helpful. I donâ€™t feel she really knew how to help me or specialized in the areas I needed help with (she was assigned at random by Kaiser). Otherwise Iâ€™ve been mainly in support groups, which helped at first but isnâ€™t doing much for me now. 

Iâ€™m honestly just so tired of everything, my life is ruined and I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I was so disappointed yesterday that I couldnâ€™t end it. Though Iâ€™m feeling a little better today. I would just go back during the weekday and do it but Iâ€™m supposed to leave with my family for a vacation next weekend and I donâ€™t want to ruin their trip with my death before then. Might do it next month if nothing improves but Iâ€™ll what happens.
