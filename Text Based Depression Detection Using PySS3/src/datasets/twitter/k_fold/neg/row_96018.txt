Abusive home situation. May be fired from work for gross misconduct if they find out what I just did. LT illness using walking stick currently and getting sicker from stress. Want to just die.Using a throwaway.

I'm in my early twenties. Living with emotionally/psychologically/financially abusive mother. My brother has attacked me physically a few times. Saving for further study this academic year which will result in a career change, as I currently work for a charity (planning to give notice end of July). Suffering from depression, anxiety and possible PTSD, been taking an SSRI for 1 month now. Long-term chronic illness which often is invisible but recently have been getting more obvious physical effects from ongoing acute stress including shaking, brain fog and muscle weakness which is why I'm using a walking stick for distances and getting up/down stairs etc. (folding so work doesn't know - I just walk very slowly and conserve energy).

I did something so stupid. My family is trying to stop me saving up for my course, saying I can take on debt instead in a private high-interest loan and pay them my money instead. They blow through money at an insane rate. My (other) brother gave my mother $150 on Friday because she made him and by the evening she had less than $10 left to buy groceries. I don't know where it goes. She's blackmailing me to stay living at home instead of moving away and renting while I study so she can take payment from me.

I'm making applications to lots of grants and scholarships at the moment to try to afford my studies. I also started writing to well-known philanthropists after reading a news article about a drama student who raised funding for her course by writing to actors, politicians, etc. I got a list together using online research.

The stupid, stupid thing I did:
- I used the database of the charity I work for to check addresses of around 4 people whose names and addresses I'd found online
- I used the same database to look at philanthropists who had donated to the charity (large donations $$$$$) and wrote letters to some of these as well. I believe it was less than five.

I received an email that I've reread and understand was very kind from the wife of someone I wrote to this week, saying her husband sadly died last month but she would consider my request further when she knew the state of his affairs, and saying she assumed I was given his name by [charity]?' (naming the charity I work for, without saying how she thought I may have come across this information).

I am so stupid and now so scared. I wrote back profusely apologising and asking her please to consider my request retracted and saying I came across his name while searching for philanthropists in the United Kingdom. I believe this will be okay, hopefully.

My worry is that one of the other people I wrote to will alert my workplace and tell them what I did. I had no idea (somehow, stupidly) that what I did was data theft and gross misconduct. Now I see the stupidity of what I did and that if my work is alerted I will probably be fired.

I don't know what I was thinking and now the stress has been crippling. I can barely move and have been stuck laying down barely moving for over a day since I received the email. My mother does not know about this and thinks the stress is due to trying to save for my tuition. She told me she thinks since I am getting sicker I need a carer and can't live on my own but I will need to stay home and pay her rent and study part-time. This will take me six years, six years of more emotional abuse being called selfish and manipulative and lazy, having her force me to do chores standing up when I'm having trouble walking or standing without support due to chronic fatigue, gaslighting, blackmail, sudden explosions of temper, silent treatment, physical abuse and with no hope of moving out with no money to do it.

I'm terrified. I might be having an adrenal crisis which is something my doctors warned me about after recent medical testing. In no way excuses what I did but I am so scared of the repercussions I may now face: at work, to my reputation, the pay checks I needed for the next five months until I started my course full-time, what may be happening to my health, my family using this as their chance to keep me here and take my money again, thinking I will never get out.

I'm tempted just to let myself get sicker and collapse, possibly die. If I can make a mistake of this magnitude I am probably not suited for a good career where you need to be intelligent and logical. I don't deserve my job, my friends, my plan to study for a better future. My family has threatened me to stay home and pay rent to them or cut me off forever and never forgive me. I don't know what to do. I should keep my mouth shut and hope nothing will come of this but I just want to drop and sleep and never wake up.

**Update**

Went into work after the weekend and checked what I sent. Actually I only sent letters to two charity donors who can be found via Google and are in my local area. I'm an idiot. I think I had some kind of epic meltdown over the weekend and freaked out to the point where I could barely move. Getting better today - my boss did freak me out earlier by calling me into a meeting room downstairs with no warning, but turned out that was over some minor thing and all fine. Focusing now on my escape plan. Thank you everyone for your advice x
