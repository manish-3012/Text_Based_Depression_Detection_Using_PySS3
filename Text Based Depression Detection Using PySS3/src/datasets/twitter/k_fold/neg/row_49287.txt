Canâ€™t hold on much longerI feel like Iâ€™m about to break. Iâ€™ve held on for so many nights I didnâ€™t expect to make it through. It hurts so much that it feels like my heart will explode. About 6 months ago I was diagnosed with CPTSD. Itâ€™s been a lot of ups and downs. The past month has been the lowest Iâ€™ve felt and it feels like any progress I made has disappeared. 


I have a boyfriend of almost a year. He was the one keeping me strong. He got me help. He stayed up with me every night through horrible flashbacks and pain. He kept me looking at the future. But I had a panic attack which caused a fight a week ago. We have barely spoken since then. Iâ€™ve tried to stay strong all alone and take it one day at a time, but my strength is wearing out and I canâ€™t bother him with how I feel. I have friends but none that Iâ€™m close to anymore, none that I could talk to. Iâ€™m all alone and the waves of hurt I feel inside are so intense and I just canâ€™t see through it to know if it will ever get better because I canâ€™t take it anymore.
