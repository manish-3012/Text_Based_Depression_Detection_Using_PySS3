I always wind up back here...It seems like every few days I come back on here. Reading what others have to say makes me feel better somehow. 

I am going nowhere. I'll be doing phone support for ever. I don't have work experience to allow me to find another well paying job. I can't control my spending. I can't afford to live where I do, so I have to move (probably back in with my parents). The only time I'm remotely happy on the inside is when I smoke pot and play video games, and I don't want to have to do that every night. I try going out, but I feel alone with my thoughts even when surrounding myself in people. 

I lost the person I love, and it was all my fault. I ran off to chase a pretty face and when I came to my senses she was long gone. All of her friends hate me and she does too. To be honest, I do as well.

I'm sleeping with four different girls now and it feels like every night they come over out of pity. I don't know why I don't stop. I like the company they provide, I suppose. 

I've made plans, adjusted them, readjusted again and called them off more than a few times; it seems like every day I think about just leaving work and doing it. I'm going to set time delayed Facebook posts and scheduled text messages to ensure that people that I feel need to know will, and this will allow me to ensure that nobody I love finds me until hours after the fact. I am going to set the posts and texts and use an exit bag. I don't know when, but I have everything but the helium, which I can have in less than twenty minutes. 

I don't know why I think like this, but I can't stop. I know people love me, care about me, and want me alive, but I keep thinking about it all just the same. I guess that's it. Felt like I needed to get that out to someone, and without insurance I can't see a professional.
