I need some advice....QUESTION: Hello there. I was just looking for advice on how to get myself out of this entrapped feeling and hopeless mindset. . . It all started when I was 13. I broke the growth plate in my ankle while skateboarding, which led to my first Opiate prescription. I realized taking opiates relieved my anxiety, I became a smooth talker to girls at school, I had a fake sense of comfort even in the most uncomfortable situations because of opiates. I eventually moved from loratab to oxy cotton, then to heroin. I finally got clean at age 17 because I met a girl who changed my life. We were together for 3 years, and she was my foundation. I started suboxone therapy, counseling, etc. But then one day.. we fell apart. Ever since we broke up (six months ago) I lost all feeling of stability. Im still sober, but I just feel stuck and lost.. working a 9-5 job, no time for collage, I wont even leave my house anymore except for work because my anxiety and self consciousness came back. I feel s
o lost and lost all of my friends because I cut them off during the relationship... I am constantly depressed and am never satisfied. Im paying for my parents apartment due to their disability and I also stay with them.. my hobbies include guitar, music production, and video games. But now I don't even enjoy that. I can't ever sleep, and I don't ever follow through with goals I make... what can I do?
