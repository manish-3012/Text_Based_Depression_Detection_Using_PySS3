Irrational people, rational answerEveryone i know cannot seem to think, think meaning even put together 1 and 1 without throwing in their coefficient of bullshit. Ive tried to appeal to their thought process but I cant imagine stooping to that level. When people get the kicks from racism/sexism/general crude or mean behavior and can only relate to eachother thru figuratively circle jerking with no sense of moral thought flowing in their brain what is the point of trying. What is the point of living with people in this world who think their perspective is somehow pure and can be readily understood by any other irrational scum who can somehow manage to communicate to these people. What chance does one have to plead for sanity in a world of the insane. How can thse say they love life but spread so much hate distaste untrust and sickness. I cannot mesh with these anti-life worshipers any longer. 
Even now i dont hate these people. I dont blame them for their own blind wandering attempting to find meaning for themself, i sympathize but i cannot rationalize their thought process. Littering and shitting on the world with deaf ears that open only to hear their praise for one another.
