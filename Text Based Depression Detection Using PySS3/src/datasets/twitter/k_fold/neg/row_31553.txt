I am worthless I am worthless I am worthlessIâ€™m a worthless piece of shit I donâ€™t deserve to live I need to find a way out Iâ€™m going insane itâ€™s been so many years of hell and Iâ€™ve tried so hard to improve my situation but Iâ€™m tired and I just donâ€™t have a way out anymore

I always thought Iâ€™d buy a gun to commit suicide then I thought Iâ€™d buy a gun to protect myself but now itâ€™s back to suicide huh
