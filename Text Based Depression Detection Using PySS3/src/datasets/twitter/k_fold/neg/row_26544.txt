I'm on the verge of suicide after weeks of sleep deprivation and lack of meds and overwhelming life changes and being insulted by my therapist and a suicide number hotline. I'm planning to go to the pysch ward next week, I need some advice :(I'm at my worst state I've been in in years. I can't take care of myself because I'm addicted to my phone and don't sleep until 10am to 5pm, and the lack of sunlight is putting my body in shock. But lately I've been barely sleeping at all. I want to buy some books to bring with me to the pysch ward to keep me busy because I need to be nursed back to health in a safe environment that reinforces healthy body schedules like the hospital.

But my grandpa's funeral service is this Tuesday and burial on Wednesday. I want to pull through long enough to attend that and perform some music for that, and immediately after I'll turn myself in. My family doesn't like me going to the hospital and they're against doctors and shit and think I'm putting myself in trouble while they're the ones responsible for my major depression and post traumatic stress disorder and insomnia.

I want to buy some books off Amazon, one about origami so I can fold some origami, a fiction book that'll keep me happy, and maybe a self help book on depression or managing my emotions.

I also wanna write down a list of funny jokes from r/Jokes to bring with me because everytime I've been to the psych ward the nurses have good laughs with me cuz I'm pretty chill and humorous and not violent towards anyone.

And also keep a list of phone numbers of my friends that I can call, my best friends that still support me, in case I want to talk to them.

I'm worried my mom won't take good care of my dog even tho she feeds him (very rarely the dog will get out the house cuz of her negligence and I'm the one who always brings him back)  or that my parents will get angry at me for going to the hospital and they might try and stop me, need some advice on that :(
