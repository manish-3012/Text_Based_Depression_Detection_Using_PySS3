what do i dowhen i'm so apathetic to the point where "it doesn't really matter what i do now, i will be dying early to suicide" as my back up plan to anything? its hard to bring myself to do anything productive or even take care of myself. i have nothing real to be depressed about, i'm getting my life paid for me (food, electricity, internet, etc.). i think my body is disgusting and i have 5 cavities in my teeth right now, ive been gaining a lot of weight and everything feels very hopeless. i don't know how to even start to get help, turning to my SO doesn't help because he is someone who doesn't relate to emotions very well; he just tells me to get over it or you have nothing to be depressed about, you are being self centered and unappreciative

. i really just want to fall asleep one day and never wake up. everything i do is pointless and everything i harbor is my own problems that i don't know how to deal with anymore. i don't know how to even remotely start to get help. i feel helpless and alone. 

i just want to die
