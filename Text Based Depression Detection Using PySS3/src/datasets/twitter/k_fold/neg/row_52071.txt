I feel like I'm giving upI just can't do this anymore. I know how much pain my death would cause to my parents, my siblings, my grandparents, but I just can't take this anymore. I've read different suicide methods this morning and I'm not sure if I can stop myself anymore. I'm so lost. What to do? I fucking hate the way I feel, this constant sadness and anxiety. I've felt this way so long I don't even remember what true happiness feels like. What should I do?
