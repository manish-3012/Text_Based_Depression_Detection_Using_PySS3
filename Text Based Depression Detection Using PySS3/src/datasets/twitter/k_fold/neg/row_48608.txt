Staying alive for someone close to youSuicidal thoughts came back after a year of peace. Now only thought in my head is: what if my death results my little brother (when he will learn to speak) asking where I have been gone for so long. That really hits me, cause that little dude brings me joy every time I see him.

Can't even see the screen properly through my tears.
