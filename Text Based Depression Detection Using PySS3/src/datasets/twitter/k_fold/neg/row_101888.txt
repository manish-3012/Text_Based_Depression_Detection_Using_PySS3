I have nothing leftToday my best friend and I decided we werenâ€™t friends anymore. It has been my biggest fear. She was the person who understood me more than anyone else. Or so I thought.  The last thing she said to me before blocking me was that she has only stuck around for these past few years is because she thought I would kill myself if she didnâ€™t. What kind of person does that. Or says that. Iâ€™m not perfect by any means. I have adhd, sensitive, and have a short fuse. Thinking that she felt that way about me makes me want to fucking die. She was all I had left that was close to me and itâ€™s just crazy that for the past couple of years she wasnâ€™t genuine. I feel so small and invisible. I feel like I canâ€™t trust anyone. I feel like Iâ€™ll never be ok. I feel like Iâ€™ll never function normally. I feel like dying. I feel like feeling nothing. Iâ€™m never going to have people who truly like me. Iâ€™m never going to have a relationship. Iâ€™m never going to have kids. Itâ€™s just me and Iâ€™m ready to leave.
