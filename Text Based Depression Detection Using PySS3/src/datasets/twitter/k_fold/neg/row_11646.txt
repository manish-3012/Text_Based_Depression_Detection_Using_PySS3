Tired of life...I have nobody to talk to... i'm at school far away from my parents for the first time in my life and I am so lonely. When i was in highschool I could at least socialize with my parents, but now i'm completely alone... I never went out in highschool and was ok with that, but now I am in a dorm room without a roommate (hasn't shown up) and feel llike crap. Everyone seems to know somebody and is walking around with them or whatever... I just wish I could make friends, I get extremely nervous whenever I am around people and suck with icebreakers... Anyways, just wanted to rant for once.
