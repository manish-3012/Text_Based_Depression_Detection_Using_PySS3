Stop this â€œweâ€™re all in this togetherâ€ bullshit.Iâ€™m tired of all this nonsense of us being in this state of crisis together.  Letâ€™s be honest, no one gives a shit about you.  We treat each other like objects.  If youâ€™re not like fucking perfect, people abandon you.  Iâ€™m so over it.  Iâ€™m so over the world.
