there are a lot of things I must doThere are a lot of things I must do right away which I've been postponing for 5 months. I haven't met anybody except my family for 3 months. I just feel so sleepy and tired all day long I don't want do anything but sleep. I have no idea where i came from and where to go. I've cut my wrists many times but whenever i do, it fuckin hurts so i couldn't finish it. I just wanna die while sleeping. I've talked to a proffesional but nothing's changed. I feel like my heart is stopping and my brain is being rotten. I wish something that makes my heart flutter again happend but on the other hand I just want it all to stop and go away. I hate the fact that I'm wasting time doing nothing and that I wish too much from my life. I'm in the middle of nowhere. I'm not sure if I need some help. I'm so tired now but I can't sleep. My eyes are so dry and itch and red and hurt. I want to go back to the 80s because I didn't exist before i was born.
