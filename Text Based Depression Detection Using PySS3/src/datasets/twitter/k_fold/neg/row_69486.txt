Suicidal VolunteeringI have a question on what you guys recommend for a crazy volunteering experience that is extremely dangerous. I ask this because I do not want to continue with life at all but I guess I am one of the lucky ones that has friends and family and couldnâ€™t leave them thinking I killed myself. 
    I applied to Whitehats but it seems their not taking anybody and was looking for other suggestions. I donâ€™t want to go into detail why I donâ€™t want to be here I just want to end it without hurting anybody and actually helping people out. I was thinking of something out in the middle east or working on something extremely toxic. Anyways I know itâ€™s probably not the best thought process but people need volunteers in ridiculous excursions and why not have someone help who doesnâ€™t value his life anymore helping.
