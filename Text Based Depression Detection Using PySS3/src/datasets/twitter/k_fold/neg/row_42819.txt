nothing will ever make me feel satisfied with myselfi keep pushing people away because i know they're better off without me in their lives 

i'm finally alone, made people's lives better by leaving and STILL, i just feel selfish and empty and i just want to fucking leave the earth

i just don't want to wake up again
