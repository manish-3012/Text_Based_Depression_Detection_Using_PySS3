Existential crisis leading to suicidal thoughts.I've been suffering from an existential crisis since the age of ten. From an early age I've been searching for answers. As an eighteen year old these feelings are something I cannot escape from even today I'm constantly searching for and seeking answers to my questions. Does life really have purpose value or meaning? what I am doing? where am I going? is this it? Because of my NEVER ending existential crisis, I've been suffering from bouts of depression since I was 10. Which leads to severe suicidal thoughts. I don't understand life. If we're gonna die, if we have to construct our own worlds and lives, and if we're ultimately alone, then what's purpose does life have? I don't like life. I don't understand why I'm alive. I won't be the one to find the cure to cancer, I won't be the one to world hunger or poverty. I won't do anything worthy of remembrance. I am just a waste of space on Earth. I've never been loved before, and I know I am not worthy of love. I don't know how to love. I don't have a emotional connection with anybody in life. I don't know what to do I just don't want to live in this world any longer.


Sorry if this is all over the place that's just how my brain works.
