liesI've been lying to a lot of people about really trivial things, not because it makes me look any better or anything like that, but because I get a kick out of it. And it's been eating me alive recently, but I can't stop, I love lying to other people about anything.

I can't live when all I am doing is lying to others about what I had for breakfast or what time I woke up... my life is based on falsification and grandeur. 

I don't deserve life and I think I should take it
