I need help with caring for someone suicidal.Hi. I have a younger brother whose been having suicidal thoughts, but havent told anyone yet. The reason I know of this was because I just peered through his phone and found disturbing texts stating that "it would be better if he wasnt alive." Another reason why I am thinking he is suicidal is because his behavior has been very reckless this past few weeks. I want to help him, but he is not willing to say anything about it. What should I do?
