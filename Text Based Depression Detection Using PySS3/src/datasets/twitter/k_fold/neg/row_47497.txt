I'm done with this.I can't survive anymore. I'm stressed out, I live with my fucking parents, and I'm almost certain my SO likes his pet more than me. I have no friends, I'm in debt, and I have to help pay bills using money from both of my jobs, which leaves me barely enough to get gas for the month. I just wish I could die already so I don't have to worry about anything anymore. This fucking sucks. I just can't do this anymore.
