I just don't know why.So before I start this I need to say this I'm not that depressed or suicidal but this still relates to suicide.


So about 2 weeks ago I decided to look at this sub because I was bored and just wanted to look a things like this.


Let's fast forward too now and I don't know why but I keep feeling drawn bad to this sub without an intention to help because I suck a motivational advice so I keep coming back here just to read people's struggles just because I enjoy doing it...........I'm not a tearable person I do care but I don't understand how I possibly get enjoyment out of reading any of these.............. anyone else do this........I don't want to be alone here........


Oh also life is great


Don't give up
