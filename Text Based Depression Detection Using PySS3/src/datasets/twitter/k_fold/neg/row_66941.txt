I don't think I can take much moreMy depression has been spiralling. My physical health has fucked up my body and my life. Even though it has been improving, I've completely lost myself in the process. I am a shell of the person I used to be and I just don't want to keep going.
I was completely detached from emotion for a while. I had a tough therapy session today and am now filled with despair and sadness.
Up to now, knowing I had a suicide plan was enough to calm me down. Now I feel like I need to implement it. I just cannot keep going.
