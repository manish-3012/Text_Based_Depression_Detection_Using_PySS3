HelpHi, 

Iâ€™m Bill, Iâ€™m in my 30â€™s and from London, England - Iâ€™m reaching out for help today.

Iâ€™ve been suffering with depression since I was 11 years old - I was born cross eyed and kids used to tease me all the time. My brothers were normal so they fitted in well in school, I had it rough and got in fights all the time. Iâ€™m also dislexic so was in the bottom classes.

As I got older I matured into a fairly good looking man, I had corrective surgery for my eyes, and dived into music and the music industry working alongside some of the worlds biggest celebs and record labels. I was honored and humbled.

Later on in life, Iâ€™m happily married and work as an artist now. I have more money than I need and should be the luckiest guy in the world.

Yet I donâ€™t feel lucky. Iâ€™m lonely. The abuse, the fighting, the bad memories from childhood remains. 

I wake up everyday wanting to put a gun to my head. Iâ€™m not quite suicidal, I would never leave my wife that way I hope. Iâ€™m simply unafraid of death after having nearly died of a heart attack last year. Itâ€™s like being close to death made me realize how much I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.

Iâ€™ve always managed depression by hiding it and getting on with things. Unfortunately, I seem to be spiraling.

Perhaps we can share coping mechanisms, any advice is welcome.

Thanks,

Bill
