I donâ€™t wanna live another day?Yeah, uhm, thatâ€™s how i feel. I hate how every day i fall asleep just to feel the exact same as yesterday. I know it canâ€™t be magically solved but i just wish i could fall asleep and wake up a new person. i just want to escape the horrible home iâ€™m in. and i canâ€™t move out because iâ€™m 13 and to even have a chance of moving out iâ€™ll have to be 18 and thatâ€™s 5 years away.

i also cut myself fucking deep yesterday and i didnâ€™t realise you had to tape it up so it would heal so iâ€™ve been bleeding on my pants. (the cut and me are fine physically tho) 

if anyone could just talk to me for a bit or leave a comment that would be cool
