I honestly just feel really hopeless. I don't think I will actually do it, but sometimes I feel like it would be easier.I am a junior chemsitry major, and honestly I feel like I have just wasted my life. I'm getting out of college soon, and my future feels bleak. I have done absolutely no research or internships. I am trying to apply for internships right now, but honestly I'm not getting anywhere because of my lack of recommendations. I feel like once I leave college that it will just go downhill from here. I am also limited to the area I am living in because my mother has breast cancer, and I can't leave her. Everything just feels so awful right now. I don't think I could actually go through with it because of my family, but that doesn't mean that I do not think about it.
