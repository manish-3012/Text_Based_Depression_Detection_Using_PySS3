just lost an old long time friend to suicidei'm all torn up. i realize this community largely supports those struggling with suicidal thoughts. ive had those too, and now, the way i feel losing this person, makes me feel so guilty for ever having considered it for myself. i can't go 15 min without crying. i'm in shock and i wish i could have reached out more. i was thinking of him in dec, and i didn't reach out. why didn't i? i havent seen him in so long because i moved away and shit changes when you're approaching 30 but like i didn't feel distant from him in my mind and now i just have massive regrets for never really telling him how much i respected and admired him.
i keep wishing that all this was just a test and that there is still time to step in.
fuck. i cant stop crying.
