I feel uselessThere are 7.125 billion people in the world. I've always thought I was someone special and that the world was built around me (keep in mind I'm only 15 now so it's not like I'm a very narcissistic 30 year old I'm just a kid who wanted to be special). Now I have realized that I'm not good at anything, I won't do anything good for the world. I'm not some deep thinker I'm just a dumb kid. I won't be sucsessful when I grow up I won't be remembered, the chances of that are VERY slim. I'm just mediocre at the best. I hate myself, I'm just a stereotype that think's I'm not. I have no reason to live. I haven't tried to kill myself, but these thoughts have been lingering for a while. I want to, but I don't want to hurt my family. I feel like I won't help the world and I don't like the world. It's full of idiots, and I'm just an idiot who thinks I'm different. Anyway thanks for letting me vent.
