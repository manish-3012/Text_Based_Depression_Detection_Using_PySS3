I feel like a Burden.Hi, My name is Ray i am 33 years old. The last 4 years of my life have been a very big roller coaster. Long story short, You could say i gained everything i ever wanted and then in the blink of an eye i lost it all due to my lifelong fight with depression and anxiety, Things would be going good in life and then i would find ways to mentally sabotage myself by making problems when their shouldn't be any or worrying about things when i shouldn't. it drove my gf of 13 years to fall out of love with me and pretty much think i am a Lunatic. fast forward to today I have no friends who really care to talk too me, everyone is off doing their own lives i cant blame them for that but it still sucks and i am living back at my parents house and cant even hold down a job because i somehow clash with everyone now, by that i mean slowly somehow people just tend to hate me. I don't know what to do i just keep using drugs to numb my mind (i dab ALL DAY) and i don't really know what to do. I constantly think about killing myself more and more and nights alone just keep getting harder and harder to make it until sleep hits me.

Killing myself actually isnt that bad of an idea its just the carrying out the action i seem to not be brave enough maybe if i think about it more i will build the courage. Why cant they have volunteer suicide centers as long as we donate all our organs or something it doesn't seem like that bad of a trade off a place i can go and just go to sleep forever
