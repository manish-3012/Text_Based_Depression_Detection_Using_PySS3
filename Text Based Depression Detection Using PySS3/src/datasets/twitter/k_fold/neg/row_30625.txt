I have to kill myself today because of the rules.So my wife again said she doesn't love me and wants a divorce, but is "Stuck with me", and doesn't want me to touch her.

I am going to be alone, hell I am alone, and I have no friends, just my work and nothing else.

That means I will be a useless person with no relationship and no friends who must immediately kill myself because of the rules that say I would be a loser and therefore have to die.

I don't want to die, but I am obligated by the rules.
