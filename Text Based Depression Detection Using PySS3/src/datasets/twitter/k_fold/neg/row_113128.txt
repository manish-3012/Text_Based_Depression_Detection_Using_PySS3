Not sure if I am okayDisclaimer: I don't think I want to kill myself.

I'm tired of struggling to force myself to do the most mundane of tasks, I'm tired of going to sleep feeling as if I have nothing the next day to look forward to. I'm tired of convincing myself that I can make myself better, that if I journal, get lots of sleep, study hard, and exercise, things will pick up. I'm tired of convincing myself every day that if I smoke a little weed or take just a tiny sip of vodka I will feel better and be able to relax and function like a normal productive member of society. I'm tired of feeling as if nothing I do is enough. I'm tired of feeling guilty whenever I try to relax because there is always something I can be doing to improve my chances of getting a job. And the list goes on. I'm just so so tired. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
