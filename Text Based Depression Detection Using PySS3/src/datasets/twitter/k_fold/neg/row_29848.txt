Life is just too hardI'm struggling, My family treats me like shit, I'm in serious debt, my now ex boyfriend told me the world then left me because he wanted to be alone, my "husband" who I've been separated with he ran away and I have to pay for a divorce and try to find him to get the paperwork to go through, I have a painful skin issue that makes it painful to walk and doctors don't know what it is, my car's transmission blew up and I don't even have the money for it so my only escape is gone, I got raped not too long ago and strangled. Lastly my best friend abandoned me and refuses to talk to me for no reason. I feel so alone I just want the pain to fucking stop.
