Suicidal thoughts again.These thoughts are so strong that I feel unable to speak and move my body. I know I don't want to kill myself because I found the love of my life and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. I just hate everything about life. Every little thing.  I am 22 i attempted university 2 times but I was too depressed and to stupid to finish it so now I am stuck with shitty warehouse jobs for the rest of my life. I remember every single minor inconvenience of my life and I can't stop thinking about all of them. Starting from remembering these 3 boys that were molesting me and sexually abused when I was 6-7. I have been feeling constantly lonely and isolated since I was 13. I could go on and on but I hate my english so I never open up here. I did it because I feel extra suicidal today. Fuck Corona fuck my job fuck all people fuck life fuck everything
