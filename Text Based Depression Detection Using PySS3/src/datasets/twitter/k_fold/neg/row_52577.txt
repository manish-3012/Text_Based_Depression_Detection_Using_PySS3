As Hemingway went, so shall IIt's so easy. All I need to do is get a gun permit, purchase a shotgun, and shoot myself off the bridge.

In this dark, northern winter I've decided to let the last leaf fall off rather than turn a new leaf.

I've met nothing but disappointment in my life. I know that pleasures are only transient and illusory as silence is the only permanent truth in the cosmos. All waves in the ocean eventually recede and return to calmness. So too do we return to the dust that had composed us.

I've realized that the grass isn't actually greener on the other side, because I've been to those other sides. I lived in a foreign country for almost a year and found that the "greener" grass was only an illusion. Relationships, careers too, have ended in this similar fashion of satoric realization.

I'd consider myself a Hemingway type. Intensely intellectual to a fault. I've worn myself out of the shallow pleasures of life and all I feel now is dullness. But soon no longer will I have to feel anything.

edit: shotgun*, not handgun
