Do you wish something from next life?I have already given up. I am also waiting for my death( funny right?) I have made a clock that tells me how many days I have left to die. I am already 20 now and if approx I live 75 I have 55 yrs left. So that's around 20k days left. There are little things I want to accomplish before I die but if I can't then hope next life would be sweeter.

I want to live minimalist life

I want to have good desk setup

I want to have less health problems and live healthy for once

(Silly I know)

What about you guys? Is there anything you lost hope this time and waiting for next life that can't be fixed this time?
