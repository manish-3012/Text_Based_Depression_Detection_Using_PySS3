Suicidal Loneliness I'm so hopelessly lonely and it never ever stops. There's only one person that I know, and she doesn't care much for me. No one has touched me in years, and not like that, I mean hug or kiss or even a reassuring glance would suffice but no. I can't stand it anymore, no one loves me, no one has ever said they loved me, I can't deal with it anymore. Help me please God... My hands are shaking so much right now and there's a rope to my left and a knife to my right and I just want to go... As painfully as I can... I don't want to, please...
