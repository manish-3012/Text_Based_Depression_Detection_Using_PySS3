Just want some supportI'm in the middle of a very rough week.  I have severe chronic depression and equally severe anxiety.  A few things happened between me, my partner, and my friends (all separate incidents).  Even though its been resolved, I went back to self harm, something I havent done in years and I'm now slipping back into a pit of suicidal thoughts I'm afraid I'll act on.  Normally, I can move past these thoughts, but this is the worst I've been and I don't trust myself anymore.  I don't have a plan, but I'm considering it.  I just want encouragement from someone I don't know because I'm afraid of messing it up with the people I care about.
