suicidal elderly parentI am concerned that my mother at 72 is suicidal after my fathers death.   She has talked about killing herself but cannot because of no suicide clause in will.  I  have contacted her psychiatrist, and her pastor at her church and  her neighbors to inform them of this.   What else can do.
