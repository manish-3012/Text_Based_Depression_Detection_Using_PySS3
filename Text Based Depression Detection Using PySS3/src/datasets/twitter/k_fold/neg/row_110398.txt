Just a bad dayI'm just having a terrible week here and wanted to talk to some nice people.  My relationship is in trouble, I have no job, no bright future and nobody to talk to.  

Honestly the most hurtful thing is my relationship.  I feel like it's being torn apart by my girlfriend's parents.  We are still young (early twenties) and have very different tracks in life (she goes to a top university while I am a community college student).  Her parents concern is that I will drag their daughter down and they might be right.  We've been dating for two years and I always promised her that I would do something great with my life.  I wanted to be a firefighter and now I want to be a microbiologist.  The problem is that she doesn't see me trying.  And I can agree with her that I haven't been doing that well.  So I don't blame her.  I feel like everything is futile in my life, like nothing matters.  I want to get my shit together, I want to be able to succeed.  But I feel like I can't.  Most of all I'm tired.  I'm tired of trying so fucking hard in a world where nothing matters.

I guess I'm just not as in-tune to our society as everyone else.  I don't need the newest/hottest clothes, I don't need a mansion with servants or a nice shiny sports car.  What I feel like I need is someone who loves me.  I want to help others and do my part to make this world of ours a beautiful place to live in.  I want to be a good husband, son, father, friend and brother.  When did all those desires disappear from the world?  When did we go from "be a good person" to "fuck everyone else I'm out to get mine"?  

I guess I just don't know what I want or where I fit in, thanks for listening.
