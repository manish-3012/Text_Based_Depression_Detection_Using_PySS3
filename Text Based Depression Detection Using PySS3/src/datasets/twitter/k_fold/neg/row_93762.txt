I feel like the end of my life is closer then I thought even just yesterdayOkay, here's a little context. I am a 15 year old guy, I live in British Columbia, I was hit by a car when I was a baby which might explain all my mental issues. For a while I've been thinking about dropping out, today j finally told my parents. I left my moms house tonight after she told me she will force me to stay in school and she thought she does nothing wrong even though she knows she makes me suicidal. I went to my dads, he told me the same about not allowing me and they both think all drop outs will lead a shitty life, and minimum wage jobs. Because you ask, I'm dropping out because not only will i probably kill myself if I have to live with them longer then I have to (I'm moving out in August if I live that long), but also school stresses me out and I feel like because I'm gonna be a photographer it won't be very important if I don't finish school. I'll be moving in with my girlfriend when I move out. Anyways, point is, my parents make me wanna kill myself and I cannot legally move out without patently concent until my birthday (April 3rd)
