suicide by heroin overdose?what would be a lethal amount of heroin for somebody with no tolerance? iâ€™m 5â€™3 102 lbs for reference. iâ€™ve been suicidal since i was 13 iâ€™m 19 now and physically cannot take it anymore. from everything iâ€™ve researched it seems like an opiate overdose is the most painless way to commit suicide. i canâ€™t buy a gun since iâ€™m not 21 yet
