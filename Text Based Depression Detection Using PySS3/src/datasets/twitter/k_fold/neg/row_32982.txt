Suicide feels so comforting.Nothing has ever compared to its comfort. I've always known I would kill myself. I always said its not a matter of if but when.  
I float closer everyday.  
I can always touch it.  
I don't want to self harm anymore.  
I just want to be done.  
Perfect melody of biology and environment.  
Its all crafted this creature that holds the reigns and rules like a tyrant.  
Its consumes my mind and soul.  
Too many acronyms, too many memories and nothing to lose.
