Who would care?Iâ€™m a college student who is expecting a child with my fiancÃ©e in February. Iâ€™ve had to get three jobs in total and Iâ€™ve put them before my last two classes. Iâ€™m failing both and have asked for help in the math class and havenâ€™t received anything other than â€œsucks to suckâ€. I explained my situation but is doesnâ€™t matter. I was betting on graduating and getting a job before my son is born but thatâ€™s not looking likely. It doesnâ€™t help that my fiancÃ©e doesnâ€™t really seem to love me. Iâ€™m just the father and provider the days of being best friends seems to be long over. 

Iâ€™m so sick of seeing my school boast itâ€™s networking and helping other students and alumni but I canâ€™t get a little help with a class I will never use. I canâ€™t wait to write my suicide letter and decline any mention of the fact that I attended that hell hole. Iâ€™d like to wait until after Christmas that way my family can enjoy one last holiday with me but my in-laws would find out by then that I didnâ€™t graduate and would give me hell. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so stressed everyday Iâ€™m developing mouth ulcers. I canâ€™t wait to be done. I plan on shooting myself with a shotgun of trying to kill mused on campus, that way they canâ€™t ignore my cry for help.
