Iâ€™m sick of dealing with life.Iâ€™m 14, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ptsd when I was 7 due to trauma related to my dad. He lost custody of me when I was 10, and I am feeling some form of regret for not having him in my life. He had his bad moments, but he is not even a tiny bit close to how my mom treats me. During the divorce I remember him telling me that when Iâ€™m older iâ€™ll see how much of a monster my mom is, and at the time I brushed it off because my mom forced me into thinking he was some psychotic monster. I now see what he was talking about. I am emotionally and verbally abused day by day. Constantly guilt tripped. I need out of here, and Iâ€™ve had worsening suicidal thoughts since I was 10.5. Iâ€™m writing this in the same room as my mom, trying to hold back tears but I am so close to ending it. I have no other family memebers to go to. No grandparents, family friends, or even my friends I can go to. Iâ€™ve called CPS and they never did any form of wellness check. I canâ€™t go to therapy. Iâ€™m planning on ending it soon. It sounds dramatic, but I really canâ€™t wait another 3-4 years. Iâ€™m scared of my mom. Iâ€™m scared of continuing to live.
