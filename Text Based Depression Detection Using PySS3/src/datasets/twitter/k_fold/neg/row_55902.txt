I just donâ€™t see the point.I just donâ€™t see the point of doing anything anymore. I try to be happy and help people but all I get is anger in return. I donâ€™t lie to people but thatâ€™s all they want to say comes out of my mouth. People say they will be there for me but hang up when I call them for help. My family hates me, I have no friends. Iâ€™m not able to see my daughter. Iâ€™ve barely been able to get out of bed. My anxiety is so bad I canâ€™t even open a letter or get a text without having an attack. Iâ€™ve worked my ass off for the past year and a half getting and keeping myself clean and getting myself stable. The thing is no one sees it, no one cares. I just feel like Iâ€™m better off dead then the miserable life I have.
