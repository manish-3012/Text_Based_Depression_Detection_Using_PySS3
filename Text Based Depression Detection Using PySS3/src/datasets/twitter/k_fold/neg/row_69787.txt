I fucked up and it seems to not matter how hard I tryI misread a situation with the love of my life. This has been ongoing for a while now and no matter what I try it seems to have no effect. I'd rather not add to her problems but I'd rather sell all of my things and pass them off to my friends. I'm getting close to the point where I dont give a fuck. I love her with all my heart and soul. However if I cant be in this world without her in my life, I'd rather give it all away. Fuck this world, fuck my family and fuck everything in existence. This may be my last words i Express but the pain of being away from her hurts more than this world should ever give. To all that read this i pray you never feel this level of pain i hope you all find happiness through the darkness. Do not fear for me, nor pity. Live your lives with strength and I pray you all are far stronger than I ever have been through my life. Call me weak if you must but if you have never experienced depression on this level then shut your fucking mouth and I will join you in hell!
