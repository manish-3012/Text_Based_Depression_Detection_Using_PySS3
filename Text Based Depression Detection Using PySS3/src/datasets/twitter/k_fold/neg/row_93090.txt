I regret waking up in the morning every single damn day. I don't think I'm ready, willing, or able to live anymore.Life is and always will be horrible. Its unjustly imposed upon you just so you can suffer. It's like I'm in hell already.

I wish I was never born. I was never going to amount to anything anyway. It would've been easier if I never existed because then I wouldn't have to deal with finding an easy way to kill myself. 

I probably have potential for at least decent things but I will be honest with myself. I will never tap into that potential as long as I live. I'm too weak minded to change. The thought of living another 60 year sickens me. I'd rather die right now. I wish someone would just come murder me or something. It would be less of a shock to the people closer to me. They wouldn't have to deal with the shock of finding my dead body right after I kill myself.

Getting hit by lightning would be a cool way to die too. Too bad that won't happen. I'll probably die in some pathetic way like hanging myself or jumping off a bridge.
