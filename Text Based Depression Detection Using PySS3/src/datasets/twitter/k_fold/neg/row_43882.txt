I'm Selfish and you are tooI'm sure most of us have had the talk. About wanting to die or/and depression and whatnot. And almost everyone will say how selfish we would be to hurt everyone around us. How "just going to therapy" is going to help. Its just the chemical imbalance.

 No one ever just listens to the things I'm trying to say, to my attempt at trying to trust people again. I just want a hug or some crap without the guilt tripping or hand waving or shaming. "You are not alone!" I hate that saying so much. Its meaningless to me to know that yes this is a mental illness people can have. How is telling a person with a broken arm that there are others like them going to help? Do I know any of them? No, so? Oh geez the poor sods, thats just horrible.

There's nothing here worth suffering through. Everyone will hurt you, you will be disappointed. More power to  you if you're wiling to put up with this shit and live for the crumbs of happiness like a beggar. I don't care. I'm a selfish asshole after all/

So you know what? Maybe I do want to hurt everyone and anyone. Then maybe I wont be alone anymore in feeling like this.
