What Would It Take To Make You Want To Stay? (realistically, something realistic that could happen)Iâ€™m having a really hard time answering this question and I wanted to see if anyone else has a good answer. 

There has to be something worth living for, right...? There are billions of people. Why do they willingly stay alive? They go through hard times, lose people, have terrible families, struggle with money, just like everyone else. Why do they keep going everyday? 

What would it take for you to keep going everyday?
