Need quick assistance.I'm very concerned about a friend. His mother committed suicide over 5 years ago and he's talking about killing himself. He's agreed to come meet me, which is a good sign, I hope. 

I can't be with him 24x7 and I can't watch him. I can listen to him, but I'm not equipped to deal with more than that. He doesn't have any family.

I'm going to make sure he has the NSP number in his pocket. I'm going to remind him about his friends and the people that love him. 

I'm frantically going through the talking tips and risk assessment guide (and just offered to go meet him instead of having him come here).

What else can I do? 

edit: for risk assessment, do I press to see if he has a plan?
