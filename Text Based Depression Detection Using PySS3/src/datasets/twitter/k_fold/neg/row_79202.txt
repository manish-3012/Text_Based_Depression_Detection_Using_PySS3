This is the first time I've seriously injured myself...I picked up a razor I kept in my desk drawer and after I got a huge depressive episode I began to cut my leg 4 times. The anger and sadness I had when making the first cut has split my skin open and it began to bleed. A lot. I'm glad I didn't decide to cut my wrists because a cut this deep would kill me. My poor cat was meow'ing for food in the background while I was trying to stop the bleeding, locked in the bathroom and streesed that my family would come home soon.

I'm such a dissapointment to everyone. I feel the worst. I want to die, but I'm so scared of dying. I don't know what to do anymore. I know that I'm gonna throw away that razor. I'm scared. I'm shattered.
