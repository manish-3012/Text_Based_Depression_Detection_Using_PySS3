Its myself I cant standNever did I sympathize with the bad guy before I turned into one. Waking up and realizing the only way to go is down. Not understanding the longevity of consequences. My own actions are so miserable, why would I allow them to continue? If I can control anything at all, I'd like to control if I exist, because i sure as hell can't control my actions. 

I've pushed every single person away from my life enough so killing myself will not upset them as much as just be a blip to them. Like another top ten from buzzfeed I'll just be a 5 minutes of fame on facebook or something. Doubt it. But I'll finally be done with this. Wrote my letter, wrote all my info and left my EBT card with pin to any person who finds it. If anyone around LA needs food, I'll let you know where I left it in hopes someone reads my letters. 

Goodluck everyone. I truly hope better paths in all of your futures. Bye bye.
