The Train keeps rollin'I'm currently saving for a suicide trip. Feels weird to say, but I should be able to do it by the end of semester. I plan on taking a train from where I live in Orange County, CA to Pheonix, AZ where I'll eat at my friends soul food restaurant for the last time. Then I'll head to New Orleans and just walk around. After that I'll head towards my hometown in NorthWest Kansas to die. 

You may ask what has lead to this thought out decision. Well, all I've ever wanted was a home and family, but that seems more and more out of reach as my life goes on. I'm currently 22 and going to school for Env. Sci. I have an impossible time with self loathing and generally don't care about the damage I'll do to my current family when I die. I don't think I've ever felt love and I never will.
