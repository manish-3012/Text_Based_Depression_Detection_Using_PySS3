I don't knowI don't really know if this will help. Nothing seems to.  I've been struggling with my mental health since high school and it only seems to be getting worse, even ten years later. I'm taking my meds, I'm doing therapy and I'm trying so hard to make steps in order to improve my life but just when I feel like I have made way in some area my mood shifts and I'm barely functional.

I'm so tired of waking up day after day and feeling like shit. I hurt deep within my soul and no one seems to get that. I just want it to be over so bad, but if I fuck it up then everyone knows and I've got to keep living while trying to fix another one of my endless mistakes. I feel like I'm drowning. 

I honestly don't know why people love me.
