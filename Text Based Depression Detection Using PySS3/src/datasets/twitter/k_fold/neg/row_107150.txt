Any Tips on How to Stop Thinking About Suicide?I can't stop thinking about it. It always resurfaces even when I'm doing ok. I'm on anti-depressants by the way. They were prescribed to help alleviate the symptoms of ocd.

When I find myself alone, a thought pops into my head that maybe I should do it now. A huge factor that stops me is that I'm deathly afraid of blood. That and my dogs. I feel like they're the only ones who really cares about me. I have a feeling that they'll go looking for me if I vanish 'coz dogs don't or poorly understand death.

When Hasan Minhaj said that (Asian) parents give conditional love, he wasn't kidding y'all. And right now, I just feel like a huge disappointment and a gigantic waste of resources. My parents gave up a lot to let me experience things that they weren't fortunate enough to have, and now they wanna reap the fruit of what they've sown. And I don't blame them. I'm pretty disappointed in myself too.

I'm in my 20s and live in an Asian country. I'm also a grad. school student who's currently on a leave of absence because I'm not really sure about how to work on my thesis. To be honest, I believe that I suck at writing papers in general. Not even sure how I made it all the way to thesis writing haha.

I've already lost 2 jobs this year and I really want to keep the one I have right now. Really doing my best to be productive. Guess I'm still adjusting 'coz I haven't had a steady job in a few years. I only did project-based work when I began taking MA, but before grad. school I had a full time job. When I decided to take a leave from school, that's when I decided to work full time again.

It has been a bumpy ride since I began looking for a job again. It took me months to land a job, then I got terminated after roughly 3 months due to poor performance. Same thing with the 2nd. But the 1st job was just a shitty company. I found out from an ex co-worker that another writer was also fired a month after she began due to downsizing, then that co-worker herself got fired after several 'coz of "lackluster performance". That girl was our top performer! She only fell behind because the stupid boss expected her to accomplish the work meant for 4 people. 1 resigned and they fired the rest of us so she was the only 1 left. Naturally, her workload became heavier.

My parents tell me that I matter more than awards and that I shouldn't burn myself out by trying to be spectacular, but actions speak louder than words. Of course, I know that they just want the best for me but, dude, it can be soul crushing sometimes.

In a way, our achievements are also the achievement of our parents but I don't want to be reduced to a fucking trophy. Sometimes I feel like they want me to fulfill what they themselves wanted to do. They weren't able to do it because they sacrificed for my sake, and now they expect me to fulfill their dreams for them.
