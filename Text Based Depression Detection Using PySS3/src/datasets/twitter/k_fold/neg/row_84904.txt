I'm sitting on my bed with a gun next to meSo I just found out that my dad is most likely gonna be dead before the week is over and when I went to see him in the hospital he told me he loved me for the first time in years and apologized for all the shit he's done to me and then I find out he's gonna die and now I'm on my old bed kinda drunk and have a gun next to me I'm not sure where this is gonna end up but I really want to put it to my head and pull the trigger
