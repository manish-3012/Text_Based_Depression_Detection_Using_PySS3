ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘Well girlfriend stopped me from trying to "cut" it's pretty fucking annoying of her to go and do that to me but I forgave her...? You want to know the reason why..? Of course well I live with an abusive drunken aunty as both of my parents left as they said I was a accident which mentally messed with my brain and over time staying with my aunty started to give me depression and the crave to hurt anything I could find (not gf) so I wanted to try cutting myself as an experiment and she stopped me which I nearly retaliated but I get used to bottling up my anger. So that was a big oof I'm gonna try it tomorrow without her knowing. Wish me luck guys.
