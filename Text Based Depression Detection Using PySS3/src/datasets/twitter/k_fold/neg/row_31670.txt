This is my second depression,I've lost all hopeThe first time I was depressed, I thought I could overcome it, I took my meds, I exercised, I made friends, I went back to uni. I even found myself a boyfriend... It worked. I was so happy, "everyone was right I got better"

Now I have those things, but I'm more depressed than ever. It hasn't anything to do with all those things. If your brain is fucked up, it is fucked up you can't do anything about it.

So I'm depressed again, but it's really heavy this time, because I don't even have hope anymore.

What's the point? Getting better to get worse each time.. No thanks.

I feel ready to kill myself this time. I don't know when exactly, I have a few ideas as to why but I haven't decided, but I will do it
