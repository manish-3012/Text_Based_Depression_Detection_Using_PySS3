HelpI donâ€™t know why everyone at school hates me. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrong. I just wanna be more than a nobody and people just treat me like shit. They call me ugly and unathletic. Itâ€™s because theyâ€™re right. Iâ€™m ugly and short and not muscular enough. I feel like I donâ€™t wanna live anymore. I have barely any friends and people think Iâ€™m a joke

Everyone says it will get better but will it? People donâ€™t change and everyone there hates me and would be better off without me.
