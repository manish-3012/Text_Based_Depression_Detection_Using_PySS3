just going to put this out there...I don't what's wrong with me lately. I don't know if it's been the months that I've been away from my close friends or the realization that I'm always the odd man out. I feel like everyone near to me has a connection with someone-- is able to relate to someone. I can't even muster small talk to someone because I find myself in a depersonalized role. I analyze everything and don't even know how to be "myself" (whatever that means). I just want a connection-- to know what that feels like.

I don't think I'm suicidal, but I find myself begging for someone to just give me a heart attack, or hoping that the plane I'm on will crash down and incinerate me. These thoughts are always interrupted with the knowledge that I'd break my parents' hearts if I did do something. The idea of treatment or seeing a therapist is nice, but considering I'm in school and don't have the cash / financial resources to do so makes it almost impossible. Furthermore, I'm a medical student and don't have the time to even think about these sort of things unless it's my break. I know the damn side effects of taking these drugs too, and it only pushes me away.

I don't know what to do.
