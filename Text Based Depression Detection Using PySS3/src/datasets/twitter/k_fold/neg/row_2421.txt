On a dark path, need some wordsIâ€™ve been depressed for as long as I can remember and feeling suicidal lately. Tonight I took a huge potentially fatal dose of opiates, not with suicide intent but certainly a fuck it attitude.

My family is limited to parents and a very distant brother, they are totally dysfunctional and have a very cold sort of love for me. I had parents growing up not â€œlovingâ€ parents. I donâ€™t have the same happy / supportive net that many do here, so in many ways this makes me feel lonely.

Friends, this is where I really struggle, I have a few close friends and a wide network of â€œfriendsâ€. Nobody to really hang out with and comfortably talk about problems though. Itâ€™s been this way my whole life. I get incredible anxiety and crushing loneliness on the weekends when I spend whole days alone because nobody bothers with me despite my extraordinary efforts.

Relationships, I had a very very intense one and felt happy for a brief period. I opened up to her like a book and she walked out on me crying on the floor of our empty house after the last of the stuff had been gone. She left to â€œgo work on herselfâ€ and is now taking cocaine multiple days a week and hooking up with strangers. I havenâ€™t seen her since. I havenâ€™t met anyone else since, had the emotional energy to go on a date or, rather pathetically, managed to even muster the confidence to hook up with anyone.

Iâ€™ve been on a path of â€œthings will get better if you work hard on yourselfâ€ for YEARS now. Iâ€™ve put my blood and soul into hobbies, gym, socialising, work. Where am I? The lowest mentally Iâ€™ve ever been. I moved city to try a fresh start, the same. At the end of the day the commonality is always ME. Maybe itâ€™s my appearance, body language, something about me that just makes me â€œmehâ€ to other people, some sort of background noise. Maybe my brain is dysfunctional and wasnâ€™t meant to be happy, constantly overthinking and overanalysing. 

I used to be depressed but buoyed by bursts of hope driven life enthusiasm, now I feel so disillusioned that I dismiss the hope and every day feels like a chore. I think I will probably end up killing myself in the near future.
