I don't want to die, but I don't want to liveI don't want to wake up another day knowing he'll never know I exist. I am worthy of being loved, exactly how I am, but no one ever will. I'm too tired of existing like this. I've done everything right. There's nothing wrong with me; it's my situation. But no one will intervene and help me. Meds, therapy, electroshock, being handcuffed in a psych ward... that isn't what I need. I need a support system. I need family. I am worth knowing. 

No one will bother. He'll never know I lived or that I'm dead. That makes me sad, but I can't change it. 

Even the suicide hotline chat kicked me off after 90 minutes in line. So fuck it. I didn't think I had the courage to do this, but now I think I do.
