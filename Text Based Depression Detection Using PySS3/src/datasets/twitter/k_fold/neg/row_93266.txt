gcse mocks in a week and i want to kill myselfi have my gcse mocks next week and i donâ€™t know what to fucking do. i have not revised at all and iâ€™ve looked through all of the content and i literally donâ€™t understand a thing. ive gone through past paper questions and i donâ€™t understand anything. iâ€™m terrified of getting a low mark because if gcses are cancelled then my grade will be based on that, and thereâ€™s a chance i wonâ€™t be able to go to my sixth form. furthermore itâ€™s going to disappoint my family so much and my teachers are going to be mad at me. i really want to kill myself because that means my problems will be solved and i wonâ€™t have to worry about exams. but i still want to live because i know if i died my family and friends would be devastated (maybe). but still i cant bare this stress of the exams and itâ€™s making me want to die so bad. i have no motivation or energy to revise, and i donâ€™t even know where to start to revise. please someone help me i donâ€™t know what to do.
