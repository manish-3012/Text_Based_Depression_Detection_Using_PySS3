i feel like a monsterSo I have POCD. I hope. I really hope itâ€™s OCD. Either that or I really am just a monster. I also have Autism. Today I saw a video saying if you watch teacher student p0rn youâ€™re a p. I have watched it a few times as I have a crush on my teacher and felt I could kind of live the fantasy that way. I just ignored the girls because they were always infantilised and it was really weird. Iâ€™m still in school so I assured myself I wasnâ€™t included. But it just hit me in the wrong place. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it and iâ€™ve been ruminating on my life before this. Choices iâ€™ve made, things iâ€™ve said. What if I am just a horrible person and deserve to die? I wanted to get married. I wanted to have kids. I wanted to grow old with a husband. But I donâ€™t deserve this. Iâ€™m too messed up and I donâ€™t deserve the life Iâ€™ve been given. My family loves me and I never understood why. Iâ€™m horrible. Iâ€™ve done some disgusting things and Iâ€™m not worth the love they give me. I wanted to live a good life so so bad but Iâ€™m not worth the effort. I just wanted to be loved by someone who I loved too. But I donâ€™t love anyone. I feel empty. And this POCD is eating away at me. Again, I do hope itâ€™s just POCD. But sometimes it gets so confusing I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on. What if the people who do love me love a monster. I canâ€™t do that to them. They deserve to love a good person. Not me. All I can think about is self destructing and thatâ€™s all thatâ€™s in my head. I donâ€™t want to live anymore in any way shape or form. If Iâ€™m a monster, then killing my self will keep everyone safe from me. If Iâ€™m not, well at least I made sure. It just seems like a win/win to me
