I hate people my ageThereâ€™s a girl in my year

I donâ€™t talk to her much

I donâ€™t know much about her

Some days sheâ€™ll be bragging about how good her life is and how she gets everything she wants

But every week she said sheâ€™s odâ€™

And she mightâ€™ve

But I donâ€™t believe her

Because itâ€™s the same story whenever I ask her what happened

And itâ€™s always randomly

And then when I ask more specific questions she ignores me

I feel bad
Because if she did actually odâ€™ Iâ€™m not believing her
And that might hurt her

But idk how to feel about it
