Nothing hurts more than hope being taken awayYesterday I felt good for the first time in almost a year. I was energetic, enjoying things, excited, dare I say even happy. I looked at myself in the mirror and felt almost willing to share a picture of myself with friends for the first time. I went to bed early, excited to wake up the next day (this hasn't happened in... a long time). Four hours later I find myself awake and unable to sleep. A sense of unease starts to creep in. I go online to whine about it because that's all I ever do. It's 4:00 AM so not many people are up. I see my ex. Just that is enough to further tank my mood. I start living out conversations in my head, imagining things, getting angry. I know there's no way I'll be able to sleep now.

I realize that I'm probably going to have to quit a website with a group of people I really like who seem to actually like me for once all because of that cunt. I've already lost so many friends because of her. I just recently reconnected with one of my closest friends and then lost that because of her. I'm running out of social spaces.

I managed not to be suicidal for a week, not to cry or imagine suicide for two. Now I have to reset once again. I'm tired of feeling this way. I want to live yesterday. I just have to make it through my appointments next week and then I can go to the hospital.
