Not everyone can get what they wantYou can't be follow you're dreams because if everyone did that who would work in the retail stores and who would work the dead end 9-5 you can try to chase you're dreams but you'll fail and just have wasted you're time and have no other career path.

Not everyone is ment to be happy its just how shit works I feel like I'm a side character that's not even part of the main story because hey they gotta flesh out the world somehow for the special people to thrive. 

I love drawing and doing art but I'm not so delusional to think I can somehow make it and become well off by doing something I love because thats not how it works sure there are success stories of it happening but what about the 99% that failed. 

I need money so I can get 2 hours of relief just doing a hobbie that makes me happy fuck my life and fuck the world. I just want to die in not ment to be here I rather just a object or something maybe a mug mugs are cool I think I give off pretty good mug energy.
