Animal Poison? OTC drugs?Hi everyone,

I have a friend who is considering suicide and they want to purchase animal poison. Is this a real way someone can kill themselves? They don't have access to any prescription drugs either (I think). I know they have access to OTC drugs and alcohol. Is there a real chance they can kill themself this way?
