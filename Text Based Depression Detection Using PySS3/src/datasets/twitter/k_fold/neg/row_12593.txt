Should I End It?Basically I've never been good at anything other than school in prep, No one likes me everyone just treats me like the pos I am, I have no social skills, I cant play footy for the life of me, I've spent 100's of hours in video games struggling to get 1 kill in gold rank on rainbow 6 s and the last thing that comes to mind is I have half decent grades in school + I'm tall lanky and ugly being 15 never having dated a girl let alone barely spoke to any. I need advice on how I should end my life and what the quickest and least painful ways are (my family will be happy as I'm a type 1 diabetic and just generally make their life difficult).
