I wish my past attempts workedI donâ€™t wanna be here, I just constantly feel like w burden and Iâ€™m horrible to my friends. I just want to leave, why did my past attempts fail? I wouldnâ€™t be burdening people if I died, Iâ€™d be better off dead then my family wouldnâ€™t have to slowly watch me fail and not be successful. At least then there last memories of me would be of me succeeding and not being a leech. I want to cut contact with my friends so they wonâ€™t have to put up with me anymore, because I know Iâ€™m a burden, I know I am. Itâ€™d be good to make them hate me first so I could leave with them hating me. At least then they wouldnâ€™t grieve as much. I just want to put a blade to my throat, push down and end it all
