I've been alone all along.I've always had suicidal thoughts off and on but it's been worse for months. I don't know what happiness is anymore. I don't know how to live anymore. My anxiety has only gotten worse. I dropped out of high school as a senior a few months ago so I don't talk to anyone from school. I was already losing friends since junior year. I don't have the strength to open up to any family members because we don't really have close relationships. People who've said they were there to talk to ended up not wanting to hear it or didn't know how to help. Some people just left. I have big trust issues. My own best friend left me. I have a job which is the only thing I have going for me but it isn't enough to want to keep living. It's getting harder to pick myself up. I can never fall asleep at night and I end up crying. I'm tired. I'm so tired. I just want to give up.
