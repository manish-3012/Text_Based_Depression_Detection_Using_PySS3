Feels like I have no escapeI barely have any friends. In major debt, working at a minimum wage job for the last 5 years. I have no motivation to change my life. I will be 25 in May. Car breaking down. I feel lost, directionless. College didn't work out.

I don't feel like I belong in this world because I don't fit in with crowds. I'm an outcast
