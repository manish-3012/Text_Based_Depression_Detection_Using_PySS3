I understand if this gets removedThe other day I saw the view outside the campus window. It was night and I thought I could just run out there and vanish from everyone's lives. I know I'm a bother. My stupid life has fucked me up and I try to so hard to be better and fucking grow up, but every time nothing fucking happens. I though about different ways I could kill myself. Alcohol, basing my head against the wall. I think about it so much. Everyday I fantasize about dying because it's so much easier. It would solve so many problems, too. I don't know how to try anymore. I don't know if it's the isolation again, but I just see no future. I see no future for my worthless self. I feel like I'm just going to suck my parents dry and waste away like the pathetic shit I am.

I don't enjoy living. I don't enjoy being happy. I don't enjoy anything. I don't think I'll ever enjoy anything again. Nothing ever feels good. I feel no pride. All I ever want to do is die and be forgotten. I want my body to be lost under the wheels of a train. I want to die with no funeral. I want my body to be thrown away and never thought about again.

I think I've had an episode in every school bathroom for each school I've attended. You can also add my brother's house to that list. I don't want people to like me. Maybe I do. I don't know. I don't know which part of me to trust anymore. I never learned how to be a person. But I want to learn. God damn it I want to learn how to be a person. I don't want to do good things so people will think in good. I want to do those things because I'm a decent fucking person.

I want to be good. I want to be good so fucking bad. I just want to be good. Please tell me I can be good.
