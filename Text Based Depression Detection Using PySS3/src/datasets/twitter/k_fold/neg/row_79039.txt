Career Alternatives to SuicideHey guys. 
In a desperate attempt to fight off my suicidal thoughts, I thought maybe there is a job that could provide me with the opportunity to maybe put my worthless life to use. Something that would allow me to disappear from my current life and start over. I know it sounds pretentious, but is there an organization or something that would require a person to lead behind their old life? That's the only thing I think I could do better than anyone. Any ideas?
Thank you
