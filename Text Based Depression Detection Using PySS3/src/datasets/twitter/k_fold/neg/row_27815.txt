Thinking about buying a gun and blowing my brains out in the middle of townIts' all fucked. The bills, loan debt, and rent are piling up, and I can't find work that pays enough to live. I've given up on every dream I ever had. All I feel is range and grief all day, everyday. The screaming inside my mind will never cease. I'm too tired to keep pretending. I'm alone. No girlfriend, no family.  Just a few friends who live a hundred plus miles away, and strangers on the internet. No opportunity for change. I can't sleep without alcohol anymore. Haunted by the horrors I've seen, lived through. Don't know whether I hate myself or the world that made me more. I cry in the shower with a knife everyday. I scream and hit the walls. Everyone around knows I'm insane. I drive to bridge once a week. Thinking about buying a gun and blowing my brains out in the middle of town. I want everyone to see. The world that turned its back on me should see. Things aren't going to get better, I don't have it in me to fight the uphill battle anymore, alone, against the odds. The game is rigged and I'm sick of playing. I wish thee was a way to fight back, but there's not. There's no coming back from where I am at. Please I don't want to hear about how I'm strong and going to make it, or how you care when you don't even know me. None of it is going to make the pain stop, or make me any better able to handle it. I'm a bad person, and few people will shed any tears when I'm gone. Fuck it.
