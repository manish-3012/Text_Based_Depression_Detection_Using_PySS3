Iâ€™m a horrible human beingI have been feeling bad lately From all my past mistakes. Let me start from the beginning.  My mother never tells me she loves me I am 18 at this point meet a girl and sneak her into my room on my parents house. They find out they are not mad idk why I sneak her in maybe cause Iâ€™m disconnected with my family.  Girl become girlfriend she becomes pregnant. Life is good become dad really good dad mother cheats on me I try to work it out she agrees. She continues to talk to guy that she cheat on with me he wants to talk to me.  We end up fist fighting, I win gf is mad we break up.  I still continue to be dad meet new girl life is good.  New girl gets pregnant I am good partner to her but she says I ruin all important days with her and life is a battle with me.  Still do the dad thing have 2 kids 2 Motherâ€™s but still there to them.  Me and gf fight and battle everyday I am an asshole to her not purposely but I am.  She ends up leaving me she gets pregnant month later with other dude.  Decide to stop seeing kids.  Chain date but no love until I find another:  we go out second date she is my gf and I ask her to move in.  She does but leaves a month later comes back again after 3 months.  Happy again still not seeing kids but happy.  Me and current gf together but life has been a battle.  I think sheâ€™s leaving soon I am insecure all the time she doesnâ€™t love me like she used to.  Sick and depressed about life donâ€™t  want to lose gf she is my everything.  Feel like this is the end but donâ€™t want to let go.  Insecure so much I think sheâ€™s cheating on me.  A lot more details in all this but just need to vent.  Love gf so much but she doesnâ€™t seem to love me back.
