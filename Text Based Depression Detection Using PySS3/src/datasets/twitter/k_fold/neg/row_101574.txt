just came back from the ER, trying it again nowI slit my wrists a few hours ago, someone (probably my boyfriend) called the police and they took me to the hospital. I took 4mg of Xanax and slit my wrist. wasn't enough. I didn't want to go home because my mom just keeps shouting at me if I talk about suicide, so I went to my bf's place at 5am. I wanted to see someone I love. He called the police on me for trespassing (WTFFFFFF). So Im home again. Took 4 Xanax, a few naproxen, a few antidepressants, Im not done yet but I will smoke a joint first. My wrist hurts as shit and there is nothing left to live for. 

sorry, I really wanted to tell someone
