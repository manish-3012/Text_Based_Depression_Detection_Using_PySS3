Most likely killing myself today.I'm sitting here crying as I write this....

I am 15, and my father has been emotionally abusing me for my entire life.

He bought a Ferrari, and cares more about it than his own family (me and my mom)

My mom doesn't think I know, but were running out of money because my dad refuses to go to work, and he even went to Florida today to see his friends.

He bought a expensive Mercedes next, and has been throwing money at that aswell...

He took all my money, and while I can still see it in the bank account, its now under his name, not mine, and I've been seeing the savings account go down...

I currently have 3 dollars to my name, and I don't know what more to do.

Most Likely killing myself today.

Throwaway account because... I don't know, I barley care anymore...
