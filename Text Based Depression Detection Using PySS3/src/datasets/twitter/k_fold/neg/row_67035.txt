Is it "Stronger" to kill yourself or stay alive?I mean really, I think about it, I don't want to say it, but on one hand I've been told that it is better to stay alive and persevere through life. But on the other hand, blowing your brains out and ending it. It just seems like no matter what you think happens to you after you die, your going there RIGHT NOW. and you have to accept what happens. so what?
