I'm unneededI'm tired of feeling like such a twat / social exile. I go to school where i have one friend who i actually care about (this is fine). I tell him everything, my issues, my hopes, my fears, my depression (which he has helped deeply with), etc... However he never seems to tell me anything about his life and when im at home he never texts me or anything and i just sit there by myself and the depression just gets worse (i'm gay btw which has contributed greatly to this), i just feel like he should talk to me as i worry for his mental state as well (i know at most he's having family issues similar to me). I just want to help and maybe make myself feel more wanted / needed at the same time.
