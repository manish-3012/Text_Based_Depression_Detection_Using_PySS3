Itâ€™s my birthday but I want to die.First off, my situation just makes no sense to me. 

I have a lot of close connections with people who will support me and have proven so, so itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m alone. Ever since Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with Dysthymia, my family have been making more effort to connect with me. For example, a sibling of mine keeps in touch with me more and my parents have stopped arguing everyday (at least in front of me). 

I do have a lot of stress from college because I feel like Iâ€™m not doing well enough. I kept procrastinating even though I make an effort to start early because I know that somehow, I am afraid, although I know itâ€™s necessary to do my work. I would get panicked near deadlines and that has helped me not backlogged but lately itâ€™s like I seem to care less and less to the point that I just donâ€™t feel the desperation anymore. I am backlogged because of that, yes. 

The past two weeks Iâ€™ve gotten sick again (to keep it simple, for 1-2 years Iâ€™ve been getting sick every 2-3 months with a lot of infections like laryngitis, tonsillitis and bronchitis to name a few.  At the end of last year I got tonsillectomy done and I was fine for half a year until I got sick again. My lungs donâ€™t like me recently it seems. I donâ€™t smoke or drink alcohol or anything, just a weaker immune system I suppose.) and during that time I stopped taking Valdoxan since it clashed with the antibiotics I was taking for my infection, as the alternative I was allergic to. So of course me being sick, slowed me down even more and Iâ€™m more backlogged.

Basically, I have no idea why although itâ€™s my birthday and I will be going for a birthday dinner with my sibling later, and my parents and friends will be seeing me this weekend, I feel absolutely shut down and miserable. I feel like either overdosing on something or just walking to a highway and hope a collision kills me on spot because at least, people who care about me would think I tried my best to live instead of seeing me waste away on a hospital bed because I have no will anymore. 

I feel very utterly hopeless, useless and full of guilt because I do not understand why eventhough my life generally seems fine. At this point I feel like a burden to everyone as usual because they canâ€™t help me when I canâ€™t even help myself. 

To reiterate, itâ€™s my birthday and I want to die because I feel like I have no reason to feel this way when life seems good. I hate myself for feeling this way illogically. I am a burden at this point. 

Many times I wish I was one of the miscarried babies of my mother, because Iâ€™m sure my other siblings wouldâ€™ve lived their life much better than me.

If youâ€™ve read this far, thank you.
