I'm sick of being too scared to dieThe only reason I'm still alive right now is because I'm too scared to die. Honestly. I talked to my therapist about it and she first tried to guilt me out of it by asking me how everybody would miss me (which I hate because guilt will only keep me going for so long) and THEN immediately followed it up by saying suicide is selfish. My family refuses to let me exist as my own person, I'm suffering from severe anxiety and depression (I'm taking prozac AND xanax for it), my girlfriend is drifting apart from me, I've been rejected from my graduate programs and now I can't even find a job to have during my gap year because of the pandemic. I'm in constant pain, I have no support from anybody, and I know that I want it to stop. 

And that's where my problem lies. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I'd rather be dead than alive but no matter how close I come I'm always reminded that I have no idea what comes after death, and the only thing that scares me more than feeling the way I do now for the rest of my life is me jumping off a building and there being nothing afterwards. I just want the pain to stop. Please. I just want it to stop
