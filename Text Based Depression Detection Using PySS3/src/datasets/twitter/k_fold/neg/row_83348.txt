Asking for advice18 male and recently broke up with my girlfriend, we were dating for almost 2 years. Too some it might seem crazy how I can feel this way, but I really dont know what to do anymore.

It was going well before a couple of days,when she said she was lying about loving me like I did her. She said that she can't be with someone like me anymore, she said the she wants to be the others as well. Well I do sure understand that to some degree, I was shooked that she did not tell me earlier.

I do not wanna do anything anymore, Im feeling suicidal and hopeless of anything, I cant forget all the times we had fun and had an amazing time,and now its nothing anymore.

Does anyone have any advice how to stray away from these feelings and thoughts?
