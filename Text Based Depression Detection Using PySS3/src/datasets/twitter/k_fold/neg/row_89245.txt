I'm trying to make a suicide noteAmong thousands of other things, I'm really awful at writing. I want to leave something that truly explains to my family and friends why I've decided to kill myself.
I want to record myself because that would be the easiest for me, but I cant find a voice memo app on my Galaxy S8 and it seems the ones available in the app store arent very good? Does anyone have suggestions on a good way to record my voice?
