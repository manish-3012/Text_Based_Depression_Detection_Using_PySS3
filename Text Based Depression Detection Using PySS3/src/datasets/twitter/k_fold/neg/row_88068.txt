I can't fight it anymore.I'm 21, with two boys and life is too much for me. I feel like I'm coming to a point of no return. I can't breathe here anymore, I don't eat, I can't sleep and when I do sleep I have nightmares. I just want to fucking die already. Maybe I should run out into traffic. My mom hates me. We fight and she belittles me, she even choked me which triggered one of the worst bouts of depression I have ever had. I don't know what to do anymore and it terrifies me. No one understands. No one notices. I keep trying to hang myself but I don't want my sons to see. I'm not a good person. I don't deserve to be a mom. I try hard to be happy but I don't feel anything other than the suffocating depression I have. I'm tempted to do bodily harm again, cutting or burning just to ease the pain. I feel like such a failure. No one will miss me if I leave tonight. My boys will be better off, I love them but I'm not worthy enough. I'm just some cancerous disease that brings misfortune. I hate myself more than anything. I have a boyfriend who loves me but I don't feel like I deserve him. I hate myself and I don't know how to live anymore.
