I just swallowed a lot of medication what should I do?  I regret it ooooh I regret it. Itâ€™s not going to kill me I can already tell. I canâ€™t tell my dad this will be the 5 suicide attempt this year he will be pissed.  Can I puke it up? Itâ€™s fast acting medication I have 3â€ minutes until I have tremors and canâ€™t speak like last time. Until Iâ€™m extremely emotional and cry for like 8 hours straight. I canâ€™t I canâ€™t this was my last chance before residential. This isnâ€™t good
