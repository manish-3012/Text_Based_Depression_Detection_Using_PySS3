I'm out of feelingsJust self-harmed for the first time in a few months. I got nothing out of it. No physical pain, no shame, no regret, no pride, literally nothing. It affected me about as much as drinking a glass of water or looking out the window, that being not at all. Nothing elicits any feeling from me anymore.
