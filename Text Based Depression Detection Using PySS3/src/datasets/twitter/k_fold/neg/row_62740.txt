i don't want to live anymorei am 15 and from Sweden, i have been suicidal since about when i was 11 and one of the only things that have kept me alive is my two younger siblings. I am a divorce child and my mom was dealing with ptsd after the divorce witch made my life a living because i couldn't ask her for help because she wasn't present psychologically. My youngest brother is four and is my half brother by my father's wife, the problem is that my real mother hate him and his father and when i found that out (a couple of months ago) i was thrown back into my suicide thoughts. I have been coping with thees thoughts by some times smoking marijuana but my family recently found out and i now have to go to a ''social worker'' but i don't think that this will help. I am about to start going to ''gymnasium'' witch is about the same thing as highschool i think, not completely sure, but the thing is that i hate school and i don't believe that i will make it out alive. This isn't a fake cry for help because i already have four plans, hanging myself, jumping, getting hit by a truck or buss by purpose or blowing my brains out with one of my dad's shotguns (they are in a weapon locker but i know where the key is hidden). Help i don't want to die right now but want som advice on how to move/go on with my life.
