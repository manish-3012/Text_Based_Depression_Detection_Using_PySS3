Today he told me she's pregnant.....My husband who walked out me almost 3 months ago decided today would be a good day to tell me the side chick is pregnant. 2 months pregnant. Never mind that I have been trying to get pregnant for the last 5 years and lost 2 babies. He got her pregnant less than a month after leaving. How much is one person suppose to take? How much? When is enough enough?
