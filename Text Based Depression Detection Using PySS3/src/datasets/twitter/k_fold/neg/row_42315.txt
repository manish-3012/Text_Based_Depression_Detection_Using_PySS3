I suffer from Chronic Bad Breath and it's makes me suicidalHad this shit for 4 years now on last year of high school. YES I fucking floss,scrape my tongue,brush my teeth, and mouthwash 3 TIMES a day.  Been to doctors and dentists and they all say I don't, yet still get comments from people that my breath smells.... Can't speak to people without them stepping back or looking the other way. At this point I haven't found a cure for my chronic bad breath spent thousands of dollars on gum,mouthwashes,etc. Grades/Attendance plummeted due to severe depression and social anxiety, don't see the point of living anymore if I can't even talk to people without offending them.
