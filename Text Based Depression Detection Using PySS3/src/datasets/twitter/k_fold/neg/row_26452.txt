tonight was rough.i wrote all my suicide notes tonight. i couldnâ€™t just leave one. i had too much to say to a few people. in total i wrote 19 letters. some for family, some for friends, and a few for people who just knew me or knew of me, i guess just a generalized note. i thought about attempting tonight but decided that i wanted to get some sleep and think on it just a little more. but if anyone is reading this and thinking of attempting please donâ€™t. you are so valuable and loved. i know i am too but i cant stop myself from what i know iâ€™ll do. iâ€™ve tried all the help thatâ€™s available and none of it has worked so i guess this is just my last resort. i really hope i donâ€™t go through with it but i will. but iâ€™ve written my notes. if they are found, good, if they are never needed even better. but thatâ€™s all for tonight.

edit was a spellcheck
