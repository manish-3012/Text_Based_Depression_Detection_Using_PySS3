HOW DO I HELP MY SUICIDAL FRIEND EXTREMELY URGENT!!!I have tried almost everything I can think of. They have been depressed for a while and I've supported them, but they lost their girlfriend who broke up with him and grandfather who died within the same week. He made an attempt today this being the third one and I'm on vacation right now so I cant hang with him.

He isnt one of those typical depressed looking for attention people either, like he is actually a really amazing guy and great friend, but he just has some stuff both chemically and in the real world to deal with.

TL;DR how do I help my suicidal friend
