EndgameItâ€™s apt that they are calling the second infinity was film Endgame, because that is the part of life I am in now. I told myself 5 years ago that I would refuse to fully commit until I had seen the last Avengers film. It didnâ€™t stop me then, and now Iâ€™m at my worst itâ€™s getting harder and harder to not think about it. I know I need help but what is the point of that. I had a relationship, that ended. People care about me, but I know they donâ€™t care enough. Theyâ€™d miss me, but maybe they should have treated me better. The only other thing keeping me alive is the thought of the dog missing me, that devastates me. But I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold out. The wounds make me happy for a bit, but then the memories come back. Iâ€™m on a mental break, my mind is about to snap.
