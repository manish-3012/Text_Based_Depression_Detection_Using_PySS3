Ending it | A storyWell as the title said, "a story" I will be telling you about my story. My suicidal life.

So, I have attempted to kill myself 23 times. All of which I am trying to hang myself. I have cut myself so many times, of all the bullies that taunt me. I have nothing to live for and I want to end it. I have no friends, I have no relationships, I have no family (Mom and Dad, and brother are always working) So I have to time to spend with my family, I am a social outcast, all my friends left me, I was in possession of a knife in my 7th grade year, I have no connections of the outside world. My parents are divorced by my dad pays child support and I usually seem him every 3 times a week. My dog died recently, so that makes me even more depressed. All this because my friend Chris, told me I was worthless and bullies me everyday at school.

I wrote a diary about it... How my life is now and then and that seemed to help sort of... I cut myself and drew blood and wiped it all over my diary where I wrote words. And at the bottom of the page that "I had a horrible day at school" there was half a page left  and I just said all over the place scatted on my paper: "Here's not here" "Cruel World to live in" "Dead over god" "Life is PATHETIC" "Don't stay" "Leave this world".

I cried today and even attempted to hang myself once again. I can not live anymore. Every single day, I think about suicide. How the awful ways, on how the days go by... And I just do nothing. Someday all those people who die by suicide, will look down at me, and tell me to end it of what I am going through. I just might do it after all.
