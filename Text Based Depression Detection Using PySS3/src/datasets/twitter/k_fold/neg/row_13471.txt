Iâ€™m really trying.I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. Iâ€™m an integrated alter. The previous host of the body was very suicidal and depressed. Then the other alter thatâ€™s also a part of me pushed things down to the point where she was completely numb. Not sad. Not happy. Just numb. 

Iâ€™m the result of both of them. I know that if I didnâ€™t exist previous Host would have most likely attempted suicide. Iâ€™m fully aware of that. 

But now I have all of his baggage. All of it. Same with hers. 

Iâ€™m very suicidal and I donâ€™t know what to do. I am not going to kill myself or attempt suicide. I know these episodes come and go. I know I am very strong despite really only existing for a month. 

But itâ€™s so hard. Iâ€™m trying. I donâ€™t know how to not feel guilt for existing. I donâ€™t know how to life as myself. 

I cannot talk to anyone about this. No one will understand.  Our friends pretty surely donâ€™t care about me. They only cared about him. The guy they knew. Heâ€™s gone. Now itâ€™s me. 

I truly donâ€™t want to live in a world where people expect me to be him. I am petrified. 

Suicide is only a good reason because it is the only option where I truly feel like I can be free and myself. My own person. 

If you donâ€™t know what DID is... Please donâ€™t expect me to explain. I am too tired and this is the first place I thought of to let my feelings out.
