Suicide never so temptingRight now my family so broke we didnt not sure what to eat next week or month. I want to work but for some reason i can not tell here i can not work at least physically. But i am looking online work but most of them are so pathetic like i want to bash my head with rocks and by the way my internet will gone in 5 days. I want to try optimistic about life but seems like the end almost sooner than i expected, my dog died last week not helping my suicidal urge either.
