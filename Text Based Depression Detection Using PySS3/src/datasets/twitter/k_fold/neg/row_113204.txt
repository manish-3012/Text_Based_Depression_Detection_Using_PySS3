My eating disorder isnâ€™t killing me and I need it toI want my eating disorder to kill me but Iâ€™m not even good enough at that. I eat too much to die because I donâ€™t have the willpower. Itâ€™s not even a real eating disorder because I eat just enough to get by. Last night I took a bunch of pills and then threw them all up. I wonâ€™t throw up this time because I have the willpower.
