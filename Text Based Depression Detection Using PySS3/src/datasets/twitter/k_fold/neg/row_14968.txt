Loneliness is a crushing feelingTitle says it all. Long post, sorry about this. I canâ€™t fathom how I made it to 20 when I first attempted suicide when I was 15. I was kind of a loner throughout high school and hated it. College changed that where I had a group of friends, but since I realized my sexual abuse at the hands of my brother, my mental state plummeted. This was last October, and more than half a year later, have things really improved? Since the pandemic, Iâ€™m isolated and alone at home, my friends are far away and Iâ€™m holed up with my abuser and toxic parents. I have hope in that I am moving out of home, but Iâ€™m not so sure the outside world is any kinder. My job prospects are awful, I donâ€™t know my eventual housemates, my love said no to staying at her place, and my friends are so far away. Now I eventually will be alone... like I was in high school, the second worst time of my life. Virtual meetings with friends only go so far.

I want someone to cuddle me, but the pandemic and many other factors are working against that. So where am I? At 20, Iâ€™m left desperate for any love from friends, a loser, and just not worth anyoneâ€™s effort. My parents are so awful, I cannot fathom why they made me. They worry about me, but for what? They are responsible for bringing my abuser home, destroying my confidence, and neglecting me in my adolescence. 

I feel so alone. So so alone from all my abuse. This was the case in high school, and Iâ€™m reliving it now. My friends are physically absent and I feel no love from my surroundings. My friends love me, but I canâ€™t live with them. I get the message, universe, I am not worthy of being loved and cuddled. Itâ€™s probably fine I accept it and just not live. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Why am I unworthy of love? :â€™(
