On my MindIm just a person who doesn't matter however I'm going to write this anyways. Every since my childhood I've had paranoia and fears about death and clear flags of mental illness. I was always the quiet silent kid who satin the back of the class and because of that no one really talked to me or showed interest, this doesn't mean that I don't have friends I do but there are issues. I never feel like I can tell any of my real friends about things I go through so I usually do it online but that just ends up in people only talking to me in the short term. I can never talk to my parents because I've always felt as if I can't trust them because I dont even know them. I think its because they never spent enough time with me because of my disabled brother but I understand that he needs more attention. throughout my teenage years I began to feel suicidal and felt like dying and have tried before. I feel like a monster just walking around places and I feel like life isn't really worth it. ty guys for being available at all times reddit although I dont think this will help  (P.S sry if Im breaking rules just tierd right now)
