Would this help?One of my best childhood friends took his own life last year and i've been wanting to talk to and help others going through similiar, horrible situations. I know there's a lot of resources out there but would you find it helpful if there were a website that provides realistic everyday suggestions that help with your state of mind? 

The theme would be something similar to "it's normal to not feel normal".....i.e. everyone is going through something, and some are going through a more difficult time than others, but each individual can do something today that will help them get out of that deep, dark tunnel of depression and suicidal thoughts over time. 

It would include 1. everyday strategies to help, 2. A few stories about the aftermath of suicide, 3. stories of former suicidal people that are feeling better and are on a better track. 

Any thoughts/suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.
