I would just like to talk someoneim drunk right now. bipolar, social anxiety, post traumatic stress, years of isolation and lonelyness. Im thinking about killing myself, but im afraid. I want to escape all of this, but im too comfortable. I want to talk to someone intelligent that understands and isnt going to merely try to convince me to stay alive( I've heard everything over 100 times, I want to read something else). please, anything really
