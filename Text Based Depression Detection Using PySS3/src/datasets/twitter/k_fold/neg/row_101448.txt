Birthday in a weekWith my 19th birthday approaching, I canâ€™t help but reflect on my life thus far. This world has thoroughly beat me down at every turn. I used to be an optimist but after a lifetime of giving out love without it ever being reciprocated; my outlook on life has become very bleak. Tonight I will probably end it all and although I always felt like an outsider, I figured I would turn to the only place I ever felt included, the internet.
