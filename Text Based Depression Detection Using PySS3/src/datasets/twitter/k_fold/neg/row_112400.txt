I have my noose tied up and I've been staring at it for 15 minutes.I don't know why I'm here. Last time I posted I couldn't even muster up enough strength to reply to anybody. I feel like I'm searching for the magic words that somebody'll tell me to make me feel better but they don't exist.

I don't want to die, but I can't take living anymore. I started crying, writing that sentence. I'm still crying right now.

Its been a few more minutes. I don't know what to do. I don't want this, but I want to stop hurting so bad. I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know what's wrong with me...
