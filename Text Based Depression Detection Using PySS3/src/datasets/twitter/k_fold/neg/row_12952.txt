I just want them to be happy-One of my friends and my enbyfriend ( non binary partner) ((of 6 months )) are questioning themselves because they have started to like each other. Both of them I care about and want them to be happy, I was told about this slowly happening for the past few days. They are thinking of getting together but I'm scared, I want both of them to be happy but my enbyfreind was the reason I didn't want to end my life beforehand. I feel worthless and like a failure to everyone all the time and had always contemplated killing myself for a while. Losing the person who I have given everything I had to might be the final nail in my coffin... I have started to scratch at myself till I bleed again and I'm so scared. I know not only if I end my life something might happen to them but I have a mother with clinical depression who would also end her life immediately, but I don't want to be on this world anymore if it means looking at them because that is only going to be painful. I feel so selfish. I have cried myself to sleep. I want to end it all but I don't want to hurt others....
