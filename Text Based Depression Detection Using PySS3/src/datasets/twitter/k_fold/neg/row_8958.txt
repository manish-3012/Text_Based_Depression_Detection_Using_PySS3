Cigs, Drugs, Alcohol and suicidal thoughts.Hello, just turned 17. We live with grandma.

I have been abusing drugs (not as much now), alcohol and cigarettes.

My suicidal thoughts are getting worse day by day.

I live with my mother and my grandma.

My whole life is just an disaster. My father abused my mother when pregnant, my father is gone since my birth and my parents (my mom loves me) don't love me. (well, my grandma)

We have are so poor. We're so poor we can nearly live. My mother is taking pills like it's candy (doctors told her so, I love her) so I don't blame her for anything. My mom was abusing me too until I stood for myself. My grandma abuses me 'till this day, but I really don't care much anyway. Still, it brings me the anger and wrong emotions to my brain.

I tried so hard to be a better person, to do something that it would bring us money, but nothing. I failed. I hate myself so much I just can't take it anymore.

Yesterday I overdosed on Lyrica (10+ pills) and Rivotril (3+ pills) because of the pressure.

Police? I have problems with them since 13. I hate them. Drugs, alcohol all the way.

I'm tired of everything. There's so much pressure from school, family, and everything. I just turned 17 and all the problems that my parents have are on my head. I just can't anymore.

But there's a chance I will go to Ireland to my mother's boyfriend. He works for Elon Musk (proven) and promised us he will take us to Ireland in the next maximum 96 hours. I just hope it's not some lie otherwise this will be my last goodbye to you, redditors.

Parents of reddit, please, be more kind to your children and don't pressure them into anything, including school.
