What are the mods doing?So I saw one post recently and the guy actually killed himself and left last words and hoped for others to see his post, and i checked back and the post still shows his name, and comments, but the text says removed. 

Why would you remove something like that? The guy basically is left to be forgotten and only remembered by few. Bullshit.
