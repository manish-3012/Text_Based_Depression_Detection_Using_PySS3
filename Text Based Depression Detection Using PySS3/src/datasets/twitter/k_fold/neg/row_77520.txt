PainIâ€™ve been laying in bed for about an hour now. Heâ€™s (boyfriend) out, so I donâ€™t have anybody I could speak to. I forced myself to do some housework so that I could at least do something productive this week. Iâ€™ve had a fairly good day, but I canâ€™t seem to focus on anything else except this never ending pain that we call living. Iâ€™m pretty young, but I live alone with my brother during the weekdays. Heâ€™s a very arrogant person, very self-centered, so I donâ€™t mind being quiet all week whilst our parents are away, since I know he doesnâ€™t actually care at all. Every weekend I have to put on a smile for my parents so that they wouldnâ€™t be worried or they wouldnâ€™t yell at me for not speaking. Every Sunday I have to wake up feeling exhausted because of the whole â€œplay pretendâ€ thing. They know Iâ€™m depressed. They know Iâ€™m suicidal and anxious all the time, but they never cared enough to look into it more except for when I told them and my mom comforted me. Now, they arenâ€™t bad parents, Iâ€™m just never a first priority. I might not agree with the way they treat me and how they see parenting, but they arenâ€™t bad parents. I know they are supportive, but theyâ€™re also very stressed and angry all the time and probably about 95% of all that stress and anger goes onto me. I have to take it all, since Iâ€™m the quiet one. Since Iâ€™m too scared to voice my opinion in front of my parents, because I would get yelled at. They see me as a very disrespectful child, just because of the fact that in my eyes they do not create a welcoming enough environment, in which I would be comfortable to speak about anything in. I guess they never cared enough, or they just donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s wrong with me, so I have to fake being happy for their own sake. And it hurts and exhausts me. I have to go on a trip with them and my brother the upcoming week and Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™m going to get through that. 
It has been almost four months. Four months since this awful year started. I started it off by having a mental breakdown, but I had to close it in myself, because I didnâ€™t want to have an anxiety attack in front of my parents, once again. Iâ€™ve been crying more than Iâ€™ve been doing anything else for the past two weeks. Right now I physically donâ€™t have tears left to cry. I want to lay in bed and bawl my eyes out, but I canâ€™t. Everything in my head just tells me I wonâ€™t make it through, and Iâ€™m starting to believe it. The voices are becoming more and more convincing. This world is filled with stupid people and Iâ€™m one of them. I was never good enough for my parents. I was never good enough for any of my friends, and thats why they all left. He seemed like a shining light in my life and I trusted it. I trusted it so much that I started convincing myself that forever exists. It doesnâ€™t. Why do I keep forcing myself to believe in things Iâ€™ve been telling myself I donâ€™t believe in? Why do I keep trying over and over again to hurt myself? Why do I let people hurt me so much? Worst part of all of this is that I cannot talk to absolutely anyone about my biggest problem and it sucks. Even if I went to therapy it wouldnâ€™t help. No one would be able to fill the hole in my soul that heâ€™s going to leave behind. It just isnâ€™t worth trying when itâ€™s over. Iâ€™ll be left alone and I will destroy myself. And heâ€™s going to blame it on himself when Iâ€™m done. If he ever finds out that is. Iâ€™m a lost soul looking for the right way, but there is no right way is there? If there was, then Iâ€™m probably very far away. I wonâ€™t be able to reach it and I might be gone soon. Itâ€™s scary.
