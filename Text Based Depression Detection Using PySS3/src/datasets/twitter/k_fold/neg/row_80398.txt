I fee like I'm alone in my struggle and nobody cares. I feel lonely even though I have many friends.I'm having a lot of health problems since the past month, along with exams. And it's been really hard keeping my shit together. I just want to die, and be free of this pain.

I feel very alone, and have nobody to talk to.
