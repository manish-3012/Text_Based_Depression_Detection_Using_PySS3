Not yet in any danger but scared. It is just around the corner.Not sure where to begin, maybe a bio?

I have been diagnosed with depression for years now (each doctor has their own take: MDD, Bi-bolar, dysthymic.. in chronological order of doctor). Suicide, as many of you probably know, is a fact of life - it maintains its own presence.

I have been hospitalized before. I still have literal nightmares about the place. It was the Army and it was not pleasant.

I am in my late 30's. I am a (peacetime) veteran so I have VA resources and access to medical support, if you can call it that.

I have been under a lot of pressure, or at least I feel pressured and stressed. I am slightly crippled (hence veteran) so that's some stress, but I am trying to get out of the hole of uselessness I have been in by attending college (stress number two, etc).

And now, divorce. In one of her drunken fests she yelled and blamed me for a lot and we agreed to do a trial separation in some time. A couple days later I told her it was going to be a divorce. We are not at each other's throats. We intend to go on being the best friends we were, or as best we can, but a divorce is a divorce. Oddly enough, there is of course emotional stress, but the divorce is probably the silver lining. It could go belly-up and I could end up homeless for a short time, but I believe we can be civil.

A little time before the marital fight I started to struggle. Probably best to place it at about 3 months ago. My 'control' over negative thoughts, at least to maintain healthier thought-practices, began to really slip.

I hate talking about myself and my issues. Not sure why here is fine, but it may change once you guys ask questions - will try to maintain focus, though. I should note that I have no real caring support group, other than by those whose job it is to care (the VA, the crisis line number they ask you to call every 15 mins to cover their own asses). My wife does not believe in about 97% of mental disorders. Bringing up my depression has been taboo, so no support or remaining support there.

I have hated myself in varying degrees and specifics for so long I am not sure it is in anyone's interest to change. (For example: I have always hated looking at myself and have finally gotten quasi-permission from my wife to cover the mirror, if that were to change I wold be very much a different person). The hatred is mutual, though. No woman has wanted to get close to me for years.

So, I guess what I am asking is, what is the point? How can I, you, anyone, live each day like this? Why would you want to?

I am searching for why I fight for life so much but come up empty.


I have a bit of time now but it takes a while for people to comment. I will likely check back in the morning (CST) after that.
