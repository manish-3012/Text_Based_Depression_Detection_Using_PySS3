A scarred, shell of a human.Every bit of my skin is tinged with my trauma. I wear my heart on my sleeve. No matter what I do to stop it, I'm fixed in this catch of being dependent on my abuser. My father. I'm 26 years old and my family still relies on him, despite the 6 years he abused me. Despite the fact it tears me apart. I've got my masters in social work. I know I've done some good...but nothing seems enough. My family and friends would miss me, but not enough to help me when I'm at the bottom of the barrel...done...I've tried reaching out....but I can't hide my pain anymore. I can't hold it together for everyone anymore. There's nothing I can do to save anyone if I can't save myself.
