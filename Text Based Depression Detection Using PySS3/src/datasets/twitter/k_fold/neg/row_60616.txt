I think tonight is itI think I'm gonna try to overdose on abilify when my parents leave tonight. I've been fine up until now I have had my strokes with depression but I think the following events sealed my coffin. Last summer my friends and I did acid and I got super horny and thought this girl was coming onto me, I ended up groping her and she wasn't ok with it. I've struggled with depression before that but it really hit me this time when the kid who jumped me over all that told everyone at my new school about it, my one safeplace. It took about 7 months for it to blow over and now it just blows up again. Thanks to my mom for trying her best to give me the best life I could have I'm sorry for not appreciating it. To my dad thanks for giving me the world and sorry that I also didn't appreciate I know you love me dearly but I fear this situation has no end to it where I am still alive. to my sisters i love you guys you made my life amazing  and I'm going to miss you the most. To my neices and nephews I'm sorry you have to encounter loss so young it's not fair but I hope while I was here I gave you the best times and the most amazing memories. Anyways I love you all.
