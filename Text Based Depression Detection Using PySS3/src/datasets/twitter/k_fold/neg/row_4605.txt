Advice needed as soon as possibleI've never told anyone this because I have no one to tell and I'm afraid of being locking up, heavily medicated, embarrassing my family and putting them into debt because anything medical is expensive. I'm in my early thirties and I always have suicide in the back of my mind. I'm a professionally diagnosed highly functioning autistic with ptsd because of abuse, socially anxious, learning disabled, major depressive disorder, treatment resistant and generalized anxiety disorder.  I don't have any children or a significant other. I am divorced and because of this I had to move back in with my parents. I am constantly being told college isn't for me but I feel if I don't at least look into it I will never have a career or be able to live the life I long to live. I held a job for six months as a nursing assistant but couldn't do it anymore because it was very high stress job. I currently work at a gym, watching children who are dropped off by their parents so they can work out. It's low wage $8.00 hr and my hours are not consistent. I'm the oldest person there and I feel horrible about it. One month I will work near full time and the next it will be barely part time. I cannot deal with it anymore. I have been trying to look for another job while I keep this one because little money is better than none at all or having to ask my parents for money which makes me severely depressed even more because they aren't well off and they work very hard. I feel I am nothing but a screw up and everything is hopeless. I don't know what to do. I'm out of ideas. This isn't the life I wanted. I have tried to get disability but I was denied in court because they believe I am too high functioning. 

What are some jobs that pay a livable wage that don't require college that are suitable for introverts and are low stress??
