Is there anything I can do to make the thoughts go away?I have been thinking about killing myself for 2 days straight now, and it is absolutely driving me crazy. I am on the verge of having a panic attack every minute, Iâ€™m rehearsing my last words to everyone in my mind, Iâ€™m fighting and losing to the urge of harming myself, Iâ€™m thinking of how to end it and making plans, and I have no one to talk to about this. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to lose if it doesnâ€™t stop. Does anyone have any advice on how to make it stop?
