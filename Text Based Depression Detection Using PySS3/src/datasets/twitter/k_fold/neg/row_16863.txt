Suicide Thoughts EverydayIâ€™m not sure if anyone will understand what I am about to say, but here it goes. Does anyone here experience the paradox where each day night you wish that you would die, and you would do it yourself if it werenâ€™t for the fact that you have loved ones that would be devastated if you did? I wish each night that I die in my sleep. I have as many reasons to kill myself as I do staying alive, but the pain of existing is so overwhelming. I love my nieces and nephew. I love my parents and siblings. But I hate myself. I know that if I didnâ€™t exist, their lives would be less problematic, less difficult. But if I killed myself, it would kill them. I wish I could find a way to die without it being a suicide, but Iâ€™m not smart enough to figure out a way. So I keep on keeping on. Iâ€™ve no joy. My existence is bleak and without purpose. I contribute nothing to society. And Iâ€™m just tired. Iâ€™m exhausted with the charade of going through the motions and acting like things are ok. I want to sleep forever.
