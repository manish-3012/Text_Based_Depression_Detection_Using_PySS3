Just passing byIt doesn't matter where I am,it doesn't matter with whom I am,It doesn't matter what I do,every single time suicide comes up in my mind.I just know I will try again soon,maybe sooner than I expected.maybe this time I will not wake up in a hospital,maybe I won't wake-up at all...maybe one of this days the pain will go away.
