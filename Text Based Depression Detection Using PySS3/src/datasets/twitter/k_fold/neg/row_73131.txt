I think the girl I love moved away so I'm probably going to kill myself.Theres a girl I've been in love with/infatuated with/had intense feelings for,  for almost a year now.  I would go to her workplace a lot to talk to her and I asked her out but she had a boyfriend so she said no.

This obviously made me sad but I understood and I really liked her so I wanted to at least be her friend.  I was okay with that.  But then she quit her job and the past few months shes only occasionally comes into my workplace and she would barely even say hi.  I haven't seen her in a few weeks and on her facebook it says she got a job in a town like 30 min to an hour away.  I thought we werwe at least becoming friends but she completely forgot about me.  I can't blame her I'm a forgettable piece of shit.  I can't move on from this girl I'm 22 and I've never even kissed a girl I'm so pathetic and I loved her.  

At first I thought she liked me back, because a girl has never responded to me the way she did but I guess it was all just in my head.   I'm probably going to down as many pills as I can in the next few hours I can't be alone and I can't live knowing she just forgot about me that easily.
