I want to go nowI'm going out after dinner tonight to see if I can commit to ending it, i plan on bringing a load of painkillers with me and doing it somewhere alone, I'm not particularly bad objectively speaking but I know that I'm never truly going to make those around me happy, I don't think I want to live like that, I wish it would all go away. I think my family might miss me but I'm no good to them, I don't help them really. 

I'm not pretty, I'm not funny, I'm good at tests but I've never truly been smart. I don't believe there's any afterlife, I think everything just goes away and for me that's better than any heaven will ever be
