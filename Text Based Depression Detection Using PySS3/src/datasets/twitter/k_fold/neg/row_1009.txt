WROTE MY SUICIDE NOTE ON SATURDAYI'm 30 years old and have been feeling hopeless about my health and how it has been affecting my life. I've been having problems for years. I just had a part of my skull removed 2 weeks ago because of a skull tumor and now I'm also having intestinal pain again that I haven't had for years. Haven't been able to work and have no income and feeling like I have nothing and I am ready to go back to nothing...I've lost everything because of this over the last 2 years even though I tried to keep healthcare but I feel like the government wants people like me to die and not be a drain on the state.  

All I have left is a bunch of mental disorders making it darker and darker every day: AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social anxiety, Body Dysmorphic DisorderÂ &amp; ADD.

I wrote my suicide note on Saturday and was going to hang myself even though that's not my  preferred "plan". Just seems so easy. Made it to today with the help of my family and my partner and I have an appointment with my Neurologist at 1:00PM. I hope I don't have to go back to the mental hospital because I cannot do that again. I wanted more out of life than constant physical and emotional pain
