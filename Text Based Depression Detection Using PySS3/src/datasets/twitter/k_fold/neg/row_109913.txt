life is bullshitUnfairly flunked out of college and then my girlfriend dumped me when I told her I'd be moving back to home in Montana. There's no one here except for the top two critics in my life, whom from each I derive 50% of my genetics. When I feel really bad, sticking a Glock under my chin actually helps, I feel like I still have a tiny scrap of dignity left.
