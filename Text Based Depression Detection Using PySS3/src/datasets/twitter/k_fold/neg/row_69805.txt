Nothing seems to be going my wayHello, I am 17 and it may seem a bit young to start complaining about all of the shit that happened to me, but it made me depressed as fuck and I donâ€™t think I can make it out of this swing. About 3-4 months ago, I started to date a girl that to most people wasnâ€™t attractive but she was beautiful to me and I thought that she was the one. She was a grade below me(I graduated this year so I guess that is something good). I thought it was going well and she just stopped talking to me and a couple weeks later she came to me and said she wanted to focus on academia and I should be doing that too. Not a few weeks after that I got into a car accident(I am ok, it was just a rear end) and I broke one of the companyâ€™s trucks a couple days after that. It just feels that everything I try to do to become a successful and happy person just fails and breaks. Nothing makes me happy and there is no one to talk to that will help me with this (all of my close friends know about my depression and they help out with getting me out of it by giving me some social interaction). I donâ€™t enjoy the job I work but I feel that I would disappoint my parents by quitting. My parents always told me that they were proud of me and I donâ€™t think that I made them proud from all of my actions. I donâ€™t want to sound edgy but I almost ended it all last night. I have had suicidal thoughts before but I was never as close as I was last night to ending it all, I just feel like a waste of space and time for people who care about me.
