Ambien, the quick way out? Or just another failure?I've already taken 40mg of Zolpidem on an empty stomach, I have 160mg left to take. This could be it, they say third times the charm and I wasn't getting far slitting wrists. It's hard to type already so long story short I'm a screw up, my real father abused me from 0-10 and then my mother became a chain smoker and got cancer and is dying and im drug addict.
