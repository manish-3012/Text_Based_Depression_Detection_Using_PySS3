Suicide is the only option.My mind is conditioned to think negative all the time. I've grown up in such a environment, can't help that. 
I can't focus on shit. Nothing. Absolutely nothing cheers me up. It's like no matter how hard I try to look at the positives. My subconscious just doesn't let that happen. 

I'm always irritated on people and stuff. Always looking for people, so that I can rant. But now I'm just so tired of my brain. I know that I'm the one who's giving orders to my subconscious to work like that but it's beyond my fucking control. I can't even exercise 0.000001% control over how my mind processes things. 

Suicide is all that I've been thinking of lately because I want these thoughts to stop and I can't deal with myself anymore. I've tried everything from meditation to medicines. Nothing has worked for the past 5 years. Nothing. Even my doc that told me that your mind is coniditoned to work like that and there's no medicine that can cure it. Just a few people I can be myself around are the only hope and help I should be expecting. But, I don't need people. Nah! People suck. 

So, yeah I just wanna die and be numb forever. Would be such a nice feeling when zillions of thoughts stop coming at the same time. I can't imagine how wonderful that moment would be.
