I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreIâ€™ve lost so many friends and relationships to my constant need to talk about myself. I honestly think I have narcissistic personality disorder, then again Iâ€™m not doctor or some shit. People have literally told me that I canâ€™t change because of my personality and I donâ€™t think I can ever find someone to be with friends or otherwise (Iâ€™m 16 btw). I think I should give up, my family probably would be better off which sounds like the typical thing to say when youâ€™re suicidal but rationally yeah, they donâ€™t have to pay for my college, they can focus on my sister whoâ€™s 9, and they donâ€™t have to deal with my bullshit anymore. I donâ€™t think I can change, Iâ€™ve tried believe me, but I canâ€™t seem to shake the narcissistic part of me that I hate so goddamn much. Iâ€™m a fat fuck who deserves to die and logically I should. I donâ€™t get good grades Iâ€™m not good at anything not even fucking videogames. I canâ€™t even get a killstreak on Battlefield 4 fuck. I say that I have fake friends but tbh I am the problem and I realize that now. Every bad thing thatâ€™s happened to me is because of me. I donâ€™t think I can hold on any longer.



Sorry for the horribly structured post
