I need helpYesterday, I tried to kill myself. I wrote about that on this link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TellReddit/comments/cwhvc7/i\_think\_today\_is\_the\_day\_i\_die/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TellReddit/comments/cwhvc7/i_think_today_is_the_day_i_die/)

I am new to reddit and someone told me to post here so I am doing it now.

Well, I climbed on one of the few abandoned houses near my street, took a rope, made a noose, all prepared. I put a noose around my neck. My neighbour saw me, and until he came to me, all good things got through my head. I dont know why... and, when he came to me, he put me down, then beat the living shit out of me and asking "why!?". I was frightened and happy. I needed that.

Right now I am waiting for my next chance to do that. Becouse, this morning I saw that person...who is responsible for all of this and every fucking thing came to my head. I dont know what to do, and I dont know where to search for help. Dont wanna call hotlines becouse I dont believe them and I know my parents will find out for that, my country is not very good with law so... :) Tnx in advance &lt;3
