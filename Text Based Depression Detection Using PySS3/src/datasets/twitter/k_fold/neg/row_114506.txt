Any practices to deter or support thoughts of suicide?Suicide has been on my mind for over a decade. Itâ€™s getting tougher with all the gobbledygook nowadays to keep my mind off of it. Iâ€™ve been trying to better myself and trying to stay away from substances to gradually not be so dependent on them. Iâ€™m hurting really bad right now mentally, I hope I can receive some help or an open ear to vent and get some feedback.  I have so much to live for and strive for (Iâ€™ve been told.) But Iâ€™m starting to think Iâ€™m not mentally as strong as I thought. 

Iâ€™m tired, I just donâ€™t want to pursue anything in life, it feels like. I canâ€™t exercise (anymore atm ) , get some peace in my life and other personal things I rather not mention. 

This might not the place to ask for advice or help but Iâ€™m not sure where else to turn, where I can turn for guidance.
