Hi I want to die.My name is Heather and I really hate myself. I'm pretty damn drunk and I want to die. Idk how. Maybe overdosing on something but that would just fuck up my liver. I'm trans and it seems like everyone hates me besides other trans people. I'm just so miserable and I want to be better. I have therapy on Thursday and my first appointment with a psychiatrist the Wednesday after that. I just want to either be dead or happy. I hate myself so much and I need companionship and affection and love and attention. Blah blah blah blah you've heard it all before. Im a failure and no one will never be proud of me. I'm a problem and my friends are sick of me, hence the public thread on my main account haha. I'm fucking miserable. Someone please help me. I'm drunk and I want to overdose. I want to die. Life is so hard.

Update: It's the morning and I'm sober and I'm safe. Thank you to everyone who helped me through that last night. I'm going to do my best to stay strong until I see my mental health professionals.
