Fucking suicide dude..Iâ€™m suicidal. I want to die. I canâ€™t do it because people would be sad. That kinda makes me mad. Why should I suffer because people care. Very selfish. I know I am. Iâ€™m only a man. Iâ€™m not some god. I canâ€™t make the bad people go away. Theyâ€™re in my head. They want me dead. My dad is sick but Iâ€™m afraid to talk to him. Itâ€™s been a few years. We were never close. Itâ€™s as if he already died in my mind. Heâ€™s close to it. Stage 4 everything cancer. Stuck in a hospital bed close to death. My mom is healthy enough, she smokes.

I want to make people happy, make people laugh. Now Iâ€™m optimistic but I know it wonâ€™t last. I switch from personality to personality like the flip of switch. I hate, I love, I want, Iâ€™m done, and Iâ€™ve begun. Crazy. Thatâ€™s how Iâ€™d describe myself. I need help. Iâ€™m hoping Bernie Sanders wins so I can see a doctor. I donâ€™t feel safe, for myself or others. 

If the bad men take control again i might hurt. I donâ€™t want to. I need help. Should I try the state mental health facility? They arenâ€™t very helpful. I seem to come out worse when I go there. Itâ€™s in Kansas City. They put you all together in a room. The people there make me feel sane because theyâ€™re all fucked up in the brain. Iâ€™m just depressed and extremely stressed. Iâ€™m worthless and Iâ€™m the best. Maybe bi polar but I think itâ€™s worse. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed as schizophrenic, once or twice. People here in Kansas arenâ€™t always nice. Some are cool until they find out youâ€™re mentally fucked up. They treat me like Iâ€™m crazy but I guess thatâ€™s fair. I just want to be normal but life scares me. Iâ€™m afraid to leave my room. Help. Please, help. I love you all and I hate you to. Weâ€™re all fucking doomed. Weâ€™re looking for salvation in a world of pure frustration. Itâ€™s a wrap.
