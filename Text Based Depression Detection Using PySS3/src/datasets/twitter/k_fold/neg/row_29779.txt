My sister is in ICU and I don't know quite sure what to do.My sister is 16, she's on medication for migraines, truthfully she suffers a lot. She's brilliant and she pushes herself. She's been put on some anti-anxiety medication recently.

Last night I went downstairs for a snack and she was sleepwalking, I watched her and she went to the hall and out the door and I thought that was not okay so I went out and I picked her up and I brought her back in and laid her on the couch and told my father about it.

In the morning she had moved again and there was a bottle of Tylenol open in the living room and that would react with her meds and shut her liver down so we took her to the ER and found it in her system, now she's in the ER, and she says she doesn't remember taking it but..

I don't know what to do if she did. And there's a difference between 2 pills and a fistful and the doctors will figure out that number and I don't know what to do about it.

Somebody, please tell me what to say to her. Please tell me how to help her. I just want her to be happy. I love her.
