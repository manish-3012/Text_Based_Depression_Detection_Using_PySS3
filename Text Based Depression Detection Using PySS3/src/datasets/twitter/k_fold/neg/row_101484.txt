shallow breathei think that iâ€™m ready and this is something that i want for myself. iâ€™ve been told for 15 years that it would get better &amp; that it would be selfish. but iâ€™m never actually happy nor do i make anyone else happy or proud. wherever i go i will finally feel good. this place isnâ€™t where i want to be. no matter where i have moved to in life iâ€™ve never felt comfortable or content. this wonâ€™t hurt many as iâ€™ve cut off 90% of the people i once knew. no one even knows i exist anymore anyways. it will take a while to find me but i hope this is all over with quickly. i am useless and there is nothing i want to experience anymore. nothing feels better than falling asleep so iâ€™m going to take myself to that place for good finally.
