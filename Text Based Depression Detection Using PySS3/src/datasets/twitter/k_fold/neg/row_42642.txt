Alone in the WorldI'm a college student who happens to be very conservative. I disagree with almost every leftwing idea. But now I've realized that none of my peers truly support me. The college publications and students oppose every single idea of mine. The student newspaper recently posted a story about an anti-abortion rally, but posted a picture of an counter protester looking heroic and defiant while holding up a "I Stand With Planned Parenthood" sign. Like somehow the anti-abortion rally was one the wrong side of history. What made matters worse is that the girl who was in the picture was a girl that I talked to for awhile when I came on campus. We liked each other, but when she realized that I was conservative she began treating me poorly.

I've been excluded from my social circle and I'm afraid to be myself and speak my mind. I can't be me. I either must conform to the mainstream college ideology or suffer the consequences. The thing is, a large part of me wants to just conform. Just be quite and never speak so I can finally be loved. I hate the idea because it's so cowardly, but it never leaves my mind. "Be someone else, because no one loves you now."

I have no friends and very little family. It seems as if the universe is telling me that my ideas are so gross and disgusting that I'm being punished for daring to have any ideas of my own, and that somehow makes me an evil person. The only thing keeping me alive is my Mom. If something happened to me, she would be in unimaginable pain. So now I'm forever stuck in a limbo where I want to die because I have no friends and no lover, but I can't let myself die because of my Mom. How can I possibly deal with this? People won't magically start accepting me for who I am.
