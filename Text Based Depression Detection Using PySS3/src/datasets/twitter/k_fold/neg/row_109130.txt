Why shouldn't I do it?Hi r/SW  I have been trying for two and a half years to be normal. I am 20 almost 21.   Normal to me is 1. have friends and 2. have a significant other.  I am about to be a 21 year old virgin.  My only relationship has lasted three weeks and that was two years ago.  I'm a freak.  I'm weird and this is unacceptable.  I want to be normal.  But I'm not.  I don't fit in with people and they don't like me, no matter how I act or talk or whatever.  So why shouldn't I do it.  I have invested two and a half years into trying to be normal and have failed.  I truely believe that will be a loser who is alone for the rest of his life.  I don't want to be alone, and I can't change it on my own, I can't just will myself to be liked.  So why shouldn't I do it?  If I'm not going to grow and develop socially and be the same I am now and be unhappy why should I be in pain?  Why would people think its selfish for me to not want to be in pain anymore?
