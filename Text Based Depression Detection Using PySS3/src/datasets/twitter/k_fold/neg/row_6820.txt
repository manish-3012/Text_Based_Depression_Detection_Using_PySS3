Survival instinctI really feel like ending my life is the right decision for me logically. Getting it over with is the hard part. Once your dead you won't know any different. But the process of dying is hard to face, you have to inflict some kind of violent trauma to your own body in order to be released from a life you don't even want.  It terrifies me that I don't have the courage to do what needs to be done.
