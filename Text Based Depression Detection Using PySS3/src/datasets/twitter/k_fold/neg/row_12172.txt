I've hit a depression spike that's gotten so bad for the first time in a while I feel suicidal.I doubt that I'll carry through with it, cause I'm a pussy.
But honestly I go to school everyday, and I have absolutely no relationship with anyone there. People ignore me, stare at me, probably make fun of me behind my back. My "friends" will literally just tell me to stop when I'm talking. So I start thinking about how I am a failure and will probably never own up to anything. I'm not smart enough for a job, especially not to support the only person who might care about me when I finished high school later this year, nor any kids we may have later, all I do is sit home on the Internet because it requires no human interaction.
