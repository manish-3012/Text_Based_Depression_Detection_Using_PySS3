I need helpI have lived in an abusive home for my entire life. I have attempted suicide seven times in my life. I have been trying to get help for my depression for 5 years. I asked my school, they did nothing to help me. I asked my mom, she did nothing. I finally asked my new school for hell and I have been on a waiting list for a month now. But now my parents have been basically telling me I am retarded. First it was because of politics, now it is because I escaped to my boyfriend's house everyday. I begged for them to let me stay at my boyfriend's and they yelled at me and said "you can't stay. I will see you at home." I am terrified to go home, I just want to die. I have wished that I wouldn't wake up the next morning. My life is just getting harder and harder. I just feel like I am running in water. I am 17, I don't turn 18 until August. I need help guys. Thank you for reading, I am sorry if I spell things wrong or anything and I am sorry if this is long. Have a nice day guys
