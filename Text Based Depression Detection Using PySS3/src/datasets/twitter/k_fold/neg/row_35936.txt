Without depression, I would be an asshole 100% of the time.I realized that the only reason I am capable of being kind, is because I'm depressed. And since I know what that feels like, I don't want anyone else to feel even remotely close to that.

However, during times where my depression does not bother me, which are rare times, to be frank... I manipulate, use and throwaway people. I am a living piece of shit. I'm aware of it. And I even know that I enjoy being one. Only when I fall back into depression do I weep and wail at how fucking pathetic and shitty I am. Otherwise, I'm just an asshole.

Don't console me. I don't deserve anything like that and I am completely aware of my misdoings and have no intentions of quitting them. Sensibly speaking, I should just take my own life already. I hurt people and enjoy it. Scum like myself is what drags down this world.
