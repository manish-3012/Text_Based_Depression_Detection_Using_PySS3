HelpI have nothing to live for. I am failing all my classes. Its too stressful to do 15 assignments each class . I don't work to make money.  My parents tell me to drop out and start working im 15 and I want to kill my self. I'm just prolonging my death because I'm to scared to do it. Even to run away. It is better if I do that. It'll make everyone else's lives easier not thinking about me. I dont know how to keep these thoughts out of my head. I want to kill my self but I'm too much of a pussy to do it. I tell myself there's better times ahead but it just gets worse
