I'm Not Good At Dying, But Not Living EitherI've been facing depression since I was 8, and I've been attempting suicide at least once a year since I was 10. I'm 20 now. I'm not a college graduate, and I doubt I ever will be. I failed the prerequisite English course 4 times, and I don't think I'll ever be able to pass it. I'm unemployed, and I can't see myself having any long term work. This whole time I just assumed I would drop dead and not have to plan ahead for adulthood, but it seems I was wrong. Now I don't know what to do moving forward. I can't see myself being productive, helping society in any way or even giving anything of value to the people I love. I'm really just dead weight. I can't give anything and I can't expect to keep living doing nothing. I feel like I should have I died a while ago, but I just never did. At this point I'm miserable doing nothing, but I also have nothing to do. It'd probably just be easier for me to die.
