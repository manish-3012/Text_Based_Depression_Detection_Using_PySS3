My hamster is sick and is going to die soon and I might too
So a little backstory, I got my hamster Hercules at one of my lowest points. I had moved 500 miles away from anyone I had known, and the following week my dad walked out on us. She was my anchor in this crazy world, and now sheâ€™s being ripped away from me. It sounds childish I get it but itâ€™s more the idea that as long as sheâ€™s ok I will be ok. And sheâ€™s not ok anymore. And neither am I.
