What do I do I'm a kid who is shutting downHello I'm having problems and I want to know if anyone is feeling like me or can help me... I feel like my parents don't love me sometimes,my only friend moved away,the people I was closest to were my grandparents and they are all dead,my uncle killed himself,and I had to get out of school due to bein constantly bullied an being called Fat,a loser, and lots more. They were always telling me to kill myself and making up filthy lies to get me in trouble...I am now homeschooled and have 0 friends at all but I just stay in my room on reddit an Xbox when I'm not in school. Most of the time I have no drive to do anything and I'm lonely depressed and just feeling really down in the dumps and really low and I don't know what to do but sometimes I feel like dying...what should I do?
