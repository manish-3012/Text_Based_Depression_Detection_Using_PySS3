Wouldn't it be niceWouldn't it be nice if there were anonymous group meetings in the manner of AA where people could go talk with other suicidal people?  And we could be completely honest with each other.  And then hang out together. Drink coffee and sing songs and cry and hug each other.   And not worry about being reported and locked away.  And we could all be friends.  Sigh.  I've made friends in mental hospitals before, and there is this extremely special bond between people who are suicidal.  We are highly sensitive people.  We get it.
I have a few friends (in the real non hospital world), but none of them go through these feelings, and I can't unload these thing on them.  Whenever I talk to these few people or select family members there is just this barrier.  Yes I see a therapist and psych.  Yes I've called the hotline.  
People would argue that it could be disastrous to have a bunch of suicidal people all together.  Maybe so.  Sigh. I wish all of us here could meet up.  It's just not as satisfying to communicate through a computer.  I'm not doing so well....
