This world is definitely... not real?Have you eved had this feeling? Meditating on the cost of life, the core values of life there are something that doesn't fit...

Like that world (obviously) can be The Real World. Or there's something really broken.

Sorry for the unstructured thought, but that idea just can't leave my mind and (following the confirmation bias) constantly showing the evidence that it is true. Have you ever had same thoughts?
