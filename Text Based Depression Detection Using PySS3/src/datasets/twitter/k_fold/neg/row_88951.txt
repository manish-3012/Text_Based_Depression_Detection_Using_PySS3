Thereâ€™s no point.Iâ€™m a freshman in high school. Iâ€™m already failing a class, and possibly another one. I have absolutely no motivation to do any work, to study, anything - I feel itâ€™s pointless. Iâ€™m not going to college. or getting a job. If I could I would just drop out but Iâ€™m not allowed. Iâ€™m only going to school to appease my parents at this point. I feel like thereâ€™s absolutely no point in me staying alive if I donâ€™t do anything with my life. Iâ€™m just making myself miserable at that point.
