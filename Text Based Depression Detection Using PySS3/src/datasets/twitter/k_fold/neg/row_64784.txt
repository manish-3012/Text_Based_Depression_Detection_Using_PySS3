Hey so I(16M) have very little reason to liveI own a puppy , that's about it. He is the only reason I'm still alive because I have to take care of him. He's a great little guy. But my life feels like it has no meaning right now , I don't want to cope I want to thrive. I have pills and blades aplenty and I am quite scared. It just hasn't been a very good year for me and I'm tired of hearing it will get better because the better hasn't shown up yet. I'm so tired
