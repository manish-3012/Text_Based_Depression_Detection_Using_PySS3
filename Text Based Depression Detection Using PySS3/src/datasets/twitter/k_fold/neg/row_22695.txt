I'm not alive for me.I'm alive for my husband, my parents and my 3 puppies. The three humans love me too much to hurt them, and my babies would be so confused and sad if I suddenly wasn't here alll day, cuddling and talking and playing with them.

That's it. Everyone else's feelings aren't important to me. Im just too cowardly to hurt those 6 living beings that form my world, my support system, my moments of happiness and adventure and joy.

I'm just over it. I have been for probably a year now. I fought and persevered and tried new meds and had ECT and did programmes and therapy... but every year plays out the same with bipolar. The depression, the mania, the self harm. Nothing actually helps. I still wreak havoc wherever I go. Can't hold down a job. Can't control my emotions or impulses. Can't find my purpose, my place in the world.

I just want to cease to be. Like an art project that didn't go to plan, just throw me away and don't look back. Don't be sad. I won't be. I'll be free. 

6 weeks ago I cut myself the worst in my entire life. I opened up my thighs and between my breasts to the bone. 101 stitches, then 2 weeks ago remedial surgery to fix an area on my right thigh that just wouldn't knit together. I'm scarred all over, physically, emotionally. I just can't take trying to NOT kill myself anymore. Eventually it's going to happen by accident; I'll hit an artery and bleed out before anyone finds me. I wish more than anything I had your blessing to go in peace, voluntarily. 

I wish you loved me enough to let me leave you.
