I'm not happy with my life and I'm wondering if I should end my life. I don't know what to do...I'm a 21 year old woman and I have been feeling very depressed.  I have been contemplating suicide for a few days...I live with my mom, my parents are divorced and my dad is living his own life.  I have a boyfriend who I've been with for 2.5 years, we broke up briefly in September because we realized that each fight we had kept on getting worse.  Around early November, we got back together.  I was seeing someone else at the time that we were seperated, but after that...I cut all ties with that person.  

Lately, I feel like nobody cares about me...Not my mom...My boyfriend...My friends if I even have any...My boyfriend and I are long distance, and I feel like I don't make him happy.  I feel like he's way happier with his friends and I feel like if I was just invisible to..Things would be better....I feel like I have this big weight on my shoulders....I also have lost a friend to suicide....And I know it's wrong to do it, but...I just don't know...

I feel like I don't make anyone happy and I feel like everyone would be way happier without me if I was gone....I feel like my presence is meaningless.....I feel like my own mom hates me, she has a heart condition....
