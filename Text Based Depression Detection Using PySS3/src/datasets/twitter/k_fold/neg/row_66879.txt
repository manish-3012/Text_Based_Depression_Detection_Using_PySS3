This is the last one of these that I'm going to make.No amount of background story would help here; I've been told so many different things by so many different people and none of them have helped. I post this hoping for a miracle that I know isn't coming...

I am ready.

My letter is ready.

I'm slipping off of the last piece of life that I'm holding on to.

None of this "it gets better" or "permanent solution to a temporary problem" shit. Some things don't get better. Some things don't go away. I am completely able to bear the fact that this will fuck with my friends and family for the rest of their lives. I wish somebody would tell me that it's okay for me to go, but I understand completely that nobody will.
