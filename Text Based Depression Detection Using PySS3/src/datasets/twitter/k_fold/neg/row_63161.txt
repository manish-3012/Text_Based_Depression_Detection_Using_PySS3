A mess It's so hard to do anything.

I have all the symptoms of Avoidant Personality Disorder

I haven't left my house in 4 months (the only time was for a dentist appointment)

Please don't tell me your seeing and watching everything. My parents better not invade this too. I can't handle you doing this again.

The one good thing in my life. The only happy memory I have. Is gone. Going to meet my cousins, and hang for vacation. I couldn't get myself to go. My acnes gotten too bad and I gained a shit ton of weight. I can barely look at myself. I'm a piece of shit. At first, it felt better when I realize that I barely effected them by not going. But now that its been two days its starting to hurt. I don't know if I can do this. The one good thing I cant do. I can't do it. why. why. its you. you.

I sleep all day. I sleep every time I eat. I sleep every few hours. It's so hard to stay awake. I don't have friends. I have none. I don't have any siblings. I don't have any pets. I'm so detached from reality. My memory is starting to get weird. I feel like shit. My head always feels weird. I never feel normal. I invalidate everything I think. but I believe it, unlike people who say they do. I genuinely think I'm disgusting because I genuinely am. I don't want to cling onto something or someone who dislikes or pities me. I know they all do. It's my face. right? my figure. my hair. I hate it. I fucking hate it so much.

But I'm ok. I'm ok. I'm ok. I'm not actually depressed im, not I'm not. It's my fault. like my parents say. Im doing this to myself. I want to go outside. I want to be happy. I want to interact with others. I can't describe the exact feeling. But its not what you think... I just don't feel real, or human. I feel gross. Everyday. I barley feel much anymore, it's all just subtle twinches of emotions I illude to. Expect fear. Its harder to just reason your way out of that kind of thing. But I will to the best of my abilities. Like its not real. its not happening. ignore it. pretend your in a game. pretend like its ok. Why should you care about how you look. You vain piece of shit. ignore it. please.
