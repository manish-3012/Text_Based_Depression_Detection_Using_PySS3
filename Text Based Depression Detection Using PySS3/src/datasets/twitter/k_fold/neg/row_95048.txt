I just can't anymoreI am losing it all. My job, my SO, my home, my cat.
I have never been one to give up. Never been one to think I can't anymore. I just don't want to fight or try anymore. I don't have anything left in the tank. I have support I have people who care but it's not enough.  I want to let this pain end. I don't want to exist in this world anymore. I can't fight it anymore and I'm only scared that there isn't that voice inside telling me not to. I know how to fix my life I know what I can do to be happy but I just dont want to. Because I have nothing left. I'm deeply ashamed to write this. Please someone help me.
