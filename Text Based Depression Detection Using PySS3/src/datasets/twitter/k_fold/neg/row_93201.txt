I'm on my 3rd screwdriver, going on 4Where do I even begin? I'm getting drunk as shit because it stops me from feeling anything. 
I have PTSD from getting assaulted which has caused me to distrust people on top of making my social anxiety even worse.
This past week I've felt like shit and contemplated sliding my wrists and throat, thats all I imagined all day. Only thing stopping me from doing it was thinking about the people of my life.
Maybe I'm just going on a drunken tangent but I needed to vent.
I dont know where the fuck im even going in life. I'm just going to school just because, I have no idea what I even want to do as I don't even see myself that far in the future. I think I need another drink. At least that way I can feel less like shit while I listen to Alice in Chains.
