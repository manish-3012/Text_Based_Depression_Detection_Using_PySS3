quitteri hate myself beyond words. and i dont think that will ever change. who wants to be around that? who wants to be friends with that? who wants to hear that every day? just an endless spewing of shit. who fucking cares. there are good people out there that are positive and actually deserve your time and respect. people with personalities. productive people. people that take care of themselves. people that smile and laugh and trust and hope and fit in and love and forgive and have experiences. just let me fucking rot. thereâ€™s no hope. i am not worth it. clearly.
