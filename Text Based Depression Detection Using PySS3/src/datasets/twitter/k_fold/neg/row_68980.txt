I'm a coward and it's the only reason I'm still here.Nothing ever gets better. They've been telling me for 14 years since my early teenage days that "it will get better" and it fucking hasn't. I'm now almost 30 and still fighting the same demons I have been for more than half of my life.

Amid this COVID-19 thing, I know it's selfish of me to want to take my own life because there are people actually dying all over the world, begging for a chance to live. And I wish I could give them that in exchange for my own (as I saw someone else say as well in another post). I wish I could give my life for someone who could actually make something of it, and make the time here worth while. 

I have moments of happiness - of clarity, where I think "hey maybe this life this isn't so bad", and I think in those times that I'm finally gaining some footing but there is always another wave to take me down and always harder than the last time. It is exhausting standing up each time and it's getting to the point where I don't think I'm going to be able to anymore sometime soon.

I haven't killed myself because I don't know how. I've been told I'm a failure my entire life and now I'm even afraid of failing to die. I'd rather live my life miserable and healthy than miserable and brain damaged or disabled because of a failed overdose or failed hanging or failed bleed-out. I'm just fucking done living and I pray every day for a tragic accident to happen to me so that I don't have to do it myself. 

And no one gets it. I have no one in my life who I can speak candidly to about this because I'm ashamed of the coward that I am. I want to die, but I won't. So now I'm just the girl who cried wolf.
