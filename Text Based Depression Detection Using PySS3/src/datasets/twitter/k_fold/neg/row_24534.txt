I just wish there was someone out there like me and acc came out of this dark place so I could be taught ways on what to do and really believe thereâ€™s a possibility for me to be happyAnxiety is physical and itâ€™s so bad to the point that Iâ€™m unemployed and donâ€™t like talking to anyone even my family...really wish I didnâ€™t do the things I did so I could be normal and actually have love, a normal life and a future I could acc see cause rn all I see is me being alone and killing myself
