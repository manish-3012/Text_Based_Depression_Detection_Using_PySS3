Iâ€™m so fucking doneMy mom hit me with the â€œyou are lucky that you arenâ€™t in foster careâ€ again today and just made me feel like an actual piece of shit. Iâ€™m not worth living for anymore. Iâ€™m ready to go, I want to go. Iâ€™ve already signed my death with a bunch of pills. Enough to kill me. Thank you to all of those people that have helped me on here before, and Iâ€™m sorry that it came to this.
