I've never wanted to so badMy "best friend" slept with the girl he knew I liked and tells me all of the details. I don't want to confront the fact that he's so shitty, cause it reflects poorly on my ability to make friends. I already have trust issues and this just piles onto it. That and my shitty job. I feel like I'm gonna break. I don't want to kill myself, but it feels like nothing is ever gonna get better, and the only peace I can find is with death.
