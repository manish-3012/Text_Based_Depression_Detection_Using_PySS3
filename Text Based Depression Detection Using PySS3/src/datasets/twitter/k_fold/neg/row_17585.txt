Will my bf care if I commit suicide?I have been dating him for 2 years. I love him very deeply. I'm not using suicide as a way to control him I just have really bad mental issues. I've gotten help before and I'm on antidepressants that I have been on for 3 years. No difference. Im ready to do it I just want to know how it will affect him because I don't want to hurt him.
