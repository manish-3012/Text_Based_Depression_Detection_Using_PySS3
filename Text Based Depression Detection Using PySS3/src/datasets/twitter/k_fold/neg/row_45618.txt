I want to care.Ever since I was little I felt anxious. It was never really a problem until now. When I was sixteen I had a boyfriend. I felt happy and I really cared about him. He showed me what it was like to be adventurous. Then things started going down hill. One day the quarterback of the football team did something bad to me. No one believed me when I said what he did, I couldn't prove anything. I ended up spiraling into depression. My boyfriends seemed to be getting abusive. I had to break up with him. He started sending me pictures of him cutting himself and saying he was going to kill himself. This just made everything worse. I tried killing myself. I ended up surviving, and I was put in the hospital for a few months until they thought I could leave. My parents and I moved a few towns over because the word of me spread around town. Nothing was ever the same. I feel like I have no passion, like I don't care about anything. I started talking to the quarterback again because I felt like I needed to forgive him in order to move on, but he just wanted to use me again. I feel like there is no point in living. I just want to die. The only reason I won't kill myself is because I don't want my parents to deal with a dead daughter. I'm eighteen now. I tried Tinder because I wanted to allow myself to be happy again. I meet a lot of people. I've been really promiscuous and it's not like me at all. I met a nice boy that says he cares about me and he tries to help, but I am afraid I can't give him what he wants. He deserves better, someone that will care for him. He knows about all my issues and tries to help me. I met with him yesterday and we just cuddled, I told him I felt happy, by I still couldn't "feel" anything. I have these manic episodes where I cut everyone off. I've tried therapy and medication and it doesn't seem to work. My parents are always annoying me. I just want to be normal. I just don't want to be alive anymore.
