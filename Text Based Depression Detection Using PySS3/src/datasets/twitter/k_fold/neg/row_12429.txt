They donâ€™t care until your goneI thought about jumping today. Iâ€™m already depressed and now I canâ€™t sleep. Then my mom walked in telling me I should take a nap. So I lay down and 3 hours later she came in and asked if I had slept. Then I realized what I would be leaving behind and what other people would feel if I disappeared. So now Iâ€™m postponing.
