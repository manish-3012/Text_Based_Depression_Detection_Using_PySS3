My life is as bad as it was 15 years ago. I'm starting to think suicide is the rational choice.I've swallowed pills and put a gun to my head or a knife to my throat before, but this is different. I don't feel upset or unstable, I just don't think I belong in the world for one more year.

I'm unhappy. Nothing but bad luck. Worst is the crushing loneliness. No efforts to change this have ever worked. 

I'm unable to get romantic relationships or even good friendships, two things that almost everyone else in the history of the world have managed. I'm thirty and don't know what either feels like.

I have other impossible ambitions too, but that hurts the most.

The world won't lose anything. I am not smart or skilled enough to do anything important. School is the only thing I've ever been good at.

No one is dependent on me so my death will not disrupt much.

What's left? How does the knee-jerk reaction of "suicide = bad" apply anymore? I look into the future and I see nothing but more of the same.
