I give upI havenâ€™t felt true happiness in years, only small &amp; menial surges that end as quick as they started so I can return to spending every single moment I have thinking about ending my life. I have a single person not related to me by blood that even texts me back &amp; frankly I know that even that relationship is nearly over. I have no one, no goals, &amp; no future. Iâ€™m typing this into the void because no one I know actually cares aside from my mom and even she isnâ€™t there much anymore. I know that going through with this might crush her but we barely even speak anymore.. I feel as though she would recover. I just have no solutions to the mountain of problems I have. As a kid I was so social but slowly anxiety took over my life until I isolated myself from everyone. My demeanor changed as this happened &amp; I managed to successfully ruin every relationship I had with everyone I know. Thereâ€™s no saving those friendships, &amp; I find that every new person I meet just seems to instantly dislike me. I feel like Iâ€™m locked in a soundproof room made of windows always just looking outside my walls instead of trying to find a way out... but there is no way out. Thereâ€™s no coming back from feeling this terrible about yourself &amp; everything that surrounds you. I can either hold onto this terrible slice of hell I have &amp; watch as things just manage to get worse than I thought possible.. or I can just slit my wrists tonight &amp; whatever happens after that will be my last adventure. I donâ€™t know. But I write this here because I expect no one I know to ever see this &amp; I expect to go through with my plan within a week. I really didnâ€™t want this to be how my life went, I really tried making something for myself. The fact that Iâ€™ve lived with never ending thoughts as complicated as this stupid paragraph for the past 3 years is all the evidence I need to prove I really tried to be a fighter &amp; be happy.
