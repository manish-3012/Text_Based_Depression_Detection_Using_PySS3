I'm so close to done. I can't live like this.I am a disabled transgender man in desperate need of chest surgery. I receive ssi benefits so I have very little income, sometimes I can't even cover basic necessities. My insurance won't pay for surgery and I have tried every possible loop hole. There's a local surgeon that offers financial aid but the remaining costs have to be paid up front. My chest causes crippling anxiety and depression that keeps me stuck at home most days. When I do get out I am completely miserable and in fear for my safety. Binding my chest causes rashes, bruises, and other skin problems. I feel completely invisible. Nobody wants to help. A local alternative club told me they don't do personal benefits then did one for someone else a week later. My go fund me campaign is a complete bust and I see people with ridiculous campaigns making thousands every hour. I feel like nobody cares. I've done all that I can do and it's not enough. I'm sick and tired of living like this. My entire life is on hold. My dream is to go to college and work with Trans youth but I can't do anything. I do everything I can for everyone else and get absolutely nothing in return. I don't want to be another statistic but I'm not even living right now. I can't do this anymore.
