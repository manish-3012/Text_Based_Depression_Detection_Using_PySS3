I nearly did itNot going to mention how as it violates the rules but I came very very close to killing myself about an hour ago. 
I'm on the verge of dropping out of a prestigious university in London. I'm have a bad anxiety and depression, and am fundamentally not happy with what I'm studying. I don't know what I want to do. The depression causes me to see the negatives in everything and nothing interests me other than aimlessly browsing reddit because I have a short attention span. 

So yeah I'm probably going to drop out. I could transfer to philosophy because I used to be interested in it but I don't care anymore. I can't understand anything I read so I'd be screwed with philosophy.

I'm going to have to drop out. Leave uni. Leave London. Go back to my shitty home town and work a shitty job. Maybe I'll reapply but I doubt I'll be able to return to London and end up in some shitty university town that I hate. I'll also be 21. Won't graduate until 24. Fuck. But maybe I won't because I'll never find interest in anything ever again. I'll just be a burden on my family forever. 

All my dreams are dead and I probably will be too soon.
