Some point soon, I'll have a gun in hand, probably look through this sub one last time, and then nothing, finallyI don't know why others seem to love life. Being alive is a problem that you have to solve yourself. Life certainly doesn't bring me happiness anymore, I don't think it ever did. I don't understand people who can be truly happy. Even drugs don't make me happy anymore. Life is just a series of things and expectations that you fail to live up to, but that's my own fault. I could've been better if I wanted to but I'm just not a good enough person.
