I've got everything going for me and yet...Hi Reddit,

This is my first time posting ever. I need help. I've been diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I take my pills every day. I'm surrounded by people that love me. I've been told I'm pretty, talented, funny, nice, etc. I have a boyfriend. I have a loving family that is paying for my college education (though I dropped out because the depression was so bad). I have a roof over my head. I was in a sorority surrounded by tons of friends. I used to be a division I athlete before I dropped out. Everything is right in my life.
Everything, except me. I'm miserable all the time. I honestly want to kill myself. I've tried twice to hang myself but it didn't work. All I got was the impression of a rope around my neck. I've never felt this down in my life. I think of all the mistakes I've made and I just wish I could go back in time and relive my life, knowing what I do now. I don't know what to do. If I didn't live in a state where it was so hard to get a gun I probably would have shot myself a long time ago.
I know this is just rambling and probably doesn't make any sense, but I just want to get everything out. 
I'm so sorry I feel this way. I shouldn't.
