Iâ€™m ready.Iâ€™m ready to go now. Iâ€™m not angry or upset anymore, I just know now it is the time. Iâ€™ve struggled with this decision for a while, but Iâ€™ve found out Iâ€™m going to be a father to a one night stand. 

I know this seems selfish of me to do this, but I feel like I need to do this before the child forms an emotional attachment to me. 

The child isnâ€™t the reason for the â€œneed to leaveâ€ before anyone says it is a bad reason to die, but has helped me cement my thoughts. I just canâ€™t inflict myself on one more person.

Iâ€™m not out rushing to do it tonight, Iâ€™m going to plan it, I donâ€™t want to botch it and I donâ€™t want it to hurt anymore than it has to. 

Iâ€™ve created this throwaway account just so I can have a final connect with people, other people that may understand the reasoning. 

Thanks for reading.
