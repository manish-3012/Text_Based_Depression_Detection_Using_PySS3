Life is Truly HopelessIâ€™ve had a really, really shitty life. Iâ€™ve been raped by cops, sexual predators around the world and I keep fighting for the underdog.

We also live in a world where forgiveness isnâ€™t possible. So Iâ€™m damned if I do and damned if I donâ€™t. I really just want to fold my hand and we done.

I donâ€™t have a racist, homophobic, xenophobic bone in my body...and all people do is criticize me for standing up for people. Itâ€™s not a pity party for one. The probability of self harm is 0%. 

Iâ€™ve tried to commit suicide in the past on several occasions. So this isnâ€™t brand new territory. As with most things I canâ€™t even do that right ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ j use dark humor to cope. I donâ€™t even think I should post this. But I will.
