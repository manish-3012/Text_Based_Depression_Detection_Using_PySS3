Slicing wide open my femoral and carotid arteries in six hours, wonder if anyone cares. Probably not.I'm done with all of the bullshit.  I've been so stupid to think that I could have a happy and normal life with Asperger's Syndrome.  No one wants to be your friend, no one wants to be in a relationship with you, no one wants to fuck you, all because of how you act.  I can't change it.  There will be no hope for me.  There are no "how to" guides that aren't scams.  There are no "free pdf" self help guides.  I'm done waiting.  Not even my "friends" care.  I've tried dating in college, they all make up bullshit excuses.  I've burned so many bridges.  I've tried online dating, no one I've matched with is within 50 miles.  I can't drive anywhere (parents don't trust me because I had an accident).  I don't go out with friends or do any activities.  I enjoy nothing anymore.  No stupid "hobbies" or any of those crap suggestions please.  Not even the drugs I abuse can take away the pain anymore.  Don't even try to tell me that there's more to life than this, I'll never be happy without it.  If I can never have it, I will never feel happy, and will never be okay with myself.  I don't even know why I'm posting this here.  There's really nothing that will change my situation.  
  
The world would be better without a whiny bitch like me, so in six hours, if I don't see a reason not to, I'm walking into the woods somewhere, drinking a bunch of alcohol so I bleed out faster, and cutting my femoral and carotid arteries with my Spyderco.  Maybe it'll do some wild animals some good.  At least I'll be liquid for the centipedes as they eat away my memories.  
  
  
Edit 1: I'll be here another 24 hours
