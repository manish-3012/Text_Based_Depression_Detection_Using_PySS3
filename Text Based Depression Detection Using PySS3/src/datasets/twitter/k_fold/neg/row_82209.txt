I woke up today feeling "good." It disappeared within an hour. Now I feel stupid for not trying harder to feel that way, and stupid for choosing to kill myself because I "could feel better if i tried harder."I want to kill myself but I don't know if I have the spine. I hate this. I wish I would drop dead.

I feel stupid, because even when I feel "good", I still want to die. Even when I know if i just tried harder and wnted happiness more, I could get it, I just don't care, and want to die. I want to want suicide. I disgust myself. i don't want to do this anymore. I'm so stupid for all of this.

And honestly, I think the only reason i'm "feeling better" is because it's almost time to kill myself. Being close to attempting is supposed to make people feel good sometimes, right?
