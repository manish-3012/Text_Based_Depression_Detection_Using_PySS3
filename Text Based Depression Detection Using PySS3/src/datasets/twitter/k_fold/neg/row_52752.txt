A different approachWe need a different approach to reach out to people that deal with these thoughts... I'm kinda tired of hearing "you are loved, you aren't alone, no don't do it"...i'm just sayin..... They say we are loved but we don't feel loved... They say we are not alone but who stays up with us to cry at night(if u do. Idk) idk i'm just sayin.. A different appraoch man.... I suggest bringing up a happy time in history that made us all smile... Idk... Like when Kanye said he wants to run for president.. That was kinda fun to hear
