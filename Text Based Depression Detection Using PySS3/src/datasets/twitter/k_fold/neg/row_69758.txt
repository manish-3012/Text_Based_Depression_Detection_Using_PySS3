Dysphoria and unchangable situations/ suicide solutionSo I'm 8 days from quitting hrt. Why? Because I'm too scared to be humiliated and targeted by the world.

Only for that anxiety and fear to be replaced with soul wrenching dysphoria over the fact I was too scared as a child to speak up and say I wanted to be a girl. Dooming me to irreversible puberty.


Other things people deal with, with enough effort can. Can be changed.

Drug addicts can get clean, obese people can lose weight, anorexics can gain weight.


But not puberty, it will never be reversed and will stay forever. And it will always be a barrier you can never undo and it's the one that ensures as a transgender woman you can never blend in and be normal, you will always be noticed, be a target, be a freak, be ostracised. Only the lucky ones escape that. And I don't want to live to experience that nor live as a man and let them win.

The only pathway, the only chance to go back or be born was what I want to be, is suicide.

The only possible path to my happiness is through death. No which way about it, it's concrete and final. That's the only chance I have.

Because that chance is better than staying here, suffering in silent repression, trapped in a body I can never escape, that no amount of hrt or surgery could alter.

Because it's the only chance to become real.

And some people will agree this is what I deserve as an aberration of the human race, I'm a waste of oxygen. And I agree. I failed to suppress and keep this condition under wraps when I repressed as a child.

The only way to fix me. Is to end me.
