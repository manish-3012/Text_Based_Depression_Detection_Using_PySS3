Iâ€™m sorry if I hurt anyone from saying thsiIâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m bothering you and others by writing this and just becoming another statistic. I donâ€™t mean to hurt people or bother people but thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve been told I am in my life and itâ€™s all Iâ€™ve every been in my life, itâ€™s almost like a self fulfilling prophecy. I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m posting this here. What I do know is that Iâ€™m completely alone now. I canâ€™t control my anger and I hurt the people that love me the most and Iâ€™m putting an end to it once and for all. 

I guess Iâ€™ll just tell my story one last time. 

Iâ€™ve been through a lot in my life, seen a lot of things no child should have to see. Iâ€™m 18, btw. Almost 19. I grew up having a very rough childhood and they always said it will get better and things will be better, but they arenâ€™t. And they never will be because Iâ€™ve been living off of the broken promises that things will get better when they have just been getting worse for years after years after years. I grew up as a really nice kid; loving, caring, and sweet. I tried to make everyone happy in life because Iâ€™ve seen all the hurt in the world but all that has happened to me and all the trauma has changed me drastically for the worse and just
I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m mentally unstable. I hurt the people who love me the most because Iâ€™m psychotic. And I canâ€™t control my episodes and just I canâ€™t I CNST DO THIS ANYMOREz
All I ever fucking wanted was to make people happy and smile but I just end up hurting them I canâ€™t do this anymore I want to fucking die so I am going to die. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m fucking sorry I donâ€™t want to burden anyone anymore but itâ€™s like no matter what I do or where I turn it just wonâ€™t stop it wonâ€™t stop it never stops
