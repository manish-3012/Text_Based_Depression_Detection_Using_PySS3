My therapist said I need to see a psychologist but the only one covered by my insurance is booked for two months. I'm actually sick today with a fever of over 100f and i just can't stand the pain anymoreI don't want to die. But no matter how hard I try I always end up here, feeling worse then ever. 

AND ALL THIS JUST BECAUSE I WAS Born a few weeks early and couldn't breathe for 7 min and now my body is FUCKED. I'm not human enough to take care of myself by myself so i guess it's time to die. 

And it's so dumb we have the technology and tho resources that I could probably live a pretty okay life without even leaching off of society that hard... But no, Humans are shity and we decided the 90% of shit should go to 1% of people. And we decided everything needs to be a competition so that anyone let's not all there is less then a second class citizen. We don't even get scraps.
