Give me one reason not to kill myselfA couple of weeks ago my therapist said that I simply lack the motivation to change anything in my life. They say that feeling like this is my choice. 

I have almost no friends. Only a couple of people see me occasionally out of pity. Some talk to me in between classes at uni, but that's nothing really. See I had to take a year off because I was sick and ended up being hospitalized. Now I am back, but the new people  I am around don't really want anything to do with me, neither do the old ones that I was kind of friendly with-but only because I was around them all the time at school.

It's no wonder really, I am ashamed of it but sometimes I don't shower for days, right now I have a huge hobo beard and often times I don't even brush my teeth. I am fat and disgusting.

I will never have any friends or a boyfriend. I guess it's my choice as they say. 

There's nothing good in my life, I just go through the motions every day and nothing makes me happy or content. I feel miserable and terrible. 

I will never be happy and I see no reason to live. I really want to die. No one can help and I can't help myself.
