i'm so tired of everythingFirst of all, I'm sorry for the grammar mistakes. English is not my first language.
Anyways. 
I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so fucking tired of everything, of everyone. Tired of crying untill 4am, of being replaced or ignored, of making efforts who nobody notices, of going to school and pretending everything is okay, of cutting myself without any purpose. 
Tired of always feeling hopeless, to always feeling like my soul is tearing apart, to always feel like i'm the worst and most useless person alive...
I've already assumed that i'm not going to be alive at summer. I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts since i was fucking 11. I've lost myself a lot of time ago so who the fuck is going to care about this.
If you've read everything, i'm sorry. I always try to do my best, I swear.
