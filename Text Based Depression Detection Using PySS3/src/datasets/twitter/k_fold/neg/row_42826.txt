Where do I start...?So....to start out, I have to say that I usually despise talking about any problems with anyone because of the Hero Complex I have, but here Im, posting this all over the Internet. So, I don't exactly want to explain my situation, since I have a fairly decent life. I highly doubt my life is important to you, after comparing it to the shitty lives many people that post here are force to lead.

So anyway, here's the thing. I've been randomly cutting myself for no goddamn reason. I'll usually take a sharp scissors, and suddenly slice a few cuts into my wrist. Then, immediately afterwards, I'll act abnormally rational. Here's my basic thought process after I do it: "Why the hell did you do that, Mariah? What the hell? Damn, that's bleeding a lot. Ok, go disinfect it. Now go put a band-aid on it, make sure it doesn't get infected.   Ok, now put a long-sleeve shirt on, you don't want anyone to see that. You should probably make up a story, just in case anyone asks. You alright now, good. You're an idiot." 

My question is: Is this kind of behavior normal? I really have no discernible reason that I can think of for cutting myself, only that I know I have to bottle up any emotions I'm feeling because of my hero complex. I hate asking for help, but I've got to know: Why do I think so rationally after doing something so irrational?
