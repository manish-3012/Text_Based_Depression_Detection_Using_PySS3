I can't take it anymoreI've been job hunting for months. Every time it looks I'm close to getting a job, I end up not getting it and back at square one. I just feel like I'll be stuck in my shity retail job forever. I hate it so much there. Every time I go in for a shift I have to stop anxiety pills just to stop myself from having a panic attack and feeling like putting a loaded rifle in my mouth. But I can't just quit because I really need the money and I told myself I wouldn't quit until I found another job because that's the smart thing to do. I just feel like such a huge loser lately and that no one will ever hire me and I'll never move on to a job I love. I just feel so helpless and hopeless and just like giving up and lying down and dying. My job is making me feel that awful, and the stress of interviewing for several places and never hearing back from any of them or hearing back from them and saying I'm not the right fit for the job is just making me feel worse. They keep saying they want someone with experience. How am I supposed to get experience in the field I'm applying for if no one will hire me and give me a chance? I just want to give up everything at this point.
