Losing the Battle.Simple as that. I've been fighting hard since elementary school. But no one has ever gave a damn but one person. Mental health is so bad I cant even get up to go to work. I'm in a state i dont give a shit about, I'm in limbo with so many things its driving me crazy.

Therapy doesn't help. Just gives me another thing to dread and throw money at until I'm in the red. 

Cant wait to be another number. Another statistic. Another loser ass tranny who kills herself because she's too much of a failure to make anything of herself. 

Life is never worth living.
