Writing suicide noteDoes writing a suicide note make it more likely that you want to actually do it? After watching a medical programme that featured the after effects of suicide, for those left behind was the not knowing why. It seemed practical to me to write a note even if did not plan to end it there and then. Have revised it a few times since but not deleted it. One of the main reasons I have not done it is can't find a definite way that would be 100% successful and did not involve others.
