I've lurked this subreddit for a year, wanting to ask for help, but I was always too nervous. Now, I don't know where else to turn.Hello there.

I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts and tendencies for nearly four years- but I recently hit a wall I just can't get over alone. I woke up this morning with intent to hurt myself tonight, but I decided to try this first. Maybe one of you has some insight that'll help.

The nature of my problem is unrequited love. I'm still really nervous, so I don't want to really discuss it in such an open spot, but maybe PMs would work better?

I don't know what else to say, and I need to submit this before I have second thoughts about asking. I'm sorry if this is all a jumbled mess.
