Advice pleaseSo I want to die. Every night I either try to or plan it out and I don't know if I can keep going on like this. I need to do something like a psych program again but I'm scared to tell my mom because I feel like she'll be upset or disappointed. And I can't leave school because I'm failing and I need my grades up before the semester or I go to summer school and I'd probably kill myself I had to go. So does anyone have any advice on what I should do?
