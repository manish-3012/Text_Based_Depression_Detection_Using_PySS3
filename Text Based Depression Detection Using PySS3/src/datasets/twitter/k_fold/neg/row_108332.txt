Mental Health question about Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)Probably an inquiry best suited to another portion of Reddit, but given my thoughts are lingering on suicide I'm putting it here for now.

Has anyone tried TMS as a treatment for depression or OCD? And, if so, did it help you?

Part of me worries about something so intentionally designed to causing lasting changes to my brain, but given the state of my mind I'm not sure such fears are rational.
