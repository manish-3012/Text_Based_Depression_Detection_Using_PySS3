Why shouldn't I?I'm 22, and I've made some seriously poor decisions in my life. I dropped out of school after 3 years with a 1.3 gpa, tried to go back but failed again in my probation semester. Lost my girlfriend of 5 years, had to move back in with my parents. 
That was all a couple years ago. I've been pretty depressed since then, but that's not really what's going on. Now, I have $100k in student loan debt with no job. Why do I have no job? I just got fired because I was stealing money. It was the only way I could make ends meet, and I did what I thought I had to do. Now I'm caught, and I'm being asked to repay what I took in exchange for no charge. I can't afford that either, so they're probably going to charge me. I've taken a felony amount, so I'm looking at jail for up to 5 years. So now I have no job, no friends, a ton of debt, a possibility of a felony arrest that would ruin my life, and no real hope for a future. So someone please tell me, why shouldn't I do it?
