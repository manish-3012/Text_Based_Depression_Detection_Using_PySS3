My girlfriend needs helpMy girlfriend has depression and has contemplated suicide many times, and cuts. I myself have these problems, but I've chosen to get help, she won't. I'm worried sick about her because she won't tell ANYONE but me about her problems, and makes me swear not to tell anyone, but if I did it could save her life... what the fuck do I do? I've tried being there for her every time but I just don't seem to have the impact I want to have. Thanks for any advice.
