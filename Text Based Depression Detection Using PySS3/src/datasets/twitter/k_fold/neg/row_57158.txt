Suicide CravingHi SuicideWatch, I have a problem that I think is relatively unique and would like whatever insight you feel like providing.

I am 32 years old and happily married to a 33 year old, no marital troubles, I am medicated for Bipolar Disorder and for the past six or seven months I have been craving death.

It feels sort if like any other craving, like for chocolate or a smoke or a sexual impulse, except it's for death.

When I have trouble sleeping, I fantasize about being dead and it helps relax me to sleep.

What the hell?  This is most certainly not normal and is a very dangerous thing.
