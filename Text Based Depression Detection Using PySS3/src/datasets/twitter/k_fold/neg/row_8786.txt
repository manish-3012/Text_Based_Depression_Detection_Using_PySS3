Every Goddamn DayEvery goddamn day I fight it. Every day I have convince myself that impaling myself into something sharp isn't with it. Every day I come up with an excuse. "You really want to see that concert". "You have a trip soon". Sometimes I drag the bottom of the barrel. "You just did your hair". "The weather looks nice tomorrow".

I have toyed with that line. Still do. I have held the sharp thing in my hand and felt the cold. Imagined so realistically the intake of breath as I push past the resistance point of flesh. Always into my chest. Always.

Everyday I put it down and walk away. Every fucking day. I have no idea how long it will last. Thirty-six years so far.

I don't post this for a response. Won't even answer if you do. I just needed a place to say it. To put it out there. 

I will save myself. I always do.

Every. Fucking. Day.
