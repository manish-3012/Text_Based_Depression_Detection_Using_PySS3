I don't know why but i just wanna dieI could never understand my mind. I hate people but still I want someone to talk to. I hate my parents but I still have to live for them. I always wanted to be a good bf but I could never sustain a long term relationship. I wanted a better job and now that I have one. I am still not happy. I moved away from my friends and everyone I loved. And I really find no reason in living.
