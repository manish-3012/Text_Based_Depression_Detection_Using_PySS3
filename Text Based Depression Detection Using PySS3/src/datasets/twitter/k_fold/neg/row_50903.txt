My life isn't worth living and I don't want to keep going, I'm a fuck up and nothing moreI don't feel like anything is worth it and nothing I ever do is ever good enough. I am never going to amount to anything except for a failure no matter what. It's like nothing I ever do is ever right, I fuck up every single thing I ever try and whenever I try to help others I just make it all worse. there is no future for me and everything I do that could ever mean anything I fuck up. I don't ever do good enough I barely pass my grades but anytime I take a fucking test it says I should be one of the smartest in my grade. The only time I can ever remember actually doing good on a project was when I gave up on trying and I barely put any effort into an essay but hell that could've been the teacher just taking pitty on me cause she realized I was depressed. I don't want to live a life full of fuck ups and nothing that I've ever done good in. I feel like I'm sub human, I just want to do good enough once in awhile. I don't have to do the best I just want to do enough that I can actually feel like I'm not an absolute waste of life. A fucking fly could probably have a better life in the 3 days that they have than I could ever do in my lifetime. I know what people say about things like this, I shouldn't worry about what I'll be in the future, I'm only 15 I still have potential but seriously fuck that, I'm useless I'm nothing I am a fuck up and there is not a single good quality about me, except maybe how amazing I am at disappointing people. I fucking hate myself and I know for a fact that I'll never grow into someone who will be worth the effort of living
