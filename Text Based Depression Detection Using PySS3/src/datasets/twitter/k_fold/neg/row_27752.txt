i ruined my life, no point in continuing.Hi everyone,

I am posting here because I have no one to talk to. I ruined my life and there is no point in continuing on. I'm old and never made anything out of myself. I've never done anything interesting. I'm essentially worthless (and I don't mean this in a self-loathing way but I have no value to offer this world nonbias kind of way.) I have never even really dated because there's no point since I'm ugly. I dislike where I live and wish I lived in a better country. I feel like my life is never going to get better, there's really no point in trying because it's too late to do everything.
