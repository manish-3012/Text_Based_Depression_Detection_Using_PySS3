please tell me how to kill myself.please tell me: how can i reliably kill myself, with the least pain and risk involved?
the only reason i haven't tried this in over 5 years is because i am scared of surviving, and staying alive crippled forever after with no opportunity to kill myself again. that thought frightens me and i just want to die. 
how do i do it?
please, don't come at me with bullshit like 'it will get better', 'life is what you make of it', 'hold on, try harder' and shit like that. i have heard those hollow rehearsed phrases and lies all too often, and they only aggravate me because they show your ignorance.

don't tell me how to stay alive. tell me how i can reliably off myself. please.
