Hobbies!I'm just saying... find one and love it! you can't go through life with nothing to look forward to. I have always believed that you need something to stimulate and distract your brain for at least an hour every day!

For me: World of Warcraft and Anime have ALWAYS helped me when i am feeling out of it or get to stressed.
