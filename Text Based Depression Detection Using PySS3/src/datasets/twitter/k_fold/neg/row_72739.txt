When the one person you're fighting to live for, joins in on the hate wagonI've struggled with so much, especially after my first (my son's dad) husband abused me in all ways imaginable. It destroyed how I thought of myself and what I should be doing and have found ways to work around it or when I attempted I ended up pulling through and always thinking "I have to do this for my son".

It isn't enough any more, every time I talk to my almost 12 year old it is always one thing or another about how I'm being mean to his dad and grandma, or how I did this, or I did that. His tone is a mirror of what how his dad has been treating me for almost 12 years.

I'm so angry/lonely/rejected/set back/broke/broken and a hundred other feelings. I've hated myself forever and have never wanted to continue this life but have always done so because that little boy needed and loved me. Now that I'm being pushed out and hated by him too I'm very badly struggling to understand why this world is worth it.

There is so much more I could say, but does anyone have ANY advice other than "love yourself" or "Do things for yourself", because I don't know how, I have no desire to, not one thing interests me and the only reason I'm still here is so they can't turn around and tell my son how much of a "crazy psycho" I was and turn what memories he has of me into shit.
