iâ€™ve accepted the fact that iâ€™m a lost cause.iâ€™ve accepted the fact that iâ€™m a lost cause. itâ€™s not that i fully want to die, i just donâ€™t want to feel this way and after being repeatedly told by every therapist iâ€™ve ever had that they canâ€™t help me and donâ€™t know what to do, i myself donâ€™t know what else to do. if i donâ€™t kill my self then i need to just be put some where and be kept semi comfortable till the end i guess.
