i dont know what to doi have no money. no ambitions to better myself in life. i tried 2 days of the new semester and it seems like its just going to make my depression worse. i feel like im going further and further away with my relationship im in (she always tell me how angry and depressed i get every day). i cant turn to my parents for help (i cant get along with them and telling them i want to drop out will start trouble). I just want to shoot myself.... its not fair that people that dont want to live should have to. the biggest punishment for people on this planet is being alive. its only any good if you are rich. not like anyone cares anyway. this will get zero comments and hopefully ill be dead by the time anyone finds it
