Iâ€™ve made my peace with it. Itâ€™s not that I canâ€™t live without her, I just donâ€™t want to.Relationship of 7 years ended about a month and a half ago. She decided on a Tuesday she was moving out Thursday. For the first few weeks we were in digital therapy trying to work on us but sheâ€™s since said she no longer plans to return to our state and has no interest in a relationship. I havenâ€™t heard from her since Thursday and itâ€™s the most painful thing Iâ€™ve ever experienced in my life. I know the pain will get less over time, I know I could move on and find some dream girl, I know sheâ€™s moving on and doesnâ€™t see me in her future life. I know it could get better but the reality for me is, I donâ€™t want it to. I want the life I had with her, the life we were building, and while I could move on, I donâ€™t have the energy or desire to. Iâ€™m just kinda, done.
