Giving up on lifeSo i've tried everything i could to keep living, i've had 2 suicide attempts before, both end up failing, my ex now, i ended up telling her everything about i've done to myself, broke up with me, cause she couldn't handle me being suicidal,  for 21 years, i've tried reaching out to someone, that could help me, but everyone ends up leaving me, i don't know what to do... i wanted someone to convince me that life is worth for, i've been alone all my life, idk if anyone would even miss me if i'm gone  I'm planning to end my  life on new years eve
