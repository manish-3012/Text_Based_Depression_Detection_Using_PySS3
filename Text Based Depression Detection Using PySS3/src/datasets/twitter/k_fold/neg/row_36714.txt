Why do people think you must show signs of depression (or that youâ€™re suicidal) in order to validate the fact that youâ€™re actually depressed?I donâ€™t understand. 

Nobody takes me seriously because of this.
I would literally smile for one second and theyâ€™d say, 

â€œLook! It definitely looks like youâ€™re getting better now!â€ 

â€œYou donâ€™t look depressed!â€ 

Iâ€™m giving myself 2 weeks.
