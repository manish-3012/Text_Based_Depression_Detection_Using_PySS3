Planning on overdosing soonI love living a lot. I never wanted to die. However I've had a heath issue for the last 2 years that i can not seem to heal. I wont be able to get a job or support myself. I wont be able to get into a relationship. Honestly no point of living no more.  Its sucks honestly. I really want to live but ill never have the life i want. I'm honestly just surviving, i'm not living.
