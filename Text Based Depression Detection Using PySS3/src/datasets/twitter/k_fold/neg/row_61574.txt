How to tell my parentsMy name is Kane and Iâ€™m 15. Iâ€™m heavily suicidal and I donâ€™t know how to tell them. I fear that they will treat me differently like thereâ€™s something wrong with me. It will also make things between classmates and my older brother awkward. I also am scared that if I do get professional help it wonâ€™t make me better ig. I donâ€™t know can I help myself alone or not because Iâ€™d much prefer to keep it to myself. I am scared that I will kms tho if Iâ€™m still alone. Send answers please!
