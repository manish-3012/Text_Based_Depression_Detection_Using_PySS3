28 and had enoughIt's not like anything bad happened to me or anything.  I'm just sick of going to work and doing the whole 40 hour grind thing.  I have flexible hours even and get away with 20 hours.  This is even too much.  I have really simple means to live this way but I still need to work or I'll be a burden on society.


Nobody can say I didn't at least try to give this life thing a try.  I've held out for this long.
