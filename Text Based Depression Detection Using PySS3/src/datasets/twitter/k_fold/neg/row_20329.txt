Every girl I try to date is also suicidalI feel bad even posting this because so many people here come and say they can't get dates. But I really don't know how to help someone when I'm in the same situation. She told me on the 3rd date that she had attempts when she was in college and still struggles with the thoughts. I don't know if I should run because I'm also suicidal or if being with her will help us both. Blah.
