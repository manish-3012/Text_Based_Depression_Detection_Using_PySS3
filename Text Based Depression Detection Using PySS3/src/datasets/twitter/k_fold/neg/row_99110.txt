Family Only Thing Keeping Me HereI've been thinking of suicide for a few years now, but I can't afford leaving my family without my financial and emotional support. My wife also is struggling with depression. We have two kids, and my life insurance wouldn't pay out if suicide were my cause of death. I've also been struggling with alcohol recently. I don't have a plan, but I've been imagining a lot of scenarios recently where my death would seem accidental.

It's weird, because I have a good job, we have enough money for our family, and my kids are great. Sometimes it all just feels overwhelming, and I just wish I weren't here. If I didn't have a wife or kids, I think I'd be gone already, but I'm afraid that someday I may feel selfish enough to go through with one of my plans.

Professional help is almost out of the question, as the blowback on my career would be too much. I want to keep doing the same job I'm doing, and I can't afford to have a mental health record. I've tried a few online services, but everyone just asks the same questions: Have you had thoughts of suicide, do you have a plan, have you asked for professional help, tried to distract yourself, etc. Not super helpful.

I won't tell my friends or wife, for the same reason that I won't talk to professionals - there's no real gain to be had by telling someone else, and there's too much to lose. My career, relationships, and social standing would all be impacted. I just want a way that I can deal with this by myself, if that exists.

It's probably dumb to think that reddit could be any real help. Probably just 1-2 responses telling me to call a hotline, talk to a friend, or get professional help. I might even be breaking the rules of the subreddit since I just googled "suicide reddit" and found this sub. Whatever. I'm willing to try everything at this point.
