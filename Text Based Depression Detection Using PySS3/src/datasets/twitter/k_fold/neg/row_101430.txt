I'm not strong, I have no lifeI'm done. Done being the family butler. Done with anxious around people. Done being lonely. There were a lot of things I wanted to do with my life, but I guess this is it. Weird to kill yourself at 24 but whatever. I'm just tried of all this bullshit. I don't want to be here anymore. Call me weak, tell me this is all part of life that there are ups and downs. There are no ups for me. It's all negative. I don't want to live in this hell. 

Goodbye
