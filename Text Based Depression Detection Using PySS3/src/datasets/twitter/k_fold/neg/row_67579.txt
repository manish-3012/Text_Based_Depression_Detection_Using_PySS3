I tried hanging myself more seriously a few minutes agoI tried counting to 10 because I might be already unconscious after 10 seconds.

But I stepped back to the platform I "jumped" from (can't really call it jumping because it's just 1.5 feet may be because of a reflex I guess.

Now I'm feeling really bad because I don't know how to kill myself. Why doesn't society offer a pain-free way to suicide...
