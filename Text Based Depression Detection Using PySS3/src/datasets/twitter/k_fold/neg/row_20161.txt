Anyone feel like just talkingI'm kind of in a bad place because I had to do a performance today and botched it. It hurts really bad when your only aspiration is to be a singer, and you mess it up. I was so ready to, but I started having a panic attack and a bad bout of dysphoria because of my voice. I feel so awful, and I've worked myself up into a frenzy.
