Friend with suicidal Ideation: she wants my help. Need advice.I've recently made a friend that I've very quickly become close to. We both go to the same anxiety treatment center and see each other once a week there. We've been helping each other with our problems and we know things about each other that we've never told anyone else.

Last night we had one of our more serious conversations. I know she's tried to commit suicide several times since the age of seven, her most recent attempt having been about three or four months ago. She still struggles with ideation and self-harm. We were both talking about how we violently reject any sort of positive remarks or offers of support from people, almost like we're offended by these "lies" people tell us.

She then asked me something that I can only imagine was insanely difficult to ask: she asked if it was okay for her to talk to me when she starts struggling with episodes of suicidal ideation. Of course I said yes without hesitation; I love this girl more than anyone, and she's been through so maybe horrible things and deserves any support I could possibly give her.

But I'm not sure how to go about this. She wants me to be able to sort of pull her out of those kinds of moods, and I know I won't be able to do that. But I want to give her as much help as I can. So... What can I do?
