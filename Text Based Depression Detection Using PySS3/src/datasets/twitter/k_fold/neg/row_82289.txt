I need advice and helpYesterday I've had enough of everything. I got extremely drunk and decided I'll finally do it. So i came home, went to the medicine cabinet and took a combination of 30+ pills. I don't know what most of them were, but a few of them were benzos and painkillers, all in combination with alcohol. I woke up today, 3 hours ago and I'm in horrible condition. I threw up so many times I don't have anything left to throw up and as soon as I drink some tea or water I just throw it up again. My head hurts extremely bad and my heart rate is 120+ Can I count on my body to naturally get rid of all the toxins or do I need to go to the hospital and explain what I did? If I don't need to I'd really want to avoid it because I don't want my family to know, I just told them I'm feeling sick. If anyone ever went through this any advice or help would be appreciated, thanks
