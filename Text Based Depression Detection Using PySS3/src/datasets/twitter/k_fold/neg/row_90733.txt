Would you go back to abuse?Even if it was family? I've been physically abused by my father; and verbally/emotionally abused by my mother and sister all my life. I have Aspergers Syndrome which wasn't diagnosed until I was an adult, so they preyed on my weakness. They are trying to pull me back into their narcissistic web by using guilt, and throughout the extended family I'm seen as the bad one, when I did anything and everything for my family. I could go into detail but no one would read it. Would you go back if your family was like this? Please give me your honest thoughts.
