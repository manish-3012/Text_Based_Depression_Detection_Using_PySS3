Is my destination predetermined?I feel like my suicide is inevitable. It might not be tomorrow, next week or even next year, but I've already made piece with the fact that I will probably die by my own hand.

I'm literally telling myself every day "Not today". I've been able to survive like this the past few years. Nothing makes me happy and I feel like I failed in life. I thought being successful in my career or having a family would change things, but it doesn't. I love my family and want to see my kids grow old, but I don't know how long I can hold out like this. Everything around me is constantly changing,  but my mental state seems to stay the same. 

My tank is running on empty and all I want to do is live a long and happy life. I haven't felt true happiness in years...
