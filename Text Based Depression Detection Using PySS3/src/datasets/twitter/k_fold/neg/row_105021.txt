conflicting values, suffering, etc etcwhen do you sacrifice your own values and or beliefs for some other good? and how do you even make this judgement considering that your values and beliefs can shift? and when you cant tell what good or lack of good will come from each decision?

i am left to make multiple decisions based on this, its utterly impossible.

the most pressing and relevant one for here is that of death. as it stands, i currently dont think any amount of good is worth even the smallest amount of suffering. therefore, life shouldnt exist. however, obviously, i cant just have the whole world die, and the vast vaat majority dont share this belief anyways. and im not even sure if i believe it, i cant tell.

because of this, i feel it is right to die. me living causes suffering elsewhere, lots that im not even aware of, just based upon how global society is built up, how, essentially, our global economic system functions. and of course there are other reasons, as youd expect from someone posting here, i think im a bad person for a multitude of reasons, and whatever good i have is outweighted by it. but really, thst is secondary and can be ignored in this case.

the problem is, since the entire world isnt joining me, my suicide itself would cause pain. the best i could do is make it look like an accident, still not too much better though. regardless, i cant tell if me just living is the better option or not. both options, commiting and not, seem wrong.

i do have this drive to die, perhaps from mental illness (if youd like to call it that), that has me even consider this, i guess since i dont feel bound to the idea that living us a good thing (from what i understand this isnt common). im not sure if i am ill or its the world, blinded by their own brains telling them life is good so they stay alive, instead of the truth, that life isnt.

essentially, i have no time to make a decision. i can push this back again a couple of months, like i recently did, which is a decision to stay, at least temporaraly. my grades in uni are about to tank if i dont get back to work, so i have to do something. just lost really. and being dead would absolve me of all of this. and this is not the only situation in which i have to make a choice of this kind, there is at least one more that involves conflicting values that i have to figure out, although its a bit less time-sensitive and less final as well.
