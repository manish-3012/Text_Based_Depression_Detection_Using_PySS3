RIP 6 weeks soberI thought depression was behind me. Whatever I do I make my mom disappointed, aswell as my girlfriend of 5 years broke up with my bitch ass.
I still love you Felicia, please come back
I always turn to alcohol whenever I feel depressed. The only solution would be to end it all. I don't want to be a redditfag browsing reddit and drinking all day when I'm not at work. I have no friends, my family hates me and I'm to selfconcious to go out and do something by myself (unless it's going to the liqour store)
