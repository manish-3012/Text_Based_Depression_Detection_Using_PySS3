I am sorryI am drunk and I took everything I could find. And all I can think of is how sorry I am. I am so sorry I am not strong enough. I am so sorry I never fit into this world and that I have felt like an outsider my entire life even though people were lovely and welcoming. I am so sorry, Dad.  I know you loved me more than anything. Please forgive me. Everyone, please forgive me. I know I never could. I had many dreams. In none of which I was happy.  Please forgive me.

I am sorry to bother you, Reddit. I am sorry, to all the people I have bothered in my life.
