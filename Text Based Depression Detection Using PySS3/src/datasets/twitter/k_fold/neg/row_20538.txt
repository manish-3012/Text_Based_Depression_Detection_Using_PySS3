I don't know what else to doI don't know what else to do but post here. It feels wrong asking help from strangers. My emotions have taken over and I've been battling so much pain for so long. The big problem in front of me and why I'm posting here is that I've just learned my ex has moved on to another guy. It's pathetic I know but it's hurting way more than it should. It's been 8 months but I still love her with all my heart. She is the thing in my life that ever made me truly happy, that made the pain stop. Now the though of her being with another guy is a pain I didn't expect. I though I would be ready for this, that I could handle it but I can't. I don't think I can can handle it. I can't stop shaking and I am not sure how to stop this pain. I just want my life back back. I want her back. I want my family back. I want to be happy again. I've been going to therapy and trying so hard to move forward, to stop this pain and depression, but everything always gets worse. I though she was the answer, true happiness. A life I felt I could live. Now I feel like I truly have nothing left. Somebody please give me some kind of answer. Im sorry for asking but I don't know what else to do. I don't know how to stop this pain.
