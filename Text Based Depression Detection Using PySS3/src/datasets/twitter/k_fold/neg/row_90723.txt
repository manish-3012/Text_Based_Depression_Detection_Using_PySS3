I am, a despicable, rotten personThere are multiple reasons I want to end my life. There are very few reasons I do not want to end my life.

I want to end it, not because me and my girlfriend fight constantly, not because I get rejected from every job I apply at so I'm stuck with my current one, not because I am unable to get out of my circle of debt. Self loathing may be a big part of it' I hate the way I am, I hate the way I treat others, and I hate how I treat myself. I've tried to change, seek help, but therapy is unaffordable right now

Tbh, the straw that broke the camels back was just because my glasses broke today. Didnt have super glue, tape wasnt working. I work from home, and tried to find something to put them back together, I couldn't, so I harmed.

My girlfriend just broke up with me, because my glasses broke and I qas stressed out about it qhen I text her, all she had to say to me saying I was fucked was "yep". Felt like she didn't care, no one ever really genuinely cares about me anyways unless there is something in it for them. Thinking on this, drove me over the edge, I harmed again.

Graduated high school 10 years ago, I have done nothing with my life my 28 years on this planet. I feel like a despicable rotten failure, who will never get out of this hole I'm in, so I may as well lie in it and die in it.

Been told my whole life, it will get better, but it fucking doesnt, nothing gets fucking better. So fuck anyone that says so, because you're lying to yourself
