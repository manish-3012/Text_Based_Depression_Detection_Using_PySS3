I hate everythingMy name is Quintin and I've been depressed for years now. I wish I was loved by someone. The only thing that was keeping me sane was my delusions of being loved, but now they stopped working. I'm not good at anything. I refuse to leave my house now because it hurts to see happy people with their friends and family. I hate it so much, I hate them so much. I'll never be able to connect with someone and have happiness like them. My only escape from this hate filled life is death and I can't stop thinking about it.
