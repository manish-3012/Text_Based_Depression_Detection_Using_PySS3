Idk anymoreI called the Suicide Hotline twice today because I just wanted to talk - literally just talk because it was a struggle to open my mouth at all today.

This is my situation that I know no one will empathize with me for, making me feel even more depressed and suicidal: I'm a 23 year old guy who recently experienced loss of my eyebrow hairs. I got microblading done (natural looking semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo) a couple months ago and the regret has been KILLING me. It's faded and looks terrible and obvious and I spend every waking second wishing I never did it and I'm so self conscious now. I've become reclusive and depressed. Yes, over a fucking eyebrow tattoo. 

It's the constant thinking about it that's killing me. I feel embarrassed, ashamed, stupid, exhausted, paranoid, anxious ALL THE TIME. The past few days I've just been at home, trying not to think about it, but I can't not. I'm not going to kill myself over this, but it's definitely killing me. And it's hard because I KNOW how dumb this sounds but it's a nightmare ON MY FACE that I have to live with... I can't believe this is my life right now. 

I've been through actual shit in my life like dealing with my parent's divorce, calling the cops on them, raising my little brother, taking care of my aging grandma, dealing with my friend's suicide attempt, heartbreaks, you name it. But I've NEVER felt like this before because I feel like I did it to myself and there's NO ONE who can understand and will look at me normally now. I've gotten stares, I feel like people are whispering, I can't live like this. I feel like a freak and I don't think I'll ever be the same again...

Sigh. Just ranting. Another sleepness night.
