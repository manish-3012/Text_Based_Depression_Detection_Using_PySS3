My husband is forcing me to live. I donâ€™t know if I can love him after that.Everything has been a nightmare since graduating college in May 2019. I got fired from the job I got out of college, Iâ€™ve been unemployed since August 2019, and I canâ€™t qualify for unemployment or disability for my depression. Although I got married in November, Iâ€™m still miserable. I love my husband with all my heart but even that hasnâ€™t been good enough to keep me going. 

I had a breakdown last month about being unemployed and useless. Heâ€™s a PhD student with two years left to graduate and heâ€™s a research assistant. His pay is the only thing keeping our heads above water right now. He said that heâ€™ll just DROP OUT and get a job somewhere with his Bachelorâ€™s. However, this is the worst economy weâ€™ve been in since the 2008 recession. I donâ€™t want him to give up his pay that heâ€™s receiving for being in his PhD track in Computer Science. CS is guaranteed 6 figures when you end up working at Google or become a professor. Heâ€™d be giving up his goals in life for me and I wonâ€™t be able to live with myself. It would make us worse off.  I know that he loves me but I feel that anyone would resent you for that. 

I feel like he (whether intentional or not) gave me an ultimatum. Live on in misery or have him give up his dreams and potentially resent me for it. Heâ€™s forcing me to stay alive and be miserable. I donâ€™t know if I can love him after he told me that he might drop out. He has his whole life ahead of him and Iâ€™m not sure I can stand another 2 years before he gets a tech job. My depression and social anxiety is the worst itâ€™s ever been, and I just want the pain to stop. I wish I never met him so that I wonâ€™t feel guilty about leaving any loved ones behind. All of my other family can die for all I care.
