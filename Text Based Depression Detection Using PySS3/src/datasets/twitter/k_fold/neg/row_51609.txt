I care too muchI consider myself a highly ethical person. I care about the environment and animal rights etc.

I care about the actions of others too much - to the extent that it effects my own mental health. I tend to be highly critical in general. 

I simply cannot carry the emotional load of myself along with that of others.

How can I learn to be more accepting in general, as well as accept my (miserable, lonely) place in life?
