Drunk, my birthday, wanna dieIâ€™m pretty drunk. Itâ€™s my 21st birthday. Thereâ€™s no point in livin anymore. No one would care if I died. People would actually benefit. I donâ€™t want to live any more. My parents want me out of their house and their lives. None of my old friends would notice, and I donâ€™t have any new ones. For fucks sake my sister wants my dog and if Iâ€™m dead she can have him. I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore.
