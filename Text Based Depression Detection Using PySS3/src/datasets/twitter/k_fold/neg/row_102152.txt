to the void...I say this a lot but it always takes too much effort for me to explain without feeling stupid or like no one gets it, so I hope someone on here might.

I feel like everything in life is easily replaceable, and therefore I am not necessary. And I don't that that is a bad thing. But in almost everyone's life I can be replaced with another person. My significant other will initially be distraught, but they will also get another significant other. I'm not any of my friend's "only" friend. I'm not even my best friend's best friend. But that's life. And it's inexplicable, but like I all know I mean very little to a vast majority of people I meet, and I am as equally as forgettable to them as they are to me. And in a year or so I would have new friends to represent my changing as a person and the changes of my interests, and thus people in my life are replaced with others. I'm not special, so I can say I know this is a normal human thing, but that makes me replaceable. And if I am replaceable then me being around is not necessary. thanks for coming to my TedTalk.
