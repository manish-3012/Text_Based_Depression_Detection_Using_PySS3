Iâ€™m suicidal. I pretend like Iâ€™m not but I am.My head is always spinning with darkness. I canâ€™t ever sleep without nightmares creeping in. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m already dead but Iâ€™m not. I canâ€™t feel anything anymore. I donâ€™t cry. I donâ€™t smile. I donâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m so empty. Itâ€™s like someoneâ€™s erased all the colour in the world, leaving only black and white. Night never comes soon enough. Counselling doesnâ€™t work. Talking to people doesnâ€™t work. I donâ€™t know what to do. It would be so easy to just stop all the aching. All the pain. All the heartbreak. Everything. I wish I could stop everything. The only thing that Iâ€™m here for is my family, only a few people in it though. I wish You could pick your family because some of them have just...broken me. I debate death everyday and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
