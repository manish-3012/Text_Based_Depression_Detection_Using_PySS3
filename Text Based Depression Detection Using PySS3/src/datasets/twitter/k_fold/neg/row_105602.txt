I'm having a really really bad timeI'm not sure where to go with this. This week has been very bad mental health wise. I had to make the very hard decision to put down my dog, I got her when I was 5 and I spent 16 amazing years with my happy girl and being there in the room was one of the hardest things I've ever done, I feel like I betrayed her, like I could have done so much more for her. I miss her so much.
And to top it all off, I've been off of my antidepressants after stopping them cold turkey due to a health emergency and I haven't felt this low In a long long time.
I'm drunk at home right now and Im scared I could do something stupid, I just need some reassurance that I did the right thing, and that things can get better, cause right now it really doesn't feel like they can
