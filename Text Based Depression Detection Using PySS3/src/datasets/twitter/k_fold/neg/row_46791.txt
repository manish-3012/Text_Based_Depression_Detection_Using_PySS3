Standby?I know someone who owns a shotgun and has been suicidal for years. He recently told me that he doesnâ€™t think he can make it to the end of 2019. He hasnâ€™t replied to my messages since, I know he didnâ€™t do it, because he wouldnâ€™t do it so soon, but he is going to do it very soon. I last talked to him a few days ago. Is it wrong that I messaged a company that he worked for and gave his name telling them a warning? He programmed this companies website or something. Is that none of my business? Is it wrong for me to do that? And last if all, if he does commit suicide, will I be to blame because Iâ€™m the last person heâ€™s talked to?

QUESTION: WILL I BE BLAMED FOR HIS SUICIDE? WHAT DO I DO?


I do not know this man in real life I only known him online for a year
