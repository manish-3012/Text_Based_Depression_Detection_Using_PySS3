Day 3 of "give it a week"Thats the advice I was given. Someone mentioned suicide is usually impulsive. Said to give it a week and see what you're feeling by then. So here I am. Not being impulsive. I wrote a note to my son. Next is my wife. Then my friend, funnily enough one that I've never met. In the note to my wife, ill be letting her know how much to sell my stuff for. If that's what she wants to do. Im giving my expensive prop lightsaber to my friend. Its something we both have common interests in. 


I feel like I want to vomit. I feel so sick.
