One sided love destroy youI knew this girl for a month, asked her out, she said yes but apparently she just thought we would meet as friends. She wasnt interested in a relationship with me but we still met, had fun but i put pressure on her so she didnt want to meet me ever again. To show her my grief i posted stupid pictures with guns and drugs, i am just stupid. 6 months later we sit next to each other in most courses in university, talk alot and laugh most of the times. She smiles at me like she didnt do before. I gain hope again. Hope is a dangerous thing, especially if you own a gun. I love you.
