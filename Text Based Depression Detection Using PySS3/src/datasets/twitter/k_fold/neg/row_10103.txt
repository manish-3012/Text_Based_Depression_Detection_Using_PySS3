I had my second meeting with my counsellor today and she asked me to promise her that I donâ€™t kill myself yet and to give her a chanceI essentially told her that Iâ€™m at a point where I feel like suicide is my end. Iâ€™m not scared of it anymore. For me, itâ€™s essentially a plan B. A get out of jail free card if you will. I said to her that I have it planned out Iâ€™m just waiting for the right time. But despite how much i appreciated the sincerity of her gesture, Iâ€™m worried one day Iâ€™ll break that promise.

Sorry for the random/out of context post, just wanted to share this with someone because the one thing Iâ€™ve kept from my mum is the suicidal aspect of what Iâ€™m going through
