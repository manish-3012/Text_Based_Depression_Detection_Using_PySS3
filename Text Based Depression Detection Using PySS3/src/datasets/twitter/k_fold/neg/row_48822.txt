Dead on the inside, no hope for the futureI feel like it's kind of pointless to post, and I'm not quite sure why I'm doing it. I hate wasting people's time when I can never respond positively, but I keep wanting someone to say anything to make things easier. 

I'm tired, just exhausted to the bone. I've got overwhelming depression and social anxiety. I do nothing all day, no work or school, and I know that makes me even worse. I just can't see the point in doing anything.

I feel like something is fundamentally wrong deep inside of me. I feel like a monster. I feel like I've been running out of time and rotting inside for years. Part of me wants to hurt myself where other people can see, so they won't just think I'm worthless and lazy, though I really might be. There's this constant hopeless voice in the back of my head telling me to just end it all the time now. 

I don't see any kind of future for myself. I have one friend who's barely holding on, I feel like I don't belong with family and I know I'm a burden, and the thought of being in a romantic relationship, either emotionally or physically, makes me feel ill and angry in ways I can't explain.

I just don't know how to take all of this black and empty hell and turn it into something worth living for. I am very tired.
