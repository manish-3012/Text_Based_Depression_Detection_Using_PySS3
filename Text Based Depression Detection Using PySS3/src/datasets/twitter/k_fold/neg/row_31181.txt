Every day is getting worseHey guys, just created this account to post here without my followers seeing what mental state I am in. I'm broken, have nobody to talk to and all my friends leave me every time after we talk for once. The girl of my dreams denied me and everything hurts. I have been thinking of suicide too much for a person my age, and I am worried I'm gonna do something to myself.
