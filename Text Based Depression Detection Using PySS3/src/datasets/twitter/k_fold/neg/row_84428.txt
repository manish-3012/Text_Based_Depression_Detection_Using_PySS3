Nothing, you can ignore it.I don't have a terrible life like other ones, i just don't like being alive, i mean, my entire existence was a mistake, leaving jokes aside, i was literally a broken condom, i shouldn't be born in first place. I don't find a reason to exist, i don't have any aspirations, so what's the point? Life isn't that great just to live because "you only live once", if you're dead, you don't have to worry about anything, so why is it that bad? It's bad because you're scared of dying? Because you enjoy life? Well congrats to you, it's nice that you love yourself, have aspirations and a reason to live, but that doesn't mean everyone has to live because you like life, that's selfish. 

I sincerely don't want to wake up tomorrow.

Well, I'm not really expecting replies I just wanted to say this, and thought this was a nice place, like I say before, you can totally ignore this.

(Sorry if anything's bad, English isn't my first language)
