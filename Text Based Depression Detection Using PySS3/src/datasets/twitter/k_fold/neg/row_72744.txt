Counseling does nothingI just got done with another useless counseling session. The man is extremely kind, and knowledgeable about what heâ€™s doing, but nothing is really seeming to be useful to my situation. Iâ€™ve been extremely open with him, telling him each and every feeling, and emotion that I have, but his advice just feels like blanketed statements. It feels like Iâ€™m being forced to get better instead of actually going through the motions, no hate toward my counselor, but it sucks.
