I am finally going to do itNow school also went to shit and have given me the opportunity to finally end it.

Some story about why I am going to end it, a year ago almost my best friend died from cancer and 1 month before that my other close friend over dosed on pills (suicide).

I really tried to hang on but the depression have also made me fail in university and now I just want to go "away".

Hope the rest of you can find peace in this torment we call life.
