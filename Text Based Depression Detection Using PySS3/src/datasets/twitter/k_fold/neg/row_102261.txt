Why live"don't drink alcohol because it'll fuck up your brain" but what if my brain is already fucked up sober?

I'm a 27 male, cancer survivor (brain tumor at age 8) and idk how I'm still alive. I've got like 30% of vision left, most of it in my left eye,y right eye has gone lazy from lack of use apparently. Also deaf from both ears die to the chemotherapy. On top of that I have a speech problem. Did I forget to mention that I have a golf ball size hole in my head where my pituitary gland was?

So, with all that, idk how I'm still alive and how I haven't suicided yet. From an outsider view, guess I'm doing well, got an 80k career job with lots of benefits and a master's degree but 30hr drive from my family. But I don't have a girlfriend or best friend for even a friend here, just a roommate and a bunch of co-workers/people from work. I don't have anyone to truly talk to, no one that shares my same interests and never have ever since I was born. Always felt like an outsider. Only been invited to 2 birthday parties and that was pre-cancer. My older brother who had more potential died from a hit-and-run on his motorcycle. My mom who used to say "why can't you be more like your brother?" now says "why can't you be a normal person?". (jokingly?) 
I currently live 2,000 miles from home, can't drive, can barely hear (can never hold a conversation let alone a group one cuz I can't hear shit.) I feel alone and trapped. Can't drive, too blind, can never be an independent man. Always at the mercy of others. What is life and is there a god/heaven?
I just want to die, reincarnate into a world like "By the grace of Gods" anime where I'm loved and appreciated, and also don't have this shitty body of mine.
Depression? It'll never go away. Mine is not based on money or other society struggles, but things I can never fix, like my vision, hearing, speaking.
I just want to stop suffering, and stop being alone.
