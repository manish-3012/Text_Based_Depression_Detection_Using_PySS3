If I kill myself, will my parents be charged with child abuse?Asking not because Iâ€™m going to do anything, but because my mother told me she would be arrested if I kill myself. Iâ€™ve been in the mental hospital 3 times this year for suicidal ideation/attempt and homicidal thoughts, and my mom said because Iâ€™m not getting better and because I was open about wanting to murder my family theyâ€™d think it was their fault I died. They have never abused me in any way - I just have issues. Also my only diagnosis is a depressive disorder if that changes anything,
