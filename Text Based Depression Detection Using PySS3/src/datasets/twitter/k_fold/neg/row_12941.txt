The things that keep me going barely are enough.Right now, the Octo expansion for Splatoon 2, a handful of new movies being released this year and the Spyro remakes are what get me out of bed.

Other than that, there's nothing in my life that really makes me feel worth a damn. I'm an adult female living alone on disability checks. Can't drive and don't work. Never gonna amount to anything(becuase I can't find the motivation to do anything).

I'm so utterly sick of  being lonely. I'm tired of feeling sad all the time. I can't stop thinking about when I was younger and I had friends. I just...don't see a point in this life- my life. I feel so guilty and selfish. I should appreciate what I have. I am living pretty comfortably...but I'm lonely. 

I hate myself because I can't connect with people anymore. I keep myself so far away. I don't find people worth the effort anymore. I don't reach out or try hard enough.

I'm just venting. Sorry.
