I want to but I'm scaredI've been getting mad bullied at school
It's getting to the point where kids are making fun of my scars
I have a shit ton on my arms legs and stomach
I can't wear normal swim suits because of how bad they are
And recently I've been getting bullied really really bad
I had to do a baby project for a class
I was exited because I needed this class to pass
I took really really good care of the baby( robot )
And when it cried I was there
But I was freaking out because it just kept crying and crying
But when I was patting it's back to burp it
I took a Snapchat of me doing it
And I typed in the chat" this baby's gonna be a hoe"
The next day at school when I turned the baby in
My teacher said I was abusing the baby, mentally and physically, and she had the proof on my Snapchat
She said a student came up and said I have been doing it since the day I got it, and teachers were telling me to stop

No teacher talked to me
Nobody did
I told her I patted it's back, I didn't even call it a name, I typed it
She didn't care
I failed the class
Ever since then
Kids have been calling me abusive 
They say I'm going to abuse my future kids
And they say I abuse my boyfriend 
I tried so hard to make it stop
I've talked to counselors about it
They told me to talk to my teacher 
I told her I would never do that
I fucking showed her the snap chat 
She didn't fucking care
Now I'm being harassed 
By teachers and students 
I'm so done with this
Everyone hates me 
I didn't even do anything 
I'm a fucking failure and there's nothing I can do about it
I had a test in the same class, and I had another teacher look over it, she said it was all good, but when I turned it in, she deducted points off of it 
Because
I'm
Fucking
Abusive 




I'm so done with living with this



I don't know what to do anymore
I want to end it
But I'm so fucking scared
