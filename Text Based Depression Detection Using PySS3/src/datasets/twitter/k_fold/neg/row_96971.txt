Iâ€™m turning 18 in a few months and Iâ€™m probably fucked.My grades are way too bad to go to any college, and Iâ€™m way too skinny for any labor work. The only path I can think of is the easy way out because Iâ€™m just so depressed to the point where I have no motivation to do anything good for me. I canâ€™t even go to school anymore otherwise Iâ€™ll lose that tiny dose of dopamine I have left that keeps me going because something always upsets me in the outside world. All I do is hide in my room. Which I canâ€™t do forever as I canâ€™t just leave my parents with that burden. At this point I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s dragging me down. But I canâ€™t get out of it. I canâ€™t see any light at the end of the tunnel.

Fuck.
