Feel like I'm a living example of what not to do/beJust.. Down. Been sick so long and feel like I've tried everything. Getting better for a time only made me sicker in the longrun and has made me that much more fearful to try anything again because I just can't afford to get worse... And I am really bad off. Housebound for years and multiple diagnoses. I'm not having the best of times lately. I'm also too scared to say much of anything for fear of identifying myself. I feel like I've been sick so long that any bit of information about me is obvious. Never really make much of any advice I usually get from these things anyway, if I get any at all. Feels like it's so easy for people to say it'll get better, just hold on, and whatever. I'm heading towards my thirties... Not a bit of what I wanted from life has worked out, and it's been miserable since I was very little. There's been little time for actual healing when another shit storm was around the corner, or when one just never seemed to end. Yet throughout it all, I have never tried to off myself.. I have no plans to.. But it doesn't mean that I don't want it to end. I go to bed hoping to not wake up. It feels like I can never recover. Even when I'm fighting my hardest, life and my own physiology has to fight me twice as hard and not give me any breaks.
