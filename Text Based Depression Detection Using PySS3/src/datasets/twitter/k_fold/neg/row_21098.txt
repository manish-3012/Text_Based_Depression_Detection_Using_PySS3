What's the point of living?Like I don't enjoy experiencing new things, I don't enjoy music movies or any kind of media content, I don't have friends and I have a fucked up family. I don't care about my boyfriend either. But I have a cute guinea pig.

I just feel numb all the time.

Can anyone name some other reasons of living?
