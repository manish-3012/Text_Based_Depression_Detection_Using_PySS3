I think Iâ€™m most suicidal during the summerIâ€™ve heard of seasonal affective disorder but I thought it was only the winter months that drag people down. Iâ€™ve got it backwards apparently. I never wanna off myself more than when itâ€™s hot and humid. Itâ€™s only then too that my life always goes to crap. Iâ€™m backwards. My whole life is a mistake. Give me one good reason why I should continue this pointless cycle.
