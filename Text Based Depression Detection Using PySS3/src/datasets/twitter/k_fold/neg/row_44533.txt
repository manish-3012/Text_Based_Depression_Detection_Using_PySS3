I Don't Know What To DoI was molested by my father. According to my father my mom made an outlandish accusation during they're relationship. When I was ten I went to my fathers and fell asleep I woke up to being touched in new places. I acted like I was asleep still, I believe he was drunk. He left and I started crying. A week later he went to a party and came back and did it again when I was asleep in my bed. He acts like everything's the same. He has *always* made me feel uncomfortable, but after what happened I just think about it. I started developing he touched my stomach and looks at my chest, comments on my hips, and slaps my butt. I've told four people, 4 friends. I didn't tell them who, I told them I was over it, that it didn't bother me anymore. That's a lie, I think about it all the time, I hear people joke about molestation and I become numb. It's been so many years, I was able to forget, than it came back. And now it's all the time, during classes, in bed, watching TV. I don't want my dad to be in trouble so, I still go and act like everything's normal. I can't tell my therapist, my mom, or tell my friends who really did it. But, I can't go on thinking about it, I'm a teenager, I don't deserve this. Chronic pain, PTSD, depression, GAD, school. I can't do it anymore.
