Need thoughts on how to go about dealing with an employee/coworkerHe's been at our work for a month, and within that time has been consistently late, having mini melt downs, having family/self emergencies to leave work early. He is a cutter and today told one worker that he wants to kill himself. Are we obligated to get him hospitalized or is this not our place and we should move on without him until he can get better? Not really sure what can be done other than letting him go or holding onto someone who isn't reliable at this point.
