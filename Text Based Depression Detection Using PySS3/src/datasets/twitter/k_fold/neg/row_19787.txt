How can anything get better?I have had a lot of death around me lately. A coworker died in a car accident, a friends sister committed suicide, and worst of all one of my students from last school year committed suicide as well. Their deaths were so sad but I keep imagining what it would have been like if it was me instead. I've had depression for about 10 years and have been suicidal before, but it had been pretty well managed until the pandemic. But now I live alone a thousand miles from my family and I can barely even see friends. I know eventually that this situation will be better but then the next disaster will come. We're heading for ecological collapse which will just increase natural disasters and zoonotic diseases as well as bring famine and political unrest. It feels like now is the best time to get out. I've up until recently been really focused on thriving in my career but now I can barely get any work done because I'm so depressed. It doesn't really seem like theirs a point in anything anyway. I don't really know why I'm writing this but I'm so sad and I want things to get better but I look into the future and can't see how.
