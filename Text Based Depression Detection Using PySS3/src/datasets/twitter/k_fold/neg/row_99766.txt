why does everyone hate me?even the mental health clinic I tried to get in to, just put me off for weeks. everyone always seems mad, or upset with me, I sound like a fucking kid, but I'm not. maybe I'm autistic, but just little enough that no one can tell, except think I'm an asshole.

I disappeared for 2 years, not even bullshitting, spent a year living in the middle of nowhere, where it was super cheap.  not one person noticed or messaged me. 

I really have nothing to live for anymore. no friends, family, hobbies, interests, goals. all feels so empty.
