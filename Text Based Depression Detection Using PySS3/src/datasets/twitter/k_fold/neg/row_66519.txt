iâ€™ve been having thoughts non-stophey, iâ€™ve been on here a lot recently and i have read a lot of posts. most are helpful to what iâ€™m feeling right now. i donâ€™t really see a future thatâ€™s fun. i donâ€™t think i want to continue being alive, i want to see life after death if there is one. i usually donâ€™t think like this but have been for this past year. iâ€™m failing my classes and at life basically as of right now. iâ€™ve been trying at everything i do but itâ€™s not enough apparently. currently iâ€™m only a sophomore in high school. yeah, 15. i know when people hear this the first thing they usually say is that i have my whole life ahead of me and to not worry about this stuff. life sucks man. i already wrote a very long letter to my friends and family saying it wouldnâ€™t be their fault. i have several ideas on how i would attempt but iâ€™m too cowardly to do any of them. i have fully given up at school. fully. i have single digit grades as of right now. i have no interest in life. the only thing that keeping me here is literally reading comics. fucking pathetic. iâ€™ve been a procrastinator since middle school so maybe that even applies to this whole thing. iâ€™ve seen a lot of people say that iâ€™m loved. i know i am. thatâ€™s why itâ€™s hard to do this but iâ€™m definitely going to do it. if youâ€™ve read through this whole thing, thank you. i appreciate it.
