i was a failure from the startDon't worry, I'm not going to harm myself in any way. I just wanted to say something that's been on my mind.

Many times I've heard depressed/suicidal people talking about how they used to be smart/talented/successful/etc but then things went downhill and their lives went to shit and they don't know what happened.

I feel shitty because at least they, at one point, were successful, and so they have a chance to get that back. But me... I never had any potential. I was born a failure and I'll die a failure, whether it's by suicide or some other way. I never had a chance because it's just the way I am. A loser, a waste of life, a disappointment. A sad, pathetic existence. 

I don't know which situation is sadder. It obviously isn't a competition or anything and I'm not trying to make it sound like that. Just something I've been thinking about.

Also, I am not in any way trying to invalidate anyone's pain. I'm not saying that they aren't suffering, or shouldn't be depressed, or any other bullshit like that. Please don't take offense.
