I'm not going to be here to experience guilt, so why can't I just fucking do it?My mom is dying of cancer and my life just sucks in general. I've been suicidal for a couple of years but I can't just fucking do it because I feel guilty about her having to be around for it but also the rest of my family having to deal with it. But it doesn't fucking matter. I will be gone, it's not like I'll feel guilty, I won't feel anything.

And more importantly death is inevitable and shitty no matter how it comes. Even if I don't kill myself someone else in our family will get sick or die randomly soon after my mom. This is just the shittiness of life. There's nothing selfish about ending your own suffering. What is selfish is people expecting you to stick around for their sake. 

God I just wish I could get this concept through my head so I could finally end it. I feel like I get closer with each passing year, and maybe losing my mom will be the final push.
