Not sure what to doFor the past month or so Iâ€™ve been feeling out of sorts Ana down constantly .contemplating my mortality and what not and trying to decide if itâ€™s worth sticking around. I just found out what the plan was for thanksgiving and was totally left out of the loop and two of my best friends kept me up till now drinking when I said I was already done ( but they wouldnâ€™t let up. )

Just from those two accounts it seems to me I really would t be missed all that much of I did go. Yet something g keeps holding me back and I donâ€™t know what . All I know is time is wearing thing and I do t know how much longer I can stay strong .
