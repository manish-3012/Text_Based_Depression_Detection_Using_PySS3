DespairI wish I could die in a way that wouldn't emotionally scar my kids. I won't kill myself, despite the feeling that it's inevitable, because I have three young children that have such potential for bright, shiny lives. I won't do that to them.

But what if my staying is worse? What if they inherited my chronic depression and suicidal tendencies? What the fuck did I do if they get that? I love them but sometimes I feel that the choice to conceive them was a mistake because they're saddled with my DNA and me for their lives.
