PLEASE HELP: Off Paxil six and half weeks ago, extremely depressed right now (X-POST from r/depression)I was on anti-depressants for about 2.5 years, and was most recently on paxil for 1.5 of those last years. Six and a half weeks ago I took my last pill. The first almost two weeks of the withdrawal were hell with me feeling depressed, angry, just awful. Then starting during the third week from the last pill i felt amazing and that continued for about another 3 days, totaling about 10 days of feeling good. Even since then my thoughts and progress in life is great and NOTHING IN MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED. However, after those ten days I started to literally feel pshycially and emotionally fucked sad and depressed. Since then, about three weeks ago, I have been extremely depressed and very very sad and close to the edge. My conclusions have been that it's either still some weird shit from the withdrawal and that I need to give it more time to feel better, OR that this is the real me and I need to do something.

PLEASE HELP ME, i've never felt so sad and depressed for such a continuous period. People that have been on paxil please can you help me to tell me if you experienced something similar or anyone else please give me your conclusions/answers on this. thank you
