I'm so fucked in my head because I can't believe my unhealthy pastI used to smoke way too much in the past. Can't fucking believe what my previous self was thinking. Constantly smoking cigarettes like a pack per day + 5 joints too. I also didn't pay attention to my diet at all. Now I'm 28. I've turned it around. Healthy diet. Hitting the gym. My life should start right now. Children. Marrying a beautiful wife. Instead I feel like I will die soon. Fuck, I'm so depressed...
