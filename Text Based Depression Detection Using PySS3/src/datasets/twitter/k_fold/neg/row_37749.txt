I can't think for myself.I hope you guys can relate. I've been depressed before, to the point of an intentional overdose, and I've gotten help. My depression just keeps coming back. Its like I'm addicted to feeling this way. I'm so....tired of this. I don't want to go back to therapy. I can't keep ties to one therapist, I have now been through 5! I STILL can't open up 100%. I have no friends to talk to. Whenever I tell people I am depressed they say, "really, you look fine to me!" and don't even try to offer to help. I've gotten so good at masking this. This is destroying me. 

My emotions take over me to the point where I genuinely believe I have no control over them. I'm sad, on edge all the time, I want to cry but just can't. Depression has no mercy.

Hope you guys have a good night tonight..
