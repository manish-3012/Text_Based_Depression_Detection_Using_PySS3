I am indifferent to deathI don't have the guts to do the act myself but I have no qualms about dying in some freak accident or by being hit by a truck. A sort of "oh well" attitude towards death. Sometimes I lean towards wanting such a thing to happen. Life is a bad deal in general, really. I tend to approach my thoughts relating to this with a matter-of-factly perspective. Maybe I'm trying to create a disconnect.

On a tangent, I don't even know myself if the jokes I make about suicide are genuine or not. What is "depression" anyway? Am I depressed? I don't know that, either. I'm able to laugh and enjoy some days but others I don't feel like myself and I end up secluding from socialization. Sometimes I get sad suddenly and lose motivation to do work, but I always get it done eventually. I cry myself to sleep regularly; the tired sensation that follows is very good for sleep, but doesn't everyone do so occasionally? I've found that staying up for extended periods of time and crashing later is very effective in two regards; not only do I avoid thinking up a storm, but this practice, too, aids in sleep quality. I particularly enjoy dreamless nights - just an empty space, not darkness, but a void. Maybe the sensation is similar to being dead?

Maybe I'm just a wimp and I have to get over this breakup. Do I miss her, or do I miss the happiness associated with the time I spent with her? Many questions and very little answers.  From this experience, I've come to believe that relationships can be likened to a house of cards. They're painstakingly developed with great care, extremely fragile, and pointless; and in the end, the house of cards is abandoned anyway...

This turned into a small rant and I don't know what exactly I'm trying to accomplish here, but if anyone is knowledgable on the topic, I'd like to hear some elaboration on the difference between sadness and depression.
