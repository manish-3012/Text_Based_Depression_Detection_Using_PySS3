I've had a wonderful life.I really have, so why am I on this subreddit and considering something as terrible as suicide?
I can't say exactly.
I come from a "problem free" family. I love my parents dearly and my sibling are all great people.
I'm actually the only true problem of them all. 
I couldn't ever figure out how to be a normal person.
I couldn't learn from my father and help with the business, nor could I find a path in education. I always feel like time is slipping away.
After my siblings found their careers, I found myself eight years into the future, a balding stranger left behind wondering why I am so alone. I've always felt like a disappointment since I've never been able to get the same sense of engagement and joy that I see from everybody else's interactions. I know I'm a burden because I don't do enough to liven up the mood, and they seem stressed when I try to bring up any collaboration on my life's plans(education). I feel like they never forgived me when they found out I smoked weed in high school.
I feel like I was type casted in life. I'm not as good looking or as smart as my siblings. I never went to college, and I always wish I had/could like my siblings. I've moved out a few times but ended up back home every time. I was replaced by my sibling's SO for the family vacation this year, which was a last minute surprise for everyone. I was devastated honestly.
Now I'm moving out one last time and I'm going to try my best to not look back.
