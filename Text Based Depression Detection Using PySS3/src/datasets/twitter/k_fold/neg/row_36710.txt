I hate this existence, I feel so alonegirlfriend broke up with me after two years. She said she didn't feel the same. she was my best friend and was the only person I trusted enough to help me with my issues. I feel like this is the only thing left.  No medication is helping she pretends I don't exist, I don't care about anything anymore.
