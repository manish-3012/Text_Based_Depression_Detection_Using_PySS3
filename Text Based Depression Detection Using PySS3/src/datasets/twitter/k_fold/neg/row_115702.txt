Considering Self-HarmI've been considering it for a while now. To be honest I've just been a mess for do long and I feel like everyone would be better off without me.

I've been diagnosed with depression and autism and those two are apparently not a great mix. My ADHD meds give me anxiety and that doesn't help. I don't feel like this is why I am in so much pain though. It's been 2 years or so since it's been this bad, and I just wish I killed myself before meeting more people that I care about.

I feel like everyone would be better off without me and even though people say that's not true, I can't agree with them. I only make everything worse in every way and I just want to stop all the mess I've created. At the same time, I feel selfish because I know it would ruin my family. everything hurts so much and I just want to die do bad like I'm always so stressed the time. 

I used to think just straight quick suicide would be best, but now I want to suffer because I feel I deserve it. That's why I'm considering cutting myself. I'm not sure what to do.
