I feel like there is no point to life. If everyone â€œhas their own purposeâ€ or â€œtheir own truthâ€, doesnâ€™t that technically mean that neither exists?I have struggled with feeling worthless, and that life is pointless, for a while now. I first started feeling this way when i was around 10, but I also had a depressive episode when I was 6. My dad said he thought it was because of a demonic presence. I donâ€™t know about this, and I wish sometimes that I was not raised a Christian because every time I feel like dying I blame it on myself and my sins -but I still want to know why I have been depressed for so long. I am 17 now. Before that I was very good in school and didnâ€™t always have to try to feel happy, or even feel any emotion. Now I am constantly trying to find ways to change myself so that I can be happy for even a moment. I genuinely cannot tell which is the problem; am I doing something wrong with my life, and that is why I constantly feel detached and horrible? I feel like dying would put an end to this. Can someone please let me know if there is a definite reason for life. Like a solid reason that does not vary between people. I would like to know so that I can have a reason to live. I have tried hobbies and I want to develop relationships; but even if I live a long life and go on for another seventy years, I will just die and none of it will matter anyways.
