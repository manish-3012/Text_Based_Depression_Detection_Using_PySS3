I am not sureI've been encountering this stuff like 4-5yrs now. I had this moments where I have these images in my head :e.g. a person talking to me is holding a scissor, in my head it creates this situation where I take the scissor in my eyes then bleed to death while everyone is laughing. And sometimes there are words spits out of mouth such " i want to kill everyone", "just die!", " I want to kill myself." Literal out of nowhere. The word ones mostly happens in when i am alone after seeing something on youtube or other stuff but when it happens infront people ( usually i dont remember saying it) it feels like joke. Sometimes i hear voices in head but I couldn't tell if it us from my head or someone near me is saying it. I am not sure. I dont want to bother parents or anyone for it so i ignored. I am not sure.
