I didn't think it would end this wayYesterday I got into a pretty heated argument with my father, and today he is telling me I have until Sunday to go and live on my own. I am 17 at the moment but honestly this was enough to push me to the edge. Before this I had thoughts of suicide but decided I would try to hold out and see what the future would hold for me but this has proven to be too much. He seems dead serious about it but at this point I think it is for the best. I can no longer stand to live under my dad's authority and his constant hatred towards his own family. I only hope that my mom, sister, and friends can continue to live their lives happily, and I am sorry for being so selfish to them.
