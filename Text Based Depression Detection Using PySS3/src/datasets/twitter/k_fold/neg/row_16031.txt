Is anyone here?I'm not sure where to begin, so I'll start with now. My mother has advanced lung cancer, she and my step father both have intellectual incapacities. It shows that word as wrong, and I'm getting paranoid about it. I'm alright and everything, just need someone to talk to. Having thoughts of self harm and suicide. Thanks.
