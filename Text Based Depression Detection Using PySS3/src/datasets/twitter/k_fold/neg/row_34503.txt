I'm so tired.I'm never good enough.  My girlfriend doesn't want to be with me anymore.   She thinks I'm taking too many classes and that I don't want to see her if I take any classes she's not taking.  I feel so dumb and stupid and worthless when she talks to me.  I can never do anything right by her. My dad thinks I'm never good enough, I'm always doing something wrong in his eyes.  I'm not running fast enough, I missed an assignment, I'm not eating enough vitamins.  I just don't see the point anymore.  I have nobody to confess to anymore.  I just want to kill myself over and over again and hope I don't have to deal with this shit.  I know I'm wrong to feel this way because people go through so much worse shit but I'm a fucking coward and a piece of garbage and I feel suicidal anyway.
