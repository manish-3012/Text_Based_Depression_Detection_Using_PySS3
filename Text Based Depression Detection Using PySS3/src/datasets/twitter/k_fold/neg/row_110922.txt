The only reason I live is for my mumI hate life. There's nothing I want out of it and I don't enjoy it at all. I wish I could just end it. I know that my mum would fall apart and end up hers too if I did though, so I'm trapped. I just couldn't do that to her.  When she dies, I die. I just wish that I could go now. The pain in unbearable.
