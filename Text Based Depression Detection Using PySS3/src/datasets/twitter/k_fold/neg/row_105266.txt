STUCKThe mere thought that suicide exists pissed me off. Not that I don't want to die, I do, but it shouldn't be so fucking hard. I read on here today a guy who has tried to off himself 10 times taking massive overdoses and still waking up. That terrifies me. I want the job done. Even a gun in the mouth isn't guaranteed (look it up, but we warned it's gross). Surviving is my biggest fear an only think keeping me alive. 

I have all the drugs they say you 'need' to OD. And alcohol is easy to get. I guess it's when I find the right cocktail. Til then i'm stuck. Stuck living when I want to be dead.
