I (M22) pushed my ex away and now I am suicidal. Having BPD sucksThe title says it all. I was by a bridge today to kill myself but I was too chicken to jump. My trigger was pushing my ex away. I went hot and cold from nothing to do with her to want her to be my friend to nothing to do with her to now wanting her to be a really good friend again. I was constantly spamming her phone last night and this morning which I shouldn't have done but now I can't go back in time to fix anything. I'm in deep emotional distress and want to reach out to her to tell her I'm sorry and that I want to be friends again but I know that won't work. I'm just sitting in my room ready to take these pills any moment now. I keep on pushing people away.
