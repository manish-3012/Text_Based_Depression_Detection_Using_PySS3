Suicide seems like the best wayIt would end the neverending pain and misery. It is so hard, when every day I wake up and feel terrible.

I am so lonely, no one ever wants to hang out. People say "I don't have time", but I see them hang out with others. Guys want to go out, but always back off, when I tell them I am trans(I want friends, they want pussy).

No matter what I do, I end up in more misery.
