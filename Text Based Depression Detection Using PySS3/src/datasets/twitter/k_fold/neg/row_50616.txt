I've messed up big time.I failed all of my classes in college last semester and fasfa  is no longer available to me due to my failure. I lied to my parents about this. I feel that if they found out about this I would be without a home. I think ending it would be the only solution. My therapist knows about the failure and has not been helpful. Nobody in my family has any money to help pay for college so fasfa was my only option. I feel so alone. I can't do this anymore.
