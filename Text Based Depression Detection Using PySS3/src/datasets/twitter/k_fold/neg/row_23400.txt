Is it weird to be looking forward to my suicide?I have been thinking about this for a long, long time and I am so excited to finally do it. I have decided not to leave a suicide note, because I think it's lame and anyone who cares won't be surprised that I did it or be confused as to the reasons. I am just so tired of fighting and struggling to get through every day. I am 36 years old, and have been dealing with depression, ADD, anxiety, chronic insomnia and impulsivity for the majority of my life. This combination has not made life easy. I am not saying that I am worse off than anyone else, but I have definitely struggled more than my fair share. I struggle to maintain friendships, haven't had a relationship with a man in years, have an on / off relationship with my family and am just so... tired. I recently lost my job (respectable and solid career for most) and even though I have experience and post-grad degrees, I can't find a new one because I have a criminal record (2 DUIs in 7 years) and my ex-boss detests me and refuses to give a positive recommendation. I am currently living in a hotel, because the house I was renting flooded several weeks ago. So, no job, no home, nothing. I am so sick of people of telling me to be positive, that things work out in the end, yada yada yada. Because... really? How do you know? The worst is when it comes from random people who don't even know me, like counselors or help-line people. After a while, it's just so generic and patronizing. Anyway, I am just here to post this as my final goodbye. I have a plan, which has been carefully researched and prepared. I have some final details to handle this week and then I can go through with it. Is it weird that I am looking forward to it? I am so tired of battling and struggling to be normal and live a simple, successful life. It shouldn't be this hard. I am looking forward to the peace. Anyway, thanks for reading.
