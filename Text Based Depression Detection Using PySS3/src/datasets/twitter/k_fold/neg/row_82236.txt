VentingBeen seriously contemplating committing suicide for a while, canâ€™t seem to decide on what the best method would be. Have considered jumping off a bridge, hanging myself, or shooting myself in the head, although I donâ€™t own a gun which is probably for the better. I feel the best way would be to inhale enough carbon monoxide to get to where I want to be, since itâ€™s considered one of the most painless ways to go, although I donâ€™t know how true that is. Hate to add on to the bad energy being put out to this world and hope this doesnâ€™t contribute in putting any new ideas in anyoneâ€™s head, though I believe in everyoneâ€™s right to die how they see fit. And though it may seem like it, this is not in any way my last cry for help, I mostly just keep to myself but idk I guess I just wanted to put this out there in case I do decide to go through with it that someone out there can know where my head was at. Sorry for the rant just felt the need to say what I said. The weight on my shoulders feels insurmountable and donâ€™t know how much time I have left. Have yet to reach my breaking point obviously since I am alive to type this but donâ€™t know what itâ€™ll take for me to finally snap. My drug abuse and self harm seem to be getting out of hand, feel as though I canâ€™t go a day without blowing all my money on drugs and alcohol. I do hope for my own sake that Iâ€™m able to figure out this particularly dreadful time in my life, and see the light out of this seemingly never ending tunnel, and hope anyone else out there feeling the same way can to.
