Could use a little helpI never thought I'd see the day I'd be posting here but I just need to let it out somewhere. 

I've been battling what I thought was some pretty minor depression and anxiety for a while now and I just can't do it anymore. 

I'm sitting on the side of a road parked because I'm too afraid to drive. Way too many thoughts about how much easier it'd be to just run this car into a train or building and just end the whole thing right here. I'm sure it'd be easier on my fiancÃ©e. 

She is the best thing to happen to me ever and I continually fuck everything up in life. I can't hold down a job to save my life and I'm so sick of disappointing everybody around me. I'm sick of becoming the guy who can't be counted on to show up to work anymore because he is sick (I have Crohns). 

I am medicated for depression and it's not working anymore. I don't think I want to go on living the rest of my life like this. I don't want to go on the rest of my life continually letting everybody down around me. I used to be good at things and get decent grades but those days are long, long behind me.
