Well I donâ€™t even knowAm I depressed or do I just not give a damn any more? Or is that the same thing?! I am constantly angry at something or the other and probably not very great to be around! 
Do I want to die or not? I feel like I do.. I feel like I wonâ€™t be missed? Or that I wouldnâ€™t miss much! I donâ€™t have a social life at all.
I look at things and wonder how I could kill myself with it. Not saying I would because I am a huge pussybitch. 

I even emailed the UK suicide helpline thing last night and didnâ€™t get a reply hahah.. kinda funny really! Even they donâ€™t give a shit! 

Constantly worrying what people think of me or if I have done something wrong or if people even like me is soooooooooo draining. All i wanna do is sleep! 

Ah well I donâ€™t know where I was going with this. Just needed a rant I suppose!

Cheers
