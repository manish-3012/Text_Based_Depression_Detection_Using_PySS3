experiences overdosing on zoloft?IMPORTANT NOTE: i am not currently planning on trying to kill myself with my zoloft. it has certainly crossed my mind many times, but my psychiatrist told me it is almost impossible to die from it, but i don't totally believe her and i wanted to know if anyone has any real life experience that will maybe drill this into my head. if i did do it, i would take anywhere from 3000-6000 mg, depending on how much patience i can muster up.
