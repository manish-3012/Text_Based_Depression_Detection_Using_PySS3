What is wrong with me?I don't consider myself suicidal; but I wouldn't be sad if I caught a fatal disease or got into an accident. I am stressing out- reasons for which I don't know why, I feel breathless and I am close to hyper ventilating, I keep shivering.

like, for example: I was sitting in the class room, just minding my own business, doing some work- and then it felt like the walls were closing in and i got this lump in my throat and i just, cooled down, felt like I was close to dying, but not actually close to dying, but close to going through with something that would kill me like, i shivered right there and then and then it just transitioned into a like, anxious or kinda weirded out, but still normal ish state- it was over in 20 seconds ot less.

I don't know what to do and I get really anxious when I try to talk to people or explain my problems- and I just feel weak and defeated when I do do. Only thing I am capable of is expressing myself through text.
