It's all endingFirst off this probably isnt worth a read i just want to get my thoughts out there so go on to the next post.

Ive ruined my life, im the only one to blame for it, i have ruined so many relationships with people because i am a bad person, i have upset so many people to their breaking point and now im alone. There are about 5 days left in school and im going to fail all my courses, i already dropped one course because a full school day is too much for a pussy like me to handle, my other 3 classes i have 4 or 5 projects that are due that i havent started and i dont care anymore. I am such a shitty person, my family is a mess because of me. my parents are constantly fighting because of me and i believe they may get a divorce and im the reason why, my parents are doing everything they can to make my life miserable now because i wont go to school im not supposed to be using the computer right now but as my parents are at work i am able to for a little while.

im not living for anything anymore and i just want to die, a few months ago even thought i had wanted to die i had a couple people to talk to that i didnt make hate me and i would somewhat enjoy my time spent playing video games (not actually enjoying playing them but they distracted me from my suicidal thoughts) or watching videos on youtube/ listening to music. I dont enjoy any of that anymore and my life is completely stale, everything is bad, im so useless, my parents say why dont i just try harder but im past that point, i wake up in the morning and i ask myself why am i such a disappointment, why cant i just die all i do is upset people and make the lives of other worse.

This probably makes no sense because i dont even know what im typing right now all that is going through my head is why am i alive, if you have taken the time to read this i very much appreciate it but i just need a place to put my thoughts so that when i finally do decide to end it all this is here not that anyone would care to find it

Edit: i have a bit to add on why im useless, i got a job and quit after 2 days because i cant do anything right and im too scared to talk to people
