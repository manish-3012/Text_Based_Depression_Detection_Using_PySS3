this would be the perfect time to do itI'm graduating college in a couple weeks, I finally saw the big finale to all the Marvel movies I've been watching for the past 11 years, and I'll be seeing my mom in the next couple weeks (which could be the last time). Everything that I've had to look forward to for most of my life is coming to an end and I feel like this would be the perfect time to finally end my life on a high note. I'll have succeeded and done everything that I wanted to, and instead of venturing into the terrifying unknown I could just call it quits and peace out. I probably won't do anything but I just wanted to get this out there. I just feel like everything I've wanted to accomplish in life is basically done now and I'll probably never have as good of a chance again to end my life on my own terms at a time that I really feel content.
