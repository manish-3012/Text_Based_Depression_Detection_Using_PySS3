HelpHi,

It's because of a girl. I've been steadily fucking up my life for the last year and a half and when she left me I snapped out of it. I've started dating someone else, and she's perfect. But I can't stop thinking about my fiancee, every day. And it hurts too much. I started fixing things in my life, but knowing I most likely will never get her back is killing me and I want the pain to stop.

She's flawed, she's grumpy, totally opposite interests. But I miss her. It's been 4 months since we split, and for a month now every day hurts. And I want it to end. And I don't know how other then this.

Reddit, you're my last hope. Because right now I don't want to continue life without her. And I'm just hurting the girl I'm dating.

I'm a terrible human being, and I can't live with it anymore.
