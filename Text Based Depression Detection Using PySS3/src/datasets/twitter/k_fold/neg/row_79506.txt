I haven't decided when I'm going to do it, but I'm leaving this as my note.First, thank you to everyone here for the loving words and support. I really appreciate it, but I'm just not strong enough to do this any longer. To Levi, if you're reading this you mean the world to me. You really do, but this is on me. I know you did your best and please don't blame yourself. This is my fault, not your. Stay strong and change the world one student at a time â˜ºï¸. Mom, I know we argued and faught a lot, but you are really important to me too and I appreciate all your help. Please don't blame yourself either. Don't grieve over me, I'm not hurting anymore. Goodbye everyone, I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough. Goodbye.
