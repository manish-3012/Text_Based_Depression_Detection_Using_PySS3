Iâ€™m just tiredIâ€™m tired of being happy and hopeful only to end up back here again. Iâ€™m tired of constantly disappointing myself over and over again. Iâ€™m sick and tired of cycling through my bipolar disorder bullshit.

Every year I get just a little bit closer to ending it all. Im not sure if this is my year, but its starting to feel like it.  

Thank you for listening, I think i just needed to let some shit out.
