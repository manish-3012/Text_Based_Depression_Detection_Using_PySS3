How do i approach a triggering video a teacher showed?In Literature Studies my teacher was showing us a video in correlation to Lord of the Flies regarding â€œsocial crueltyâ€ and the video was relatively old, about 10-15 years old and showed children and what bullying went on unnoticed.

All of that wasnâ€™t bad just mainly made me feel sympathetic until this one part where a mom breaks down crying while reading a suicide note her daughter wrote on her first attempt, then explained how the second time her daughter committed suicide she wasnâ€™t coming back. That part really triggered me and I kept a low profile the rest of the day.

I want to tell her about how that part of the video may trigger some people and that she probably should just leave it out but she scares me heh. How do i approach her in a respectful manner while being straightforward?

**TLDR** My teacher showed my class a triggering video and I want to know how to tell her respectfully and straightforward
