I want to dieFor the past few months every morning when I wake up I fantasize about walking off a bridge, shooting myself, etc. I stopped wearing seatbelts in case the car crashes and i fucking die. 

I didnâ€™t think I was depressed I have things going for me, I guess. Iâ€™m in my 20s and I want to fucking die.
