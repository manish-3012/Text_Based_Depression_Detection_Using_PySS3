Statement of IntentIn lieu of writing a letter, an anonymous post is more fitting to the filth that I am.

In the twenty-seven years I've lived, I've amounted to nothing. In the twenty years I've been among people, I have been bullied relentlessly. As I've grown older, the friends I thought I had were no more than users; a tool, a weapon, a means to an end; whatever so suited them. I've watched my banners burn, my causes crumble, and even cast aside the luck of a stress-induced heart attack out of stupidity.

My touch is Midean, but turns all to shit. I ruin everything and everyone with whom I come into contact. The happiness of others is stolen and obliterated with my presence. Each word from my mouth turns smiles to scowls and wears out all welcomes. Best friends have turned to bitter enemies; I speak to no one.

So vile is my person that my diagnoses have forced my spouse's hand to search for new lodgings for myself. So reviled are hospital visits that my family will no longer respond to me. Help is for the deserving, not the disgusting.

This is it. I've taken, stolen, cheated, swiped, and pillaged enough from those who want to help. This money pit is now condemned and off-limits. There is no hope for worthless. I wish I had died at any time throughout these last twenty years of trying, but yet it has never come.

My last hope is that now it shall be.
