I [21 M] hate it that I can't just go away because it would devastate some peopleI just want to go to sleep and never wake up. People would be better without me, but they would freak out instead...

Some of them wouldn't care, some would move on quickly, but there are some who would fucking freak out and become depressed like I am now.

And that's actually what makes me that depressed, that **I can't decide on my own fate**, just because my life depends on other people and vice versa.

Those people are:
* my mother - she's so overprotective, my death would make her go insane
* my father - similar to mother, would leave him woeful for a long time
* my little brother - he wouldn't understand but me disappearing from his life would make him cry all days
* my grandma - it would only make her already bad health state worse, also I help her when I'm home
* my godmother - she'd go insane as well, might destroy her career
* my best friend D [20 M] - we rent a flat together so that would leave it all on him, I would live him alone in many ways, I don't want to make financial problems for him and make him depressed...
* my best friend P [20 F] - she's already worried about me and trusts me and I promised to always be there for her and she did the same. Not only I would fucking hurt her, also would have lied to her and left her alone instead of caring for her because she's pretty depressive as well...
* my friend K [21 M] - we take care of school stuff together, I'd leave him alone there having to find a new mate when everybody is pretty much set up after all this time

Those are pretty much all people I actually care in my life. And all people that care about me. The rest of the family would just be woeful for some time and then move on as I don't affect their lifes directly. Same for all other friends, they would just forget quickly.

I'd like to make them ready for my leaving, but yeah... It's impossible. And that's what keeps me still here. I can't fucking break their hearts. And **I hate that**.
