Put an ad offering my guitar for a solid handgunHey guys. First time poster here, long time struggler with life. 24, failed boot camp (and thus am not enrolled in school this semester), got diagnosed bipolar and BPD, dumped my gf manically and got a DWI an hour later last Tuesday. She took me back but did so cautiously, and still is. BPD makes such a mess of everything because I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m loved, even though her ass was at the jail an hour after the arrest (and 2 hours after we broke up) trying to bail me out with a credit card. Iâ€™ve long casually considered suicide, and like it as an escape option. 

I owned a sick modded NiB glock 19 before I shipped for basic. Sold it cause I couldnâ€™t take it with me. But not having a gun makes me feel naked/vulnerable. 

Does anyone else feel the same way? Odds are I wonâ€™t kill myself, or at least not for a few years. But not having the ability to (and to defend myself but yolo) stresses me hardcore. I just listed the love of my life (my custom fender) on armslist looking for a trade for a good new handgun. Idk why Iâ€™m posting this at 4am, just lonely and thought someone might sympathize with this weird fear of NOT having a gun lol. 

I pray you all are having an alright night.
