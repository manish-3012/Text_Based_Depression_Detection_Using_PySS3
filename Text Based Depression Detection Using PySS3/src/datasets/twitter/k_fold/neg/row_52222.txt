Googling doesn't cut it anymoreI've been researching and looking up "I want to die" or "I want to kill myself" and I think I'm finally ready. I found the moist painfree way for me to go and I've found a way for me to just go missing for a while until my body is found so none of my family is traumatized. Googling "I want to die" used to scratch the itch when I became suicidal. Now that it doesn't, I think I'm ready to go now. Time for me to pay for my mistakes I've made my whole life.
