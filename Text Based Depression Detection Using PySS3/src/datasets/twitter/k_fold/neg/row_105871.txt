I don't understand why life just seems to be getting worse and worse I wish I don't attempt to make it better at his pointI wanted to be happy and try to get a good life but as I progress through life I seem to be getting more and more people who are fighting me. Every time I go to college I get the urge to jump off the 8th floor and end it.  I'm not complaining about challenges I welcome challenges that would improve me after they are over but I just seem to end up in a worse position as life goes on. I wish I could go back to the days of lazing around and not caring about anything. I wish that people wouldn't fight me over lies and misunderstandings. I just wanted to be happy. That seems impossible for me.
