Failed suicide attemptSo I finally tried to kill myself a few weeks ago. Downed a whole bottle of pills and a bottle of wine. I woke up the next afternoon and couldnâ€™t feel my leg. I thought it was just asleep so I decided to just go back to sleep. Woke up and still couldnâ€™t feel it, so I tried to walk to take a bath. Eventually after falling 6 or 7 times I decided to go to the hospital. Well it turns out not only did I fail at killing myself I also properly fucked up my leg. Like a two week hospital stay and two procedures worth of fucking up my leg. Maybe this is a sign that Iâ€™m just stuck here. I just feel kind of hopeless after everything and now I have a janky leg to go along with my depression.
