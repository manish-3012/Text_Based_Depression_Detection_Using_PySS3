I want to dieI am an 18 year old boy and Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with Herpes (HSV2). I got it from a guy(25) I met on Jackâ€™d. Idk how long I can keep the diagnosis from my parent. Itâ€™s been a month since I found out I had it and my depression has gotten worse. Iâ€™ve been smoking heavily in order to cope and numb myself. Today is the first time Iâ€™ve actually considered suicide and the first day I see it happening. I know I shouldnâ€™t feel bad because Its basically my fault; we didnâ€™t use protection. What makes matters worse is my parents donâ€™t know that Iâ€™m gay and I know they wouldnâ€™t support me. I feel alone, I have no friends, or anyone to talk to. I feel like life isnâ€™t worth living, Iâ€™m alone now and I feel like Iâ€™ll die alone due to my condition.
