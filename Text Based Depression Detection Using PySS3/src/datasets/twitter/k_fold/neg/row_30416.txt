I can't even kill a flyI just don't want to be alive. Like I don't care if my parents will be heart broken if they found out I'm dead, because I won't be there, so I don't worry about it. It's just I can't seem to get the urge to hurt myself. Like I never tried cutting myself or anything. I'm just too scared. This is the worst fate imaginable, wanting to die, but too afraid to do so.
