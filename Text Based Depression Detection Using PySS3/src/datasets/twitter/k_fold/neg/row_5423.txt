Need support.I want to be a musician. I have taken every kind of lesson there is pretty much, but I always get told it's "not realistic," My psychologist even said that. It hurts being depressed, and then (even ones close to me) step on the only thing I like, music. I am an atheist(people don't suggest I find God), I know I only have one life, but what is the point if I don't mean anything. I just think a lot of the time I should just end it now if I won't mean anything in the long anyway, whats  the point of suffering and giving it my all if I get nothing for it, just to be forgotten.
