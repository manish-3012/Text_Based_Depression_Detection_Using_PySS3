I don't feel I deserve life.If I had 100% trust that there was an existence after death, I'd off myself. Not out of sadness, just to skip it all.

I feel extremely cheated. I've suffered from paranoia issues my entire life that have essentially ruined everything. 

I also don't like being told what to do, and this has ruined my education. Failed 8th grade, went to summer school, passed, went to 9th, failed, went cyber, passed, continued for another year, passed again, but fell a half a credit short.

I have no feelings towards anyone who isn't a friend or relative of one, and view everything very critically. I see everything scientifically and very bluntly, and I believe my entire personality, brought on by issues, have ruined me. I will not go in to further detail here.

I feel as if I am a complete failure at life who is not needed.
