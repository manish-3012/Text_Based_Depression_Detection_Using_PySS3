i want to diei don't see a future. it's just blank. i can't sleep without getting anxiety about everything so i end up staying awake 2 nights in a row often and passing out on the following one. i've lost most of my friends just by caring about them, ending up with them saying 'i've changed' when i'm the one who hasn't &amp; i feel alone, full of anxiety and depression.  i almost attempted suicide but my dog and this girl i love and care for so much came to mind and i just couldn't do it. the way my dog smiles as soon as he sees me keeps me happy for a few moments and this girl and i seriously love each other, but both of us are going through constant shit &amp; betrayal in life and are trying to be there for each other. noone else would bother to check up on me other than them, my parents just argue and scream at me every time they see me, i just hate almost everything happening. i've been lucky in the education system constantly scraping through every time but i don't see myself in a future at all. i don't feel like i have a home, everybody apart from my dog and her makes me feel alone and i feel colder every day. 

 i want to die so bad but i can't for the sake of my dog and her.
