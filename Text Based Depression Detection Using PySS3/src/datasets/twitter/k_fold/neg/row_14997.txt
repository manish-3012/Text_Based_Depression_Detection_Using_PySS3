I have no idea what to do with my lifeI'm in the transition phase of life, where I'm getting out of adolescence and turning into an adult. I'm 20, and dropped out of college after completing a couple years because I have no idea what I'm doing.  I'm currently working in an insanely boring retail job, where I work 40-48hrs a week in something I'm not interests at all.  

People say "you'll just find your way" or something like that. That one day I'll know what to do with my life, and well I've been waiting for that day to come and it hasn't happened. I'm not sure if it will ever happen.  

My biggest problem now is finding meaning. I've fallen into severe existential angst, and don't see any purpose into living as by the end of it our lives don't matter whatsoever. I know that one day if things get too unbearable I can always kill myself. The guilt is the only thing that keeps me going.  

I don't really have any huge interests or passions, I have no friends, not a lot of money and never been in love. How can I live the life I want to live?
