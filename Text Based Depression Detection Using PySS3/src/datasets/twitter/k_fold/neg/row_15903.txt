This life is just painful, my health is crap what's the point of even trying?I got dying kidneys/liver/intestine, Every time i take a dump i feel even more tired and cold due to the blood loss from the internal bleeding + the hemorrhoids itself is painful. Got a forever going ring/buzz on my ears 24/7 with different tones, tinnitus which has robbed me off my peace and never lets me have my rest. I'm tired i haven't had any good sleep i barely get any sleep. Got high cholesterol problems and a possible heart disease due to feeling pain quite often in my heart. and i am deficient on vitamin d but i can't take any supplements nor sleeping drugs since my body can't even handle them.. / allergic to them. My brain feels like it's constantly burning and i feel like absolute shit. 


I haven't had a shower due to some treatment where i'm not supposed to shower or else i'll deinfect my so called medicine that isn't doing anything but causing me even more pain



I'm crying like a little boy at night talking to myself like a mad man saying words like please stop, leave me alone, I don't even sound like a sane person anymore. I'd love to just end it with some death poison pills at this point.
