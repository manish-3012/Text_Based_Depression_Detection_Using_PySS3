A friend of mine just told me that she wants to die - someone please help me with what I should say to her.Quickly, please help me.

She's depressed over her last boyfriend (that she gave a second chance at dating, but he broke her heart again). She's had a hard childhood (raped, molested, etc.) and now she just wants to die. I don't know what to tell her besides that I'm there for her. I can't go and stay with her because she's in another state.

What should I do?

I tried looking at the resources thing but it didn't help me.
