Suicide = mental instability every singe time?Is it possible to just be finished with life if you know it's going nowhere? I feel like there's a difference between barely being able to pull yourself out of bed and feeling incredibly miserable day in and day out, and kind of just being finished with life because it sounds good to get away from things. What I'm saying is, I'm wondering if anyone is on the same wavelength as me. Just because you don't want to be alive anymore it doesn't have to mean you're crazy or mentally unstable.
