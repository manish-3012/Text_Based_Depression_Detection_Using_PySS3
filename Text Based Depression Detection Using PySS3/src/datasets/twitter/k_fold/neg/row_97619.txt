at what point should I worry about my suicidal thoughts?i'm ftm transgender (pre-everything) and i probably think about killing myself once a day on average, but it's very passive and i never think i'll actually go through with it. recently, however, it's gotten a bit worse. i just don't really see any reason to live if i can't be who i want to be (that's the simple way of putting things) and my thoughts feel like they have more... weight? it isn't as much of a passive thought as it used to be, and it's only getting worse. however, i really don't think i have it that bad (i think i'm overreacting)
