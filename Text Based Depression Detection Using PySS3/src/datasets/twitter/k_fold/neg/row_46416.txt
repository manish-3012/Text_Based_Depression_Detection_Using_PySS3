Wanting to die: trying to be happy and don't see the point?Hello, 

I have been trying really hard to be happy. I work in healthcare and have done lots of therapy. I have tried medication already 

I have been fantasizing about death since age 12. I am a 33 year old woman.  I wish there was a store where you could go in and sign up for death. I feel like I am only staying alive just to make others happy.

People say I am professional, pretty and nice. But, I feel like life isn't worth living. I know this sounds odd, but I don't have much in my retirement account (I know I can work on it, but it's not up to the standards of others).  I am single, and there's criticism on needing to find someone. Trust me, I have had plenty of dates. No right fit. In fact, I have received a lot of criticism and emotional/verbal abuse my whole life. Years of being put down doesn't make you grow a thicker skin. It can make you feel like you want to disappear.   A client today told me that I wasn't the right fit for her.  I know these are all little things, but being dead means you don't have to put up with anymore. 

I don't feel like I was meant for the planet. I seriously wouldn't mind being dead.  

I am asking if you can give some rational logic to feel better?  I know people will be upset about my death, but for some reason I feel apathetic.
