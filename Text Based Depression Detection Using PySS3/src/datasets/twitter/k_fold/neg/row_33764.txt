I plan on killing myself in about 2 yearsSo, I am planning to kill myself. Last autumn, almost one year ago, I made the biggest mistake of my life and I just cannot live with the consequences. I was in a relationship with the most amazing, unique, sweet girl I have ever met. And after two years of trying and loving her, she had just come around and started loving me too. I was her first love... We shared our first kiss and had many amazing moments together... But one year ago, we got into a fight and I left... I WAS THE ONE TO LEAVE... And only one year later I see how grave a mistake that was... I ruined everything... I will never again have what I had... Because I want her and only her and she will never get over it and trust me again... Only the thought that she ha seen other people and it was all because of me..... I can only barely live with the thought that I once had all I desire from her now, the only way that I can get myself to get out of bed every morning is theft she is still around and we are kind of friends, although she will never forgive me and get over it.... But this is going to change soon.... She will leave and does not want me to be around her anymore...she says she wants a new beginning.... But I need her... I don't want a life without her. It hurts so much... So, if this happens, exactly one year after we talk for the last time and she severs all ties, I plan on killing myself. That one year is to not make it look like she was the cause... I don't want to Hurt her...
