DoneI seriously want to die, like I've seen the rest of you do as well. 
I've tried hanging myself, I've tried taking pills. I can bring myself to slut my wrist. 
I'm just so tired of fucking up my own life and everyone around me would seriously be better off.. 
I fucked up my family by not being able to control my anger, the love of my life walked out on me without a word and took our son. I havent seen him in 4 months. I missed his 2nd birthday, I missed his first science center visit I'm missing him learn new words I'm so over this. 
when she left I was stupid enough to fuck someone else and now theres no way I'm ever gonna have my family back.. to top it off I found out that I potentially have Asperger's so theres literally no hope for me to change the way I am, I've wondered my whole life why I've been this way and now all this is hitting me at once... 
I cant fucking handle this shit anymore, I can get a job because I have charges and too much social anxiety to deal with people I'm just fucking worthless and hopeless. 
Sorry for the poor grammar and what not this was very hard for me to even type to people I know dont really care... 
Appreciate anyone who's gonna try to help.
