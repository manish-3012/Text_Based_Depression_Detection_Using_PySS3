helpi just need the fucking balls to kill myself already, this isnâ€™t a cry for help or for pity. i just genuinely wish i had the balls to fucking do it. every day is monotonous and waking up in the morning is harder and harder every day. every day feels like iâ€™m running on autopilot and itâ€™s not like i have nothing to live for, i have plenty of reasons. iâ€™m not really that lonely, iâ€™m just not happy. my brain never fucking stops and iâ€™m tired. i canâ€™t think or enjoy anything without a shroud of â€œdo it already â€œ hanging over me at all times. iâ€™m not looking for pity or anything like that, i just needed to get that off my chest.
