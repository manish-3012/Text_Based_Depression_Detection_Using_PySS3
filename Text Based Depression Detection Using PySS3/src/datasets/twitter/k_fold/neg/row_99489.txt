I'd be dead if my circumstances weren't so cliche.I've fucked up a lot of things over a long period of time, but most recently, I smoked too much weed and ruined my relationship, the last good thing i felt i had going for me. She dumped me in December and we still live in the same house. It has been a roller coaster, sometimes we'd be cold to one another, but other times we'd interact like we always had, going on dates and sleeping together. I never really accepted that she was done with me, but now she's seeing someone else, and I don't like the reality that i'm faced with. With everything else, I'm really unhappy with my current place in life right now. I'm only in this city because of ex and i have no direction to look towards. I keep trying to move forward, but I have no real conception of what I'm marching towards. Before, I had a lot of problems, but now i have very few. I'm just very dissatisfied with my own reality. I was feeling pretty down yesterday and bought a gun. That process cheered me up a bit, but I feel like it's only a matter of time before my discontent boils over again
