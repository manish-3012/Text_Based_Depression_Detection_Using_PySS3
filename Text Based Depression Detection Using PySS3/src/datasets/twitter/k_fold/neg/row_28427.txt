I don't want to live anymoreI want to end my life. My grandfather passed. I don't have a father as he left me when I was 9. My mom has a boyfriend. My grandmother and aunt constantly argue with me and want me to die. I am done with my life. I get bullied in school everyday. I never was a bad boy. Always listened to my parent.
