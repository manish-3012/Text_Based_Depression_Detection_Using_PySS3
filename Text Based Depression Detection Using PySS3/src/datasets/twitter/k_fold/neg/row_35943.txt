Iâ€™m probably going to be dead tomorrowI was so fucking close to being done with this waste of a life like a month ago. I got too scared to go through with it but this time feels different. I feel ready. I have cut ties with everyone in my life. Iâ€™ve never been so fucking alone. But I feel like itâ€™s better off this way. Less people Iâ€™ll hurt. I wrote a couple notes for specific people and a main one for whoever finds me. Iâ€™m not sure if I should send the specific ones or not. I donâ€™t want people to try and â€œsaveâ€ me but I donâ€™t wanna just leave without saying goodbye to the people who are still kinda close. Not saying they are close now.... but they were there for me for a while and it feels wrong not to say anything. 
Anyways, thatâ€™s whatâ€™s going on right now. I think this will probably be my last post here so Iâ€™m gonna leave one of my favorite songs of all time for you. Enjoy.

â€œWhen Iâ€™m a dead boy
Burn my body
Pour a couple of my ashes into concrete. 
Build a bench ten feet long, twelve inches tall.
Leave it somewhere, central Phoenix
Where no security guards will dare try to protect it.
Layer of wax on the corner near a QuikTrip.
With smooth ground so the step kids can do their kickflips. 

An ugly wave in a sea of ugly flatness. 
A beautiful wave in a sea of pretty flatness.
A mania wave in a sea of simple sadness.

Until they tear me down. 

When Iâ€™m a dead boy.


When Iâ€™m a dead boy....â€
