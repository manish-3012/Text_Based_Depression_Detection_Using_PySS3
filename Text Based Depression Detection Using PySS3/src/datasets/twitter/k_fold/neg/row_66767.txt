I have suicidal thoughts, but I don't want to die or hurt myself...I don't thinkNot sure where to begin here, aha. I'm new to Reddit and I'm posting now for the first time cause I feel like I need to talk about it and see anyone else out there gets it at all? I feel very alone and I don't know what to do.
 
It's 2am where I am and it's another sleepless night for me, I've always suffered from insomnia and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I am so aware that mentally I'm not doing great, and feel low and it doesn't make sense, I have a roof over my head, a loving family however small and broken, and a loving supportive boyfriend, and yet it feels like there is this constant shadow over me, my brain feels clouded and to be frank all over the shop. More and more recently I've been seriously questioning is me being here worth it? I struggle a lot of days especially recently to get out of bed, I feel completely worthless and useless in life, my brain works (as many of you experience) constantly working over drive on negativity and it's exhausting. I just want this to stop, just all of it to stop. I don't want to die, I just want my brain stop this shit.

Tonight of all nights it really feels like too much, and these thoughts scare me, the realisation that your brain is almost planning of to off yourself, when deep down you know you don't want to die!

Does this make sense to anyone? Or am I rambling on with sleep deprived nonsense?
