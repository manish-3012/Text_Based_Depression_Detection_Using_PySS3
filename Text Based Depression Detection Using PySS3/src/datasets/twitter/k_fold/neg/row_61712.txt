I need to follow throughGirls have been the biggest problem in my entire life, Iâ€™ve run through this shit countless times, but I always bitched out of killing myself, but that didnâ€™t change anything. Iâ€™ve been a horny little shit since I was 7, and relationships are something Iâ€™ve tried since elementary school. It was terrible because I was gross and uncool until 7th grade because I moved. New school, new place, new life, right? Absolutely fucking not! I made friends with the wrong crowd, never got involved in high school and lost my clique junior year. Sophomore year I tried to ask out this new girl, but she didnâ€™t even acknowledge me, something about only dating black guys, it makes me hate interracial couples with white girls now. Iâ€™ve been stood up junior prom, and senior prom I spent crying outside he venue. Iâ€™m a freshman in college, things are supposed to be different, but the women look and act the same. I just want sex with a beautiful girl, it shouldnâ€™t take much to let it happen, Iâ€™ve been waiting 10+ fucking years for my chance, and Iâ€™m not gonna lower my standards, I mean thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m on this subreddit, Iâ€™d rather kill myself. If I canâ€™t have sex with a beautiful girl within 2 weeks, than just tell me to off myself so I can actually get enough encouragement to do it, your not a murderer, your just a requested critic.
