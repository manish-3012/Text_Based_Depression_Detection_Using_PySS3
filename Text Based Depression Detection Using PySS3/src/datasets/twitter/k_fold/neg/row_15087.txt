Back again.Hi. It's me again. 

I'm graduating from 10th grade tomorrow and I'm really not feeling it. It feels like any other sad Monday night. If I died tonight, I honestly wouldn't mind (like accidentally or naturally idk). 

I've been purposely avoiding my family.

I'm trying to distract myself from these thoughts but they just won't go away.

Idk what to do anymore. Quite surprised I'm still alive.
