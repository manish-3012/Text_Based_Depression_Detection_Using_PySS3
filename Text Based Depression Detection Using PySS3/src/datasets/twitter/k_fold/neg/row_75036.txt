Want to do something to myself so badSelf-harm was never something I did on a daily basis, it only ever happened in moments where I felt completely lost and hopeless. But after having to deal with numbness and that awful feeling of being unmotivated to do anything so often I really canâ€™t stop thinking about how much I hate the way Iâ€™m living. I genuinely think I deserve to be hurt or I can at least do it to think of something else that isnâ€™t my mental. Itâ€™s so stupid yet so effective sometimes. Last time I left two small scars and it kind of broke me for a while. I thought I could never ever do it again because of fear that Iâ€™ll leave scars. But why is it so tempting? I have also found out that doing it to parts of my body that I hate seems to help more while doing it, but the feeling after itâ€™s been done is so bad. And I still want to do it all over again. Why the fuck? It does not make any sense at all. Sometimes I feel so unmotivated to the point where I want to do it just to do something. It makes me want to cry so bad. I donâ€™t want to do it, but I also want to and I wish I didnâ€™t. I wish I never found out this is a way of coping with feelings like these at all. Unfortunately, itâ€™s way too late now.
