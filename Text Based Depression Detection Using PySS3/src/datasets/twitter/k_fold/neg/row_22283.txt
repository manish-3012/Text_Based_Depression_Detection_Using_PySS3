I've lost all motivationI wake up in the morning and I don't have any goals or aspirations. I just play video games or watch movies to get me through the day until I start the next one. I'm starting my senior year of high school soon and I still don't even have a reason to live. This has been a problem I have had for years but I have never felt so close to ending it all than I do right now.
