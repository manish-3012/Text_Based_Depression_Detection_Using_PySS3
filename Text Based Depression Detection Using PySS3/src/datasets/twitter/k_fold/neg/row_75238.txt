When you're the roadblock to another person's happinessI have a son. Just one. There won't be any more. All I think about is how much better his life would be if I was gone. My husband could remarry, have a bigger family with a better, happier person.

I am the source of misery. If I went, a path to love and joy would open for the people I care about most.

I hear all the time, "Oh, a child needs their parent." Uh huh. Read the open letters all over the internet from children who loathe or loathed their childhoods. They hate their parents for standing in the way of a better life.

So easy to just go and not have to wait for my son to hate me. And even if he does, at least I won't be there to listen. I think that's what so attractive about death. I may still be a lousy human, but at least I won't have to listen to the hateful crap anymore.
