What they'll say afterwardsI never did like that guy.
	* You know what? I didn't like you either.

He was always strange, a little bit off.
	* Whatever. Take a look in a mirror, you parochial fool.

	* Of course it doesn't. You knew me so well.

What a jerk.
	* Find someone who isn't.

I can't believe he would leave her alone.
	* She'll be fine. She has her family and her friends. And best of all, now she finally has a valid reason to feel sorry for herself.

I can't believe he would do that to his kids.
	* Do what? Remove them from my malignant influence?

What a coward.
	* Maybe. But it takes guts to kill yourself too.
