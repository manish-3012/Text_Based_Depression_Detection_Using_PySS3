I've thought about killing myself every single day since high schoolI don't even know what normal is anymore. I was the generic weird/awkward kid in high school people fucked with. I wasn't a total outcast. I still went to the occasional party and hung out with people but I always knew I was just tolerated. 

There was one girl specifically who I was absolutely in love with. I would have given anything to have a single conversation with her and she is the only person in HS that literally never said a single word to me. We'd hang out in the same general circle, be at the same parties, but never acknowledged me in any way. She did spit in my drink once...that I know of. Other then that, no interaction at all. 

I've thought about contacting her just to see if I had done something or said something to her that I completely forgot about considering I was usually high or drunk on something back then. But there's no way I would ever be able to contact her directly. 

I still feel completely worthless. Like there's something about me that just repulses people like her. I don't know if this something I'll ever get over. I don't necessarily want to die. I just don't want to be me anymore.
