I just want to die.Iâ€™m so tired of living. Iâ€™m so sad all the time. I hate who I am. I have no true friends. Iâ€™ve never accomplished anything. I went to rehab at 14, jail at 16 and now Iâ€™m 20 and I feel like dying is the only thing left to do. Im a degenerate and I know that no one will miss me.
