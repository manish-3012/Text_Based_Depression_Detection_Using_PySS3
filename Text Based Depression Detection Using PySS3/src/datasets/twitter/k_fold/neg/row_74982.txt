Life is a jokeAs above. I hate life so much I wish I could twist its neck and kill it. Unfortunately, I can only kill myself. I want to kill myself after being disappointed for so long and for so many times. Why can't things be like before for me when it was so much easier? Of course, things always get worse and worse until one is trapped with a negative cycle. I feel like living is not worth it, and living is not fair for me if it's going to hurt every single time no matter what I do. Hurt and betrayed so many times I wonder how I'm still here ALIVE. 

And yeah, I don't deserve to be so strong all the time. I deserve to lie in peace and do whatever I want without anybody and life trying to ruin it. Nobody really appreciates me for what I do; just a few friends who are always there for me. 

TLDR; I hate life.
