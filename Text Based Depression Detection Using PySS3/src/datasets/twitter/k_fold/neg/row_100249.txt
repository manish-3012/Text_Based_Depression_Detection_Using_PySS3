No one cares about my feelings at allNo one cares man and when I'm 25 I think I'm gonna end it. I'm tired of people not understanding my feelings and thinking I'm just too emotional or something. So I'm done people don't try to understand me at all and that's not fair to me especially when I deserve to have these things understood.
