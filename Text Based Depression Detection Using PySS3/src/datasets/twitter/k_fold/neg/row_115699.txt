Why?Why canâ€™t I move on? Why canâ€™t I be a normal person? Why am I a monster? Why am I a burden to everyone around me? Why do I ruin everything? Why do I destroy my relationships with my friends and family? Why canâ€™t I be a better person? Why am I completely insane? Why canâ€™t I motivate myself to do anything positive? Why am I the parasite in everyoneâ€™s life? Why am I an awful excuse for a human being? Why do I hurt the people I care the most? Why canâ€™t I enjoy life? Why canâ€™t I be happy? Why canâ€™t I just kill myself already?
