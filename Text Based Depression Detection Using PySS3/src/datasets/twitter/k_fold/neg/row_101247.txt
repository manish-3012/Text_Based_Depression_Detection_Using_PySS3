Dont know anymoreIve been thinking about nothing but suicidal thoughts for 2 months now. I've failed at most things in my life. I havent been able to live up to my parents expectations, I've become distant to my friends. My ex left me for her workmate last year and my heart still aches. My best friend left and sided with my ex. My other friends are distanting themselves from me. Ive failed units at tafe that I needed to pass to transfer. My hobbies and passion for sports have disappeared and no longer bring me joy. Ive been abusing alcohol and other substances, I started cutting again, I hate being alive. Im 18 and have given up. Im probably the weakest person out there.
