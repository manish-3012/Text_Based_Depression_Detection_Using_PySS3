I thought streaming would help me overcome until....I hate to admit it but I have depression. For so long I've been in denial and have been hiding it so nobody looks at me like a freak. But anyway, I recently started to stream to help me overcome my depression and feel a bit more positive about living. Until I realize I'm nothing more than a little ant in a sea of talented content creators and nobody really gives a shit about me, no matter how much I hide my tears behind this fake and happy smile. That's the name of the game, the streaming game that is and I realized streaming didn't help me but just made me worse than I was. It was fun creating content, overlays, my vr model and all that jazz but end of the day it's just me and my monitor and nobody watching. It made me realize nobody really gives a fuck about my existence and nobody would even care if I were to go die somewhere. I thought doing something like that and putting myself out there would help me overcome my problems but it only made me feel worse. More than ever I want my miserable life to end.
