I donâ€™t want to leave my childrenSince some point in the military I lost a lot of emotion I guess itâ€™s just depression. I have a wonderful family a â€˜goodâ€™ job that I hate, and I just donâ€™t find enjoyment out of life outside of my children. Iâ€™m worried someday Iâ€™ll think my children would be better without me. In my current frame of mind I know that would never be the case, however I still worry.

This is very hard to write sorry for a lack of detail.
