For once my self harm may have been accidentalBasically, I took too much birth control by accident when I fucked up my days of the week due to cognitive dysfunction. I'm not gonna die or have to go to the hospital, but I'm gonna physically feel like shit for a couple days. I'm scared to tell anyone though because it's pretty known that my "plan" is OD, so I'm afraid I might be put on watch.
