I've betrayed someone's trust for the second time    I already betrayed the trust of my friend and now i've done it again. I feel so disgusted and ashamed of myself. I feel so guilty that i can't even sleep at night. I want to make up for what happened but i can't somehow find a way to forgive myself. I can't stand the anxiety, the disappointment and the guilt that is eating me inside. I just want to end this fucking agony once and for all.
