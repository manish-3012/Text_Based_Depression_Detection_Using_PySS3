always knew it would happenIt's been a while since my previous post... after that, life actually seemed to get better. I managed to secure another internship, ten times more interesting than the one I got kicked from. That gave me a newfound wave of productivity and creativity which felt amazing. The high culminated today where I got what I thought was a glimpse of a hopeful future; moving into another home in the city, getting new pets, and even being accepted into yet another and far more interesting internship after I'm done with the current one...

But I know the pattern my life takes. It goes up, and then down, and then up, and then down. Over the years both have grown more extreme. Only that I didn't know the low would hit so quick...

I just got an email reply from my university for my gap year request. It's easy to guess what they said.

I... can't go. Not enough money, not enough experience, and the fricking COVID is why I had to ask them. I had REASONS. I had PROOF. And somehow that's still not enough.

And thus, I have to say goodbye to my dream and my future. There's nowhere else I can go; I've put all my eggs in one basket and dropped it a half year ago. They've seen me, they didn't take me, they see me again and they won't take me. This one took me, and I turned it down; they're going to spare me the work of doing that next year by turning *me* down.

Why waste the time? There's nothing left to do. What am I even doing these internships for? As I said, no higher education = no job = no money = no success. Just going to be stuck doing nothing, being useless.

I don't think I'll go to work tomorrow. Would tonight be the night? Am I brave enough?
