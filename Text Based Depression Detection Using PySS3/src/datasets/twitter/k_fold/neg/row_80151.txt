I don't know what to do.So I've been thinking about hanging myself for a few months and finally I tried it today. Obviously it didn't work and now the only option I had is also gone. I was quite scared while doing it and spent almost half an hour with the noose around my neck standing on a chair but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It was like I was telling my legs to move and kick the chair but my legs just wouldn't move. After a little while I managed to do it and thus began the struggle, firstly it does hurt if anyone is wondering, secondly my body went berserk and I guess I somehow managed to get the knot off and kind of just fell. When I woke up my head was hurting and there was a piercing pain in my chest as well(lol). My neck didn't really hurt that much which was quite unexpected. The thing is I had been considering this as my best option up till now and since it failed I have absolutely no clue what to do anymore
