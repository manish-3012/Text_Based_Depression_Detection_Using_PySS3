Will be homeless soonMy mom has stopped even trying to keep up with bills and rather go to the family reunion than stay back and make rent.
 I'm broke from paying a car that she convinced me to get in my name and said she would pay but got so far behind I took over it so my credit isn't shit.

Now after 4 months of constantly paying rent late she rather go on vacay than pay it and said we would just go to court.

I don't want to be homeless again, I don't want to give up my ESA. I don't want to be on the streets. 

So I'm planning to just kill my self man... maybe the life insurance would pay out my grandparents had gerber life insurance on me since I was born and I'm now 22 so it should be a decent pay out.
I have a few razors I hid from the last time I considered it but this time I think it's time. I rather not be homeless I rather not keep going on like this and atleast my death would be helpful the first time I'll be helpful.


I just idk what to write in my note... I don't want them to spend it on stupid shit just bills I don't even want a funeral like man just dump me in a trash bin somewhere idk... I just want my cat going somewhere we're she will be loved I don't trust my family because even when I'm here they are abusive to her I rather her go somewhere nice... I have a lot of planning to do before next Monday.
