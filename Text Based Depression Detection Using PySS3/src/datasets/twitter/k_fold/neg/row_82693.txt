I feel like an idiotHey. I feel so stupid. My whole family are super intelligent and I feel like I missed that gene. Iâ€™ve tried hard my whole life, worked hard but always felt stupid.  Iâ€™ve got a memory like a sieve, Iâ€™m dyslexic and find it hard to retain any information.
My teachers called me thick, my friends and I can even see it in my families eyes when Iâ€™m talking to them. I know they think Iâ€™m an idiot and itâ€™s so hard to push through. When your the idiot of the family your not looked upon for anything. Advice, opinions, help with work etc. It makes you feel like you wanna disappear so they donâ€™t have to be disappointed every time they talk to me. 

They ask me for certain things to â€œmake me feel betterâ€ about never being asked. To make me feel somewhat part of the family but even when I offer help they look at me like Iâ€™m an idiot and donâ€™t on board my help, only pretend to. 

I canâ€™t bare it. It crushes me inside. Iâ€™m the disappointment. The idiot. The one who canâ€™t hold an intellectual conversation. Iâ€™m useless.
