I want to end my lifeI'm 15 and I really really really want to kill my self 
No one will miss me because no one cares about me.
And these past 8 years have been really shitty.
My "friends" ditch me at least 6 times a week and like to curse me out as often as they can although I have never done anything to them. Plus no one in my family loves me a can tell they all hate me. Also I have been really stressed  lately because of the thought of going back to school and to the people that hate me  and my teachers would yellat me for things I didn't do.
And telling me that I will fail in life and never get married or get a good job. It's just too much for me to handle. I really want to kill my self. It will be fast and silent plus no one will find out I killed my self and they wouldn't care enough to find my lifeless corpse.
Idk I'm probably going to end it all some time next week.
