Breaking up, nowhere to go, unsure what to do.My girlfriend and I (of 1 1/2 years) are breaking up. While this in itself is heartbreaking, its a bit more troubling than it should be...

I've devoted everything I've had to the relationship; however, I will have nothing to show for it. Our lease, utilities, etc. are all in her or her parent's name. Hell, I even got rid of all of my furnishings and we decided to use hers since hers was nicer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've got at most $200 to my name, I'm going to have nowhere to go with basically nothing but some clothes and boxes full of junk/ momentos. I have no car, nothing of real value to sell. No real family to turn to or anything, I'm basically f\*cked.

Now heres where I get frank, I know I'm going to get people telling me "Suicide is wrong", but I've been through all of this before. I've been admitted to psyche wards (multiple times) for my depression/ suicide watch. I'm on meds, I've been in therapy my whole life. I've even been completely homeless before. I've been through breakup. Its all crap I've been through. I'm just wondering if its worth piecing what little life I have together after this (being homeless in winter and the heartache of breakup) or if its just not worth it. I really don't have anything positive to look forward to or give me strength to go through all of this.... again.

Even before breaking up I've been plagued by the thought of suicide at least on a weekly basis despite years of therapy and medication and support groups. I'm just frankly out of energy. Previous times I've been through suicidal issues I've given myself a few days to see if I can recover/ get out of it; as will I this time. I think I'm genuinely out of energy this time, though. I guess I'll see what you guys have to say.
