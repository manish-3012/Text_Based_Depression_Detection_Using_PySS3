I hurt someone else and I don't feel like I deserve to ever forgive myself for itI unintentionally said something quite racist to someone who is themselves struggling with suicidal thoughts and depression. I apologised but never heard back. I have felt guilty for it ever since and it has exacerbated my suicidal thoughts a lot, and I don't know what to do. I don't feel like it's okay to forgive myself. Why do I deserve to feel okay and be free of the consequences of hurting someone else? If I could hurt someone that much, don't I deserve not to live or at least to be deeply hurt myself? But at the same time I have attempted to overdose before and I'm worried I will try again, but maybe it's deserved - I don't know. I just don't know what to do about this.
