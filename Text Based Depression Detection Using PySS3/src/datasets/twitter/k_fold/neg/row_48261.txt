I don't want to die, but just disappearIt's midnight now, I'm getting suicidal again. Maybe it's the stress before exam, or maybe my frustration over rejection, I don't know. I'm tired of having depressed for years and being a burden to anyone. Even then, I don't think I'll be able to kill myself. All I want is to just disappear somewhere far...
