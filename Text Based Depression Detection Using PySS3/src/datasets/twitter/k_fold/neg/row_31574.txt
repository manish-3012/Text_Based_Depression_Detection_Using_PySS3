I deserve to die.I learned about white privilege today. Not that I didn't already know about it, but I learned a lot more about today.

I learned exactly how much I am and should be hated for the color of my skin. I learned about how my feelings about race are completely irrelevant, and rightfully so. I learned that there are bloggers that refer to my race as "white peepul", because I am not even worthy of being considered a person.

The world would be better if I just died. I deserve to die. I'm white scum. I make everyone sick with my thoughts and opinions and everyone hates me. And I deserve it.

I try so hard to be kind and good, but I will never be kind and good. I'm ignorant and I'm scum. I'm a terrible fucking person. Someone give me a reason not to fucking end it...
