friends don't last foreveri apologize in advance for the language
i fucking hate this stupid fucking world, people say them want to help you but its all a lie. i was there for my friend when he was going through depression and problems with his girlfriend and wanted to kill himself. i helped him, i got him past the darkness, he's still depressed but he's back witth his girlfriend and doesn't want to kill himself. but when i ask for help from him he says he's too busy, but when he needs money hes my best friend. my friends only use me when they need something, someone to load their problems on, take money from anything they can take from me. they dont care about me, if i died they wouldn't care. maybe my family would but not them. im so alone and what makes it worse is i was there for my friends whenever they needed me, 3;00am in the morning, yep i was wake to talk them out of suicide, but when its me who wants to die no one is there. their off avoiding me, lying to me not giving a shit if im alive or dead. i hate them i hate them for not being here for me, for leaving me alone, isolated when i was ALWAYS there for them.
