I feel guilty about being depressed and having suicidal thoughts because my life really hasn't been that misfortunate. While other people suffer a lot more and manage to trek on despite it.Every day is a losing battle. I feel utterly alone 24/7. I have a hand full of "friends" I hang with on a regular basis but I'm so distant from them I'm basically just an acquaintance to them. My depression stems from feeling worthless to the people around me. Although I've never gone through any personal trauma or had terrible people put me down before. I feel like I don't deserve sympathy and at the same time I hate the idea of people pitying me. The days keep getting tougher man :/
