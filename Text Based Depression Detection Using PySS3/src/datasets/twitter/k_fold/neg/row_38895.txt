I've decided to end my life today. I hate being around mankind. I don't like what life is either. In order to do anything in life I have to be around other human beings. There is nothing worse in my experiences on this planet than being around other human beings. No one really cares about me or my feelings anyway. The last person that gave a shit about me died 18 years ago. Since that day it's been one horrible experience after another with people. I mean liberals pretend to care about you. But that's only so they can look cool in front of their other left wing friends and oppose right wing people. They really don't care about me or you. It's an act. 

I'm tired of life and today was the final straw. My coworkers were all assholes. I tried to be reasonable but it didn't work. I put up with their shit for years. Today was the deal breaker though. I went to the bathroom and when they poured cold water over the stall I got upset. I came out of the stall and I push one of my coworkers so hard he broke the sink when he hit the wall. The fired me. I stand up for myself one time and get punished. I'll be homeless soon. I've developed so much hate for human nature, there is no way I'll find another job. 

I did do one thing though. I purchased a .40 cal hand gun and ammunition on my way home today. I'm going to turn the heat all the way up. I'm going to take my trash and all the food out of my fridge and dump it in my living room. I'm going to sit down in the middle of it and put a bullet though my head. In 3 or 4 weeks when my landlord finds me it will be such a horrible mess someone's going to have to clean up. 

That's what I want to leave this world with. I know I'll just be forgotten in a week or two but fuck it. Fuck mankind, fuck the idea of life and fuck the hell you people have created here. You thought you could hold me down forever but think again assholes. I control when this ride is over, not you.
