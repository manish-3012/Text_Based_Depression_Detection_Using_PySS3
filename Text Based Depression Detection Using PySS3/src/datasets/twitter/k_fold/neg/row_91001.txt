She is Okay Today, But I Want To Keep Her Safe.Hi All,
I hope this is the right place.  If it isn't, please let me know where I should take my post.

I'm writing today because I'm quite frankly scared shitless by last night's events.  I received a garbled message from my friend (who happens to be bipolar 2) which said in essence that she wanted to take 'a fistful of klonopin' but had an angel on her shoulder telling her not to.  She then said that she was joking, but noted that she really had Valium and was 'so, so blue.'  I have dealt with feelings of suicide myself, and thus I called her immediately.  It went straight to voicemail.  I called our state's  suicide hotline and all people were busy.  I then called the second number that the hotline provided and left a message there.  When they didn't respond for about ten minutes and I was trying to contact her to no avail, I ended up calling local police to do a welfare check on her.  I hated doing that because I know it would be terrifying to be so low and then have cops show up at your door, but I felt I had no choice and wanted to ensure her safety.  

Edit: Forgot to say that she finally text me back after I spoke with the police and tried to backtrack about the drugs but I was still concerned.  They apparently checked on her and left, according to her. She had not taken anything, thankfully.

Moving forward, I have no idea how to proceed to try and keep her safe.  She texted me that she is at work today and I urged her to call her psychiatrist who she apparently met up with yesterday, so far no response. I just want to be supportive and make sure she gets the help she needs.  

Thanks very much.
