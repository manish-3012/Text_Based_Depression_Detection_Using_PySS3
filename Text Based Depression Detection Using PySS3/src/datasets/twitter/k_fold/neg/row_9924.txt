Iâ€™m very sad.Iâ€™m a deeply sad and lonely person. Iâ€™m 22, I pay 500$ a month to sleep on a cot with no privacy, I had leave college, Iâ€™ve been fired from every job I loved, Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend because Iâ€™m repulsive, and I canâ€™t stop thinking of sex, and I got herpes from my only fuck buddy. Iâ€™ve had an outbreak since I was diagnosed except when pills take it away, Iâ€™m disgusted with myself, but I still want sex and intimacy so much. I canâ€™t pay my insurance bill of like ~200$, and I canâ€™t get around because I live in Florida and have no car. 

Is anyone awake to just talk? Iâ€™m trying to just not think about it recently, but itâ€™s hard when Iâ€™m alone. 

Thereâ€™s a bridge near my house Iâ€™m thinking of jumping off of. Usually heights terrifying, but when I look over it I donâ€™t feel scared. Itâ€™s like the water is inviting me to come home. I donâ€™t fit in with anyone. Shouldnâ€™t I just end it?
