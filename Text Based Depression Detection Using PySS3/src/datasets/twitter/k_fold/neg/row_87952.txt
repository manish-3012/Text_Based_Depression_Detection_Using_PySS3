I met a Vampire yesterday and i asked him why is Life so pointless and this was his answerHmm....Indeed, itâ€™s hard to compare anything i know.Yet you are aware we donâ€™t see death as you do. The way you cling to life - we find it entirely peculiar.

You are mortal, ergo itâ€™s a foregone conclusion- you will die. Itâ€™s but a question of time.
Thus I often find myself wondering why you try so hard. To die at twenty years,forty even a hundred - whatâ€™s the difference? Theyâ€™re all but the blink of an eye.
