The question left is: is this worth the effort?This isn't as much as I'm sad or upset, but more that I'm tired. I'm tired of having to deal with the constant struggle. Living is always effort. It's always another test, another obstacle to leap over, and in the end there won't really be any reward for all of this. I'm pretty sure at this point that all the spiritual bs I was fed since a kid is bs. And I'm pretty sure that there is nothing beyond this life. All of this will be erased in the end and I won't possess the consciousness to see what impact my life had, an impact which will diminish with time like everything else.

So then the question presents itself: Is it worth laboring over something that brings no reward?

Welcome to my poetry reading, I'll be here every Sunday.
