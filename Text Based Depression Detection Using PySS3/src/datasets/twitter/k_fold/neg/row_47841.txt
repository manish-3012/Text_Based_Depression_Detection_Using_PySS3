Hey YouHey E, I canâ€™t do this living thing anymore. The trauma you put me through has made it unbearable for me to live any longer. Everyday I wake up wishing the day was over, I look forward to sleeping because itâ€™s the only thing that gives me ever lasting peace when Iâ€™m not on some kind of drug. You said I was the love of your life and I was your soul mate, yet you ghosted me for months and didnâ€™t bother messaging me until I told you I was suicidal. Your apologies canâ€™t help, this isnâ€™t just in my head like you say. This is reality, I hate it. Tonight will be my last on earth. Iâ€™m finally going to rest. Good bye
