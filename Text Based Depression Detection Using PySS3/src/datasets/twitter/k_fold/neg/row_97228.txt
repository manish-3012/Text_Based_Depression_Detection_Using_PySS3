I survived my overdose (again)*** Pre cursor: please read my previous posts ***

I overdosed again and survived..I got back home and my wife officially left me and took our dog. 

Whilst I was in Florida I bought everyone presents to try remain civil - not a single thankyou or even a message.

My wife and I had a final â€˜chatâ€™ and are semi friends but during our talk, which her brother knew about, he kept messaging her...stating that I never tried to overdose / that he didnâ€™t realise (he shouted at me and threatened to come beat me up and kept saying â€œhow dare youâ€ and calling me a liar that I never tried to kill myself etc). 

I didnâ€™t even get the dignity to have a final conversation with my wife without interference/her actual full attention...I showed her the messages and missed calls etc as proof (literally stating I had overdosed) and she forgave him INSTANTLY. No questions asked, legit just acted like no cares given and said â€œIâ€™m not getting involvedâ€.

So yea, I unfortunately survived my overdose. Iâ€™ve been back for 4 days and a puppy local to me became available. My grandparents bought him for me to try give me a reason to live. I really am trying my best but the urges are coming back stronger than ever. 

Disassociative amnesia is what I was diagnosed with. Essentially due to my trauma I blackout and do something if I get too anxious/worked up. For example when my brother in law was shouting etc and threatening me &gt; i overdosed.

To not even trust yourself, especially when you now have a dependant animal on your hands, is terrifying.

Every ounce of me wants to just die. Iâ€™m forcing myself to be there for Newt (Harry Potter reference, massive fan of the books). He is only 8 weeks old and needs support but I donâ€™t know how long I can hold on
