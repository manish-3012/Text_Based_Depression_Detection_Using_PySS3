Not an interesting postDo you guys ever feel sad for no reason? Like it's just the way you are: a sad person.
People tell me there's a reason behind it, that theraphy will help eventually, that if I am possitive and patient things will work out, maybe it's out of pity, maybe they are proyecting what they want to think... it's funny cause usually when someone say things like that it hurts, it makes me feel even more alienated
Tbh I accepted long ago that this is who I am, my natural state, and thinking about it don't make me sad, just helpless, empty. I feel it's healthier to see it that way.
Sorry about the spelling, it was just a quick flow of consciousness before going back to reality
That's all, hope you guys are ok, wherever you are :)
