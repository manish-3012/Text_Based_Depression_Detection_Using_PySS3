About to lose job and the roof over my headthis is my first time posting here and honestly i feel like such a failure. i donâ€™t have anything saved because i live paycheck to paycheck and simply canâ€™t save. i end up over drawing my account to be able to even eat a single piece of bread. i have no where to go, i have no one to help me. i cant ask for a loan.

i feel like such a nuisance to my friends even then. December 4, 2017 is the supposed the last day at my job and after i collect my things i plan on taking the train downtown and jumping off of a bridge head first on to traffic.

i cant face my family like this anymore. i cant look at anyone in the eyes anymore. iâ€™m crying my fucking head off because i canâ€™t do shit right.

iâ€™m being buried fast and faster... i donâ€™t know what to do....
