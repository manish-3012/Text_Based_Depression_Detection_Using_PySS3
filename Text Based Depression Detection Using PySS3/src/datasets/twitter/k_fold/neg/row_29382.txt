But I'm still suicidal.And very recently I realized that I can't. I don't think my sister could handle it. I don't think my mother could handle it. I don't think my only friend could handle it. Everyone else would be fine. It's not comforting, to think about grief saved. I've been praying for a bad car crash or freak accident.


I want to get better, but don't know how to get there. The last two years of my life I've let everything go to shit, because I wasn't planning to be around much longer anyway. I've made a huge mess for myself, and I don't know how to climb back. I've lost all sense of who I am. I don't do *anything* any more. I can't even sit down to read now without getting distracted. I don't feel real. I feel like a shell of a human, always walking around hazy-eyed. I feel out of it, weak, and dumb.


School is worse. I was raped a party  and never told anyone until my roommate found me covered my own blood and fucked on pills. Cue ER visit, more depression, and now PTSD. I stayed in school and came really close to failing out. I was eventually given a year-long academic suspension for fucking up too bad.



I don't have the motivation to do anything. I used to draw. Now my anxiety is too bad for me to even try. I was never good anyway. My dad killed that dream really young.



I come off as a very normal (maybe shy) person, yet I literally have one friend. We go to packed bars, and try to meet people. It usually ends up being a circle of people around her, while the bouncer gives me pity shoulder shrugs. No one gives a fuck who I am when I'm next to her though.


I'm just going to sleep off the rest of this life.
