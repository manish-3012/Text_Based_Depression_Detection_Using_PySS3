Envious of suicideIâ€™ve always been a loner and my weird quirks made it hard to make or sustain friends.  Iâ€™ve never been a weak minded, Iâ€™ve always prided myself on how much my body can endure. No matter how heavy the weight is, we usually lift our feelings. 
  Recently Iâ€™ve been hearing of deaths from accidental to suicide. I donâ€™t really know why but Iâ€™m envious of the ones who go through with it. Iâ€™ve had some dark thoughts and feelings but couldnâ€™t act on them from my faith. Itâ€™s a longing effect that gets stronger as the days roll by.
