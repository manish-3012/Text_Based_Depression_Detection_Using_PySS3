I plan on killing myself.Hi,  
I'm fairly new to all of this. I've never had any online support or anything and I only recently joined reddit. I feel as though I have no future, nothing will ever change. I feel like I've hit rock bottom, I can barely get up in the mornings, which is causing me so much trouble; my attendance sucks. I just have no motivation to go about living my life, and I'm seriously considering just ending it all soon. I've never tried seeking support, so please be kind. Thank you.
