Iâ€™m deployed, married with three kids, my wife and I love each other but things are going down hill.[M27] Despite the family, the love and all there is to live for, we are struggling. My wife isnâ€™t happy, with herself and a little with me Iâ€™m sure.  Thereâ€™s a lot of things going on and I donâ€™t feel like writing it all out. But I just feel as if, I was gone itâ€™d be easier for her. The Army would compensate her for my death and our families would always take care of the kids. Plus sheâ€™s the strongest woman I know so she would work and take care of the family. And... I know sheâ€™d miss me. And not want me gone. And itâ€™s that and the kids is why Iâ€™m on edge about it. But like... why not. No more fights. No more issues married couples have Iâ€™m sure. Idk. Just low and I feel like... idk. Maybe. Why not.
