10 year old girl threatening suicide...?Not sure if this is the right subreddit.  I need help.

A 10 year old in my family was recently rushed to a psychologist after telling her school friends that she was going to end her life.  She then reportedly told the psychologist that she had tried to kill herself a year ago.  Other than this, no one in the family recalls noticing any signs.

She was the youngest of her cousins (by far) and has always been the "baby" of the family, until the birth of a younger cousin a few months ago.  Her grandparents and parents spoil her endlessly with material things, iPods, clothes, cell phones.  Her mother barely knows how to cook, so they eat fast food every day, and their house is often a huge mess.  I mention this because I myself have had issues with anxiety and I find that nutritious food and a clean, harmonious environment makes a huge difference.  I don't know if she knows about my own struggle (I have been an outpatient at a psych ward) but she does know I see a psychologist, because she once asked me why.  At school, she struggles with some subjects and has a fair amount of friends.

She has a track record of going to the infirmary and complain of various ailments, to the point where her teachers allowed her to leave classes because they thought she had a terrible medical condition.  She does this around family too, and I personally considered it to be a call for attention (she will often complain of trouble breathing and laugh when everyone got concerned, etc.)

I'm not sure what this is.  I don't want to dismiss it, but she does have a habit of calling for attention.  How can we best help her?

Thanks.
