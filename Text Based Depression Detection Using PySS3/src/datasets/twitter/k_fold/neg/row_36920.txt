I tried it last night...I cut myself and took multiple pills. I woke up though. As if nothing had even happened. 

This wouldn't be happening if I had someone to cuddle with at night. If I had someone to tell me "I love you". Someone who could be my best friend as well as a lover. I have none of that. Every single night for twenty years, I have went to bed alone and depressed. I always cry myself to sleep. It's not fair. Where is my princess? Why did I do to deserve being alone? I just want *one* person to share my life with. *One*. Someone who loves me just as much as I would of them. I've tried everything from OkCupid to posting on reddit. Every time I've posted on reddit, it was downvoted into oblivion. Every time I message someone on OkCupid, I'm told I'm "ugly", "unattractive", "monstrous", and even "wretched". 

Every time I see a couple...I want to yell, scream, cry, and cut. And I do. I do all of it. Only this time I just don't want to keep waking up anymore.
