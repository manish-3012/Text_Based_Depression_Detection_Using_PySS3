LostIâ€™m 17 years old and have just kinda lost hope with everything. Iâ€™ve changed a lot from younger me , in ways I donâ€™t like. I used to sit in class with people who just told me to shut up any time I said a single word ( literally I only was able to get out a handful of sentences the entire 3 years). I was ridiculed and made fun of and if I tried stand up for myself I would be told Iâ€™m being a dry shite and itâ€™s just a joke. I began to lose all interest in school and eventually stopped trying at all because I dreaded being there.I feel like I wasted the talent I had, going from winning competitions and getting near perfect scores on everything I did to just barely passing most subjects. In the past year itâ€™s gotten a bit better, Iâ€™ve found a few good friends but am struggling to make stronger connections. Iâ€™ve noticed Iâ€™ve become a not so nice person, making jokes about people, not because I dislike them but because thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ve kind of been conditioned to act because how I was treated I guess. Though I donâ€™t really mean anything I say I still feel like Iâ€™m hurting people I donâ€™t want to.Even people I really like I donâ€™t feel I can trust, I act less nice to them , sprinkling in a 1 negative joke with every 2 positives so it doesnâ€™t seem like I care about them when they donâ€™t actually like me back or are just pretending to like me as a joke. Recently i made a pretty big mistake while setting up a fibre optic cable at work (6-8 thousand euros worth) and weâ€™ve yet to test the wire to see if itâ€™s working. I donâ€™t want to let everyone down seeing that most likely me and the two people with me would lose our jobs if it ends up being broken. I just really hope it doesnâ€™t fail cause I donâ€™t know if I can get past that. The stress alone has been killing me and I really just donâ€™t know what to do. With quarantine going on as well Iâ€™ve felt more lonely than ever. A few weeks ago my neighbor hanged himself outside my window and I suppose feeling sorry for his family is the only thing that has kept me here as I do love my family and wouldnâ€™t want to let them down any more than I felt I have.
