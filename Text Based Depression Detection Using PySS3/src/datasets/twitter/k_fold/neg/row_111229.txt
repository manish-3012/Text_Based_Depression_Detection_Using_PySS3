If nobody else cares about me, why should I?Hey SW. First time poster, longtime lurker. Most days I come here and read through the comments on other posts, as they usually give me some mental comfort. Today is the first day they haven't.

I constantly feel like nobody cares about me. That everybody just wants to use me for money, affection, emotional comfort, etc. None of my friends seem to care. I cut for the first time a few weeks ago, despite promising for years I'd never do it, and found relief. I've not cut since, but my emotions are on a downhill sprint to the finish line (the finish line being my death). 

At least 4 hours a day are spent with a lump in my throat, feeling tears well up with the inability to cry, and do my best to hide the fact that I'm so miserably depressed so nobody thinks any less of me. 

I can't ask for help, I don't want a psychiatrist or a therapist or anyone that I have to fucking pay just to let out my emotions, and hotlines never seem to help other than make me feel worse for wasting other people's time. I don't want friends because I constantly feel like they don't even like me other than when I have money or they have problems. I'm tired of being ignored. I've never felt so alone before, and I feel like this could be the day that I find out what's beyond the light at the end of the tunnel.

Edit: I apologize to those who have tried to help me, but I just don't belong. I'm sorry.
