PoemI am human

Externally similar to you and yet internally so very different

So do not dare attempt to claim we are referent

I have made the external match the internal and it only ended with your dismay

Do not be so quick to judge or claim I am running away

For I am unfortunately human

..........................................

And I am alone

Abandoned by life and left on the side of the highway to slowly rot in pain

I am a missile without the vane

Falling out of control about to detonate

Mixed with feelings from a world filled with hate

For I am ignored and left alone

..........................................

So I am leaving

Will the world hear the sound of my final breath

Numbing the pain as I slip into my death

The universe will carry on

I am only a mere pawn

Good-bye to everyone for I am leaving
