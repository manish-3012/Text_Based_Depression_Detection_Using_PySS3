i've failed from career to career, now wife pregnanti'm a habitual failure who lucked into a marriage with a wonderful woman from whom I concealed my constant failure as I lost job after job.

Now she's pregnant.

I wish I could be killed through some company's negligence so they could live on with a settlement, and remember me fondly.

Before I met my wife, I failed out of grad school. I thought about ending it then. I should have. I've dragged my wife and unborn son into my spiral of failure.

I dealt with a lot of social rejection as a young person, and it scarred me. I have a complete inability to keep friends, and I'm addicted to online forums and bullshit just for the social connection. My wife met me in a brief period in which I had a group of friends and seemed like a normal social guy, but that ended. Truth is, they were losers like me that could keep up appearances, transiently brought together.

Anyway. I'm rambling. Probably not going to kill myself. Need to be there for my son. Wish I could provide him with a better life than I probably will, wish I never thrust any innocent people into a situation in which they'll have a shit provider like me.

I wish I could have ended it while I still had "potential". Now I'm just a loser in his 30s, a father to a son who ~~is not~~ *will not be* proud of his loser dad.

Sucks. Wish I could find a way out.
