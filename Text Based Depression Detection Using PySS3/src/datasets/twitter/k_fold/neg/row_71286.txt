The End is drawing NearHave you ever felt unloved? Uncared for? Well I feel it every day. Let me start from the begining...

I have a voice in my head. The voice tells me about how Im destined for greatness. How all my friends hate me secretly and only keep me around to laugh behind my back. How I should crush them all like the insects they are.

You see, these last few years, Ive felt hated. By everyone. I feel as though Im a disappointment to my parents, like they wish they could've, should've, had a "better" son.

My friends are no better. He (the voice) tells me how they all hate me. That they wouldnt care if I lived or died. Any proof towards its point is undeniable proof that they all hate me, and any evidence against is disregarded as pity.

I dont know if I can continue like this, in a world that hates me...

Perhaps he is right. About it all.
