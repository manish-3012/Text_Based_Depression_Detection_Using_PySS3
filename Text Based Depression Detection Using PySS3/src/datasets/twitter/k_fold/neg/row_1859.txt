This Is Me. The REAL Me.Alone. Trapped. Uncared for and unwanted. A few words to describe my life. I've written a few things on reddit about how I hate my life and shit, and people comment on them saying "you cant give up." "you're only doing this for attention." "i wont leave you." blah blah blah. 

Well here are somethings for those people, I gave up a long time ago. I'm only here because I know I'll be in more pain than if I die. There is no way in hell I'm doing this for attention. Damn it you sound like my mom ass hole. You say you wont leave me. A lot of people have told me that before. All those people have lied and left me. I know you're here for now, but soon I think you'll leave. Even you can't thats not true. 

Don't get me wrong, everything this girl has done for me is more than I could have ever asked for. I love her but I've loved a lot of people, friends, boys, etc. and all have left me at one point or another. So when the day comes that she does leave I wont be suprised but I'll miss her dearly. 

I have convinced myself that death is the only way out of all this pain I'm in. I still believe that and I'm pretty sure I always will. "No it's not. It does get better. You just got to hold on." I'm done with that bullshit. That believing in a fairytale ending doesn't erase my past. It doesn't erase the day I found my dads secret stash of chewing tobacco, or when I first cut myself, or tried to kill myself, or thought about not eating and throwing up whatever I did eat. 

If you knew me you would never guess these things about me. People always tell me what a happy person I am. But I'm not. Thats the truth.
