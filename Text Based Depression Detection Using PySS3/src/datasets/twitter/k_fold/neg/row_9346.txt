Dying..I know no one believes that Iâ€™m going to kill myself.. I really donâ€™t care.. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for longer then people even or every have wanted to think I was thinking for myself.. to the constant belittling of who I am, how I was raised by my grandparents and not my mom or dad, and how that I was set up as a mark in high school as something that needed to be pushed over and made into something I wasnâ€™t.. I hope you all can find peace in letting god deal with all your problems.. and hope that he covers for your checking out of what was being made of me. And not who I was to literally anyone else who wasnâ€™t a complete asshole or being made to look like one. None of you have to care. Thatâ€™s the point you let go and let god deal with lol your misjudged opinions and lack of understanding to who what and when sehome was for me.. and to a lesser extent no the people I cared about. I didnâ€™t bigot or belligerate over the n word and me being a nigger might be more then just who I was or made out to be..
