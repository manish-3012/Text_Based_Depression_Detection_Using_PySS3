I've been there, and I can help. I was extremely suicidal for two years up until a few months ago. In that time-span, I have made 22 suicide attempts, 9 near-successful, the rest interrupted. If you need help, or have questions, please PM me or comment for a group discussion.

Suicide is not the answer. The simple fact that you're here shows that at least a part of you wants to be helped, to live. Life is beautiful, whether you can see it now or not.
