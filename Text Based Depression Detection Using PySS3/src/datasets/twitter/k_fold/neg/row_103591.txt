I just admitted to my mother I'm suicidalHello everyone. I've never had any intentions of killing myself but sometimes, the days go by really slowly and artistic frustrations push me to my emotional limit. The past few days, I've been telling myself how I don't matter and that no one will care if I suddenly disappeared. I've been able to combat those feelings/thoughts before but right now, I'm shaking in my desk chair, listening to Game Grumps, trying to ease myself. I've felt emotionally drained this week and now, after an unnecessary argument over furniture with my mom, everything feels hopeless. I've told my brother that I might be optimistic for a few days then go right back into this depressive mood shortly after. It's becoming overwhelming and I don't know who I can turn to now. Maybe it's a just a fleeting emotion but I don't want to take any chances.
