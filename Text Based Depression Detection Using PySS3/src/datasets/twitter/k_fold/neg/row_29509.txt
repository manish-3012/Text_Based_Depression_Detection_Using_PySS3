really struggling with college and also all of itman I'm in the middle of finals season and its super hard to stay motivated when the suicide gremlin at the back of my brain is just shouting "HEY ASSHOLE, INSTEAD OF FINISHING YOUR PAPERS, TAKE A BUNCH OF PILLS?"        
i stretched myself way too thin this semester and im paying for it hardcore. it sucks a lot. I know im pursuing what i want to do, but man. this is hard. I don't feel valuable or smart or accomplished or anything good. I wanna sleep forever.
