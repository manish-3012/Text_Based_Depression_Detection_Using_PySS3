I'm so ungrateful wtf. Like I have a partner, friends and I'm completely able-bodied living in a 1st world country w access to educationI dont even know why I'm posting this here but I feel like idk I cant pass a bridge w/o having immense difficulties to suppress the desire to jump down anymore. Since my earliest childhood I've just had daydreams of different ways of dying and it always made me feel some sort of internal happiness. The first time I attempted was when I was about 12-13 but the thing I wanted to hang myself on broke. Started self hurting at primary school age and haven't stopped since although it was more when I was 12-13. 
Around 6 months ago I decided I'd definitely kill myself, already walking to the railway but a very special person unknowingly stopped me from doing it. A bit later they became my boyfriend and we've been a couple ever since. But everything I do is hurting him. I can see how sad he is that I have these thoughts and how much its pulling him down and as I'm almost sure I'm gonna do it in the next few days I suggested breaking up to him and explained that he really shouldn't be in a relationship w someone like me, but he just refuses to accept or admit how bad this is for him. He's the only person on this planet I actually care about, as I do not have any sort of connection to my family more than sharing a house (taken away by CPS at 11 but bro8ght back at 13) and I do have friends, but i just feel so numb when talking to them. All in all I'm just an ungrateful cunt that's being a terrible girlfriend and deserves to die
