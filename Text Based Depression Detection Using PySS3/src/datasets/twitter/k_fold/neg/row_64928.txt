If you're suicidal, seriously try to remove yourself from anything you could use to commit the act.Seriously. I live with family unfortunately and there's no way to get my father to remove the guns from the house without admitting how close am I to going over the edge. The other day I pulled out the shotgun and just stared at it for a half hour in my room. It's a freaky thought knowing you're one trigger pull away from ending it all.
