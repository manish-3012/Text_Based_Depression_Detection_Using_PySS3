tough, llonely, friendless timesIm 19, recently found out i have ADD, Autism and have had life long anxiety and depression.

I just dont know what to do with myself atm. I left college at 17 due to an overdose and since then iâ€™ve just spent my time drinking, abusing substances and have had a few drug induced epileptic seizures.

Im too scared to go back to college in febuary to carry on studying a subject i rlly enjoyed but scared iâ€™ll just go further down hill. I havent stopped drinking since christmas 4 Litres of cider a day and my life just seems absolutely pointless and all i wanna do is call it quits. Its boring.

Is there anything i can do to help myself. I take SSRIs but they just dont seem to have effects ive been on for 6 months and just can go out occasionally with them but my sadness still stays.

Should i speak to my doctor. Im from UK fyi is there anything to help me with these thoughts and mindset. All i get a dopamine boost from is drinking and itâ€™s already a problem i can tell.

Thankyou &lt;3
