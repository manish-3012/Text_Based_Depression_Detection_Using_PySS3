How do I handle my suicidle thought creeping back?I (20) recently enter a relationship and I feel like itâ€™s triggering something in me. Iâ€™ve been able to over come my suicidal thoughts and intentions exactly one year ago and feel like itâ€™s been creeping back in the past days.
Any idea on how to handle it so that it wonâ€™t comeback complete?
