I feel so lonelyI feel so lonely right know like nothing I do is right. I'm upsetting all my famliy and going no were in life right know. I'm supposed to be starting collage but I have not picked my class but I'm scared to. I'm fat over weight I just found out that I'm 300 pounds and I'm ugly no one knows how it feels like to be a girl and be that fat and I can't tell my grandma because I feel like I'm already a horrible person. My best friend moved to California to go to collage I just feel like drowning and no one can save me . I'm just so sad I feel like screaming and crying all the just so someone will hear me
