Afraid Of SurvivingI really don't want to live, and all the things that people say will "get better" I'm not sure even matter anymore. They might get better, maybe not, and I'm going to want to die regardless. I have a plan that I'll be able to attempt in a little over a month but I'm afraid of failing. I don't have too many different methods available to me to attempt suicide. I've been to therapy but never admitted to suicidal thoughts because there's a chance I can get kicked out for suicidal thoughts. If I attempt and get caught I'll almost certainly get kicked out. I'd be losing the plan I had for my future when I wasn't suicidal. I'd probably lose any benefits and would have wasted all this time for things to only get worse as I'll have to come home and face people as the dude who couldn't make it in the military. I don't have any guaranteed successful methods available to me like a gun though. I'm tired of being alive but can make things so much worse if I fail. The more lost I feel the more I want to go through with it which makes me more scared and feeds the cycle. Please I just want it all to stop.
