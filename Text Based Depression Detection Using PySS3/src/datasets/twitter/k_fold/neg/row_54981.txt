I thought wrongI thought things were getting better but things have only gotten worse with my parents constantly being mad at me because I try to speak what I think and they donâ€™t listen to what I mean I just get in more trouble, I tried suicide once but just woke up in my shower sick and fucked up. Idk if I want to die or just run away and leave for awhile. Weâ€™ll see.
