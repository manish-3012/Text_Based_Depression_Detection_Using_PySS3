Probably going to end it all after the visit.I'm 19 and I've been a pretty healthy guy my whole life, however, in the past year my life has gone from bad to worse. I have a sister who was also healthy at a young age, but 6 years ago she developed a weird chronic cough that wouldn't go away. She went to tons of doctors none of them knew what it could be until one day a doctor said she should be tested for "Cystic Fibrosis", I had no idea what it even was, no one in my family tree did. However, she got a cat scan, and a blood test. The cat scan showed multiple cysts in her lungs and kidney. The blood test came back positive for CF and now life is living hell after researching this horrible diesease I'm ready to kill myself. Now, if you think the worst part is over you are mistaken. about a year ago I started having issues in the morning constant throat clearing, minor coughing (not like my sister but still annoying). Feels like there is something in my throat and my mother also started having the same thing at the same time. Me and mother have been having this strange weird coughing/throat clearing sessions in the morning for the past year and doctor just told me it was minor swelling however I am a hypochondriac so now I've pretty much set myself death date. I cannot live with this horrible problem my mother should not even be HAVING any issue as she is 48 even the specialist said it would be impossible for my mother to have this diesease. Knowing that I could now have the same dieases my sister however, and knowing I could soon be having lung problems scares me to death. I'll be getting blood tested soon for the diease. After I get blood tested I'll probably just end it.


Yes I know no one wants to comment. I wouldn't even know what to say.
