I need to kill myselfIâ€™m a female college student (18) I have had a pretty shitty childhood and teenage years. Iâ€™ve been used by so many guys and Iâ€™ve never had a real relationship. Every time I fall for a guy they just seem like they donâ€™t like me back or give a shit about me. Iâ€™ve recently started talking to this guy and he was so sweet and we hooked up, after that every time I ask him to hangout he gives weird responses and never does. I donâ€™t have any friends, Iâ€™ve tried to meet people but people seem to really not wanna be around me. Iâ€™m a decent person I was told Iâ€™m really nice but there MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. Iâ€™ve tried killing myself multiple times. Nothing worked. A few days ago I took over 4000mg of hydrocodone and fucking NOTHING HAPPENED. Iâ€™m kind of a pussy I wanna go out an easy way and nothing you say can change my mind. No one gives a shit about me. My parents never call me, my sister blocked me like no one cares so why should I? Please give actual advice on how to do it easily. Thank you.
