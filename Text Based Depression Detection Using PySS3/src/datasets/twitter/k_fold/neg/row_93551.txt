Lost one of my few sources of hope, now I'm spirallingI've been in intensive treatment for severe clinical depression for the past few months. When Pokemon Go came out, I'd been caught in one of the classic traps of depression: exercise is supposed to be extremely helpful, but actually getting myself to exercise is extraordinarily difficult - I have no energy, and the reward circuits that would normally produce a motivating runner's high or whatever are not working. 

So when Pokemon Go came out, it was really helpful. All my friends were playing it, so I could go on Poke-walks with them and get some exercise. Leaving the house became slightly less of a pointless and insurmountable feat. I could have cute pokemon and social validation to show for all the little tiny incremental progress I made. And it was a fun way to connect with happier times from when I was a kid. I went from averaging 2,000 steps a day to 7,000, and kept it up. It was great, it was helping me break out of the downward spiral of reclusive/agoraphobic depression.

Now, I'm tech-savvy and paranoid, so I keep my phone rooted so I can tether when I have patchy internet and use XPrivacy to maintain some control over how apps use my data. XPrivacy is why I can avoid total social isolation by using Facebook Messenger, without selling out my friends by giving Messenger access to my contacts. Without XPrivacy I feel naked and vulnerable and scared and exploited and powerless. But I don't have the kind of lucrative tech salary that would enable me to keep up with flagship phones. So I have a mid-range phone with a boot loader I can't unlock.

This means that as of 0.37.0, there is simply no way for me to play Pokemon Go anymore. This "feature" of the update was deliberately hidden - like most sane humans, I don't google every update to every app I use before I install it, so I had no idea updating would lock me out. I've tried installing old versions and it doesn't work. I've spent the last two days trying to get the Magisk workaround to work on my old Nexus tablet, to no avail. So I'm ready to give up.

I am grieving. The progress I've made these last two months is still fragile. I have no confidence in my ability to keep up the amount of walking I've done lately - every single day is still a struggle, and PoGo made that struggle a little less impossible for a little while. I'm at 252 steps so far today. Leaving the house seems as hard as it ever did, and now once again I have nothing to make that leap seem palatable. 

This was one of the few signs I had to give me hope my depression might be getting better ever. Plus one of the few things I sometimes still care about is tech politics and internet freedom, and this feels like yet another sign that the important battles are all already lost. So I'm feeling really hopeless right now and could use some support.
