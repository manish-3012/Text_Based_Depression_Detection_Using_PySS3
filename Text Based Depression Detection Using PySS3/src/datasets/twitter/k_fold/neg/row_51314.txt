can anyone tell me what it was like to OD?iâ€™m trying to come up with a plan, and i feel as if overdosing might be the most accessible choice. what are your experiences with it? when the OD failed for you, did it cause permanent damage? please help me, iâ€™m trying to take steps so that iâ€™ll actually commit suicide, iâ€™m tired of having this doubt when itâ€™ll end my troubles.
