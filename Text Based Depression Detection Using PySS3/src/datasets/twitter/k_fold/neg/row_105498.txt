If they put fall classes online, it is the last strawIâ€™m really struggling right now. My life was fine before everything closed, but now I feel so alone. It is just my mother and I in this apartment, I donâ€™t like talking to her. I see my boyfriend as often as I can but I feel myself falling deeper and deeper into this hole of depression. Itâ€™s my senior year, everything I was looking forward to is cancelled. Itâ€™s just so bleak. If they cancel in person classes and I canâ€™t move into my dorm next fall, I really donâ€™t know how I am going to cope. I really want to die. I keep telling myself to hold on a little longer, but it really is so so unbearable. I wouldnâ€™t end my life but I need to figure out how to feel better. Does anyone have any suggestions for how they pass the time? Anything..please. Something that is fun?
