Concerned about this user in /r/relationships[Link here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1f0fad/a_month_before_the_wedding_i_just_found_out_that/)

He's talking about how he has a .44 under his bed. He says his family is on another continent and he doesn't feel like he has any friends. I don't have much experience talking to someone who is suicidal although I'm doing my best. Please help.

EDIT: He's going to sleep and has agreed to update tomorrow, but any advice in the meantime would be appreciated.
