Im just existingMy girlfriend cheated on me. We weren't together long. Barely a month. But i love her. She made me feel like life was worth something. I thought I could be okay but I'm not. I found out this morning and quit my part time job immediately and went home. I started counting pills and looking up how much of each drug could kill me. We talked for a bit. She says she needs to get her shit together. I live in an outside room where I dont get wifi and I fell asleep. No one could reach me. She was worried and called my mom and almost called a suicide hotline. I made everything worse by not answering because she has past trauma from a suicidal mother. I didnt react well to any of it and now she will never want me again. I feel tired and heavy and I dont want to die but I want it all to be over. I now have almost 2 months of holiday ahead of me and it just reminds me how I fucked up and how I wasn't good enough. Im useless   I never get better. I've been depressed for 8 years and it hasn't changed. I'm just older.
