Please HelpJust be honest and tell me if thereâ€™s any relatively dignified way to take myself out thatâ€™s easily accessible. I was looking at poisonous plants online that I could buy; sadly they all involve very gross GI effects. I was thinking cough medicine. If I took enough I probably couldnâ€™t move and panic in the psychotic state it would induce.

I took the advice I was given here last time and talked to my family. It did nothing. I took a big risk and tried psychedelics; itâ€™s a big risk because Iâ€™m an addict in recovery. The psychedelics didnâ€™t help either. 9 separate diagnoses, so many meds, so many psych hospitalizations. Nothing works, and I want the ups and downs to stop. All my thoughts lead to death or suicide eventually. Just constant suicidal thoughts.

I was looking into the exit bag method. But the Helium pricks started making it 20% oxygen so itâ€™s no longer viable. If someone has a way then please tell me. Itâ€™d be more helpful than harmful. I was waiting on one thing to happen before I took myself out. Now sheâ€™s good, and I donâ€™t have to worry about adversely affecting her health. A bit narcissistic to think I would. But for some reason she cared a lot about me, and when you lose someone you care about it can crush you physiologically.

Anyway... Please help. Pretty Please. Itâ€™d make my whole year.
