I am so fucking suicidal I just want to let it all outEvery day on a constant Iâ€™m â€˜happyâ€™ when in reality Iâ€™m just feeling so fucking shit, wishing I was emotionless and didnâ€™t have to feel the way Iâ€™m feeling right now. I want to die so fucking bad, nobody cares unless youâ€™re dead. Nobody will ever care about me, after all Iâ€™m some irrelevant fucking waste of space. Iâ€™m so suicidal I donâ€™t know what to do, everyday is a struggle, canâ€™t I just end it already. Thereâ€™s something holding me back, my family I guess. Theyâ€™d get over it though Iâ€™m just an irrelevant fucking piece of shit. I canâ€™t live on, I canâ€™t go on, I feel as if Iâ€™m not meant to be here, wherever I go I feel out of place, Iâ€™ve never felt â€˜normalâ€™ or even quirky. I feel fucking messed up.
