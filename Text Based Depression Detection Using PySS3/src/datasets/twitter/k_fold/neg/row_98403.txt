Why am I even here anymoreI hate who I am and everything about myself. I am an 18 year black bisexual male who is overweight and not that very good looking I also have depression and most people say itâ€™s for attention because Iâ€™m a black guy who isnâ€™t afraid to tell people I have it. People tell me to exercise because I donâ€™t like my appearance but I have no motivation and when I try to exercise on my own I see how pathetic I am. Iâ€™m in college but I feel like I might not be able to handle it. I take depression meds but they donâ€™t help, Iâ€™ve talk to therapist, counselors, etc. Iâ€™m also very scared to get a job and idk what to do. Not sure what to do anymore I feel like everyday Iâ€™m getting close to going insane or killing myself.
