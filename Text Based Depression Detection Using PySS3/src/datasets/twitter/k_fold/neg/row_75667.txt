No regretsIts becoming clearer and clearer to me im not needed. Everyones been doing better without me recently. I cant even manage to do a favor for my boyfriend of three years because of how useless and weak I am, and when i finally find the courage to do it for him he tells me heâ€™s having someone else do it for him. 

My parents complain about how much of a burden I am. The rest of my family doesnâ€™t even make an effort to see me. Even when I tell people how much of a burden i feel like or that im depressed they blow it off, or tell me im faking it. 

All I need to do is find a way to end my relationship with my boyfriend. Once he hates me and we arenâ€™t together he wont feel responsible for me, then i can leave without ever hurting anyone again.
