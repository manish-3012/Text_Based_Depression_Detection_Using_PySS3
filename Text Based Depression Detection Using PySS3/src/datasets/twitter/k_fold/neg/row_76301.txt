I have no where else to goIm 25 years old and ive been completely alone my whole life essentially, And it just keeps getting worse. I posted on here on another account and nobody talked to me about how im feeling or anything like that. I just had the cops sent to my home because i was "posting suicidal things on reddit"

Like, really? I get being worried about my well being but whoever did it could have just been like "hey, you good?" But no.... i guess its to hard to talk to someone who desperately needs some sort of human interaction. 

I have no one to talk to and that person tool away the one place i could maybe find someone to talk to about what im going through. 

Ive been trying so hard to find friends and people to talk to but its just not happening. I either dont get a chance or i get ghosted almost right away. I cant even post on subreddits to find people without getting down voted for no reason. 

Im done, i give up. Ive tried so hard and i cant take it anymore. Id say its not fair but that just makes me sound like a baby, but thats really what it feels like. Why do i deserve to be all alone?
