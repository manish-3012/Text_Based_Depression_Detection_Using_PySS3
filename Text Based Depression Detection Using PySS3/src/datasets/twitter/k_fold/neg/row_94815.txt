i've lost all my therapy progress so here's a ventI feel like I'm re-living certain early childhood memories as if during usual PTSD flashbacks, they have have triggers, but they're not traumatic memories (although one is suspected to be) and I can't stop thinking about them. I feel like I'm trapped in a loop of thoughts. I remember only tiny parts of it, but I feel a need to try and remember them fully. Why? I don't even know. So I keep trying to as much stuff related to all of that as I can, but I always fail. I feel like my mental health is extremely declining since the start of quarantine since one of my traumas is very heavily medical. I feel like I've become slightly obsessed with those memories, I want to recover them so badly, I have only cloudy fragments and tiny things like music or the place at a certain time that reminds me of that and I just want to cry because this all makes me think of death and how I will never be remembered and all those memories and thoughts will disappear and I just can't take this, the best thing is that I can't get any help and can't get myself to actually tell my therapist about any of this  because I'm too scared she will not take me seriously. I can't call any hotlines since my parents will hear (i live in a small flat) and the wait time for a response to a text message from my local suicide hotline is around 20 days. I start getting easily suicidal and dissociative again, and I feel like I lost all my progress from therapy. I feel so torn away from reality I'm starting to wonder if all my friends and relatives are actually real, existing and alive. I simultaneously want to live and die. Schroedringer's will to live.
