Schizophrenia is my lifeI can't handle it. I don't want my job, I don't wanna go to school, I don't want to see things, I live every fucking day doing things I don't want to. I live my life in terror and I don't want to be like this for 60+ more years. My life isn't enjoyable and I just wanna be done.
