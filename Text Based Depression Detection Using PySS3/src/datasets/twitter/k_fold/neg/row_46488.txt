The pain from the hole in my chest is unbearable. The time has come.It's weird because it's both physical and psychological pain. It literally feels like someone is suffocating me and squeezing my heart and neck. The psychological part is an emptiness and worthlessness ive never experienced in this intensity before. I am in so much pain, my movements have become slow, im constantly nauseated and tired. It's time. I'm ready. I think I wont be able to wait till this weekend.
