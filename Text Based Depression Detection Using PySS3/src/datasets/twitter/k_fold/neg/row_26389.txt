Too Far GoneThis thread is useless. The people that come on here and are actually planning on killing themselves have already been lost. There's no point in trying to "help" them because they've finally realized that life is worthless and that nothing ever gets better. Some people realize this and are stupid enough to try and get over it. So, for all of you fake ass commenters and positive pollys put there, you. are. wasting. your. time. And until you get it through your thick fucking skulls that life is LITERALLY THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO SOMEONE, you'll be speaking into deaf ears. 

This is bullshit. There are like 9 people on planet fucking earth that know what I'm talking about.
