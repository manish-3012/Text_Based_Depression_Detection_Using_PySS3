How do I get help?I really want professional help. I'm afraid for my life lately and I just don't think it is getting any better on my own. I'm 17 and broke so I can't afford to go to a therapist and I really don't want my parents to get involved because I know they would feel guilty for all of this, but does anyone have any ideas? I'm desperate at this point and I really just want things to get better.
