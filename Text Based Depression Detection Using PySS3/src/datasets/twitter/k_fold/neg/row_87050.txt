Life is crumbling.I want to kill my self in fact I have tried once but failed without anyone knowing and thought it was a sign from the universe that there might be light in my life but no a brother that raped me is know my mothers favourite child and she never realizes what I am saying or doing for her she always thinks I am in the wrong when ever me and my brother fight and when my sister told her how she felt about her she blamed me for everything please help me I dont wanna but it seems it is not worth it, nothing works and this life is not a blessing rather a endless stream of tests which I can never pass it is curse.
