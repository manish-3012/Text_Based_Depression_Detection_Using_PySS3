ThinkingIâ€™ve wrote on here many times that I want to kill myself. I really just want my pain to stop but I know for that to happen, I would have to die. Oh, I am so scared for whatâ€™s to come next if I do. I know it would hurt my mother for me to die so cowardly. But she sees how broken I am but pays me no mind. If she knew I was gay, which she probably does by now, it wouldnâ€™t matter that I died because I will be going to Hell, anyway. I have no direction and feel so unloved my whole life. I never felt anyone wanted to be with me or cared about my existence outside of blood relatives. I feel like a monster, physically and mentally. My homosexuality disgusts me and makes me feel 10x worse about myself. I hate being so degenerate. I feel less of a person and more of a joke. My mental health is taking a toll on me and I feel anxious 24/7. The state of my anxiety is getting worse and my depression is becoming crippling. I am so jealous of happy people, especially straight. I envy their normalcy and lust for life. I only know pain but for people of my attraction, itâ€™s what we deserve. I canâ€™t keep living like this and I canâ€™t see myself marrying a woman to hide. Itâ€™s hard seeing no worth in yourself but I am used to it. I feel bad about suicide knowing that people are really suffering. Suicide brings me peace until I remember that in the back of my mind, I might suffer eternally. I wish I knew for certain.
