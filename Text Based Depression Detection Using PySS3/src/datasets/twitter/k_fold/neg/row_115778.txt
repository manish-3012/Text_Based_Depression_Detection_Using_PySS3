I thought life would get betterI struggled for years finding a stable job, it tore me apart mentally. I destroyed my relationship with the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. She was amazing, beautiful, smart, funny, everything. She left, she couldn't handle it anymore. I was always yelling and having meltdowns. 
I got the job right when she left but the damage was done. It was too much. We got back together a month later, and then my dad died. I couldn't handle anything and she left again, it was too much for her.

Now she hates me, I lost my dad. I'm a wreck. This feeling of why even bother trying to exist in this world keeps coming back. Therapy hasn't been working. I can't get my mind off anything. I feel alone, useless, and regretful. I tried so hard to get my shit together. 

I see no reason so keep living. I see no reason to continue to try to make it through this world. I feel so alone. I've felt like I don't belong in this world for a long time. 

Why shouldn't I? The more time that goes on the more I hurt. The more I reali,e that I don't want to live anymore.

I just want this pain gone and there's nothing that will get rid of it.
