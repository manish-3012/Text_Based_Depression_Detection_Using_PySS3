The worst attemptTwo days ago, I wrote a 4 page suicide note. It was supposed to be short, but I fucked up. I fuck up a lot. I grab two belts and head into my basement and realize that there was no need for a second belt. I tied my belt to the ceiling rafters, and get ready for my weight to tighten it. I stick my head in here. I know it probably wouldn't support me weight, but it was worth. I look for chairs in my basement. I get this rolly chair I find, and climb on it. Stick my head right in. Getting ready. Leaving my Ukulele for my best friend in my note. It was only fifty dollars, but she said she wanted to play ukulele. I slip on my rolly chair, and feel myself suffocating. This wasn't the plan, but at the same time it was. The rolly chair is touching my toes, and I roll it back over. Asphyxiation isn't how I want to go. I get up. I get off the belt. I throw the belts somewhere and move the rolly chair, and throw the note in my backpack with a box of matches. I don't know. I didn't die because a rolly chair threw me off guard.  I wanted to be in control I guess. I still have to burn the note.
