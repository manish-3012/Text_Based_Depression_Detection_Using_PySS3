I promised myself I'd end it all last Christmas, a year later and I'm worse than everI'm a young guy, only 17 but I can't fucking take it anymore. I've lost almost everyone, my best friend looked at me in the eyes as I was blubbering like a fucking baby begging her to let me work on our friendship rather than giving up and she just stared at me coldly. She said I'd never see her again. I can't do this. I met her around last Christmas and at least I had her then, now I'm just even more depressed and with minimal support. I can't fucking handle it, I'm meant to go to university next year and I just know I can't hack another 4 years. I don't want it anymore. I don't want this life. I just want it over. I just want it to end. I have a little sister, my dad's about to get married. All their dreams would be taken from them and i don't want to be responsible but I can't keep living like this. I want to go back to plan A and end it all but I don't know I'm so conflicted. I hope I can become sure soon.
