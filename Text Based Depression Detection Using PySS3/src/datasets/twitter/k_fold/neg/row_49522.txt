Must I go on?I'm an average teenager with an average life.
I get straight A grades in school, I'm "pretty", and I have gotten everything I've ever asked my parents for. I'm not ever really boastful about this, nor do I ask for much from anyone. I help people every chance i get. Yet, I feel so empty. I have one close friend but, she does  not know I have been seeing someone for mental help for years. I feel that i have some sort of bi-polar disorder. I just want to escape. I have never had a positive thought about myself. I've never really felt anything. I have numbly been going through the motions of my life. I have been considering OD-ing soon. I just feel like I'd be shaming my family. I'm such a waste. ugh. Sorry if anyone read this giant waste of time.
