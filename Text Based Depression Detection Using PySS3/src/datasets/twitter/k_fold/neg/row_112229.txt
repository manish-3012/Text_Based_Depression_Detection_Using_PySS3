I guess I could need some good adviceHi guys, I think I could use some advice.

I am 20 years old and have had constant thoughts of suicide for about five years now. During this time I have educated myself about this topic and actually don't have any rational problems with killing myself. The problem is that I am quite afraid of the pain I have to endure before it is finally over and in addition to that I think I would ruin the life of my parents.

On the other hand however is it very difficult for me to talk to someone about my problems. In fact during all those years I never really talked with anyone about my problems.
To make everything even more complicated I also don't really wanna change. This may sounds stupid but I have been yearn for death for a very long time now. I don't really now anything else. This is who I am for a very long time now and changing myself would mean to abandon myself.

Yeah well that's pretty much it.

If you have any ideas how I could change my situation I would be very glad if you would tell me them because I actually really don't know what to do anymore :/.
