Why do I even go on anymore?Every time something good comes by my gut always tells me to avoid it and itâ€™s always right. Itâ€™s been right for the past 2 fucking years. What the hell is worth persevering and suffering for? There is no permanent good, only temporary which leads to more pain which youâ€™re supposed to get through. I still have to deal with my useless and uncaring father who continues to ignore my interests and only sees me as a way to make his life easier and my girlfriend just broke up with me, leaving me without anything good to look forward to. Sheâ€™s still in my life but she no longer has those feelings that I will continue to have over the coming months. Life is so uncertain anymore. I just want to see anything good in my life that lasts. But I donâ€™t think thatâ€™ll ever come. I go on living but I donâ€™t know what for. I donâ€™t know why i didnâ€™t end it all the pain last year when I had the fucking chance. Iâ€™m just so damn stubborn. I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I donâ€™t wanna be here anymore.
