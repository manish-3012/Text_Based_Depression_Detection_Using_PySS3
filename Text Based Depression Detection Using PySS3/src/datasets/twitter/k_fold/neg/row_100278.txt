Death sounds goodI have a lot that happened in the past 5 years but the worst was watching a 9 year old boy get half crushed by a car, then as he lay dying there he just stared directly into my eyes and kept saying "help" and I couldnt do anything. I watched the life drain out of him from a rulers length away. Ever since then something changed. I feel like I could kill myself pretty easily, but I also feel I could kill others. I have contemplated decapitating my family members, every day for the past 5 years I haven't cried, been happy or even got angry. I will inevitably kill myself one day. I'm pretty sure I'm a psychopath. Haha.  In all seriousness this life is boring, looking forward to level 2
