Why I am getting suicidal thoughts ?I always get these thoughts about me killing myself if different gruesome ways and how would my family and friends will react on it. I would agree that my life is not best currently it's been going downhill slowly till now. I don't know what future holds for me. But suddenly I get these thoughts mostly when I am alone and I would have a minor breakdown. I am having these thoughts since one of my best friend killed himself in extremely horrible way. Does this happens with anyone else ?
