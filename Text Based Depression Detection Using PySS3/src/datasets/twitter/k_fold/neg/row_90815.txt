this is embarrassingi was feeling so good yesterday and i even made a post about it and everyone was so nice but itâ€™s gone now canâ€™t wait until summers over and i can go i donâ€™t really have friends to do anything with so i donâ€™t really know how to enjoy my summer bc i canâ€™t go anywhere or do anything and i canâ€™t drive and iâ€™m broke and i think this summer might even be worse than last summer and i always look forward to summer but it ends up being the worst period of my life because i realize how little people want to do things with me and my current friends now are nice i only really have two but theyâ€™re nice but it really feels like they donâ€™t want to do anything w me and that they just feel bad for me or something but yeah sorry if i let you guys down i shouldnâ€™t have had so much faith in myself iâ€™m sorry i donâ€™t know why i post stuff on here anyways i guess i like being anonymous on here so no one from school sees it and knows itâ€™s me i donâ€™t know iâ€™m sorry this is so embarrassing and i want to sleep but my parents yell at me whenever i try to take a nap i just hide in the basement and i really canâ€™t expect much more good out of my life i made a bucket list but tried to make it reasonable and i was able to come up with like 2 things bc what the fuck am i gonna do i just wish i had a reason for being like this
