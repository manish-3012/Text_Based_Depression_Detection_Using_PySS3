I have been harmed and harmed.I was in a relationship where I was coerced to be intoxicated while engaging in sex.  My ex was an alcoholic and this was one of her kinks.  

First the act of me harming was a Saturday morning she woke me up and gave me two beers. We started getting intimate she ask to smoke I obliged however there is some time inbetween Iâ€™m fuzzy on but I remember getting close to finishing and getting excited and tell her when she said stop I didnâ€™t hear her looked down and saw horror and stood up from the lean to position I was in.   In her words she begged me to stop and I would not get off of her telling he I was going to come.  She told me later she was bruised for a whole week but we had consensual sex again the whole day.

I was harmed I didnâ€™t ever realize why I never said no or put my foot down to drinking like that and being so ok with it.  I also was berated for wanting to wear a condom and she would accuse me of not be faithful because in the two months of our relationship I still wanted to wear a condom.  Due to my often intoxicated state often when we would end sex I would find the condom came off I never knew if she took it off.   There were atleast two times she took my unconscious but erect morning wood and begin to have sex with me waking up.  The last time we ever had sex I originally was other with not wearing a condom but I would retreat as she force me to ejaculate in her because she was sitting on me.

I canâ€™t deal with this this morning.  This trauma all came unpacked last week and I canâ€™t deal with any of it.   Iâ€™m embarrassed to say I was taken advantage of, Iâ€™m horrified my intoxicated state took me an instance later to realize consent was revoked.  Itâ€™s been two years Iâ€™ve never been contacted by authorities but Iâ€™m terrified.
