I want to end my suffering.I've been dealing with anxiety, depression, PTSD, and suicidal thoughts since I was in 5th grade. I don't know what I'm expecting out of this maybe I just need to vent , I just know I feel like this is my last cry for help. I've done everything I can to get better and none of it has worked. I was doing good for a while.. I was starting to get better and all of a sudden the suicidal thoughts came back the depression came back and I couldn't care if I died. I want to die, I want to end my suffering but the only reason I find myself not going through with it is because I don't want to put my family or friends through that.. if I could somehow kill myself without causing any pain to anybody I would do it in a heartbeat. My whole life seems to have been nothing but pain. I am not good at anything I am just worthless and that is all I will ever be. I will never be good enough for anything or anyone. I wish I was good enough... I think I need help.. but I don't even know what would help.. I don't know what to do. I wake up wanting to die. From seeing dead bodies , going to way too many funerals , losing friends to suicide, a broken home with a broken family, being bullied and being jumped, to being cheated on by every girlfriend Ive had and having my heart played with constantly , to be just being worthless. I have no worth. Everybody leaves me so why cant I leave everybody else? why do I have to go through all this pain? why can't I be happy, why can't I be good enough for anyone or anything. I don't know what I need.. I just know I need help maybe venting will help I don't know I just don't know. I just know I am tired of this pain I'm tired of feeling this way.. I just want to give up.
