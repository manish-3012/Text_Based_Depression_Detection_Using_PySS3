I don't know what to do anymore.I've always had issues with wanting to kill myself and I've tried many many times.


I've gotten to a point where right now I'm not happy and I don't know how to change it.

I can't make myself care about my SO but I pretend to; and I don't know why.

Lying all the time is crushing me but I don't know another way to stop it! I can't sleep I just want to cry.

My SO always wants to have sex but I don't and he bugs me until we do and I just let it happen. I don't want to keep doing it.

Its the same with everything else I don't want to do something or say no but ill just do it anyway ... Because they want me to.


Everyone believes I'm this happy girl with so much going for her. I'm not happy I haven't been happy in years.

About 6-7 months ago my ex broke up with me tore me apart.
I have forgotten how to care and it hurts me and it makes me want to end everything.


There is only so much I can take.
Only so long I can keep pretending I care; so I'm not left alone with no one. 
So people don't think I'm crazy and won't send me back to hospital.
