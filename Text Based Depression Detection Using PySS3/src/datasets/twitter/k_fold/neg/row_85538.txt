fuck this shitI'm scared of life. I think about the countless number of days ahead of me and I feel trapped. Trapped living. Trapped in my mind. I feel insane. I'm dying to get out. Dying to be free. I wish it it was all over. I wish I had the choice to end it all. Why don't I have the choice? It's my life. I'm the one who has to live it. I don't want to live just because everyone else thinks that I'm sick. YEAH I am sick. But I've been sick and it's not getting better. Why the fuck can't I just die. This isn't just a phase I've been like this for years. I could probably get better, but I know that I'm going to fall back down and end up in the same place or worse. I could have a good life, but I don't want it. I don't want to try. I'm tired. I'm tired of trying to be happy. I just can't achieve it. Depression has changed me. It's changed the way I think. The way I feel. The way I look. I'm jealous of the dead. I'm jealous of happy people. I feel pathetic because I have no one and nothing to blame. I only have MYSELF to blame. I blame my mind, my brain, or the chemicals in my brain. I'm so frustrated. I'm so done. I don't want to do this anymore. I just don't think I can take it. But obviously I have to, because  I HAVE NO CHOICE. I HAVE NO CONTROL. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. I just want one thing. One thing that I'm passionate for. One thing that makes me happy. One that that I can hold on to. One thing to live for. Just one thing. I just hate life. I hate who I've become. I hate these feelings. I hate feeling hopeless. I hate feeling scared. I wish it all could just end.
