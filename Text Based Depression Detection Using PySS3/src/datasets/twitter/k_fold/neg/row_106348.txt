I want to wake up next to you or not at all.It's been two months, almost. And I thought I was doing better. I was put on an M1 hold. But when I got out, I really tried. I quit smoking. Started taking higher dosages of my meds. I even started seeing someone else. I felt happy again. Like I could move forward. Like there was a way forward, even if it meant a future without you. But these past few days, I have come crashing back. I don't want someone else. What we had was perfect.

And I don't know why you had to leave it. 

I deserved that happiness. I fought for it for so long. And you just took it all away from me so you could feel like a hero. 
I want to be mad. So mad that I could never want to think of you again. But I can't. Because I know you had the best of intentions. I know you were trying to save someone, damn the consequences. And that's what I love about you. You are never petty or selfish. You're chaotic good. Always acting based on how things should be. Always optimistic. Never tied down by reality.

But you didn't need to do what you did to feel like a hero. To save someone. You were saving me.
