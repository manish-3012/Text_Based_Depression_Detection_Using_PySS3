Living out of guiltIâ€™m 22 and this is roughly my 8th year of depression (with occasional peaks and periods of normality) and I wouldâ€™ve tried more seriously to end things a long time ago if I wasnâ€™t held back by guilt. What do you do when you know things wonâ€™t improve but you canâ€™t bare to cause suffering? I cause them pain by being sick and alive too. Iâ€™m at a loss, I feel like I canâ€™t win. I just donâ€™t want to hurt anyone.
