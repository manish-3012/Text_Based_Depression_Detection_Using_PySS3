I'm alone. I'm stupid. I betrayed the woman I love.I cheated on the woman I love, the person whom I owe the most in my entire life. A few months ago we tried to make things work again but I didn't break contact 100% with the other girl. Hence, alone, and stupid. Don't want to go on anymore. Without her I'm nothing, I have nothing, I have no motivation. I just want to fucking die, I hate myself so much, for being so stupid, selfish, such worthless fucking piece of shit is what I fucking am.
