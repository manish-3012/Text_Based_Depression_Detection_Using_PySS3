For those of you considering suicide, take out as many loans as you can before you die.If youâ€™re going to end it anyway, go out with a bang. Take out as many loans as you can qualify for, and go to town. It will at least give you a chance to travel the world for a bit and do a â€œsamplerâ€ of all of the activities on earth so you donâ€™t feel like youâ€™d be missing out on any essentials of the human experience. Iâ€™m assuming that money is holding a lot of us back from doing what we want to do on earth, so take advantage of those loans before you die. Get credit cards too and max them all out. If youâ€™re not living with your parents and are over the age of 23 or so in America, you can qualify for up to $10,000 in student loans or more. You can use that money for whatever you want to use it for once it goes into your bank account.
