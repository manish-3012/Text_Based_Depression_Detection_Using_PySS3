Canâ€™t do this anymore
Iâ€™m sick of trying and people saying it gets better when itâ€™s only gotten worse I canâ€™t do anything Iâ€™m 17 years old with no friends Iâ€™m stuck in the house a damn day thanks to my ignorant mom whose the main cause of me feeling like shit since I was in 8th grade just talking about her makes me want to cringe 

I honestly canâ€™t stand this anymore but no matter how much I say Iâ€™ll kill myself abd actually attempt to nothing happens this is a terrible thing to say but I envy the people who actually go through with suicide to be honest
