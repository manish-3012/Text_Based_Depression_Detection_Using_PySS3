Surviving.My exams which literally my future depends on start next Monday. I donâ€™t know what to feel. I know damn well that i wonâ€™t do good. At some point i think â€œidcâ€ and want to enjoy my summer. But then again i wonâ€™t able be able to swim because of how insecure I am of my body.

These past few months have been hard. Iâ€™ve been thinking about committing suicide everyday. Whatâ€™s keeping me back is my family and dog.I canâ€™t do this to my mom. She had 6 miscarriages before adopting me. Sheâ€™ll feel so hurt,helpless and like sheâ€™s a bad mother. Same goes for my dad, my whole family will be ashamed and my dog will be hurt too. 

But I feel hopeless, nothing is working out. Iâ€™ve been trying to study but I canâ€™t focus and even when I do, I still mess up. I also hate every single part about my body, i tried working out but i always end up giving up. Maybe thatâ€™s proof of how useless i am and that iâ€™m not capable of anything. At this point iâ€™m not even living, iâ€™m just surviving because i donâ€™t wanna hurt my loved ones.
