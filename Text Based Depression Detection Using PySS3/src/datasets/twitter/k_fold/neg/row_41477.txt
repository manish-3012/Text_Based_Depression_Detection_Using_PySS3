Been ghosted by a woman 2 times in a row, I'm going to end it, I hate being 26 and forever aloneSo the past 3 years or so, I met two really awesome women. 

The first one, I was friends with for 2 years and fell in love with her, but due to anxiety, I never made a move. We'll call her Lucy We hung out so many times. Now it's been 3 months since I seen her, and 2 months since we last talked. I still love her to death.

Shortly after Lucy ghosted me. I met this new girl, we'll call her Mary. Mary was cool, not really as cool as Lucy, but she gives me a lot of attention and talks to me daily which is awesome, as it helps keep my mind off of Lucy. However, recently, it's been 24 hours since I got a response, so I'm sure she's ghosting me too. 

I just REALLY want a girlfriend. I'm tired of being 26, and never been in a relationship. I honestly feel like women are out to get me. I honestly am starting to HATE women with a bloody, seething, raging passion. I don't want to feel this way, but I am.

I'm going to commit suicide before I turn into another Elliot Roger, because I don't want to end up that way. I never shot up before, but I do have some heroin, and I'm going to just shoot a bunch of that up and die. I am a miserable piece of shit undeserving of love. Women have showed me that time and time again.
