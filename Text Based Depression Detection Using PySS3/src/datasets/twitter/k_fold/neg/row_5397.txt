I can't keep tryingSo for the better part of the last 3 years I've suffered heavily with depression and anxiety, as well as generally wanting to not be around. The reason for this is quite deep but let's just say that I had a relatively shit childhood, and I had my heart broke.

It's gotten to the point where I no longer want to be live. I don't envision a future anymore. I just want to die but if I'm honest I don't have the balls to do it. I have 3 sisters and leaving them would be so hard.

But it seems like everyday things get worse, and I progressively get closer to just saying fuck it and giving up. I constantly get told to keep going, take each day one at a time, just to get through the day. But it's seem as if with each passing day the more I can't take it.

If I'm honest idk even know why I'm posting this. If I'm honest I'm quite alone atm. Most of my friends arent really bothered with me anymore. I rarely hear off or see any of them. This just seemed like an outlet to at least write down what I'm feeling. I just don't see this getting better anymore.
