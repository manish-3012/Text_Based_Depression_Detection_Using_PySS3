Being dead is much better than living in this stupid worldYou can be targeted by unstable people. You can go to jail for making a mistake. You can be all alone in the world with no help. Why does anyone want this? I can't stand being alive for much longer. The fear, the anxiety, the worry, the loneliness. It's just too much to handle.
