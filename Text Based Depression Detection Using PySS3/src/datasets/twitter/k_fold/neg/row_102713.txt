I'm pregnant and alone and I really feel like this is the only way out.I am 10 weeks pregnant. It wasn't planned. I just graduated from college and moved in with my parents. I have a decent job but the pay isn't all that great. The baby's dad was more of a drug buddy than a boyfriend and he is being an asshole now. My own parents act like nothing is wrong and I'm discouraged from bringing up anything related to my pregnancy. I cry all the time. I'm always on the verge of crying. My mom says that I'm "faking it for attention." I really feel like the only way out of this whole situation is just to blow my brains out. I've thought about killing myself before but it was always just seemed like a melodramatic solution to whatever problem I had at the time. Being alone, pregnant, and completely hopeless seems like a pretty good reason just to get it over with.
