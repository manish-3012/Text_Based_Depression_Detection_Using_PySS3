Things would be better without meI can't live with the guilt of hurting someone I love dearly. I can't live with the loss of my dreams. I can't live with my faults. I don't deserve to breathe this air when there are others more deserving. I want to die so badly. I want to not be such a coward about this and just man up, walk to the train tracks and just let it happen.
