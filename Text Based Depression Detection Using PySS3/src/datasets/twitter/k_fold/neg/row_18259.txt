I canâ€™t do this shit anymoreI want to die but Iâ€™m afraid of death. I hate myself, I hate my past, I hate that no one believes me when I say I donâ€™t want to be here. I want to die to prove to them that I donâ€™t just say I want to die for attention but because I actually donâ€™t want to be here anymore yet I canâ€™t seem to go through with it. I am so fucking fed up with this pathetic shit fucking life I was dealt.... yet I canâ€™t fucking do it. What does that even mean. Does that mean I am doing for attention? Does that mean I wonâ€™t actually do it? I attempted on 01/11/15 but it didnâ€™t work (I slit my wrist, was found by my ex and hospitalized for it yet only had 9 internal stitches and 15 external stitches and apparently that was an â€œattention seeking attemptâ€) I donâ€™t give a fuck about life I donâ€™t give a shit about whatâ€™s â€œto come for meâ€ I just donâ€™t want to be here. So what the fuck is wrong with me?????
