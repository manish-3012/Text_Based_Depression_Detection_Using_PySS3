Postponing my death dateI was going to kill myself this year, but my brother got engaged. Theyâ€™ve set a date to be married next year. Itâ€™s conceited for me to think my death would mean anything, but I wouldnâ€™t want my brother and future SILâ€™s  day to be soured by death. Iâ€™ll live for their wedding, because I love my brother dearly. After that, Iâ€™ll reschedule a date for my suicide.
