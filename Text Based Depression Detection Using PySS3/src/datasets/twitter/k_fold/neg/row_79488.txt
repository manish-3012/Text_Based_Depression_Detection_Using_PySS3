Thinking how it would be to be deadHey everyone, i am thinking about, how would it be, to be dead. I'm starting to get gloomy in my freetime, sometimes I fear the furture, and crying, because of a unkown sadness. I have no friends, because they left me after school. I started an internship, but i dosen't make me happy. I just want to be happy, but I don't know where to start, I get pessimistic thoughts every day and they get stronger. The last death in my family was my uncle in an car accident, because a drunk drove him over. I couldn't say goodbye, and not seen his grave yet, because he is living in a other country. My sadness destroying everything of me. I'm crying everyday, and don't find a way to get out this hell, without killing myself...

Will i be happy again?...
