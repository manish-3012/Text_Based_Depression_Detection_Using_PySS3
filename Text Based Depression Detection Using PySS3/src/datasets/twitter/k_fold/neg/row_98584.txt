I want to post here and talk to someone about my thoughts but I am afraid of encouraging others.I am suicidal. As long as I remember I was like this. And I was seeking help online because I knew it was not OK and I was trying to limit my self harm behaviors, suicide thoughts etc. But when I read about other people doing self harm and having destructive thoughts, my brain thought it's now normal to do it because look many other people also do it. That's how my self harm and suicidal thoughts got worse years ago. I was no longer able to stop myself. 

I desperately need to talk to people but my words might make sense to others and they might develop same kind of thinking. People are already vulnerable here so that would be easier. I also can't talk to people irl because I am the only person everyone rely on and I have to stay strong. 


So I'm just gonna say life is hard, and I feel suicidal. But I was like this when life was good too. So the problem is inside me. Every single aspect of my life is failing and I can't even cry. I'm sorry
