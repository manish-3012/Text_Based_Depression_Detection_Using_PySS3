Want to get eaten by a shark in HawaiiMale, 55-years-old, single and still a virgin without a lot of hope. I haven't really made the choice to do this, but I figure that if nothing really changes anytime soon I'm going to take all the money I have saved, fly to Hawaii, shoot myself out in the Pacific and let the sharks eat me. That way I can get some final life enjoyment before it all ends. Since this is likely to happen after my father passes away, I can do this and take the responsibilty off my sister (mom passed away last year). Of course, I will probably visit Las Vegas on the way and get laid for the first and only time in my life. This is a long-term plan that is not presently in play but may happen eventually.
