I TriedI attempted. I'm still panicking. I looked for my knife and was going to just dig in until I bled out. Not the most effective way, but it was pretty much the only option. I've been panicking all day and it's too much.

My mom came in. Hugged me tightly, with no clue what I was about to do. Told me she was so glad I was born. That she loves me. That I gets better. I dont really believe her, but if she cares that much, I'll try to stick around. For her. But it's just so awful...I don't know how much longer I can handle it. 

I've had severe anxiety and depression since I got the age 3. It just keeps getting worse. But I don't know how it will ever get better. 

I just pray to whatever's out there that it'll end soon. Because I'm too cowardly to end it myself.
