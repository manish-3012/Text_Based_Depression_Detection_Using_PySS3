"suicide is about crisis"i'm kinda tired of people saying that people who kill themselves are just in a crisis and if they wait it out they'll be okay. does around 8 years now count as waiting it out, because i'm still waiting to calm down and have the feelings go away! they say you're not in your right mind because you're depressed/mentally ill, but at what point are you "sane" enough to make your own decisions?
