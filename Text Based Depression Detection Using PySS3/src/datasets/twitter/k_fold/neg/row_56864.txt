I don't really know how to ask for help.even when I first posted about it on Reddit about this. I actually was too scared and kind of tried to argue to myself why I should or shouldn't. I just spent my 19th birthday today lonely crying. I tried hard not to cry because it makes colds worse. I dreaded the day all year and I know its just stupid. I'm just used to being overly happy on my birthday. but I'm literally so stressed out I ate once today (not even close to the first time) my stomach is just so numb from stress and anxiety and depression. 

I'm just afraid of coming off as weak or an attention seeker. I also don't want to feel weak or want to have attention for shit that I was raised being taught was stupid. I honestly don't know what anybody would do anyway.
