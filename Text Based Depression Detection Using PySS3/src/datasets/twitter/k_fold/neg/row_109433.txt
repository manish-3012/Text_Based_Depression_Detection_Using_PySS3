Set me on fireI feel nothing. I want to feel alive. I want to destroy myself. Ultimately, I just want to be loved. I want stability, care, praise but thatâ€™ll never happen and Iâ€™ve accepted that. I want to put out cigarettes on my thighs and kiss until my lips tear. I say I want to die but I just want another life. I really want to escape, everythingâ€™s fucked up. Iâ€™m fucked up. Iâ€™m a slut and I use people as distractions. I feel so trapped and claustrophobic. I hate myself so much. Iâ€™ll never be good enough, ever. please kill me, just do it. I have nothing. I am nothing
