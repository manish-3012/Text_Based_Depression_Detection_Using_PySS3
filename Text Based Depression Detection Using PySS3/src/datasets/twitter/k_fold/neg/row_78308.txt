I don't know if I can take this much longerI feel so awful that for several months now the thought of oblivion that comes with death has become comforting to me. I just want this all to end.

This last year has taken so much from me. I've sold out all my dreams and I've done such terrible things. I hate myself. I hate my anger and the way it can get total control of me so easily. Worse I am riddled with psychosexual and psychological scars. 

Now that I know what I am I've resolved never to have pets or kids but it's not enough. I feel all the kindness slowly rotting in me. I hate everyone around me and they're just people and they're better than me, but I still hate them. And this is because I'm the asshole.

I just want it all to end. I've tried suicide attempts before and it was my family who stopped me doing it again, the thought of their pain. But it's too much to do this all alone. I can't remember a time I haven't been scared and alone. There are people who would give so much to have some of the things I have so it would be better to let them. I wish I had never been born.
