There is nothing i can say that you havent heard or read beforeThis is just me ranting, and i probably wont have the energy to finish this post even. But i had an amazing year last year, i got a girlfriend, i went to a special type of school where everyone had similar interests. Now....im back in my hometown, miles away from all my friends who live close together. My girlfriend broke up with me, im currently trying to study to become a teacher but im falling apart. I thought moving away from my mother would help everything, but she is still able to reach me. I live in an one room apartment im too lazy to clean, i dont do laundry  or buy myself anything to cheer me up cuss i hate spending money on myself and saving is important. My mental health has been declining. i haven't slept well in over 2 weeks. Ive been so close to calling the emergency health line several times but i just cant do it. The one friend i have who can help had a full on panic attack when i started opening up a bit on how i feel. All i can do is face this alone, like i always have and keep asking myself the same questions thats been bothering me for 12 years.
