Iâ€™m running out of money, and exhaustedI have barely 2 months rent in my savings. Just rent. I havenâ€™t been able to get an in person interview thanks to this fucking virus, and unless it blows over very soon (which it obviously wonâ€™t) Iâ€™m gonna run out of money. What the fuck am I supposed to do now? I just canâ€™t keep this shit up, I thought I could coast through life doing the bare minimum but just getting one day to the next is so fucking exhausting. Iâ€™m living because I canâ€™t put the pain of my death on my fathers shoulders, but when all this financial bullshit comes collapsing in on me... heâ€™s co-signed on my rent. At what point is it just more rational to say my memory will be worth more than destroying your retirement to scoop water out of an already sinking ship. I just know I could never find the words to convince him, so neither of us can be at peace.
