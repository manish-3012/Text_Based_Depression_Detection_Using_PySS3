Iâ€™m going to follow through tonight.The past two years have been a roller coaster with my wife. Hereâ€™s my last post of her

Now less than a month after proclaiming her love and telling me she had a flight booked to see me, sheâ€™s with someone else.

I really thought she would smarten up and we would be back together. But she hasnâ€™t sent the last step of the divorce papers back, this screwing me over for school-the only thing that was keeping me going. Come to find out itâ€™s because she met someone. Posted lovey photos of them. While we are married. 

I have no friends. At all. My best friend bailed when my divorce process started because she was too busy. My wife and I had moved this best friend into her new place, and the friend couldnâ€™t bother helping me move or be around at all.

Iâ€™m diagnosed with several mental disorders and thought Iâ€™d overcome them with long term meds. Apparently not.

Guess Iâ€™m just posting as a final goodbye, someone will find my phone and hopefully remember how much I Reddit.

Thanks for the support and distraction over he years, redditors. I wish it were enough.
