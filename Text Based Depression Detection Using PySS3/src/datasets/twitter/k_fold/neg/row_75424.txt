Seriously, why do I even bother?Every time I turn around I've got someone mad at me. I always say or do the wrong thing and just make everything worse. Why should I even continue to try? Its completely pointless. I dont know what I expected either. Monsters don't get happy endings, after all. I'm just so tired of everything. I want it to be over.
