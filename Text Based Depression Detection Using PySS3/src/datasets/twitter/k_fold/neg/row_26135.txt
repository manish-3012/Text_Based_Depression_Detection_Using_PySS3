Wanna die. Itâ€™s been years of unbearable pain.Mid 20s F. Lifeâ€™s been painful and till this day still I donâ€™t feel am wired to stay alive Ina human form. Been depressed since 14. Always hyper sensitive and possibly Aspie and somewhat BPD. Unstable emotions and loose sense of self. 5 years out of a good college with a BS in neuroscience with honors (took me a degree, yet still not figuring out myself). Unable to hold a full time job after a few months despite having worked at four F500 companies. Until I had one consulting job from a top firm; been having it almost for a year. Never really liked the job nor felt fitting in but nonetheless extremely happy and motivated to be able to do some work as an adult. Last year was heavy and traumatic (ex bf posted my nudes online, got dumped by a date of 3 years) yet I believed that my life is finally making the upward turn. There were moments when I felt truly happy and I have acquired DBT skills alongside of traveling and meditation and have my wonderful mom with me. Reminded myself constantly of positivity.

Until last week. I was laid off due to underperformance. My firm told me to leave or go thru a PIP. 

Things fell back apart. Like they always have. I am fairly positive that they will be in the future. Been in bed for 2 days with only one meal and coffee. Started researching for suicide methods and making a project plan (to try to make the workload lighter for others after I passed. 

I wanna die. Only thing I wanna hold on to - my mom. Beautiful and positive and always energetic and resourceful. Kindest and most generous person I know. Everyone loves her. I hate that she married my depressed and BPD father and also passed the gene onto me. I hate that I canâ€™t be like her. Sheâ€™s turning 60 soon. She canâ€™t have another child who might be as awesome as her.
