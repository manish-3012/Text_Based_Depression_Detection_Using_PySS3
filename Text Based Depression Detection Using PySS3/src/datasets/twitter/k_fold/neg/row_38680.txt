Twenty fourIâ€™ll be 24 tomorrow and from the POV of my family and friends, Iâ€™m doing tremendous now in comparison to my past few years. Truthfully, Iâ€™m just a shell of a person at this point. Nothing feels real or important and I cannot remember a time when it did. I have so much more to say about all of this, the words are there in my head, but Iâ€™m so numb. I just had to put a signal out there, because I canâ€™t think of any other options right now.
