Hanging on by a threadI've always considered myself to be  mentally ill (hereditary), though to anyone else I'm sure I seemed completely normal.  However, I don't think it is normal for children under 10 to contemplate suicide.  Not even suicide really.  There is a difference between wanting to kill yourself and obsessing over your own death (I think).  But that's exactly what I've done for as long as I can remember (I am 22 now).  Not a day goes by that I don't think of dying, and they do not even feel like my own thoughts.  I could be having a great day, and somehow the darkness sneaks in to my brain out of nowhere, and it's all I can think about and with that comes the chronic migraines.  The older I get, the more detached from everyone I feel, and I fear it will only get worse until I will no longer be able to suppress the urge to experience nothingness.  The headaches became less severe when I discovered cannabis in high school, but recently the law came to my house and took away the only medicine to ever work.  I will be on probation for the next 365 days which isn't that long in the grand scheme but it may be the straw to break the camel's back.  I desperately hope it isn't.  I apologize for any typos or incoherence.  I have a vicious headache right now and I just wanted to get these thoughts out.
