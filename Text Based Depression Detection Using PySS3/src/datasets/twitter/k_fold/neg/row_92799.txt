wish there was an easy way to do iti had to witness and endure so many horrible things growing up. these memories haunt me the moment i wake up until i'm able to fall asleep.

i'm a waste of space for everyone around. all my friends are going to leave me eventually as i dissolve into a distant insular parasite no one will ever love.

all my aspirations have faded, there are so many things wrong with me, so many things i haven't bothered to address with any sort of therapist. i've grown old and i'm scared i am becoming the person who has hurt me the most. i'm scared that i've started to adopt the behaviors of those who have made my life an endless hell. 

i'm no good anymore, i was never good in the first place. i'm the worst friend anyone could ever asked for. i feel like i need to be eradicated, just stomped out of existance like some sort of useless fucking maggot whose only future is to turn in to a fly that sucks the life out of anything that is good. i hate myself
