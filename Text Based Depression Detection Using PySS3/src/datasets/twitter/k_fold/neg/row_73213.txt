I read quantum physics to feel betterNothing can comfort me. No "you'll be better", no "maybe..", no "friends can...". Certainly not religion. Nothing.

But inexplicably, quantum physic give me a tiny shine of hope.

No scientific can really explain why, even Stephen Hawking and lot of hardcore scientifics are confused about it.

I talk about theory in which the oberver plays an indusputable role in mathematical results. What is an observer? Science still not agree on the definition.

But as far as we know, it's us, fellow humans, which decide of the mathematical results of some real experiments on particules like the Double-slit experiment (Wikipedia it).

More I read quantum physic, more I think maybe we are more than a useless conglomerate of matter. If we play a role in maths, the most cynical domain studied, so maybe there is something more than the current world we live for us. 

If only we could be something more than useless humans shits....
