one more tryhad a breakdown just now after weeks of feeling surprisingly fine. during those weeks, i wasn't happy. i was more like, numb to everything, which was a pleasant break from only feeling either anger, sadness or jealousy. and now, i guess, the dam broke. thought about killing myself and all the bullshit in my life again, how shitty of a person i am and how miserable i feel. i hate it.

i'm gonna give this shit one last try. one last try to get my shit together and if it doesn't work i'll finally off myself.
