I am ready to go.To me, my life has no meaning. I am nothing and am worth nothing. I have love in my heart but cannot learn to let others love me. Iâ€™ve pushed some of the greatest people out of my life because I couldnâ€™t see the value they see in me. Trust issues, anxiety, depression, paranoia, all have consumed me. I use drugs and alcohol to deal with it. I have a bleak outlook on the future. I cannot see any good coming my way and if I do, I donâ€™t deserve it. I am ready to go. Iâ€™ve felt this way since I was 13 or since I was old enough to understand what this feeling is. Some people are meant for life, other are not, I am one of those people. Iâ€™ve had a rough up bringing, but who hasnâ€™t? So what excuse do I have? Iâ€™m just a weaker kind of person. I think about death on the daily but am afraid of the outcome. I donâ€™t want leave my family traumatized or burdened. I donâ€™t want them to take blame in this. Thatâ€™s just me and who I am, I hope they can understand that. I feel like my self worth is equivalent to a grain of sand. There are so many people in this world, what does one less person mean? Iâ€™ve been trying my best to smile through pain. Iâ€™ve tried my best to be a kind, forgiving, and understanding person. Everyone whoâ€™s known me has described me as the social, outgoing, funny kid. One who care about other before himself. But Iâ€™m at my wits end and cannot do it anymore. I tried being who they said I was but I donâ€™t know who I am in the end. I love my family with all my heart. But now I cannot find a reason to stay anymore. Yes, life is beautiful.... but it can being mean and ruthless; more often than beautiful. I really have tried to see the good in every little detail, but I guess I didnâ€™t look hard enough. I guess Iâ€™m just ranting on because this many be my last thing I write and I donâ€™t even have the courage to mention a word to my friends and family. So, thank you Reddit. I feel like Iâ€™ve failed everyone. Even myself. Hopefully this path I chose has better results than the one Iâ€™m currently on.
