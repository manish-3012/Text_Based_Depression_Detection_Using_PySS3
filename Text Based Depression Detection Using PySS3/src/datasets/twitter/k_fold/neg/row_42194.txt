I don't want to go back to university but my family won't listenMy depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts become extremely severe when I'm in school. After a massive episode this past November, my mother promised to let me take a leave of absence if I continued to spiral during the spring. And guess what happened? I clung to life by a thread that semester and have been struggling this summer to tighten my grasp. When I brought up our deal, my mother urged me to just stick out the next year. She admitted that she never intended to consider the leave of absence. The thought of having to face such strong feelings of anxiety, panic, worthlessness, loneliness, isolation, and so much more frightens me. I feel like I have to kill myself before she takes me back there because I can't go through that again. And the sad thing is my mom is aware of all of this, but she still wants me to go. Knowing that, I don't have much of a choice but to commit suicide . . . and soon.
