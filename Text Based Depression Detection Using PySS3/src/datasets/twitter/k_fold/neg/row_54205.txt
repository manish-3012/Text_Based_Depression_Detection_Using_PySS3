I have an essay due in two daysI haven't done any of it. I don't fucking know how. The essay requires us to be creative and I don't have a single creative cell in my body. If I live I'm going to fail my English class and my dad is going to be so mad and he's gonna make my life even more hell than it already it. I hate college. I didn't fucking want to start college yet. I hate logging into that stupid fucking website everyday. Why should I if I'm going to fail anyway? I'm too stupid for college, too stupid for anything. All I wanna do is sit on my ass all day playing video games. I'm not meant for this world and I'm terrified of the future, i have no interest in seeing it
