Fucked up and fucked overSad that this is the state of nearly all my generation and younger. Understandably I also  am in your shoes and I have a wife and two daughters neither even two years old. To be honest it is all a scheme to bring in their NWO. For those ignorant to the end game of the elite they want to remove 90% of the worlds population in order to more easily control the masses and corral  them into their NWA (new world agend). It disgusts me that this world would rather take the word of a liar and lazy fuck than an honest and hard finger to the bone worker. I have always had the work ethic of a African slave I bust my ass and push myself literally to the point of passing out and get afterwords and I keep going. I don't believe in quitting yet what have I received in return...not a damn thing. Often I have contemplated suicide, I've sold drugs to my own shame done things to get money to support my family I never imagined I was capable of. The truth is the government doesn't give a royal fuck about you and neither does anyone else because everyone anymore cares only for self so any chance of advancement is out of the damn picture. What I can say is don't give up on yourselves,I won't  and only say this because I don't have that option I'd kill someone else before I did myself if it came down to it. It may be terrible to say but it is the fault of those in Washington D.C. who don't give a fuck about the people they are supposed to represent. Good luck my fellow unemployed brothers and sisters of humanity. Remember color matters not neither does status or privilege yet the truest measure of a person is their character even if it is unappreciated by others.
