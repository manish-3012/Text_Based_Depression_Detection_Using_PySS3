Welp, I normally donâ€™t post here..So Iâ€™m 28 years old and I found out my dad died today, Iâ€™m not taking it very well at all. I canâ€™t even keep my composure. Itâ€™s hard. I live in Las Vegas and I ended up driving to California tonight, Iâ€™m sitting in a hotel room feeling very suicidal. Like Iâ€™ve never felt before, and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m just hoping the pain passes, I donâ€™t have much family left.
