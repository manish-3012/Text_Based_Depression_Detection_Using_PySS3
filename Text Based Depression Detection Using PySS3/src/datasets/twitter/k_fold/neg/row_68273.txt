Why did I wake upDo you ever ask yourself that? 

At dawn when I feel my stomach hurting and tears on my pillow I ask..

At daybreak As the sun crashes through my window and my eyes manage to open I ask..

When the sun is at its highest and I feel the crippling aches and pains I ask..

As twilight rolls around and I fight to crawl out of bed I ask..

At dawn, In the dead of night as I lay alone with my thoughts I ask..

I await the day I ask no more..
