Anyone ever become overly depressed over friends/family's struggles and bad events, even compared to your own?One of my good online friends (I mostly have online friends, I'm as close to some of my online friends as I ever was to anyone irl) had something bad happen to him recently. He still won't tell me what happened, but the few details I could get from him it sounded like maybe all of his siblings died and he's the only child left? I'm not 100% sure but it really messed him up and I've been feeling really bad for him since I learned about it. Like it's consuming more of my worrying thoughts in the day than my own problems.

Not that I think I shouldn't feel bad for him, but I'm starting to feel weird for talking to a few other close friends about this. When I describe the situation out loud/in text it sounds... Obsessive almost? But I'm just worried about his mental health, honestly. Dealing with so much shit myself I try to help people, particularly my close friends, stay out of it. I'm not bothering him or anyone else about it, just trying to stay out of the way but offer support when needed. 

I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone else has ever had this "feature" of depression. I'm not sure if it's some form of self-destruction (I've been dealing with that in all kinds of forms lately), or what... Just wondering if anyone can relate to being almost obsessively worried about a close friend's problems more than your own.
