I'm just a burden to societyI'm disabled and can't work, so I rely on taxes, but taxes are evil, and the government shouldn't help anyone. At least that's what most Americans seem to think. I don't contribute to society, I don't have any children, most of my family disowned me. I literally have no reason to live. I'm nothing but a leech.
