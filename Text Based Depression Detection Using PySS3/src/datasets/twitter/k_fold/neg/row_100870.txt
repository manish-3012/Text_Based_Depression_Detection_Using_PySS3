How the fuck do I deal with this traumaI don't want to get into details, but I have gone through severe emotional traumna arecently... I have tried to deal with it, and I know the resources available near me like suicide/crisiss hotlines, and I've tryed to be therapeutic abotu it but nothing I do makes a difference...

I have had non stop anxiety and panic attacks for weeks. I  ant keep feeling like this and nothing I try to do for myself makes me feel better I just feel useless or guilty. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I don't know what to do I just don't want to feel the pain anymore. Help me
