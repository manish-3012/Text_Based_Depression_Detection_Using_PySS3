Why is it so hard to make the right decisions?I trigger my own onset of depression... I feel like there's no one to turn too. I feel like I've relapsed 4 years into the past.
I had someone great who helped put my depression at ease and I just pushed them away. Their gone for good..What am I gonna do now...why did I do this. Why do I always do stupid things. Stupid BIG things. 
I miss my old life
