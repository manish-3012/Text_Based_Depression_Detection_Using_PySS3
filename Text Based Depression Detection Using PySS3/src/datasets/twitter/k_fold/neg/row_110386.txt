09night, and the light is slow, I feel so much discomfort, care that will disappear until this moment. I know you have lots of beauty, sun life, where there will be smiles, everything is given to you. I know how much you can last, not so for me. How would I be willing to endure, even what would be a problem for me.
You hear a lot about how I am, and who I am.
Things I never liked, promised myself, and wanted to end up for myself.
If my night sounds like how you whisper to your image, you will look like you don't have many friends, you will see how you dream, make friends, even more beautiful forever dreaming, and stay inside it.
When it rains I prefer to cool it, open time and enjoy it together.

We used to laugh together, angry when we make trouble. Your attention is the same as my mother's, reminds me, strengthens me.

Sorry if I have never been seen again
Forgive me!.
