I just want to end things but I'm waaay too scared of the pain...So I'm 24 years old, about to graduate from a program and working to get my hours done in order to graduate. Working has made me realize that I am so lost, I feel like I've learned nothing in the last four years of school and I actually hate my job that's in my field. I suffer from depersonalization/derealization disorder, anxiety and depression. My memory is not the best because of trauma growing up, some other factors etc. and everyday I wake up catastrophizing/thinking negative thoughts. I have family and friends that love me, I know they want the best for me but I don't even know what that looks like for myself. I still live at home, help out my family around the house alot when I'm not working, go to EMDR therapy, but life just feels meaningless. I feel all this pressure to have my life all planned out and be moved out by now. I wake up everyday wanting to get hit by a car, or leave my job wanting to somehow get in an accident (without anyone else getting hurt). I just cant shake the feeling that this is the end for me because I don't know what my life is supposed to look like down the road or what I'm even supposed to do anymore. I genuinely just feel like a waste of space in life and I'm so tired of living. At the same time, I feel so guilty for feeling this way and what kind of pain that would cause to my loved ones, but life doesn't even feel real and it hasn't for the better part of a year and a half. I just hate myself and want this all to end.
