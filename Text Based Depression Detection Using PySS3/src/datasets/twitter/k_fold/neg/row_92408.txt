I'm SorryI'm sorry, mom, dad, brother, sister - I can't take it anymore. I've lived long enough in this shit heap of a world. I was never meant to be born, I was meant to be that child who didn't survive birth. It should have stayed that way. My death is long overdue.

Thank you everyone who ever partook in making my best memories. Thank you all who ever showed me kindness.

But, also, thank you who didn't. Because I deserved it.

God might never forgive me. He mightn't ever let me into paradise for what I plan to do. But I'm okay with it. I deserve it. Just be merciful to my family. They have nothing to do with this and never did anything wrong. Let only me pay the price. Let them have good lives without me. 

As it was meant to be.
