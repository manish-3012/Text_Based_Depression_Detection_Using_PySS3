I want to die in my sleepAll I do is cry when Iâ€™m not at work. Just lay in bed and sob. I miss my ex boyfriend. I thought he was interested in getting back together with me. Heâ€™d flirt and now heâ€™s leaving me hanging. I have no friends. My parents are not doing well health wise and I donâ€™t have any siblings or extended family. I am useless and I am no one. The only way out of this depression is death.
