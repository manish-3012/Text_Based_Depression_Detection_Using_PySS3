Please help before itâ€™s too late :(Iâ€™m a young male and have always had bad anxiety. I finally decided to see a psychiatrist a couple years ago and he prescribed me Gabapentin. I took it at 600 mg per day for about a year and it helped me be able to do a lot of things with less anxiety. I tapered off and had withdrawals all 4 month I was off of it. Not terrible but worse anxiety than before I started it. I went back on and Iâ€™ve been back on a few months now. It doesnâ€™t really do much and I feel more depressed. I even wake up depressed before my morning dose kicks in. Iâ€™m so sick of all this, I feel like killing myself every day and I live an easy life in a high class family. I even had Celexa added recently since Iâ€™ve been feeling so awful. Iâ€™m scared to taper Gabapentin again but I feel terrible being back on it again. Iâ€™m so sick of all of this. Help me
