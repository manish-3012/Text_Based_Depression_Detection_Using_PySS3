I need help.I've felt terrible for the longest time and I'm so tired of feeling like this. I feel alone and I hate every part of myself. Nobody wants me around and no one would miss me. Recently I keep thinking about ending it. I've needed help for so long, but there's nowhere I can go for help and I don't know what to do. I've tried confiding in family, but they don't care since I'm just a burden for them. I'm tired of not having friends. I'm tired of being alone. And I'm tired of myself. I don't know what to do anymore besides just do the world a favor and just go away.
