My boss is disappointed in meI work in a lab and Iâ€™m an undergrad student. As such, I canâ€™t dedicate much time to the lab. My boss emailed me telling me she was disappointed in my performance because I donâ€™t spend as much care as I should in lab, which is very fair and itâ€™s completely my fault. But Iâ€™m so stretched thin and depressed already, that I doubt Iâ€™ll be able to actually improve. Iâ€™m just so tired and worthless, and I honestly donâ€™t see a point in living anymore.
