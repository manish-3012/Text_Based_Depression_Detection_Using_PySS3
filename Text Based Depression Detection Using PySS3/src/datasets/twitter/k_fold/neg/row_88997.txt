I think I should just end thisI had someone who I've been talking online with for a while. I felt like they actually cared. I dropped my phone in water a week ago and just now was able to get into reddit on my new phone.  

I come back and they said horrible things about me ghosting them and then blocked me and deleted their account.  That's just one example but it showed me how much people don't care. The person I told almost everything said I deserve my past. I'm alone. I was already fragile but that kinda broke me
