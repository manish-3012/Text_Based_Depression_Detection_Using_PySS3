When is this going to be different?Not even sure how this works. Was redirected from from a similar subreddit search, and was pretty surprised to see a lot of other people with shitty situations. All of which makes me wonder, why me too?


**When are things going to be different?**

I'm 27 now, but I've never had a reason to complain or feel like this growing up. This is also probably part of why I feel like I don't have a right to tell anyone. Other people have it far worse. I'm relatively in healthy, in shape, educated. Yet, I still feel like this. Always had everything handed to me pretty much. Grew up not having to really worry about money. Wasn't super rich or anything, but never really had any major financial problems. High school had it's up and downs, but again, nothing major that I think is worth mentioning other than being stupid and reckless from time to time. Never had any worries or feelings of "when is this going to be different?"

College was paid for. I met a lot of great people, and had as much fun as I could without failing. Again, I thought things were going great, and never had any feelings of "when is this going to be different?"

I got my first real job, out of state, and ended up making over 6 figures at age 25. I thought life was great. But this is about the time where the emptiness started to sit in. Something wasn't right. I don't know if something happened, but this is when I started wondering what the heck was the point of life. I think therefore I am. Why? I blocked these feelings, thinking it was just me getting older, and this is what old people feel. 
 

Through out college and first working, I was in a relationship for 7 years. She was great. But, I didn't appreciate her for who she was till I broke it off. A lot built up to it, but for the most part, it was just me being unappreciative, prideful, and selfish. This was about 7 months ago. I think this is what escalated these feelings, and brought them to the surface. 

Since then, I've moved back to my home city, thinking it would change everything. That everything would be different. It hasn't. If anything, I feel more alone than ever. I have been going to a therapist, and she offers some great advice, but it's not changing this feeling. I am just waiting for my feelings to change, but I'm starting to think that it never will. 

I've already heard the cliche's of things **will** get better. When? I don't know if I want to wait for a long time. I try to keep myself busy during the week and evenings with work, family, friends. I've been working out, getting back to my hobbies. But still, nothing seems to be making this go away. 

The nights are the worst. I think of my ex- girlfriend more than I should. Sometimes texting or emailing her asking how she is. Only to get told to go away, and to move on. This doesn't help. And I know I should try and stop all contact with her, but it's hard to rip out someone that was with you for 7 years. I think this is now beginning to turn into a rant. 


My point is, when are things going to be different? And please don't tell me, "it's a mental thing, it's when you want it to be", "it's all in how you see things", "change your mentality" . 

I'm not really sure what the point of me posting this was. I've been reading this subreddit for quite sometime, thinking maybe I could learn a thing or two from other's posts. Nothing different yet.
