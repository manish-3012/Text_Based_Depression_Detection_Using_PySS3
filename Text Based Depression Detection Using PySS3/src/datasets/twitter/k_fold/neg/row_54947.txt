One of my seemingly impossible suicide plans. Any thoughts?So I've been wanting to get this idea off my chest for a while now. It's something that I've thought about for quite some time. My plan was to write a suicide note to put in my pocket and drive to my school and somehow find a gun to take with me. (Keep in mind that my goal is not to hurt/kill others with the gun). Next, I would wait until lunch time and walk to the front cafeteria with the gun on me. (hidden of course). After I would be in the majority of everyone's sight, I would then say a few last words then put the gun in my mouth and fire it. I would do this before anyone would stop me. Why would you want to do this in school you may ask? I would want to do it in school because I would have the opportunity to traumatize my peers. If you're wondering why I feel the way I feel, it's a long story. If you have any thoughts please let me know.

Thank you
