my nudes were leakedmy nudes were leaked on March 31st by my ex girlfriend. over 50 people have added me on snapchat since the time she has exposed me. Iâ€™m a minor. sheâ€™s about the same age as me. I canâ€™t go to the police about this because then my mom will find out that I was in a relationship with a girl and that Iâ€™ve been communicating with someone strictly through the internet. I donâ€™t know if I can sacrifice losing the little bit of kindness my family gives me now if they find out. I have no idea what sheâ€™d do if she found about about this, especially my attraction for girls. I want my ex to fucking pay for what she did, even if it was stupid for sending those pictures in the first place. I donâ€™t fucking deserve this, so donâ€™t give me the speech about how I should have expected this or that iâ€™ve learned my lesson. And she doesnâ€™t deserve to go through life without consequences or being held accountable. Even if I report and nothing happens to her, at least I could live with myself knowing that I tried and didnâ€™t just take it. I canâ€™t let her win.

All this is starting to make me very suicidal. In the beginning I didnâ€™t feel suicidal because I knew thatâ€™s what she wanted. She wants to make me feel guilty for breaking up with her (she was verbally abusive). Sheâ€™s told me that I shouldâ€™ve went through with killing myself, referring to the time that I TRUSTED TO TELL HER ABOUT MY SUICIDAL THOUGHTS WHEN I COULDNT TRUST ANYONE ELSE. EVERY SINGLE PERSONAL THING THAT I TOLD HER IN CONFIDENCE, she used against me! I feel like I have no control. I canâ€™t stand that feeling. I just want justice, even if it canâ€™t be through legal means. At least not through illegal means either. I feel disgusted and sick to my fucking stomach.

sorry if this is the wrong community to post this in, but I am actively suicidal rn and this is the reason. so I chose here.
