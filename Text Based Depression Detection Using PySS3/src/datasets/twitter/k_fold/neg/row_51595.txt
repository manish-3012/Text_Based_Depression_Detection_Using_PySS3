It doesn't get betterEveryone says it gets better. That life is peaks and valleys. When do the peaks come? When does it start getting better? I've believed them at first but for the past few years I don't really know if I do anymore. It's like my valleys are the Mariana Trench and my peaks are ocean level. Just keep getting kicked while I'm down. I've been depressed for years but don't know how to talk about it. I know I should, but I can't bring myself to put this on the ones I love. I feel like I'm just a burden on everyone I know. I've had many plans to kill myself but I don't want anyone I care about to find me. Maybe if I just drive far away one day, so far no one would be able to find me, I wouldn't feel so bad about ending it. I don't want to confuse my dog either. He's been one of the things that's stopped me. No one really knows but I would bring him everywhere with me so I wouldn't drive into a pole and kill myself because I don't want to die. He's so old now, maybe he'll die soon enough and I finally won't be holding on so tight. Maybe it will get better one of these days, but I'm not so sure.
