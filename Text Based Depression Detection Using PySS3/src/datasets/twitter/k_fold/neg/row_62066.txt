Nothing but regrets - Suicide has been on the table for over a year now.I had a good life once. I was in the army, I was paid well. I met my wife in the army, she is now leaving me after 9 years together. I have not worked for 3 years due to mental health issues that I got whilst I was touring in the army.

I sit here and wonder "what the hell happened to me?" I used to be full of life, full of dreams, full of aspirations. I'm now a 29 year old male with zero value to offer to anybody. I don't blame anyone expect myself for my situation. Circumstances and me not being able to work with the cards I got dealt has all but killed me off.  

The thing is, I have reached a point where I am just numb and knowing suicide is an option is a comfortable feeling to me now. When I first thought of suicide around a year ago, I was worried and scared. Now...it's kind of liberating knowing all this pain I have can be over very soon.
