FuckIf I blew my head off with a shotgun I wouldn't need to be sober. If I had enough money and didn't live with my parents I'd be leaning out right now on some good tar. I love the numb and the power. Too bad I was a weak ass bitch when I tried slinging dope. I got messed up in that game and I barely played. I'm such a useless faggot now. I could define my own reality and think long term. Except my goals are fucked up. I spend all day making bad trap music and it sounds like shit. I don't even have creative thoughts. I resent all my old friends, even my meth dealer has a better life than me. I don't do shit. I have to live with my parents and take community college classes. They're too worried about me getting fucked up like I was last year shooting methheroin everyday. The meth was too extreme because it fucked up my look. I was 120 ibs 4 months ago now I'm 160 and shredded. I'm so empty and pissed I wanna shoot my meth dealers house and see if I live. I can't sleep I hate myself and done with this bullshit.
