No more pleaseI remember when my dog was old and sick and we asked the vet when it was time and he said â€œwhen the bad days outnumber the good ones.â€ Well my bad days outnumber my good ones by a long shot. Why canâ€™t people understand that and let me die. Why canâ€™t they have the same attitude. Iâ€™m suffering and I donâ€™t want to be anymore. It isnâ€™t fair. Iâ€™m so unloved and uncared for and it hurts so badly. Iâ€™m humiliated and alone and I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t know if I even can. I eat like shit, I donâ€™t shower or brush my teeth or brush my hair or even get out of bed unless itâ€™s to go to work. I donâ€™t want to see my friends. I donâ€™t want to open my mouth at all. I donâ€™t even feel like crying anymore. I just wish it would end.
