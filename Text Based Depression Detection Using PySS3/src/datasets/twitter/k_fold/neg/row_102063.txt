Iâ€™m SorryI honestly donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing typing this. Iâ€™m not even sure if I even want help anymore. I just feel defeated, lost, alone, knocked down, and I donâ€™t want to get back up. I just want to stay down.

This isnâ€™t some phase. This isnâ€™t me just having an emotional bad day. This has been going on nearly my whole life. Iâ€™ve tried ending my life once before. I tried overdosing on medications and all it did was make me really ill.  The reason why I never tried again since is because I thought that maybe it really was just a phase. Maybe things would get better. I didnâ€™t want to breath anymore, but if I took just a few more breaths maybe it would feel good breathing again. 

My life has not gotten better since. In fact, I feel even worse than I ever have before. Waking up everyday isnâ€™t a chore anymore, its a punishment. Going to sleep isnâ€™t an escape. I canâ€™t even have dreams. Its just as lonely as it is being awake. I thought joining the military would be viable, and maybe I could die in combat or something. Make my life useful. Nope, this world just wonâ€™t let me die. 

Iâ€™ve had no friends for years. The last and only friend I had, my dog Max, was taken from me from the world. Now I have to live hell without him. If we could have switched lifespans I would have made the trade in a heart beat. He would have appreciated living more. 

In case youâ€™re curious, no, my family was not abusive or anything of a sort. My parents did a very good job raising me. There comes a time in a manâ€™s life when personal responsibility comes into play. My parents didnâ€™t do this. My siblings didnâ€™t do this. The world didnâ€™t do this. You didnâ€™t do this. This is all my fault. I did this to myself. I failed myself. I lost faith in myself. 

The truth is I didnâ€™t come here for help. I came here to apologize. I want to say Iâ€™m sorry to my family, the world, and myself. I want to apologize for ruining my second chance at life. I want to apologize to my country for failing as a soldier and giving up. I want to apologize to my parents for wasting their time being the best parents ever to the most ungrateful son ever. 

I finally want to apologize to you stranger. If you have friends and family I want you to think about the time you have left with them and tell them you love them. Please donâ€™t try and save me. Its too late for me. Please, just this once, please let me die. I just wanted to say Iâ€™m sorry. Save yourself.
