Why am I so desperate?I don't feel like I belong in this world. Making friends has never been something I can just do, it just randomly happens. I had a great New Years Eve actually, spent it cuddling with someone who was nice and we got along great. But the next day all that happiness just turned into loneliness because it was so fleeting. I can't just keep asking the same person to do that every day, because then I would be some clingy bastard. How can I even try to make friends when I am so fucked up and depressed? I can't make myself happy, so why do I expect others to want to? One of these days I hope I can just get a gun to end it all fast. I hate myself so much and I just push away people I want to have close to me.

Sorry this was all over the place, probably better suited for /r/offmychest :\
