Recovering from an attempt last nightAfter an attempted overdose, I was on the phone with my boyfriend when I realized I didn't want that to be our last conversation. I ran to the bathroom to throw up. 

I don't think I want to die; I just don't want to live with my family anymore. I can't afford a car though, and I have no way out. I feel hopeless, and despite this realization, I don't think I can hold on much longer.
