not being good enoughNot being good at anything

My parents both hate me and said their life was easier before I was born. My mom is a failed nurse who had to put off college and raise me and my dad is an old man already getting pension. They always had big dreams for me and hopes but too bad i suck at everything. I have bad grades no matter how much i study, i can barley run let alone do anything athletic, I have no sense for art or music of anything artistic and i struggle with everyday tasks because of my anxiety and depression. I live in a country where being a lesbian or apart of the lgbt community is considered to be disgusting and a sin. No matter how much i try how much i pray all I am and am going to be is a failure. Why not just kill myself and let a more capable and normal human being have more space and recourses on this shitty planet?
