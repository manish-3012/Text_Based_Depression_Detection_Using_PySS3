what do i do?I dont know what to do, i tried to commit suicide at age 10 and now 2 years later im back in the same predicament, i've tried to see point to my lie, whenever i speak out i end up regretting it, i started cutting myself about 5 weeks ago, but now all i can do is scratch my skin violently. i keep on going emotiononally numb. i have no way of seeing a future for myself. i have only online contact with my friends for a short period eah day, which is monitored, making it very hard to use, i never had. im going to school just to feel almost ostracised. i sit alone, i eat alone, i have become very introverted again. i have no way of getting help as far as i can see and all i want to know is, what now, how do i stop myself from comitting suicide? how do people cope?
