I would love to be friends and talk about our depression/struggles etc.  I feel alone and disconnected from the world. In my whole life I never really

connected with someone in my life really, then I feel so alone, and different from others. My life is totally different then people ever can imagine, I hardly see and talk to them, and if so, then it's just short and shallow. It's difficult to make contact. Still I would love to talk about music (Nirvana, Joy Division, Ty Segall, The Clash, David Bowie, Velvet Underground just to name a few), life, depression, struggles. I would love to be friends and have a good connection :)

I wish you all positivity and inner strength to go on in life,

I believe you can come out of the problems you are facing now,

as long as you believe in yourself.

Rose
