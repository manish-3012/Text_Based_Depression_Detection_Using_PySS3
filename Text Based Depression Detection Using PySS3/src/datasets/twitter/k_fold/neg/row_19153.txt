I've grown weary of livingTwice have I involuntarily submitted to a mental hospital, only to further exacerbate my depression. I am at school looking at others live their lives like normal, happy and outgoing. Two days ago was I discharged from the last mental hospital, now I feel like an absolute social pariah, as if I am not a member of society. God do I have the right urge to hang myself, cutting no longer helps, what now? I have no one in my life, not a love one or friend in sight, no support our no these bleak times. Perhaps this is a boon, no one to hurt, I certainly won't be missed if I were to die today. Ironic, listened and comforted others in this subreddit, yet never had I someone to truly care for me, I think I will be killing myself on the day of my birth. You are born alone and die alone.
