I don't know if this belongs here, if it doesn't can someone please direct me to the right sub?Being honest, I really like my teachers. I can always count on them to lend me a helping hand. One day I was walking with my male attractive volleyball coach who's also a science teacher for the school, When I was leaving his class he called me over to his desk. He wanted to know if I wanted to sign up for the team. I'm bi but he knows (relevant later). When I approached him he stood up and shook my hand. Ngl his shirt went up a bit and I saw his abs, (ikr right). I for some reason got excited ( I think that's the feeling) and ran off. When he asked a fellow player a question, the player told my teacher I'm bi. Being the caring and kind teacher he is, he went to my school counselor and asked her to check up on me and see if I'm okay.

But somehow the info got to one of my AP's (Assistant principal) who's a conservative Christian. She called me to her office and told me to hide my sexuality because it's causing trouble. She "threatened" to tell my parents if I didn't quit the volleyball team.

But my main principal whom I'm very close to told me this is inappropriate behavior that she shouldn't be exhibiting. She would delete the report that was submitted to the school's anonymous reporting system. tbh I'm honestly scared of my AP and I'm afraid she's out to get me, and I don't know how to handle this. Before school ended, AP said to think about it over summer. I'm honestly scared this might lead me to do something stupid.
