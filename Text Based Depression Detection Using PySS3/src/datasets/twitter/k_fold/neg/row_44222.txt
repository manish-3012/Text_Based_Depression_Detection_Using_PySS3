Sick of this shitI don't think I'm going to survive this new low, I always sort of knew I was going to die by suicide but I haven't got fear stopping me anymore. I have everything prepared, I'm just waiting for the right time. I've tried everything to change my mind but I'm just fooling myself, there is no light at the end of the tunnel and I dont think there ever has been. I had Hope's and dreams but now I'm not too bothered if I don't live to actually achieve them. I dont really care about anything anymore. All I do is work or sit in bed watching youtube and sleep, so its not as if I'm really living anyway.
