everyone would be happier if i diedmy ex left me for someone else and doesn't want me in her life anymore. i've been nothing but a disappointment to my family. i barely have any friends, the ones that i do are clearly tired of my constant venting. who would even care that much if i died?

maybe people will be sad at first. but how long will it last? a week? a month? they will eventually forget about me and move on with their lives as if i never existed in the first place. my ex would be happy that i won't bother her anymore, and my parents will have one less thing to worry about. they're already stressed and overworked, my problems aren't helping them at all. my friends clearly only talk to me out of moral obligation, i'm not funny or interesting enough for them to actually want to stick around.

i don't have energy to do anything anymore. i can't draw, sing, i can't even do my homework or assignments anymore. i just waste away my days laying in bed and scrolling through reddit like a zombie. i'm not smart, pretty or talented and nothing i ever do is good enough for anyone. i started cutting again after 3 months because it's the only thing that makes me feel good anymore, but i'm too scared to go to a therapist. they will 100% tell my parents everything and that's pretty much my worst nightmare.

what's even the point of living if nobody cares about me? at least i'll be able to rest when i'm dead.
