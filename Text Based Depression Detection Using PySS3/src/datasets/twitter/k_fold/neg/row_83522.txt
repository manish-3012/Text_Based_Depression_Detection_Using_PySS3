Planning on killing myself. Again.Hello everyone, I am writing this because I want to gather up my thoughts. As title says I want to kill myself again. This happened to me for the first time a year ago. It was something new, unexpected so I told my family, found help, spent a month in a psychiatric hospital, got treatment and meds. 

However, the thoughts came back and I don't feel like going through all that again, to bother my family with my shit although they are very supportive. There is nothing I enjoy anymore, everything I do is just for the moment, just to get distracted for an hour maybe two and after that I realize that I hate myself.

Basically I don't have any friends, no social life. I am 20, male, virgin, never had a girlfriend because I have no confidence, can't imagine someone actually liking me. 

I failed one uni, then on second try I had to stop the study because of depression, this is my third try and I have stopped attending lectures and practicals because I lost motivation and started to see everything dark again. I feel like a failure, my parents see someone who is smart in me and I just keep letting them down.

I am planning to kill myself in a few days before they find out I failed again. Still not decided if I should leave a note or not and what other things should I resolve before leaving forever.

Well, if you are reading this you probably made it this far, thank you for your time.
