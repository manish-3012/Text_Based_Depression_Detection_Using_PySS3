Going to kill myself next week.I have opportunities others would kill for... I'm 16, have plenty of friends. Am in a good school (Which I don't go in literally everyday)
I should be happy. Life has limitless opportunities. But here I am crying in my dark room that I spend most of my life.
Being born wasn't my choice, but ending it all is. I have a plan ready (won't go into detail on here obviously)
Thank you to all the people who've talked to me over the years.
