Decisions. I have always held high goals for myself, and lately, I have been falling short of all of them. The more I fail my own goals, the more depressed I come. I constantly think of killing myself, simply because I believe I'm a failure because of my own failings. 

I can't talk to anyone about it, simply because I feel that they have just as high expectations of me as well. The only way from here is down, and I feel it won't be long before I reach that point. 

If i quit now, I will be so destroyed by myself. But if I keep trying, I only keep the cycle going. 

How do I get back on track?
