Iâ€™ve been insensitive to depression and suicide my entire life, and I think karma is kicking my ass for it.I donâ€™t even know where to begin. Iâ€™ve historically been a dick involving anything about depression or suicidal thoughts. I swore for so long depression wasnâ€™t a real thing and anyone who committed suicide was a selfish prick.

Fast forward to today and I understand it all. My life is perfectly fine but Iâ€™ve been in a rut the past 2-3 years that just wonâ€™t stop. I have no reason not to be happy; Iâ€™m happily married, I have a job working within a company I love, I donâ€™t do without anything I need, but I canâ€™t stay happy. I donâ€™t want to die, but I donâ€™t care to live anymore. Going to back to the title, all of this makes me feel like a piece of shit. I donâ€™t think I would ever kill myself because of my wife and family, but it just keeps getting worse.

Iâ€™ve struggled with alcohol the last 7ish years. The last 6 months I started smoking weed to keep from drinking thinking that might help. All itâ€™s really done is move my dependence from one thing to the other. I just hate to be sober. I donâ€™t drive under any influence or go to work messed up, but I practically count the minutes until Iâ€™m home to change my mindset. Iâ€™ve kind of alienated myself from friends and family the last year or so. My wife asked me to go to the doctor and I tried Zoloft with a prescription from that visit. I hated the feeling it gave so I quit after a month or so.

Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m rambling, but Iâ€™m sitting here awake by myself, and I have this weird feeling that is getting worse as months go by. I physically feel strange and itâ€™s kind of making me loose faith in myself. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting on reddit like itâ€™s supposed to save the fucking day, but I just needed to get some shit out.
