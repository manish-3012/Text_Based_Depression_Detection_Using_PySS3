Why are some people born into family's who love themMy dad is abusive, he's abused me my whole life, and I don't love him in the slightest. He's an alcoholic and violent creep who doesn't deserve love from anyone. 
My mom who was basically my only friend in my family is dead, she died when I was eleven. My sister is nice but she's extremely selfish and her lack of consideration for other people is just something I can't and don't want to deal with. My brother is an asshole and has a huge ego because he was always the favorite child. So many people get normal family's with parents and siblings who love them, am I really that horrible that I don't deserve that? So many people have failed me in my life, teachers, school officials, friends, classmates, no one cares about me. I trusted them with secrets and dark thoughts that I didn't tell anyone else and a lot of them downright blamed me for not wanting to live or for being abused. This world sucks, I hope I die
