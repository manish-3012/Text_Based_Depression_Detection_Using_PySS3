I actually feel like Iâ€™m going insaneI canâ€™t make the thoughts stop. I feel like Iâ€™m on the verge of tears. I donâ€™t even know why. Iâ€™m so sick of everything. Iâ€™m sick of this life. I canâ€™t do anything right. Let me just die already.

Itâ€™s 8pm. Iâ€™m going to sleep. I canâ€™t take it anymore.
