â€¼ï¸â€¼ï¸â€¼ï¸âš ï¸âš ï¸IF YOU CAN SEE THIS PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FUCKING HELP ME. SAVE ME âš ï¸âš ï¸â€¼ï¸â€¼ï¸â€¼ï¸now that i have your attention im so sick of trying to call out for help, but no one is ever there. to people, if you donâ€™t look depressed you donâ€™t need help. when i tell people i care about iâ€™m going to be dead soon and i want to spend my last few months with them, or to explain to teachers why i have completely given up in life and iâ€™m just going to drop out next year and kill myself, nobody bats an eye. no one says a word. no one cares. if i put my hood up and tell someone iâ€™m having a bad day, immediately everyone suddenly cares. and they wanna help until i actually mention suicide. 

so, according to everyone on earth, youâ€™re only deserving of help if something specific happened to you that made you depressed and if you act depressed every second of the day. well, maybe i can just be suicidal? nothing happened to me. i just have these feelings. and maybe i like laughing at jokes, or smiling at people, or being positive. but no, people only care if the depression is visible. people only care if you are crying 24/7. and even then if you mention suicide they disappear. the only person who ever said to me something along the lines of â€œplease do not kill yourselfâ€ was my therapist from last year. you want to know why she said that? because if i killed myself, sheâ€™ll lose her job. pure selfishness. every one i talk to about my depression says â€œbut youâ€™re always so happy! youâ€™re just being lazy. you want attention.â€ every. single. person.

and itâ€™s the same way here on this subreddit. if you arenâ€™t interesting, people donâ€™t want to help you. you have to catch their attention, then theyâ€™ll hear what you have to say. how about this: maybe everyone is deserving of help, yeah? we shouldnt have to be interesting or noticeable to get support.

if you read this, thank you.
