My longterm life trajectory leads to suicideI think at some point I decided I didn't give a shit anymore, but had too much to live for, I have slowly but surely eroded the "safety nets" that have served to keep me alive in the hope that eventually I will be at rock bottom and decide it's not worth it anymore.

I am capable of socializing very well. However, it's been years since I dated, made a good friend, I don't go out, I don't hang out with the friends I do have, I moved away from home and haven't kept in touch with anyone I knew. I talk to my parents 2-3 times a year, my siblings, once every month or so, I never answer my phone, text messages, emails, etc.  The best thing I did for myself in years was to quit smoking (almost 2 years ago) and I recently have started smoking again.

I think what is most surprising when I think about it and write it all out, is how little I care to change. It reminds me of the poem "My Defeat" by Kahlil Gibran (an excerpt): 
  
"Defeat, my Defeat, my solitude and my aloofness;  
You are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs,  
And sweeter to my heart than all worldglory."  

I recently started taking antidepressants because I was worried my depression was going to make me lose my job and force me to move back home.  It is making it easier to do my work, but I doubt it will reverse what I have spent years unraveling in my personal life.  

This isn't really a cry for help, I'm just wondering if anyone else has done this either intentionally or subconsciously in their own lives.
