My life is crumblingOne year ago, my father and I moved out of my childhood home. Ever since then, my life has been a slow and constant downward spiral. My dad is a binge drinker and has a new girlfriend that doesn't support it, and I've been so poorly prepared for the world since childhood that I have nothing to look forward to. I'm incompatible with the world, can't talk to people, have no skills of any use whatsoever and my only foreseeable outcome is suicide.

Last night, all of this came to a head when my father was kicked out of a hotel room and I was left more or less alone. I've been in foster care before and if my relatives across the country refuse to take me I'm willing to end it. As a type 1 diabetic, I also have the tools to easily and painlessly do so. The last time I tried to kill myself was in a foster home, and now they're trying to send me there again. I have close to 500 units of insulin ready to inject if I'm under any threat of going to a foster home or being kicked out onto the streets.

I'm sure nobody cares, but I wrote this up anyway. I guess that's just how it goes. I know I'm beyond help but there's a tiny part of me that hasn't given up yet.
