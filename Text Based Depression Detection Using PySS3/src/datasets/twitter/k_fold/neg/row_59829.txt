Iâ€™d rather be dead.I feel like Iâ€™m just complaining and that my problems are irrelevant. But here goes. I have so much trouble trying to be social, I have a hard time making friends because Iâ€™m so afraid of them finding out Iâ€™m actually in a pretty fucked up mental state. Iâ€™m a senior in high school and Iâ€™ve completely lost motivation to try. Iâ€™ve always been the good student, getting good grades, and doing what society wants me to do up until now. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s just senioritis and depression mixing together to further fuck up my life or if my depression is worsening. Iâ€™m behind in my classes, not failing but I feel like I will the longer I keep this up. Most of the things online give super generic advice that doesnâ€™t seem to help much. I feel like everyday is a drag and one more day I need to get through. I try to be happy for other people but Iâ€™m so sick of pretending. Recently, Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide or hurting myself to not feel so numb all the time. I cant get therapy right now because I donâ€™t have health insurance. If anyone has advice thatâ€™d be nice.
