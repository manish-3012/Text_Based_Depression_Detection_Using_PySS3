Just got fired from new job, time to give upI just got fired yesterday. For bad attendance. 5 sick days used in 2 months. Didn't even make it 3 months. I'm 36 and can't hold a job. I feel like I've tried enough times. I can only fail so much.

The anxiety won. I can't do this. I can't live in this world like this. I have tried so many times and failed so many times. 36 is too old to be in this position. 

I just don't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm very seriously considering using my last paycheck on my "ticket" out of this life, whatever that ends up being. I am a massive failure, a giant humiliation, and a bad person. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'm hoping someone will have some kind words to make me believe it might be okay. Even though all of us here know better.
