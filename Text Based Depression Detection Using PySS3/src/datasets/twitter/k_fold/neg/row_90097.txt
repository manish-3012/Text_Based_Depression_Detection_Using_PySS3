TIRED OF BEING A PUSSYI'm like a fucking sheep being chased by a pack of wolves in this world.

I hide myself and scared of social interactions. 

How the fuck can I live peacefully when I don't even know to communicate properly.

I can't even keep a job because I break down due to feeling anxious and SCARED.

my brain is always on FLIGHT OR FIGHT mode. never am I relaxing

I sometimes feel like killing myself because of how pathetic I am. Its shameful

A sheep cannot survive in this world so what the fuck am I even doing
