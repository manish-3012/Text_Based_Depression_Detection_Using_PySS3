Why go on?When my best friend killed herself, I died too, and Iâ€™m never coming back. Ghosts donâ€™t exist, Iâ€™ll never see her again and I canâ€™t live with that. Iâ€™m trans and a lesbian, people at best tolerate it to be professional (like doctors and stuff, I know deep down they hate me just as the rest of them), at worst people want me to suffer. They donâ€™t know that they canâ€™t keep their hate to themselves.
