I don't know what to doAll my life I've had suicidal thoughts and now I feel like it's too much. I've know from the very moment I was young that people don't care about me I was always left out I was always ignored I was always the person that people took advantage of and didn't matter. And now I'm tired of living this worthless life. I'm tired of it but at the same time I'm scared I'm scared because how much it might hurt and that I will be sent to hell. But at the end of the day I don't want to hurt my mum but what is the point when I am a burden to everyone around for me? When I am a worthless piece of shit when I am unlovable and no one cares? I plan maybe to make it to graduation so finish my degree so at least my parents will have that but after I'll be gone
