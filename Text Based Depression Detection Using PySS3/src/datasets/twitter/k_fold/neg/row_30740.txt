Constant thoughtI'm not really suicidal right now, but I usually am. Everytime I buy something it either doesn't work or turns out to be a waste of money. Usually when I invest in something it's a loss. Recently,  I have let my boyfriend invest my monety for me and I am taking half the profit, but I wish I could do it on my own. I just really suck for some reason. I try to be positive. I got a vocational degree in Web design 8 years ago, applied for jobs CONSTANTLY for 3 years (now just every so often) and couldn't land one, despite being top of my class. I never get promoted at jobs. I'm constantly working my hands to the bone at physical labor PT jobs. I always feel taken advantage of and jealous of eveyone I know. It's so hard to stay optimistic when experience tells you otherwise. I'm always trying to strengthen my skills but everywhere I turn is a road block. I'm fairly certain that I will eventually die by my own hand. The only question is when. What should I do, Reddit?
