19 y/o and suicidal because in every aspect I'm completely, 100% ineptI've essentially no social circle, my family's disappointed in me, I've no future prospects â€” everything is just complete and utter shit.

I can't even get a job, let alone hold one down. 

I don't see a future for myself. I'm waiting on a reference for a university application. The deadline's tomorrow and despite chasing, and chasing, and chasing it, it still hasn't been submitted, meaning I'll have to wait another year until I'm able to re-apply. I really, really don't want that to be the case, but it isn't within my control.

I can't even get a job in retail. I don't know what to do. I'm feeling so hopeless. Please don't tell me to contact either my GP or Samaritans because if those'd worked, then I wouldn't be writing this here.
