I'm a terrible person who deserves to be killedI have a great partner, I have some really kind friends, I have a supportive family. My life has kind of gone to shit because I'm about to graduate college with no jobs lined up and a completely worthless degree but everyone's done that so it's not like that's a particularly special problem.

And yet, I'm still unhappy. Every time I try to reflect on my life, I just focus on all the negatives and it comes out as a stream of pathetic, insolent whining. In spite of all the hardships that people go through that make my petty insignificant problems look like a walk in the park, I still feel the need to just complain about how horrible my not actually horrible life is. 

Worse still, my attitude just infects people and I have a tendency to get close to people only to make them feel like shit with my own toxicity. And then I shit-talk them and put them down when they're naturally repulsed by my disgusting behavior. 

I know for a fact that if I met me, I would hate them so much. I'm a shitty person and the only reason I have people in my life is because they haven't realized how shitty I am. But they'll realize soon and leave me because that's what's best for them.

I'm a poisonous person; I've made no one's life better; the best thing I could do for everyone in my life is die. 

I don't even know why I posted this. I just hate the person I've become.
