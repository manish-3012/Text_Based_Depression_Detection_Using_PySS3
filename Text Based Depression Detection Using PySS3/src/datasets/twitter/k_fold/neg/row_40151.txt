Was told to come here and submit what i did on Askreddit. Just getting some stuff off my chest.I'm 17, and have one year until I'm on my own. I dropped out of high school because i was getting the shit beaten out of me every week or so and was bullied every day (Nothing to do with grades, i had honors every quarter). I'm now home schooled and ready for college (on an academic level). I'm planning on jumping off the roof of an apartment building next June because by that time I'll most likely be homeless.

I have extreme social-phobia,depression, low self esteem, and paranoia. i don't leave the house that often and in some social situations i have panic attacks or mental breakdowns. I just stay inside all day and study or work on the small online business that I'm trying to make enough money from to live off of for a few months after i have to leave my parents house.

I can't go to college because of my problems and even if i did i doubt i could last 4 years if i can't last 2 years in high school. What i need to do is get a job but i can't even have a conversation with someone that i know so i don't see how i can do well in an interview. Suicide seems like one of my only options here, my family doesn't know about anything because i hate complaining about my life, it sounds like I'm whining. But next week my family is telling me that I'm coming on vacation with them and they don't want to hear any excuses, I'm sure that I'll have another attack. So i guess if you're going to give advice that last problem should be the one to help me with because next Monday is getting closer.

Thank you for reading my unorganized thoughts and sorry for the long run on sentences.
