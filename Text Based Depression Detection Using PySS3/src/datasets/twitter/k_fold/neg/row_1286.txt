I'm supposed to talk with my BF today to try and fix our relationship, but I will subtly say goodbye instead.Subtle enough so that he doesn't realize at the moment, but that when he finds out I'm dead and looks back, he realizes I didn't leave without saying goodbye.

I'm going to a psychiatrist in about 52 hours, but if he doesn't take my case, or if I don't feel better with the medication, I will end it. I just can't take it anymore.

I'm not fine, I won't ever be.
