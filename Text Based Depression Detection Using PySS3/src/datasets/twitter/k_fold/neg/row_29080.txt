Once I finally end myself and this pain at the same time..I want every single one of you who is suffering, and for those who are offering support and words of encouragement, to have the happiest, most peaceful lives. I wish you joy and only happy tears, loving, grateful children, wonderful life-partners, good jobs and beautiful music at your weddings, puppies and kittens, colorful balloons, delicious food, snow during Christmas, and love.. lots and lots of love. I'm reaching the end of my rope in here, I've been posting for a while both here and on r/Offmychest, and you've all been so wonderful, your replies are overwhelming and you restore my faith in humanity. My suicide will not mean that any of you failed, it will only mean that I am tired. I wish that in the future, as soon as possible they will find a cure for this, a treatment, and no one will have to suffer through this hell. Happy holidays, you beautiful humans!
