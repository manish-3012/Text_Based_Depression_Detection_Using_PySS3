Idk guys, i dont think im suicidal, but i dont know what to do about this...pain?...in my chestIdk guys...i have this pulsating...pain...rythym in my chest. I think i am sick in the head...idk what to do. I just want the pain to stop. Im desperate. I cant think straight. Ive never felt this way in my life. I just want the pain to stop.

I feel like my soul got expelled and replaced by something else...ive never ever been this way never ever. I cant control myself. I feel like a video game character or like at the very end of that black mirror episode space fleet
