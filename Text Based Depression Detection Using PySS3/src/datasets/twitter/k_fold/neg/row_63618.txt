Im scared but almost there.I didn't live much of a life. I recently fucked up one of the best things I've ever had. But I'm not sure that they cared at all. I told them I loved them, I didn't mean to, but I say what I mean and I mean what I say. They took it horribly. All this being after we had basically planned to run away together and find something to live for. 
We clicked, I stumbled and now I'm left with nothing. 

I wanted nothing in return, I just wanted to make someone happy. But I failed even at that. 

I can't live for myself. I need something to live for and I have nothing left. I don't want to go on alone again. I don't have the strength. 

I guess I'm just writing this so someone, anyone knows I just wanted to be loved. That's it. That's all I needed.

I hope anyone reading this cherishes the people that love them. I hope you feel useful and important. I hope you learn to love yourselves. 

Do what I couldn't. 

Live.
