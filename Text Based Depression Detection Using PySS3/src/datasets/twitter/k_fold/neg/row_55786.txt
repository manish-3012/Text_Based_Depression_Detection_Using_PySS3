"Love Thine Torture"Must you torture me with such beauties?
A torture I willfully accept from the goddess of beauties, love and wisdom beyond any other.
Oh goddess of love how your torture feels. 
Am I to spend eternity as the tiniest speckle of life in your vast universe unnoticed by your beautiful majesty? Your thousands of beauties are like an army of amazons waiting to destroy any man who so ever should look unto your amazing beauty. oh so gorgeous my goddess of love that I stand for your loving torture, a cold shoulder for the stranger In me.
Goddess am I deserving of your love, your friendship, your mercy? Oh goddess of love.
Though my goddess may seem meek and friendly she is still a goddess, of her godhood she will never be stripped and herself she will protect from any man.
Will she appraise me and find me of good use?
Will my goddess appoint me as her archangel?
As an archangel at your disposal, your blade I will become exterminating all men who tarnish your beauties with their touches and thoughts of impurity, I will abolish all who oppose my goddess and her thousands of beauties, but it would seem i am destined to suffer at the hands of such a beauteous goddess of love, a torture I willfully accept.
