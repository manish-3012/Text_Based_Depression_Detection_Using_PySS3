I tried to hang myself with a belt last night, it broke.Personally, couldn't recommend. Pretty surreal out of body experience by the time I couldn't breathe and started convulsing, I didn't feel like me anymore. I expected my life to flash before my eyes or to feel regret or something though, instead it just felt like the life support system shutting down. This is more yelling into the void than a cry for help, but I don't know anymore. I don't want to tell anyone in real life because then I would have to change and try to overcome my problems, and I don't think I can. I guess it's only fitting that I fail in my suicide attempt as well. I don't feel brain damaged and my neck only has minor marks from the belt so things could have gone worse.
