I want to kill myself(16m)Alright.so I have been trying to meet people/make friends online because I find it hard to open up in person.
At first the converstation goes really well but then the person asks me what I look like and I send them a pic of myself then they unfriend me and block me o rsometimes reply with short responses like okay,okai or okey,ok and then they slowly stop talking to me....that happens most of the time....especially with girls
I have only heard a poisitve thing once. (you are cute ^^)

what am I doing wrong guys? that shit makes me want to kill myself.
is it my fault or what?.I dont think that they can be that rude......
