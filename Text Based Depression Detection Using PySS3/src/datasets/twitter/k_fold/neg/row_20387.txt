My life is not overHello everyone, I don't know why I am posting this.


I just feel that I need to let people know, I feel that if I don't I might not make it.

My life is not over, I fucked up, I really fucked up. I let everyone down, all the expectations of everyone I let them down.

But I don't live for everyone, I live for myself, I fucked up, my life is not going to go as planned, I might not be able to finish  university and get a degree.

But I can find a job, and follow my dream of being a writer.

I have a place to live so I am not going to be homeless. I can find a job to live with, it's not impossible.

My life isn't over. I can't keep standing at the edge of the roof, I can't keep looking up how to tie a noose, I can't have my mind wander every time I look at a knife.

My life is not over, How can I stop feeling like it is. I can't keep going like this.
