Am I crazy for believing it's all just a bad dream?I'm 17. I hate being alive. I deserve to die, I NEED to die. No brain like mine should ever exist. Everyone hates me. Everyone who sees me knows how fucked up I am. I had many falls and concussions as a kid, so maybe that's why my mind is so twisted. This is all just a sick joke, it has to be a nightmare. Maybe if I kill myself I'll wake up and be happy. I've started cutting, and it's helped for a while, but not much anymore. Maybe I need to cut deeper. Nothing feels real, it all feels floaty and blurry, like a dream. If this is fake, why am I even asking you all? I'm sorry.
