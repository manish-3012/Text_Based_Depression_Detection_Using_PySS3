I'm pretty much the definition of a terrible person.When I'm up this late at night all I can think about is all of the people that I've hurt over the years. The minuscule amount of good that I've done is completely dwarfed by the people I have made feel like shit. Every relationship I find myself in, I eventually break off for a completely selfish reason, and it ends up in another person completely destroying themselves emotionally. I can't remember the last time I went out of my way to do something truly good...little bullshit like holding doors and smiling at your cashier just absolutely doesn't count, and it infuriates me that the few people I have let get close to me take those tiny petty little things to mean that I am a decent person. Several years ago I struggled significantly with self injury with a bicep and forearm full of scars to prove it, and I feel like I'm on the verge of a relapse...I'm screaming to myself when I'm alone, I'm shaking uncontrollably unless I'm being touched...I've been through 3 or 4 therapists to try and fix whatever I am, and I'm supposed to start sessions with a new one this Saturday, but I know it's all bullshit and none of it is ever going to help.

My work is dead and I am finished. My music will never make a difference, I'll never be able to support a family, I'll never do anybody any good. What the shit is everyone keeping me around for.
