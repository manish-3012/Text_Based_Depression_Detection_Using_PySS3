Saying stuff Iâ€™ve never said before I dieDonâ€™t read this if youâ€™re here to help me. I donâ€™t want help. I donâ€™t want advice or kind words. I just want to be able to vent and say stuff I never got the chance to before I die. So please just help someone else. Thank you.

How the fuck am I still alive? I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d make it past 12. Somehow, against every single odd, Iâ€™m finally an adult. I barely made it through my last year of high school. How am I still here?

Iâ€™ve been taking antidepressants on and off for a year now. I just get too depressed to take them, like why do I deserve them? What did I ever do to be able to deserve happiness? I didnâ€™t do anything good, so why should I be rewarded with it. I finally was able to take them for a few solid weeks in a row now, and then they suddenly just stopped. Iâ€™m fucking depressed as hell now and I relapsed and cut myself for the first time in months. I canâ€™t even do it with a knife, I just use my house key or my nails. Thatâ€™s how much of a pussy I am. Imagine not even cutting yourself right.

I have lots of online friends that I know will miss me when Iâ€™m gone. I love them all and I hope they never find this message and have to read it. And I have a cat. Sheâ€™s my baby and I love her more than anything. I have a dad who will likely follow in my footsteps if I suck up the courage and actually do it. I have a mom who I havenâ€™t spoken to in months, I inherited my depression through her.

Iâ€™m a retard. I have autism. People like me are not needed in this world. Why the fuck should anyone waste more resources on a disabled freak like me? Iâ€™ve already taken so much oxygen and food and water to raise. I shouldnâ€™t have to take any more.

I just wish someone else could have been born to my family instead of me. Not my mom, but my dad and his fiancÃ©. Theyâ€™re such good, kind people. They deserve a happy child who isnâ€™t such a fuck-up. Anyone would love to be a part of this family. I wish I could just give this life to someone else who deserves it more than I do. Because now it seems itâ€™s just going to waste.

I fell in love with someone last year. Iâ€™ve never been able to experience emotion or truly form a connection with anyone. But he changed my entire life. I love him so deeply and I would do anything for him. Heâ€™s so perfect in literally every way but he never saw it. Heâ€™s suicidal like me. He never loved me, and he eventually just left and I havenâ€™t seen him for a long while. I always wished for his happiness whenever it was 11:11 or whenever I blew an eyelash. I hope heâ€™s happy where he is. If I could drain my happiness out of me before I die and donate to him, i would. 

My mom doesnâ€™t give a shit about me. She let some girl fucking assault me. She didnâ€™t rape me or anything but she still touched me. I hate her so much but I miss her so much too. I donâ€™t understand why I even care at all about her. I hated her before I finally moved out. I vowed never to see her or talk to her again. We talked so little when I lived with her that she would come to my room crying at night begging me to talk to her cus her girlfriend yelled at her again. And I just ignored her because she never fed me. Imagine ignoring your crying mother. Iâ€™m such a bad person. I deserve to die.

Am I even going to go through with it? I donâ€™t know. I feel much more level-headed than the other times I considered it, so I might actually do it. I donâ€™t know. The last time I tried I literally didnâ€™t kill myself because I FORGOT. Imagine forgetting to kill yourself. It was probably not going to work out anyway, it was a bad plan. Iâ€™d get my blood drawn to donate, and since Iâ€™d be lightheaded anyways hopefully the following overdose would be easier? I donâ€™t know. 

If you read all the way down to here... thank you. Please donâ€™t respond or comment. I donâ€™t want any help. I just wanted to say some things I never got to say when I was alive, even if no one will listen. I donâ€™t want advice or to get better. But thank you for reading this. Iâ€™m sorry to waste your time. But thank you again. Good bye.
