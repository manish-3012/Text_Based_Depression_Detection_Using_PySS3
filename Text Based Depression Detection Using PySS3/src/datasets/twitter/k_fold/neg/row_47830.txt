How should I tell my parents I am going to die.I posted this on advice, but unsurprisingly nobody gave a shit and like 2 people just replied telling me to go to the doctor. I figure you guys think about this stuff a lot and so might be able to help me.

Ive been depressed for &gt;10 years so im quite looking forward to dying to be honest, im just worried about my parents.


Iâ€™m fairly certain I have throat cancer. Ive been smoking unfiltered cannabis cigarettes with tobacco for like 10 years, ive been hoarse and had a lump on my throat for longer than 6 months. I donâ€™t care that I have cancer but im really worried about telling my parents. Theyâ€™re both depressed because they are in shitty financial situation since my dad had to stop working because of chronic back pain. One of out cats went missing and then was found dead several weeks later last year and they both fell to pieces and mourned the cat for weeks. I really donâ€™t want them to do anything stupid when I tell them but im worried they will. I feel terrible because I know this will ruin their lives. I havenâ€™t even been to the doctors because I am worried the doctor will tell them. Also I donâ€™t want to die in a hospital bed I want to die at home with my cats and I donâ€™t want to spend the last days I have where I can be active feeling shitty because chemo and I really donâ€™t want to spend the rest of my life with a hole in my throat, Iâ€™d rather be dead. Overall im ambivalent about dying which makes me feel even worse for doing this to my parents.

thanks for your help
