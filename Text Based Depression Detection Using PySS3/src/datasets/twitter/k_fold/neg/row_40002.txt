i keep thing about all the things i wonâ€™t get to doall the songs i wonâ€™t hear and the places i wonâ€™t go, the shows and comics iâ€™ll never get to finish. thereâ€™s so many things i still want to do but itâ€™s all so far away and not worth the monotony of working a stressful dead end job day after fucking day. if i was rich i wouldnâ€™t be killing myself but iâ€™m tired and i donâ€™t want to do this anymore. it doesnâ€™t get better for everyone and i donâ€™t want to keep doing this bullshit. iâ€™m so sad i love my cat so much i feel so guilty leaving him. i was trying to stay for him but i hope he can be happy and safe with someone else. i switch between feeling euphoric itâ€™s almost over and then calm acceptance and then like butterflies in my stomach. this is my last night i hope itâ€™s quick and painless
