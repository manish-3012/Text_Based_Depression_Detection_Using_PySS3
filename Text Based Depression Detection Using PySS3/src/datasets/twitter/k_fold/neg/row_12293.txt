I have no faith in people leftI feel alone in a world of people whose only interest is to use me and abuse me and show me I am worth noting. I will never be truly loved, I will never not be alone. I honestly hate every single person I see cause I am broken down so much and feel nothing but disgust towards others and myself.
I pump myself full of drugs and alcohol hoping I will accidentally cross the limit so I don't have the guilt of leaving my parents to live with what I've done.

But really in the end, after all is said and done, what do you have that is actually worth something if you are alone and unlovable and broken beyond repair.
I am truly not even alive anymore. I hope to destroy myself as much as my humanity was destroyed by others and life. Used and abused for others to feed their ego, never being seen beyond my body to who I am as a person or who I am really...eh
