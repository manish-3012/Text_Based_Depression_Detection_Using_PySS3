Why is pro suicide bad? Yes i read the psa but im still gonna ask.You affect those around you- yeah but all pain is temporary right? Besides you have to keep in mind that they arent the ones going day in and day out with that same pain.

You are just getting rid of a chance of a good life- There is always another side to that coin. I guess that depends on how confident you are and/or how lucky and/or how much support you truly have in order to make a logical choice. A well thought out Pros and Cons lists helps one understand that.

Theres always a better option- maybe, regardless though, at least for people with depression, that feeling will remain and return someday. That is the feeling we would like to avoid more than a shitty situation. 

I was told that this feeling will never go away, it will just come and go so why must someone go through it everyday?
