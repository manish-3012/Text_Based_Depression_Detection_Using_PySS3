Depressed all my life and I'm finally going to seek therapyI have struggled with depression on and off throughout my life, shitty jobs would push me over the edge.

I am suffering from ill health, suicide idealation and daily panic attacks due to stress from my job. I come home from work and cry everyday. 

Yesterday, I had enough. I packed up my belongings from my desk and walked out. I had a look at my finances and I can afford to be jobless for a while. I'm going to seek therapy from my GP on Monday and perhaps ask him to sign me off sick for my week's notice.

I was hesitant to quit without another job in line, but I can't take another day of work and a shitty minimum wage temp job isn't worth ending my life over.
