I should have tried harder the first time.I keep thinking how I should have tried harder the first time I tried to kill myself. It was a pathetic attempt, but I didn't really know how to effectively do it. I should have tried harder. I wouldn't be here or be in the situations I'm in if I just fucking tried harder the first time. The only thing keeping me right now are my dogs, because I don't want them to end up at the shelter. 

I should be have fucking tried harder the first time.
