i tried to hang myself in the woods todaytook me hours to find a good tree with a low branch. got cuts on my hands from trying to climb it. got a hard cable fastened and the noose was easy enough.
 couldn't drop myself so i basically just tiptoed for a while trying to suffocate myself. after that i got really angry and climbed the highest i could and then just jumped with the noose around my neck. 
it sort of worked. hung like an idiot for a couple of minutes then just sort of fell asleep.
woke when my feet touched the ground.
went home because i had to take a shit.

yay failure
