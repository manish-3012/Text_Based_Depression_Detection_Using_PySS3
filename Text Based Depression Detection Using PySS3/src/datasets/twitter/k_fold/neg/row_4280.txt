Obviously I'm not suited for my job.I've only been working at my job for a week and a half. I was late to a training session, missed a staff meeting, and accidentally scheduled myself to work on the days I have night classes. Now I need to figure out how to switch shifts for 6 different nights but none of my coworkers are answering my texts. My supervisor probably hates me.

I'm not suicidal right now, but I'm really panicked and feel like another screw up would push me over the edge. I'm trying really hard not to cry. This job was already something I was stressed about because it's something way outside my comfort zone. I have an anxiety disorder and social anxiety and this job requires a LOT of socializing and event planning.

It doesn't help that all of my coworkers seem to be really close already and text and hang out outside of work. As always, I'm the odd one out. I've never fit in or belong anywhere; I feel like people just tolerate me. And I know this screw up is only going to make everyone see me even more poorly.
