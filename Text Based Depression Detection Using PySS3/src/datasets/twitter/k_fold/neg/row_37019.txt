i cant do this anymore lolol :)since the age of 12 iâ€™ve battled with a lot of mental health issues and itâ€™s greatly impacted my life. but it never truly impacted me until now. itâ€™s silly to think i would end my life over a relationship, it is pretty silly tbh. but i canâ€™t stand it anymore. i was in a toxic abusive relationship with my ex and it traumatized me so badly. i have a new partner now but the flashbacks from what my ex did always come back. i always fear they will do the same to me. i fear that they will hurt me and break me completely like my ex did. and bc of this, i lash out on them even though i know they would never hurt me. iâ€™m just afraid of being hurt the way i was. i feel like such a burden to them. they deserve better. i donâ€™t want to continue to cause pain or misery to anyone, whether it be my partner, my friends, or my family. i am tired of being a burden. i am absolutely exhausted. iâ€™m currently debating chugging this entire bottle of advil. who knows how that will end...
