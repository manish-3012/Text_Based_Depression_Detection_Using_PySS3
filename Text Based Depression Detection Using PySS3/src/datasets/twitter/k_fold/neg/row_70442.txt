My Understanding of LifeIâ€™ve often been told that Iâ€™m very intelligent. My IQ has been measured to be around 160 - 170, but even then Iï¸ canâ€™t remember the most basic of information given to me. Anyway, Life. 

Iï¸ used to be this happy kid, always smiling and running around, full of joy. Iï¸ have no personal recollection of this but apparently Iï¸ was one of the most happiest kids in the world according to my parents. That changed when Iï¸ was young. Apparently Iï¸ came running, crying (the first time theyâ€™ve actually ever seen me cry) to them. This actually was my first conscious thought. My mom said that she doesnâ€™t know what happened, no one does. And itâ€™s been since this time that Iï¸ havenâ€™t been happy. This was when Iï¸ was maybe three years old, maybe less. 

Iï¸ am currently a sophomore in High School. My marks are good, and Iâ€™m actually kind of popular if not to sound a bit â€œcockyâ€ but Iï¸ have plenty of â€œfriendsâ€ and lots of people know me. In 8th grade, thatâ€™s when it really hit me. Iï¸ was just always depressed, Iï¸ didnâ€™t do any homework or study or anything related to school. Iï¸ just gave up, simply put. Iï¸ stopped believing in God. Iï¸ just gave up. It was that summer that Iï¸ attempted suicide for the first time, only for someone to call my parents and send me to the hospital before Iï¸ actually could. 

Iï¸ guess what Iâ€™m trying to get at is not that Iï¸ want help. Iï¸ donâ€™t want to be alive. At all in fact. Iï¸ find joy in thinking that Iï¸ will die someday, and even more joy in thinking that it could happen at any minute. All Iï¸ want to get across is that, Iâ€™m decently smart. Iï¸ understand a lot more than people give me credit for, on accordance with me not speaking much. And with that Iï¸ can give the answer to why smart people usually seem to be the ones to want to end it all. Itâ€™s because we realize that nothing matter more than anyone. There is no God, no afterlife, no meaning. We understand it, and when it comes into our minds that weâ€™re so meaningless, we often break down. Life isnâ€™t worth living, but itâ€™s the people that are in your life that make it worth living. For me, however, thereâ€™s not really anyâ€¦

Thank you for reading if youâ€™ve gotten this far.
