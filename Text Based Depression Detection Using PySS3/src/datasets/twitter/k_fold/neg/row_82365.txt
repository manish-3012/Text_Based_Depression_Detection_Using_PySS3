It feels like it is just harder to continue than to dieUpdate: I got into a place where I was only thinking about my mistakes and what is bad about me, but now I am feeling alright.


I have been losing weight for the past couple years, and I'm 60 down, but I still hate how I look and most things about myself. I've had a pretty bad semester last, and I was doing alright so far until my math teacher just gave me a 0 for reading a book after turning in the test, and I don't have any friends and I feel like nobody really likes me, only being nice for nice sake. I just want to stop existing because nothing is good right now and I want to ask for some support please because I just can't stop crying
