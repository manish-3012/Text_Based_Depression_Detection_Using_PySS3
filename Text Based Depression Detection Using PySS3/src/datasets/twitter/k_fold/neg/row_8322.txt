Itâ€™s getting to be too much.I am in Highschool and the immense amount of stress Iâ€™m feeling lately is starting to get to me. 

My father died a few years back and it still affects me to this day. My sister, who is my best friend, has been diagnosed with multiple mental disorders, as well as anorexia. She has been in and out of mental hospitals and treatment facilities. As the only guy in my house, I have to stay strong to support my family.

My girlfriend is super stressful. I love her so much, but she puts so much stress on me. She complains about everything and when I try to help her she pushes all of my opinions away. Sheâ€™s never happy and itâ€™s hard to see someone you love so much like that. 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
