what's up folks I wanna die!I turn 21 at the end of the month and nothing is keeping me here anymore. Someone purposely broke my glasses earlier this week and I fucking hate my university. Most of my friends only speak to me when they need therapy/want me to edit their papers/need school help. My relationship with my "summer boyfriend" is weird as fuck and I'm too afraid to address it with him, which is stressing me out! I don't know my grades in any of my courses and I've completely lost the desire to even try at this point. I could take all my promethazine and not wake up tomorrow. Jesus christ, I'm fucking exhausted.
