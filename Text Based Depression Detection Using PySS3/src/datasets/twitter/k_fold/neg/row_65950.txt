I'm thinking of the right time and oppurtunity to commit suicideOkay, I really don't care if my friends or family miss me anymore. I just wanna die. Life has become so unmotivating and directionless. Everyone tells me I should do what I want to do, that life is what we make of it, but I have no clue what to do or what to make of it. Whatever's been motivated me before, is now gone. I know I can, but I don't want to go on any longer. Right now, I'm just thinking of a good easy way to commit suicide without people or things getting blamed. No, the only one to blame for my situation is myself. Nobody else.
