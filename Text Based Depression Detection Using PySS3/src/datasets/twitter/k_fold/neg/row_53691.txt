LifeI don't know but I am just anxious and depressed all the time at this point it feels like it will never go away. It almost feels like life is just trying to put me through hell all the time. The feelings that I face on a daily basis is just not fucking right. What did I do to deserve the pain I am in now. I keep telling myself things get better but no fucking shit is happening.  I am trapped from two sides, it's like there's no hope. Fuc life man
