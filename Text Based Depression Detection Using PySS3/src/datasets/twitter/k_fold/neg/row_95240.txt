I just failed an attempt and Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m aliveI tried this suicide method I saw on this website and I passed out within seconds of trying it. Next thing I knew, my rope had somehow come undone, and I was on the floor. I did dream something but I canâ€™t remember what. 

I feel like something weird happened, because I put the end of the rope around a closet uh, pole thingy, ya know, that thing that holds hangers? I put the rope around that and started hanging myself. 

Thereâ€™s no way it couldâ€™ve come undone, and yet, it did. Except the rope was still around my neck, just not on the pole thing. Like someone had taken it off while I was unconscious and then left me there.

Iâ€™m not sure if I should be angry or sad.

Should I tell people about this quick and painless method? 

Should I just try again?

Did an angel just save me?

Do you guys have any thoughts?
