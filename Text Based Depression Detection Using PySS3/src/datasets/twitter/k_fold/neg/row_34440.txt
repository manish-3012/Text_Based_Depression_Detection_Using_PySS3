I have a good reason to commit suicide.19 years old.

My life has never really been great. I've had suicidal thoughts and made attempts before but now I feel like I have no other choice but to end my life or face the hellish consequences that await me when people know what I did during my early teen years. It was something I regretted immediately after I did it. Every single day since then has been a pain not only because of guilt but also because of what's going to happen to my social life when this becomes known. There's no way to undo or solve this. What's ahead of me is a dead end and nothing more.

I must end my life.
