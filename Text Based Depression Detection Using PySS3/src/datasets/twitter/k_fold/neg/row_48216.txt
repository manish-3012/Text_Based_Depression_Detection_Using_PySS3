I'm done. I'm just so done with this.I found out today that the IRS is taking all of my tax return. I have no way to pay my car insurance. It can't be fixed either. A technicality and I made a mistake a few years ago. I have no way to pay for my insurance. For our food. For my kids' birthdays. I can't even get their $50 bunk beds. I can't find a job either. My husband is working as much as they will let him and I've been looking for a job for years. I'm not picky. I just have to be able to work when he is home to watch the kids. 

I have nothing. I've ruined my college. I just don't care and I don't do the work. I just want to crawl in a hole and never come out again. I've gained even more weight. I'm worthless. I don't even want to kill myself. I just want our family to die together. I don't want my kids to hurt by losing me. And I could never hurt them. But if a semi hit our car on the road and killed us all we might be better for it. 

I've failed them. I've failed at life.
