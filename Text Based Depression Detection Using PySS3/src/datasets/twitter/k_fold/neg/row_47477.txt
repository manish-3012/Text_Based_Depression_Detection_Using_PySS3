I gave up on my selfI just found this sub and I really need to put my thoughts out and there isnâ€™t anyone I can talk to, so here I am.

As the title suggests, I gave up on my self. I feel shitty all the time because I genuinely donâ€™t have confidence in my abilities or anything I do. It seems like EVERY time I try to believe in myself I just fail myself. Whether itâ€™s some kind of mental self sabotage or what, I donâ€™t know. I just keep fucking up and and failing. Whether it was high school, college, basic training, back shops I had to work and now my 8 month training course I just keep embarrassing myself and displaying a shocking level of incompetence I didnâ€™t want to accept I had. 

I donâ€™t know when it started, but the last couple of years the way my mind talks to itself has been absolutely negative. Anytime Iâ€™m not distracted by work or entertainment or a conversation my mind falls back on reminding myself how idiotic and incompetent I am at everything I do. I only ever go by my last name anymore and I can regularly hear someone say â€œDammit [my last name]â€  when I fuck up, say or do something stupid, which is a lot. I have completely disgraced my family name with my constant stupidity and I hate hearing my name said because I just expect to be called out on something I did wrong.

People around me only expect me to fuck up. No one really trusts me to do anything right because I canâ€™t seem to do anything right. Twice now I was told to get out of a vehicle so someone else could back it into a parking bay because Iâ€™m trusted so little. And I donâ€™t completely blame them. Iâ€™m pissed off at the thought of it, but I actually understand why. Could you imagine that level of respect on a daily basis? 

With that, I came to the conclusion about two years ago I should not be alive. Iâ€™m not mad at anyone specifically but myself. I reasoned that with the track record I have with work, my daily displays of idiocy, my poor physique, and lack of basic comprehension skills that Iâ€™m either retarded or just that fucking stupid. One is a mental problem I hate and the other canâ€™t really be fixed. I am disgusted by myself. I squandered everything my parents worked so hard to set up for me, I am a parasite. I have no skills. I struggle to learn basic skills. And for other reasons I donâ€™t want to go into I just really really hate myself. I donâ€™t want to be alive. I wish I would fucking drop dead.

I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I donâ€™t want a heaven or hell or reincarnation or any of that. I donâ€™t want to sleep or be in a void, I just want to turn myself off. I want my story closed, to end. Iâ€™m ready to just stop existing; I wish I never had.

Thing is, I canâ€™t do that to my family. My father would fall apart and my mom would not be strong enough to cope while dealing with my dad. My brother wouldnâ€™t understand and probably never would. None of them know a damn thing about any of this. In their mind Iâ€™m just their Air Force son doing his part to keep America safe. Iâ€™m bad with women and I donâ€™t like working out. I have a plan to keep 10k to my name by the end of the year. Thatâ€™s the image. I canâ€™t tell them whatâ€™s really going on with me because theyâ€™ll blame themselves or beg me to get help, plan out a path for me or whatever. But I canâ€™t face them as the idiot failure I am on full display. I tried to do hard to make them proud but Iâ€™m just too fucking stupid to do that. Iâ€™m too fucking stupid to make them proud. And I canâ€™t tell them that.

Like I said, I really fucking hate myself. I regularly have thoughts of graphic self harm. The main one is just shooting myself up the chin out the top of my head. Sometimes I think of cutting parts off myself as some kind of penance. Or every time I embarrass my name I cut a sliver of skin to force myself to do better. Itâ€™s probably important now to tell you I have never so much as cut myself. Itâ€™s all just been thoughts. Not only have I never hurt myself in that kind of manner, unexplained cuts and bruises would not sit well with or go unnoticed with the people I work with for 8-12 hours a day in a sleeveless shirt and usually end a day with being sore and covered in dirt and grime. You wouldnâ€™t willingly hurt your leg then go into a marathon even if you didnâ€™t expect to win. 

I honestly donâ€™t know how well I explained this. Iâ€™m not good at writing or expressing my thoughts. But I want to explain I donâ€™t blame anyone but my self for my problems. My idiocy, failures, and reputation of incompetence is mine alone. Itâ€™s all my fault for what Iâ€™ve done. Itâ€™s my fault for the life I lead. Itâ€™s my fault I squandered my parents set up for my future. Itâ€™s my fault Iâ€™m useless. Itâ€™s my fault Iâ€™m an embarrassment. Itâ€™s my fault I am this way. Itâ€™s my fault I donâ€™t know how to stop fucking up my life. Itâ€™s my fault Iâ€™m so stupid. Itâ€™s my fault I donâ€™t know how to not be a total fucking incompetent dumbass piece of shit. I want to take responsibility for it, but I donâ€™t see a future in which I fix this. I donâ€™t see how to help myself. All I can think of is to rid myself of me. I donâ€™t want to be alive, but thereâ€™s too many people Iâ€™ll hurt by taking my own life. I just wish someone would kill me and fucking end this joke of a man.
