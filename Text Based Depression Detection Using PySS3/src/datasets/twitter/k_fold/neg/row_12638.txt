I'm 19 and a university student. I made some stupid choices and now am afraid that it might be too late. Pls help, suicide hotline has disconnected 3 times and i have no where else to turn toI come from a well respected and highly qualified family. I've had really high expectations since childhood. After coming to university, i became scared and anxious that I might not get into med school as I had hoped and as my family had expected. I started failing courses and became severely depressed.I come from a very religious hindu family and no one in my family tolerates liquor or drugs. I was depressed, stressed, and scared of my future. No matter how hard I tried, i couldnt focus and work. I couldnt tell my parents as they would have cut me off. I started doing drugs (marijuana and MDMA) to try and help the depression and the suicidal thoughts. I lied to my friends and family and I hate myself. 

It's a pain having to look in the mirror and convince myself to stay alive. At the same time, if I died, my parents and sister would be devastated. I am 2 days away from finals, am afraid of failing out. If I fail, I will die, and I can't study without focus, and I can't focus without having to get this off my chest. I love my family and don't want to hurt them, at the same time, I can't bear to see the sadness in their eyes if I do fail.

I called suicide hotline 3x and they disconnected each time. 
Pls help
