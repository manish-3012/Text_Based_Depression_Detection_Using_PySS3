Suicidal thoughts because of the social anxiety and lonelinessI'm 18 years old. Since the beginning of high school, I've liked one of my classmate. I was afraid to talk to her, even to become friends. I thought it was normal.

When schools were closed because of the coronavirus, I started thinking a lot about her. I've read a lot of crush stuff. I also started to write about it in other forums and ask for advice. After many discussions, I have drawn some conclusions, including the most important one - girls do not like boring people. So those who don't have friends and interests/hobbies.

It hurt me the most, because I've always been the type of shy boy who has no close friends or specific hobbies. I always hid it from myself, I lived in the awareness that I was so comfortable. I was afraid to admit that my shyness and asociality is something that is abnormal.

Hearing that younger people already had sex and I didn't even hugged a girl in my life, seeing a group of young people on a bicycle having a great time or two happy people holding hands, slowly bursting something in me. I realized that because of my mental problems I'm an outcast and worthless.

Since then, I want to say goodbye to this world. I can't establish deeper human relations, I can't find a girlfriend or friends, my life is limited to sitting in my own room. I'm useless in society. I don't see the point of continuing to live, is it worth it if I don't see any chance to change.
