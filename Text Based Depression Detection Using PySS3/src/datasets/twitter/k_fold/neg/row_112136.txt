Lifestyle obsession.Do you ever feel that way ? Healthy people suck, they just can't face the truth. I don't know when it started, probably a decade ago or something, and i feel like no one gets it or thinks about it, but the healthy eating and lifestyle industry has taken over western society in a way that i find ridiculously depressing and stupid. You know what i'm talking about, don't smoke, don't drink, exercise, eat healthy. To me it's another way to brainwash kids into making them think that the healthy lifestyle, a house, a car, a respectable job and healthy food is the key to happiness. These people can't face the truth. I really feel like the hypocrisy of the modern normal lifestyle has increased and everyone accepts it. People used to joke about anti smoking ads. Now there are like millions of unnecessary studies about the food you shouldn't eat, and tons of really little stupid things like that. It's so ridiculous to me and i'm really alienated by it. These people spend their life trying to look like a lifestyle commercial ad. They are boring and they suck. Lifestyle obsession. Great, i'm now 100 years old, and still healthy. They just can't face the fucking reality. Their naivety makes me wanna puke. People starving their asses off in jungles and A students who at 25 realize how much their life sucks and that having a house and a respectable job couldn't be further from happiness. They told you were going to be a winner, and material possessions are the only thing you got.
