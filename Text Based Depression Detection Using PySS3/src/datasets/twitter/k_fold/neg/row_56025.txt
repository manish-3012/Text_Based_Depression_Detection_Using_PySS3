I should be writing the essays due for my class tomorrowBut instead Iâ€™m sitting in a Michaels parking contemplating how I should take my life. 
Iâ€™m so tired of being alive.

I just needed to get this off my chest. I have no one to talk to. I donâ€™t know if this is even the right sub for this because it isnâ€™t an actual plan or a note, so Iâ€™m sorry and Iâ€™ll delete it if this is wrong. I just needed to say it without someone calling the police or my parents.
