Tired of always being alone.As the title says the loneliness of my life has been causing me some pretty dark thoughts lately.  I want to change things but I donâ€™t even really know how at this point. Iâ€™m 38 and I have never even been in love or got to feel someone in truly in love with me. I have dated a few girls in my life, some for even moderate lengths of time. But those that seemed really into me I just didnâ€™t feel the same for and those that I really started to feel something for never felt it for me. 

I have gone through depression pretty much my whole life. But it normally is much more in the background than it is right now. It constantly causes me to doubt myself and my value but I do manage to live a fairly normal life. I donâ€™t connect well to many people at the best of times and when things get darker for me I tend to push those I have formed a bond with away.  And with this pandemic what few social interactions and safety net I did have in my life feel like they have been stripped away. 

Now I sit here starting another weekend and again no one calls or messages me. I feel completely alone. I know Iâ€™m responsible for how my life ended up and I do want it to change but I just donâ€™t know how or where to start.  I donâ€™t want to end up hurting myself but I have thought about doing it constantly for weeks now.
