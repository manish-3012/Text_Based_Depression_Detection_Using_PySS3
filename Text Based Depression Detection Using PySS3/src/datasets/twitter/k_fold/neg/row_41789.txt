I have a completed plan. Now it's just matter of when.I know it'll be soon.
I'm just too tired.

I have an therapist apointment coming in two days. Have to see if that helps, probably not. I'm gonna go right after. 
No waiting after that.

I went 6 years without help, and now when I finally have help they can't even do their jobs.
