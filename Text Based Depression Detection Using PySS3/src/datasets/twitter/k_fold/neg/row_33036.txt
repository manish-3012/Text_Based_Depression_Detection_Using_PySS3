Is she doesn't pay me back I'll kill myselfToday is the day where I have to shit away all the money I've earned and worked for. Basically my mom is a piece of shit I have no choice but to pay her debt because its either that or we all get evicted.

 I don't have anywhere else to go. She always says she'll pay me back but the money she owes me just keeps getting higher and higher.  

I feel so empty.
