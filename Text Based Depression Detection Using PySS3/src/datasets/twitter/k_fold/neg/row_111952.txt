i cant do it anymorei told my friends, my boyfriend, and my mom that i was tired of living. and they care, but i know that they would get over it. and iâ€™ve been taught all my life that suicide is selfish, but i just canâ€™t hold on anymore. the pain is too much. iâ€™ve never wanted to kill myself more than i do tonight. i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™m scared, but iâ€™m also ready. iâ€™ve tried everything to stop feeling this way, or avoid this outcome, but nothing has worked. i think itâ€™s my time. just venting
