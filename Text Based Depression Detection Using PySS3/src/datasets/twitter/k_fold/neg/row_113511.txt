I feel bad for thisI know a lot of people have the issue that they feel like nobody cares and that's horrible but I'm the opposite. I wish that nobody gave a shit about me. I don't want to be here and the only reason I am is because I have a family that cares about me. If I could make them care about someone who needs and deserves it instead of me I would do it in a heartbeat.
