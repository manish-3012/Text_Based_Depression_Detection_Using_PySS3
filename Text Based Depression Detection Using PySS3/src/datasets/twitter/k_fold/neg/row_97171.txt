A story to tellWell start this off with my age my location and the problems I'm having. I'm 14 turning 15 in march, I live in California. To start off my story I've always been a troubled kid always going to doctors for medicine ADHD/depression ect ect. Around 12 I got into dnm's the first thing I did was finess a vendor off tmg out of a sheet of tabs. Completely ruined my brain off those tabs and bars. I'm still a drug dealer at the moment. I have hppd hardcore ear ringing ect ect (people who have it understand the mind fuck it is) after all the acid I calmed down around 13 (ego death trips at least 10 or them blew the the sheet in a month alone) and finally realized how fried my brain was I was smoking blunts at 12 I wasn't thinking I was a kid with demons inside me I needed to escape. Got into the dealing scene when I was 12 still sell bars to this day (s/o ak) I've had many attempts at trying to stay clean actually sneaking xan liquid into a pshych ward. Everything's been a struggle I've been on homeschool forever since 3-4th grade. My dopamine is completely gone I'm taking 5-10 bars just to function or else I lay in bed all day. So I've decided I've had enough of this and I'm buying a 45 and just gonna put it up to my head and end it. I've sinned so many times in my life I don't deserve to live. Gang related ect ect. That's just my story of being addicted to benzos hardcore from 12-15 10-50mg daily. Overdosed once on accident but hey I'm here. I've decided on my birthday in March but this post isn't for attention just to let people know some people really do struggle out here. Regularly do coke only did meth once there's not a drug you can say I haven't done. Well maybe crack but yea that's my story. 



TLTR

Sad story about a kid who fucked up hardcore with drugs. If you call bullshit go fuck off because I don't care this is my story.

Doubt anybody could convince me to not end it but who knows. If your wondering how I get guns at my age is because gangsters ain't social workers.
