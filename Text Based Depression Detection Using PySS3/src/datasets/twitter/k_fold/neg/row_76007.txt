*URGENT* Got a potentionally active suicide riskI have a good friend who may or may not be writing a suicide note at this very moment and I dont know where he lives. The guy is diagnosed with clinical deppression. I just want advice on who I should call to get him the help he needs. Im not about to post any private information to reddit but all I can say is that this guy lives in London and I live in Sweden. I have another friend I can contact on a moments notice to get better info (atleast where he lives and probably a phone number aswell).  

It's not likely that he'll kill himself but I'm not going to take a risk and have someone i care about die because of my lack of action.
