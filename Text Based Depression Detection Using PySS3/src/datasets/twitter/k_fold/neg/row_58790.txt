The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I have my 13 month old daughter with meI just feel like I'm drowning.  I'm just so tired of working hard and not getting anywhere. I know I can make a better life financially for my daughter if I kill myself and she'll be well cared for. I just don't want to damage her. Someone please help. I'm so tired.
