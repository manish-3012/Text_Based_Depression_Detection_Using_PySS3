So I am going to hang myself, have it tied and ready to go.I've tied a hangman's noose today. I used a rope that'll definitely hold me. I also tested the noose under the pressure I could apply with one hand pulling and nearly blacked out within 10 seconds, so that surprised me, I was expecting much longer. When tied right I suppose they work really well. I held some air in my lungs so I'd pass out from the loss of blood to the brain instead of suffering from CO2 building up with my lungs with lack of oxygen. I should be well unconscious and dead by both in no time at all. I have somewhere to hang it as well. Ready in my room right now. I was going to try and get the materials for a proper exit bag, but yeah broke af and... hanging will go quickly enough. I'm not worried if there is pain even by this point, and I feel like I'd rather do it like this then a drop-hang where my spinal cord snaps even though that would be quicker I guess. My life, yeah, not worth living through this pain. Life is beyond being fixed or mended for me. I really have tried. Really wish I could explain this better, I don't know why I came here to type this for people I don't know. I just don't feel like I have anyone so I have to let someone know.
