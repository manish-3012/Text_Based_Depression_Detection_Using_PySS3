I canâ€™t stop remembering the time i was molested/rapedI donâ€™t really think itâ€™s gotten to the point of hallucinations like a lot of my other problems evolve into which Iâ€™m pretty thankful for... but still Iâ€™d have rather not remembered this. 

I didnâ€™t really start remembering it until about a week and a half to two weeks ago (Iâ€™d remembered small bits a few months ago, but nothing of the level it is now). The original memories were just touching, until 4 days ago. I got memories of my dad forcing me to give him oral sex. I couldnâ€™t stop thinking of it and still canâ€™t. A day ago I remembered another time. 

I think... well, more **hope** that those were the only times.

As well as having a friend who was raped when she was younger Iâ€™m scared to tell her of these memories, in fear that she may think Iâ€™m lying or just trying to â€œ*copy*â€ her issues...
