Thank You and Good ByeI appreciate everyone on here trying to help out.  It's nice to know that there are people out there who care.

I have ultimately decided that it is the best course of action to take my own life.  I have battled depression in different stages of my life and have begun to realize that no matter the situation or how good things are, that this way of thinking will come to haunt me again and again.  I can't continue to go through it.  I feel like my mind is deteriorating.  My relationships with people are becoming strained because of all my withdrawals and all of my negativity.  

My home is not a home anymore - it is a trap.  It doesn't matter what I've done, the feeling comes flooding back when I shut the door to my room.  The thoughts are there and they begin to take over.

In the end, my existence doesn't matter.  I will hurt people, but they will heal.  Better that they know me as the better person I once was than to watch me become this mess that isn't me.  I don't want to be a burden to other people.  They can't help me anyways.

Fate is pulling me down this path and I realize that maybe fighting it is futile.  I will let things go and embrace the unknown.

Thank you for listening.
