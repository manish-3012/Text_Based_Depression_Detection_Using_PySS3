Can anyone offer some distractions right now?Iâ€™m just at a loss. Itâ€™s 3am where I am and I canâ€™t sleep. I think if I had any sort of pills Iâ€™d try take them all, so itâ€™s good that I donâ€™t. But I canâ€™t stop thinking about it, and Iâ€™m at a loss of how to distract myself until I (hopefully) fall asleep. I usually browse reddit and that works well enough but my mind is in overdrive. Please help if you can think of anything. Thank you.
