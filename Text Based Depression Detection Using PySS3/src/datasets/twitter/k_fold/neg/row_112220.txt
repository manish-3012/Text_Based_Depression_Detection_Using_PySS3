I just want to die, right now...Iâ€™m just tired of everything, I hate who I am, Iâ€™m doing terrible in school, my parents are just unfair, I donâ€™t want to have the future my parents want me to have (which is some Olympic champion, I want to be a YouTuber or Scientist, but itâ€™s simply too hard and I donâ€™t think I can do it). I donâ€™t know why I should have to keep going through all this stupid sh*t, for what? To hate my life even more? Just kill me now, please
