What is the process for finding a doc/psychiatrist?I have severe anxiety/depression. I started going to therapy and it made things so much worse. She recommended to look into medications which I would never consider but I feel that it is my last option.

I donâ€™t have a physician or doctor to go to as I havenâ€™t been to the doctor in over 10 years. What is the process for finding the best person to prescribe me meds? I donâ€™t know who to talk to or what to do.
