I Hate Being Dependent on My ParentsI wish I could fucking do shit on my own. Then I wouldn't need to ask for stuff from my parents, like a ride or food. I can't wait to grow up because I'll finally be free from them, have a job, live on my own, maybe have some shit figured out. They're not terrible parents but they are so stifling and I know I'm an awful person but it annoys me so much. I never say anything though, because when I try I get shut down. Today my mom tried to force me to talk to her, which I do usually anyways, but I was feeling really depressed so I told her I was tired and didn't want to talk. She has specifically told me in the past, if I didn't want to, she would understand and let me be. This time she exploded at me, yelling about how I never appreciated anything she did and how ungrateful I was that she drove me everywhere, made me dinner, stuff like that. I don't ask her for that, I would rather drive myself and pay for shit and eat dinner with friends or myself. Ugh. I just stayed silent because I didn't want to make it worse, but I've never wanted to yell at her more than in that moment. I hate being a teenager. Maybe I'm too selfish though.
