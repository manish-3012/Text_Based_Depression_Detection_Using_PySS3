Suicidal Thoughts over JobI was called into a meeting today and was told that I was close to being fired for not meeting sales goals. I really do not have any confidence in myself to meet meet my sales goals so I know I am going to fail and will be fired. I cannot stand the thought of such a failure and have been thinking of suicide. I think suicide would be a better option than being labeled a failure.
