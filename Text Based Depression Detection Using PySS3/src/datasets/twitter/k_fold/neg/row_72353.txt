Drinking Acetone TonightYOU DONT HAVE TO READ THIS. I've posted here about 6 months ago had about 3 hospitalizations during the summer. Was put on anti depressants as well as anti psychotics things were finally falling into place. Up until last month i had stopped my medications in November and I'm now seeing the side effects of that everything is coming back. Therapy doesn't do shit for me because im so boring i never have anything to talk about at all.  I haven't seen my therapist in 3 weeks. I had decided to kill myself on 2/16/18 but the method im choosing i don't have enough money to do it im only 16 and unemployed
 So I've decided to kill myself using what i have around the house. I've moved the date up to the first Friday in february. I've decided to drink nail polish remover or acetone or whatever you call it. Ive been doing a lot of research on it. I'm not looking for sympathy. But i guess i just want to document the days leading up to my suicide. I had written suicide notes 6 months ago and recently found them and read them but this time will be different i wont leave a damn thing. They knew.
