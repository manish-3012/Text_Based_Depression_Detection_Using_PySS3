I don't know who to talk toI was just managing before but in the last week it's got worse. The depression and suicidal thoughts hiding in the back of my brain suddenly feel more real than before, like there's an end in sight and I can gradually feel myself slipping away day by day. I've never self harmed. I don't have a plan for killing myself. But it's as if I'm being pulled under water and I'm about to let go. I don't know who to talk to.
