I am ready to die.I feel like for every 1 step forward I fall 8 steps back. I am at the point that the thought of ending my life just seems so peaceful and would remove all the weight from my shoulders.

My life is just full of missed opportunities and regrets. Whenever I try to do something to chance that then something goes wrong and I end up back where I was.
