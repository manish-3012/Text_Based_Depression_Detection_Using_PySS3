Itâ€™s too easy to grab the Benadryl and be done. Fall asleep and someone finds me in the morning when itâ€™s too late.I didnâ€™t even know I liked him that much but he ended things with me today. I know exactly how I can just end it and it would be so easy. I hate opening up and being intimate for this exact reason, but I donâ€™t want there to be even another chance.
