I actually feel glad that my life has been an absolute disaster, because that way I know that by killing myself I'm not wasting anything valuableMany people have a period of their lives that they want to go back to, "the golden days", when things were still right. They miss those times.

Many people have a period of their lives where things started to go wrong, the bad times. They can identify a certain period of time when their lives went from acceptable to insufferable, when "they went off the rails" and lost control of their lives.

In my case, I have never been on the rails. There has never been a single period of my life where I had my shit together. There are no "golden days" for me, I was always like this.

I just happened to withstand it for years and years instead of committing suicide already because I was so incredibly numb and empty-minded that I never felt the impulse to do anything. There was nothing inside my skull, just silence and numbness.

And know I have come to my full senses, and realized only suicide can free me. There is nothing I can do to live a happy life after all that I have done wrong. I don't want to see my next birthday, I want to die as quick as possible.
