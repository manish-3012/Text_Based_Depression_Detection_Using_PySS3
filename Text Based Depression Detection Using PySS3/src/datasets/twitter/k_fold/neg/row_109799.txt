It's happening in a week now, wasn't supposed to be like thisI have a suicide date that always changes. It started with waiting a year at a time. Something would happen and I would make the date only 10 months away from where I was. It's fluctuated between 2-5 months for a while. But a lot has happened and I've shortened it down to a week this time.


To keep it relatively short, I have a habit of setting myself on fire to keep others warm. I gave up my dreams to live at home to help my dysfunctional family. I forced myself to get a degree I didn't want with a horrible gpa to show for it. I never got the counseling I needed for the sexual abuse I suffered from my youth but was responsible for taking care of my younger sibling's appointments for mental health later on. My immune system was compromised, my general health went to shit, and I don't have the money to keep up with the doctor visits or prescriptions. I helped my boyfriend get a good job I applied to recently and really wanted. I still haven't received a call after the last interview, pretty sure I'm out of the running now.


I've had a bad experience with the suicide hotlines and don't have the courage to reach out anymore. No one close to me cares to listen or talk to me seriously. I used to be so strong but now I'm so emotional and cry everyday. I don't want to kill myself but I feel like dying. I have the method, date, and time and I know I'm going to go through with it. I can't tell if this is my note goodbye or if its my last ditch effort to find someone who cares just a little bit.


If you know who I am and happen to find this, it might be too late. I love you and I'm sorry for everything. I tried my best.
