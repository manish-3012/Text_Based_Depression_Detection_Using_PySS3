I've had my run.I'm done with this. 

I'm broke beyond belief, hungry and can't seem to find enjoyment in anything anymore. Life is a constant drag for me. I want to speak about it with someone but someone close to us just died and I don't want to look like I'm just seeking attention. 

I'm done with this. The pain inside is constantly eating away at me. I need some relief. 

I'm sorry, I've tried to make the best out of my shot at this world and have failed miserably. I'm sorry. I guess I'm about to cross that bridge.
