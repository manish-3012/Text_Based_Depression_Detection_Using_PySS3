I feel like a failure...(I'm 20, in college, still supported by my parents)

I have everything. I have beauty, smarts, friends, family, love, people who WANT me, material items like clothes and a car, and most importantly I have my health. Why would anyone like me feel the need to end her life? Sure, I have a bubbly personality. No one would expect that Iâ€™m being troubled by god knows what. I wear a smile on me like itâ€™s permanently glued on my face until Iâ€™m all alone and Iâ€™m allowed to untie the sutures that keep it upright. I have a fucking skip in my step. I am the definition of perky. I radiate so much whatever it is that someone like me radiates that itâ€™s sickening to some people. How on earth can someone like me even consider doing something so drastic to oneself? 

Itâ€™s little things. No one respects me. I lack dignity. I barely overcame my issues with my self confidence and esteem. I am finding it difficult to be mature. I have no motivation. No goals. No career aspects. Iâ€™m just a mindless drone who is stuck and no one seems to care. I'm driving people away with my downward spiral when I'm in one of my moods... I'm just not happy with myself.
