You people are the reason I am still alive.[I posted here a few nights ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/408cy0/im_18_years_old_and_ive_just_been_diagnosed_with). I was scared, angry and desperate. I don't want to talk about what happened that night, but all of you're comments gave me such a sense of love that I broke down as I read them.

I have talked to my family about the situation and have joined a number of groups and chatrooms, as well as a national support group here in Norway. I will begin my first session with a therapist tomorrow morning. I have hope for my future. It's not what I planned or asked for. But I believe I can make it work.

I'm sorry I don't have more to say, but I really feel that you were worried about my state due to me not replying, and I apologise for that.

Thank you
