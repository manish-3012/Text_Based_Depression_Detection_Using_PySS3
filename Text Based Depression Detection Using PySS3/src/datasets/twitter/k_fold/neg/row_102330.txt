Can't moving forward in life or sleep without alcoholHi

I've been trying to get a decent job since graduating high school in 2012. Anyway, since then I've had a job that sucked so I quit and a job that was promising but they let me and several others go without supplying a reason after one and a half weeks. I think I have anxiety disorder and depression. I cannot sleep at night. I want to go to college but without a job I cannot afford books or shit. I live with my parents. I need to move into my own apartment. I cannot sleep without drinking anymore. I just drank a lot of vodka and before I pass out I realized I am slowly killing myself not moving up and alcoholism will make me kill myself. I need help because I am a trip to the Gay street bridge from ending my life. I have been there and seriously considered it. I'm about to pass out from vodka. Please help because I don't have any success and I can't move forward without getting fucked back where I was. I want to do thingsmwith life but im not moving forward and killing me would be a load off. Help so I can move forward. I want success a d happiness
