If I can't get laid then there's no point living.Call it biology calling to me but 19 years I've not had a single girl show any interest in me. It makes me severely depressed every day to know that no matter how hard I try at anything I'll always be alone, I'll never have sex, I'll never even have a girlfriend.

There's no point in living if I'm just going to live a lonely life, no one really cares either. Everyone has their own relationships and they're happy; so why would they give a fuck if I'm happy? They don't. No one does.

I turn 20 in a couple of months and if I'm still alone by then I'm declaring myself a genetic failure and killing myself.
