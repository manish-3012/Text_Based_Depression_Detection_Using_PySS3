I just need someone to talk to, man.2020 is kicking my ass so bad. I got laid off in November, and a pregnancy wouldnt allow me to work until now. I got the call that im going back to work starting Saturday, but whats the use? Unemployment didnt pay enough to make rent and bills, social assistance wont help me BECAUSE im recieving Unemployment, and i was given the "you have 14 days to pay your rent or i start the eviction process" notice from the landlord. 
After waiting for a late payment of Unemployment to come in, and my husband and i taking everything of value to us (PS4, Switch, and even his guitar) to the pawn shop, we're a solid $60 short on rent with no income in sight for the remaining days we have to pay. 
I put my name out for emergency commissions as i figure people might go for it, but in all honesty, no one has. 
Another bomb dropped on me today was that this "flu" my 3 year old daughter has had for a few days now is actually Scarlet Fever. Who gets scarlet fever? Is this the 1800s? What happens if my newborn son catches it from her? Is this year the year i lose a child and face my biggest and deepest fear? 

Idk man. I just wish this year would stop kicking my ass...i just needed to tell the world.
