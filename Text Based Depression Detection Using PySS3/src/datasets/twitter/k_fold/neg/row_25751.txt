Couple QuestionsJust for context's sake, 25 y/o male, lots of thoughts on the nature of suicide and I'm not really here to talk about my situation. If there is a better subreddit that will help here, please let me know, as I will repost as I am in no immediate threat.

My first question is regarding the nature of suicidal thoughts. I think about it fairly regularly duiring the day, but at night it is almost all consuming. I cannot sleep without thinking of different plans or who I'd write notes to or that I'd be better off just ending it than going to sleep. I know that this is just a story that I'm creating for myself, but this is the nature of how I think, and I don't think I'm alone in this. I personally believe that it is  because I have more time alone with my thoughts, but even on days where I've got nothing going on, I'm "happier". I can't seem to find anything online that links nights with suicidal thoughts but don't think I'm alone in this.

Secondly, I just want to know how individual's suicide has affected others, especially from survivors or from the people close to the suicidee . Since it is by nature a very selfish act, being by doing so you are essentially saying that you cannot get any better or worse, and that by ending your life, this is the only course of action that can improve your lot, I just want to know why others cannot understand, or how things have played out since from either perspective.

Thanks,
