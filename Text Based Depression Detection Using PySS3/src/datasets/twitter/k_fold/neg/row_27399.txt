hi, i love you alliâ€™ve been on this sub for only a few months, but iâ€™ve read ever single post. i try and check it at least once a day, and give as many upvotes as possible to show someone cares. iâ€™ve went through a year of horrible depression and suicidal thoughts, with many failed attempts. i know what it feels like. i know what itâ€™s like to be at the bottom, to feel worthless, to have nothing. but iâ€™m better now. iâ€™m so much better and iâ€™m happy. i know a million people have already told you that it gets better, and it does. it was the fact of getting through every day. i didnâ€™t think i was getting stronger. i wasnâ€™t trying to improve myself. i was just surviving. it wasnâ€™t an overnight thing. weeks and months went by until i started living instead of surviving. (i am also on meds, and i believe they really help.) i see you people who feel lonely or have terrible parents or who get constantly bullied. i empathize with you. i do not look down on you, i do not think you are any less because of it. i hope you all find happiness. whether itâ€™s in yourself, or in a hobby. donâ€™t feel any obligation to anything. surviving is enough. the lack of motivation is what makes the cycle so vicious. you are enough, you are doing enough. you have gotten this far, you are still here. i have not given up on you. i will never give up on any of you. i read your posts, and i understand what itâ€™s like. please, do not take your life. i know itâ€™s the easiest way. iâ€™m not going to sugarcoat it, it is. but iâ€™m begging you, for yourself, please stay. you will find happiness. you are enough. i will always be here for all of you. if you ever need to text someone, i am here. 571-662-0310. you can survive.
