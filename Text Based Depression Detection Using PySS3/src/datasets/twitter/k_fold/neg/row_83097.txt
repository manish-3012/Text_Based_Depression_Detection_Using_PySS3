Anyone feel like life is abusive to them?- born addicted to heroin or methadone.
- neglectful and abusive parents.
- sexually molested, child porn etc (though, this wasn't my parents fault, they were completely unaware. it was extended family and they were pretty protective on this front)
- hit, yelled at, insulted, punched, ignored, etc for 18 years.
- bipolar, ptsd, anxiety, bpd
-string of abusive exes.
-can't work bc of this.

Life is abusive. no therapist would say stick with an abusive partner.
