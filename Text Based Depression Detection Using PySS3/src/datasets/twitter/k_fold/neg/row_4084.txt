Love hurtsI dunno if I am scared to be love or I am scared to love. Iâ€™ve been interested in this girl for awhile now and I went to a party with her in it recently. Every time we talked I just said to myself sheâ€™s way out of my league. But throughout the night chatted and chatted,but then I noticed that she started to flirt with me but at first I brushed it off as her being friendly but then I thought that she was genuine. I was confused and scared how to go on because I am very antisocial type person. So every time she complemented me Iâ€™d laugh and smile. But Iâ€™ll walk away to some conversations that she tried to start. Toward at the end of the night she disappeared with someone else and they were pretty comfortable with each other at the end of the night.
I donâ€™t know to be mad at the situation or at myself.Iâ€™ve been trying for month with her because I meet her at first at the start of the year. The other guy in question also took another love interest of mine last year.Iâ€™ve been replaying that night since over and over again thinking I wish I could change it. The reason why I wrote this is because all my friends are moving on with their love lifeâ€™s and mines just depressing and lonely. Iâ€™ve consoled with myself that I am always going to be alone with no companion or I am just over reacting as I would always say to myself but Iâ€™ll never been just able to talk to anyone really. So I am too scared to be loved or I am just scared to love
