i was forced to go off my meds cold turkey and now my mood swings are way stronger than they ever have beennumerous adult figures in my life (including my acupuncturist, which i will address later) have tried to convince me to go off my meds (sertraline 75mg), mostly because of the anti-western medicine mindset they have (old fashioned east asian adults from the baby boomer era). i havenâ€™t been taking them for that long, maybe like 3 months at most, and i hadnâ€™t seen a noticeable difference yet so i wanted to continue to see how it went. i didnâ€™t think it was improving my depression all that much but it definitely helped in keeping my mood stable. 

my moms main reason for wanting me off them was for the sake of my reproductive health (iâ€™m an only child and a girl). iâ€™m not exactly sure where she got the idea that sertraline would mess with my reproductive health as she never even bothered learning the name of the meds i was taking, so i tried to ignore her badgering me. she hid my meds at one point and it made me upset, which got her upset at me for taking them in the first place. 

my acupuncturist, also my moms friend, got really offended when i told her i take sertraline for some reason. she gave me an ultimatum: sertraline or acupuncture. this was all happening during my acupuncture session, as in while needles were stuck in my body, and i had to stay relaxed so i just complied to not cause any tension and to not fuck up my muscles. she told me later sertraline would interfere with the new meds she was planning to put me on, and that since i havenâ€™t been on them for that long that i donâ€™t have to taper off them or anything, so i agreed to go cold turkey.

itâ€™s been less than a week and i feel like complete shit. my mood swings are at the worst theyâ€™ve ever been. i want to die every fucking day and i feel completely ignored and belittled. i just need someone to tell me i matter because i canâ€™t convince myself of that right now
