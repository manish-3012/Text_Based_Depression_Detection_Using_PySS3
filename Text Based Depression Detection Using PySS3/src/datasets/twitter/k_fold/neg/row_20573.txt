21iâ€™ve been a long time lurker and have typed many drafts only to delete them. worried someone i know would find it i guess. iâ€™m contemplating suicide again. i made it to 21, last week. before this i didnâ€™t think iâ€™d make it to 18, and before that 16. supposedly â€œmilestonesâ€, but not much has changed or is changing. i donâ€™t want to be here. i have submitted to the routine.iâ€™m losing track of time. i am a pretty unremarkable and forgettable person so iâ€™m not sure i would be missed by anyone but my partner and my dog. maybe even my coworkers would find themselves distressed before my family, and only really because theyâ€™re short staffed. i would feel pretty bad about that. i lie to myself always..that theyâ€™re the reason i havenâ€™t done it yet. but ultimately iâ€™m staying here because i canâ€™t afford to live if i fail to die.
