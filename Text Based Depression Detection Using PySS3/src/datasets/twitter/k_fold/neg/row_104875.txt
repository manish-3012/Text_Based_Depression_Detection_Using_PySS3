It's all I wantedI woke up again today. I really thought that was it last night, I took a whole bottle of sleeping pills 60 all together and I really thought there was no way I'd survive it. I see people talking about surviving attempts and being happy they survived but that's not how I feel. I feel stupid that I couldn't even get that done right. My husband wants me to go to the hospital to get committed but I just don't know anymore. I feel like this is a lost cause and I'll always be like this. I have been planning this for a while now and just don't understand how I screwed it up.
