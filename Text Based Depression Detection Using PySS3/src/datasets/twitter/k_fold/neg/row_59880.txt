Why Are People So Heartless?A long while ago I posted a question on reddit asking a question as to why people (But mainly women in this case) seem to dislike me and all I got was hateful replies and down-votes in response when all I was wondering was why I am seemingly disliked

(And also girls I've talked to say I'm a great guy but suddenly they remove me from all contact?), And I wasn't being rude at all (Or at least it was never my intention) to come across as that way at all,

Everyone was trying to assume the worst of me like I'm some kind of creep? After that I was baited into arguing with one of the twits responding, So I decided to stand ground and they ended up just crushing me even further.

Seriously I've even been suicidal over this (And I know it doesn't sound that problematic, But other things are also contributing, This is just a big part of the way I feel now) and it is continuing to bother me,

Why are people so hateful last time when I was suicidal people just ignored and drove past as if I didn't exist, I might as well not fucking exist anyway right?

Why are people so cold now it fucking hurts and I want to die so much because it embarrasses me even be sharing the same species with these "People". Why I just don't understand, All I ever do is treat people kindly and friendly but I always get treated like trash.
