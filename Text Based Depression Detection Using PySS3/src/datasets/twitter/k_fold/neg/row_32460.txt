It's always my faultI'm always told that I don't listen, that I keep making the same mistakes again and again, to get over it, to think about children in Africa without food, that I'm inmature, childish, foolish, etc...

I tried to listen, I tried almost everything I could... 
Antidepressants, therapy, talking to others, exercise (albeit for a short time), thinking positive, neurological tests, everything... And nothing works.

It's like I can't fail, I can't make mistakes, because if I do, I'm seen as the worst monster in the world...

Everyone I know have rather happy lives (at least from what I've seen), while I'm here, slowly dying out, confused, scared, being put down by others, being used by others and then discarded, and seeing the actual chance that I'll die alone in the future.

What's the use of a psychologist who will probably have no one once his mother dies?

Why couldn't I have a normal life? Why can't I be happy like others? Why can't I be normal like others? Why did I have to make all of those mistakes?

Why can't I die peacefully? I love my family, I love my remaining friends, but... Even with them, I can't see myself living past 30, the pain is too much...

I know I made a promise, and I don't want to break it again... I'm afraid that I'll end up doing that if I don't find a solution...
