Here goes everythingI am writing this to let you know that I am ready. As a child, I would stress about how time was passed and how my parents would age and die but then I became older and realized that there is no such thing as fear of death since it's inevitable. I've played with death many times. I've carried her, she's carried me through long journeys and endless conversations. I finally feel I am ready to end it all. As I approach this finale, I consider how my life has been spent and to be truthful, I dislike most of it, I don't regret it but many things would've led to better, happier endings. Lately I've hated myself to the point of no return and that is such a disgrace because once upon a time I loved myself and felt like my life might have looked brighter. Thank you for the chance of growing and being. 

Forever thankful
