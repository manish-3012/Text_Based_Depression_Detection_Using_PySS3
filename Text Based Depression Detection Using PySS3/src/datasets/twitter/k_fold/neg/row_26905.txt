I've never been this close to suicide before and I don't know what to doThings were OK today when it suddenly hit me. My life is complete garbage and not worth living. With my one and only life, why am I the person who has to live with a physical disability that leaves me unable to do the things I once loved to do? A girl isn't going to find this attractive, and that's basically the whole reason I am still alive. That's probably going to end soon though. I had the most intense urge to just jump in front of a car while walking back from work today. When I hear people talking about the fun stuff they're able to do (like drive a fucking car for one) it makes me feel like shit. Why am I the one who is cursed with this bitch of a disease? I want to bash my head against a concrete wall until there is nothing left. Throw me in the trash for all I care. I never asked for this godamn life. My life as a normal person is over. Since I graduated high school, I have had no one. I have been going about my days completely alone, with only my family to keep me company (not now though while I am in college). Why couldn't the person who was an ass to me for years have this? I am so helpless and I want to die. This is a fucked up video game where the player decreases the quality of a character's life
