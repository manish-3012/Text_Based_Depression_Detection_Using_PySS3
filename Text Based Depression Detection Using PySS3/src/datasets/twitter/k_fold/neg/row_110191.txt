My son is the only good part of my life.I have given my all to be a good parent to him, but my depression has taken over and now social workers are saying I have a "negative attitude" towards him. The school would probably disagree, as they are aware of his discipline problems. He's well fed, well clothed, goes to school on time and is safe. 
I will never be allowed to get off the hamster wheel for even one day as I live with my mother and she basically runs our lives. I don't want to leave him alone with the perfectionist who destroyed my confidence since childhood, then again, my mother micromanages me so much that I don't feel like a mother to him so much as a sack that bore him who is worthless and useless as a parent.

 Is he really better off without me, like I have been thinking in my darkest moments, and social services are effectively confirming by judging, blaming, accusing and intruding?
