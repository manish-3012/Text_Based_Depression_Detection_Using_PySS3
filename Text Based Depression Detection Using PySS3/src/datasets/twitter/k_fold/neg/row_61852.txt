i dont know if im gonna make it anymorehey people on reddit and the only ones who I trust that slid up on my story

a couple of you guys know that i've been on the verge of doing this to myself for a while and y'all have helped a lot but i just dont know anymore. my parents have litteraly encouraged me to kill myself and restricted me from doing anything that makes me happy. its obvious they dont give a damn how I feel and wont care when im gone. to those who I've talked to about this stuff, thank you so much for your help and maybe we'll meet again in the next life where life isnt so fucked. i've promised many people that I wouldn't do this to myself and I feel horrible for it but it'll all be fine. you guys wont have to worry about how im feeling anymore or if im gonna make it to the next morning. if I ever decide on if I should just stop trying and end it all, I'll make sure to leave you guys some stuff to remember me by. but thank you guys for being the only ones that actually cared about me, I'll make sure to let you guys know if I made it or not
