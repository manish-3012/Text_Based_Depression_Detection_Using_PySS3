I feel like I'm drowning, but cant seem to swim above the problemsI'm feel like I'm drowning in my own despair. I screwed up my life and my wife's by quitting my job and trying to start a business. I can't seem to get going on anything and I'm letting my business partners down. We thought we knew what we were doing but all I see is failure. We are burning through all our money and in 2-3 months I think we will be bankrupt. I want to go back in time and undo this decision but I know I can't. I can't face the future. I think about the bridge everyday and wonder if it won't end all these worries. I know it's selfish and will cause pain for my wife and family but I keep going round and round in  my head. I don't know what to do. God I wish I could just die in my sleep and never wake up.
