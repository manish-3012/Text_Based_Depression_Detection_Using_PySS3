Suicidal over house
Hello!

So I made a really dumb decision buying a bad house in a shitty area when I lived in a great apartment in a great area. I thought I wanted more space but I don't! The house is right by he highway, has a ton of issues and is far away from everyhing so I'm stuck here.

I don't want to do anything but just kill myself. I'm so trapped I need to get out. I takes to counselor but thing helped.  I dunno what to do I'm so miserable. I want to drown in a lake or something.
