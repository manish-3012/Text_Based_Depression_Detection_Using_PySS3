Iâ€™ve decidedIâ€™m gonna kill myself tonight. Iâ€™ve made my plan on how and when. Now just biding time and decide to search the Internet and found this. So I thought it would feel nice to at least let someone know that I will be dead by tomorrow morning. I donâ€™t have much to say though. I guess I should start with why, well this past week has been tough. I lost my home and job. Living in my ride was not all that bad and I had it better than most. I have had this feeling for years of just wanting to die and thought of Suicide and even attempted it but failed, that was six to seven years ago. I thought since I didnâ€™t die like I wanted and having my family look at me like I am an embarrassment made me feel anguished but I figured there was worry in there somewhere so I decided to struggle for a bit longer hoping for a meaning to my existence. Unfortunately I found nothing and things are pretty bad now, this past week Iâ€™ve thought of nothing but killing myself. Iâ€™m tired of pretending I care when Iâ€™m just a selfish, worthless, pathetic excuse of a human being. Iâ€™ve did nothing but burden my family and Iâ€™m tired of bothering them with this hopelessness I carry with me. Death will be my salvation and I can finally rest from this life Iâ€™ve never wanted nor deserved. Iâ€™m not afraid of whatâ€™s to come as a matter of fact I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Iâ€™m prepared. Whoever reads this post is probably the only people Iâ€™ve told of my feelings and thanks for reading. I still have several hours before I go through with it so feel free to reply. Iâ€™ve got time.
