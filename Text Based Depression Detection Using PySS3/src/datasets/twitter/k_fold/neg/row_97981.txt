Nothing quick enough at home.I need to leave. Before anything else goes wrong. The problem is I don't have anything quick enough at home. 

I have pain meds, but I'm more likely just to get sick. 

I have knives but that leaves too much of a mess. 

I need a gun...or I live just off a major highway...

All of these thoughts are going through my head. I need something that makes my exit from this shit life quick.
