Every thought hurtsIts hurts to think about life.... I woke up to texts from my sister because her mother in law messaged her husband and apparently said really shitty things about her gauging her ears... which I know sounds like a dumb thing for me to over analyze and be hurt over.... I've never met her husbands family as they are very religious and not so found of any other life style.. I'm a lesbian with tattoos and scarred up arms from years of self harm.... but just to think his family would look at me like garbage and that I can't meet my sisters in laws because of how I look..I don't know... which I'm not saying I'm not human garbage because I am... but it makes me sad... I'm sure this sounds like rambling... but I guess what I'm trying to say... its overwhelming how many different perspectives there are and I don't know what is right or wrong anymore....  there is more going on making me not want to be here anymore.... but little things like that add up... what even is the point anymore when at the end of the day nothing is good enough... maybe I'll walk outside around the Baltimore streets and hope that someone shoots me... I'm so tired... maybe those clusters they found in my lungs will kill me... after this pandemic is over I'm not going to seek further health care.... I hope whever it is kills me.
