please help meiâ€™ve had an especially rough mental health week. i wasnâ€™t able to go to therapy last week and i realized how much i rely on it to stay alive. iâ€™m really struggling and iâ€™m afraid of myself. i donâ€™t want to hurt my mom and i donâ€™t want to abandon my cat. thatâ€™s why iâ€™m still alive.

but i donâ€™t have anyone i can be myself around. i donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. even if i did i couldnâ€™t tell them the truth because the truth feels like a burden. i am and have always been an outcast. it feels like people look right through me. i get ignored a lot at work. i get ignored a lot in general. i started watching streams to help with the loneliness but my comments get ignored while everyone else gets spoken to. iâ€™m not safe where i live. i have so much trauma. my father has rejected me. i havenâ€™t told my mom iâ€™m trans because iâ€™m scared she wonâ€™t accept it. i canâ€™t see anyone because iâ€™m immunocompromised and it just amplifies the loneliness. ive been really withdrawn and exhausted and i would sleep the whole day if i could. i want to believe things will get better but better feels so far away. i donâ€™t want to be alone but i am. 

iâ€™m an artist and a poet. i like the things i make. it gives me meaning. but it feels so empty when i feel this way. i want to get a book deal one day. i want to move somewhere where people wonâ€™t stare at me and yell/do cruel things. i want a job where iâ€™m valued by my teammates. i want to fall in love and have close friends and grow a garden. but it all feels impossible. like iâ€™m holding out for greener grass but iâ€™m just deluding myself. ive felt this way my whole life and it just feels worse every year. iâ€™m in so much pain but i want to experience joy again. please someone help me. tell me your stories of hope. did you think you were a lost cause too? i know itâ€™s not my time to go but i havenâ€™t felt like this since my first attempt. having intrusive thoughts and im scared because they just get worse and louder. i started searching methods and then i found this subreddit. i think itâ€™s a sign
