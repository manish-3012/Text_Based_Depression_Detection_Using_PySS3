I'm just waiting to turn 18 so I can buy a gunAll I've wanted for a long time is to not be alive anymore. I dont have any reason to keep living. Everyone would be better off without my stupid ass around, none of my hobbies make me happy anymore, and I dont have any plans or aspirations for the future. I just need to endure this for 2 more years and then I can go.
