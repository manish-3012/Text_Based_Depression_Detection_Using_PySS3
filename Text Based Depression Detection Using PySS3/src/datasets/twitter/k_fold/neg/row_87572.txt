My friend wants to kill himself. What do I do?In grade school, I was that kid. I was made fun of constantly. In 8th grade, I actually sat in my room with a knife to my throat. I'm completely better now. But one of my main aggressors just texted me asking how I got through grade school. I became friends with him after grade school, and I told him of my struggle.

So what do I tell him? I've already given him my advice.
Don't kill yourself, things will get better.

*You have to push through it. It wont get better if you don't do anything about it.

*He said he lost a lot of friends, so I told him to meet other kids in his class.

*I asked him to talk to his counselor. (We're both high school Juniors)

So what more can I tell him? He came to me because he knows what I went through. I want to help him, but I need some help figuring out what I need to do
