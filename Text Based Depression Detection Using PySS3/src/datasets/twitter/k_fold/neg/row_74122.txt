I just don't know what to do anymoreIf you care to go through my post history there's extra details to this but I don't feel like explaining again. Losing her has just completely fucked me over. 2 months have gone by and everything still feels like a fever dream. I only went full nc on the 24th last month. I couldn't take seeing how she's completely flipped on me anymore. The lies and false promises she made about us, how she doesn't care about me anymore, seeing myself get replaced. I just can't do it anymore. I even got a puppy to help but that was a mistake since I also got it since she told me before seeing me with one would make her happy since we always talked about getting one together so I got it with this deep chance it'll fix things but it didn't. I love my pup but I feel I can't connect with him as I should because of him reminding me of her and also mainly distracting me in my ways I'm trying to cope. Apparently she told my roommate she has an email she's too scared to send me but I feel there won't be anything good in there anyway otherwise she would of sent it by now. I hate myself for this whole situation. I don't even wanna try bothering to love again since I feel it'll always go back to this somehow and I don't think I can survive another loss like this. I just wanna feel normal again. I want my life back. Even though my life was shitty and I was still really depressed, at least I wasn't grieving the loss of her as well.
