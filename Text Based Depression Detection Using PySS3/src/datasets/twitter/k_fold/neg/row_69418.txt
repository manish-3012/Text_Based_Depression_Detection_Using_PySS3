Where do I turn?I tried talking to my counselor, my best friend, and even strangers in a hotline chat. All the emotions I decided to show were swept under the rug. Nobody takes me seriously, I might as well talk to a wall at this point. Where do you guys go when you need support but have nobody to support you?
