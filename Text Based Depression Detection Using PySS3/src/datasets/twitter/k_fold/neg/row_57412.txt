I'm ScaredSo, I joined Reddit today to be open with my feelings and possibly get an answer from any people who might know how I'm feeling. I'm 24 years old and I'm losing touch with everything. For the past week, reoccurring thoughts of suicide and self harm have peeked up from the murky abyss and I am lost. I want to just make all the pain stop. I could never actually be so selfish and do such a thing, but I literally have no idea what to do. My relationship of 4 years feels like it's falling apart. He opened up the relationship because he wasn't doing so well, as I agreed to it because his happiness outweighs mine to me, and he found happiness in another woman. No matter how many times he tells me I'm his number one and how many times he tells me he loves me and would never string me along I feel hopeless and replaced. I feel like soon he's going to leave me because I am acting this way. I told him there is nothing after him. I have nothing after him. When I was with him and his new girlfriend I had an amazing time though. He was so happy and I was happy and the world was complete. We've been in a long distance relationship for these 4 years and I've never trusted someone so much, and yet my head keeps thinking he's going to leave me and I believe it like a fool. I'm moving in with him in January or February. I feel it's the best move for my mental state, but what do I do until then? What can I do to stop these feelings? I have a primary care doctors appointment next week and I was thinking about bringing this stuff up to them. I'm so lost when it comes to anything like this because my family doesn't understand any of this. Any help is truly appreciated. I hope I did this right.
