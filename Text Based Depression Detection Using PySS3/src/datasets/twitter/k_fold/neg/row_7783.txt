My life For the past 7 YEARSI wanted to start from the begging. It all started in High school my senior year, my mom moved away with her boyfriend so I was living with actually my friends grandma, my Jr year into and ending my senior year with living with my friends grandma. ...... I remember the day like it was yesterday my friends grandma said I counsels live in her house after high school. It must have been a trigger point in my mind because from that point in time Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts since! I guess when she said that I felt like what will I do I donâ€™t have anywhere to go I donâ€™t have money I felt hopeless &amp; alone. I just feel like I could die bc at least I wonâ€™t have all these burdens and worries bc I didnâ€™t know what to do. Since then Iâ€™ve been on my own .... but Iâ€™ve been in my own my whole life never had my dad in my life my mom was never there for me I suffer from depression in my mind very severely! Itâ€™s gotten worse over the years the first time I attempted suicide was by poisoning of carbon monoxide from a car I had a hose started the car and let it run. Then I decided to live. After that I opened up to my friend of what I deal with  &amp; he helped me so much but then his girlfriend thought we were getting to close &amp; I couldnâ€™t talk to him anymore. At that point I felt the lowest I have ever felt in my life I went and bought a gun to put to my head and pull the trigger. The cops stepped in bc I mistakenly  called the suicide  hotline!  I was 51/50 and since then Iâ€™ve learned not to rely on the suicide  hotline the results for me were worse! Since then Iâ€™ve put over time razor blades to my wrist Iâ€™ve tried to cut my wrist and bleed out but I donâ€™t want it to hurt! I wanna not be here because the pain in my mind is to great to l handle. Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend Iâ€™m 25 years old a lot of the time I feel so Low at points in my life I always think about just getting a gun on the streets to put to my head and pull the trigger! MY WHOLE dam life Iâ€™ve felt abandon betrayed out of all the friends Iâ€™ve had I feel like I have nobody ... nobody calls me to see how I am nobody cares I guess . I pray to god till tears roll down my face to take this away from me itâ€™s to much to handle please god take this away from me! Iâ€™m writing this to hopefully raise awareness about depression and suicide and reaching out for help please help I just want someone to talk to that could be helpful ! I lost my friend in dealing   With this his girlfriend thought I was gay for him because he was helping me with this .... which is silly because I thought my life was worth more than someone thinking that whole ordeal! I donâ€™t wanna be here because I hurt in my mind and I canâ€™t get away from this feeling ! I feel so hurt that my friend left and that was a year ago I care about that dude so dam much I luckily still get to hit him up and say hi! Please someone help me just want someone to talk to! Please help I donâ€™t wanna hurt in my mind anymore ! Please feel free to message me thanks !
