Things were really bad. Things are only getting worse. Things can never get better.Hello. And Goodbye, I guess.

Things aren't good. Things haven't been good for a very long time. And now, they are getting worse. Far worse. I am running out of time. I am running out of everything.

I failed my post grad at university. Twice. I couldn't study. I had lost the motivation to do anything. I probably should have said something. But I didn't. I just sat at my desk for hours, with my books in front of me. Thinking about jumping out of my window.

Even so, I came close to passing the second time I took it. I was one exam away from passing. I could have asked my friend for help (he had been a lecturer in the subject previously), but I didn't. I was too embarrassed. Or something stupid.

Anyway. Now. Because I failed my post grad and know that my current job has no possible future, I lost all motivation to even move. I couldn't work at all. My arms felt like they were made of lead. I got into big trouble at work, had a nervous breakdown, spent some time in psychiatric hospital. Spent some more time off work. Trying out new medications with my psychiatrist. Got back to work. Thought things might be better. They aren't.

I think I am going to have to leave my job soon. Definitely. And I don't know what I am going to be able to do in the future. I can't see myself being able to do anything. I want to carry on, but I don't know how that could even be possible. 

There is no point.

I just want it to all be over.
