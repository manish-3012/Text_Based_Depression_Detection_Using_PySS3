Being born was my mistakeIâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™m going to stop taking my meds because it doesnâ€™t matter either way. I realized Iâ€™m depressed because Iâ€™m a fat and ugly piece of shit. Iâ€™ve lost a bit of weight but Iâ€™m stuck at my halfway point so itâ€™s like it was for nothing. Even if I lost all of the weight Iâ€™d still be ugly.  Iâ€™m too afraid to die but even if I got up the courage to do it it would just amount to a shoulder shrug. Nothing about me matters . My life, my attempts, or my death. Imagine being so pathetic that your suicide wouldnâ€™t even amount to anything. The only solution to my problem was never being born in the first place. So much for that.
