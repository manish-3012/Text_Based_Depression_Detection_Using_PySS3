Iâ€™m sitting in the grave yard with a knife in my hand and any minute now the cops are going to find me unless I act nowI know this world isnâ€™t real and when they found out I knew they started following me wherever I go. I can hear people whisper about me on the street or in shops. Well tonight I was about to turn a corner on a street going home and I heard two people talking around the corner saying â€œyou have the chloroform rightâ€ â€œwait till she rounds the cornerâ€ â€œyou get her feetâ€ â€œitâ€™s not too far from here we should have her there within the hourâ€ and I got scared so I pulled out my knife and ran down the street. Security was notified and now it was obvious that I was aware of their plan so I ran to the cemetery to hide so here I sit wondering if I should just bleed out now before they force me back into the hospital, I wonâ€™t go back I wonâ€™t take their pills. I can hear the bodies in the ground chanting â€œjoin us...the grass is greener on the other sideâ€. It sounds so appealing being free from this artificial world. Iâ€™ll give myself a few minutes to compose myself then Iâ€™ll give in, Iâ€™ll lay on the ground and cut my arms. Iâ€™ll curl up with my jacket and wait to fall asleep from blood loss. I wonder if Iâ€™ll dream before I die, Iâ€™ll find out soon.
