Parents don't take my mental health seriously?I'm 19 and I've been suffering from depression and anxiety for a good 6 years now and my parents don't take me seriously enough, especially my dad. For the past 6 years, my dad has been putting all the blame on me like I deliberately out to destroy his and my family's lives. It pisses me off if you ask me. Then he wonders why I lose my temper all the time and that is the most hilarious thing. For the past 6 years, he's been acting like I'm the "troubled psychopathic" daughter and it makes me go fucking crazy.

Recently, I'm still dealing with burdens from the past just with being bullied and numerous people misunderstanding me, but I am trying to help myself daily just by meditating and working out. I really am starting to try to help myself. Then this morning, I felt agitated and wanted a chance to talk to my mother about what was bothering me before she worked. She then advised me to continue helping myself until we talk again.

Then I got my phone, went to my room and was trying to watch Youtube videos to distract myself from all the things I was feeling, then my dad came into my room and said my phone is the reason why I'm so anxious and depressed. It was not long until we got into a huge argument and my dad started scolding me. He calls me selfish for talking to my mom about my problems all the time and he says that really pisses him off and how he worries about my mom's physical health because of me. I told him that maybe if he was more patient and sympathetic with me and my problems, I would talk to him about my problems and he replied in an insensitive way.

He then reveals that he tells his friends about my issues and he secretly recorded me getting angry at him and his friends basically told him to disown me once I turn 18. I had trouble with social media in the past and calls it abnormal and bizarre that I made numerous social media accounts and that I search up a ton of stuff everyday. He scolds me more by saying I'm very codependent, ungrateful, and how he never met somebody who has a lot of shitty days as much as me. He said I'll never live on my own and he mentioned all of my past mistakes. For about 15 minutes straight, he's listing a lot of reasons how I'm the most despicable child and how I love to make everyone so fucking miserable.

Tired of his verbal abuse towards me, I lost my patience and screamed at him and then he took my phone away, threw it to the ground and threatened to put it in the pool. He then said that he will knock my teeth out if I ever scream at him again. I'm very aware that he paid for my phone but what else am I supposed to do with all the chaos happening in the world right now? Every thing I do is so disrespectful to him. I tried being respectful towards him and not disobey but it never works. He even said he doesn't want to have a relationship with me because of my issues. He doesn't realize that all the things he's doing to me makes me want to self-destruct. He enjoys to piss me off all the time.

I just want to kill myself every time this happens. Nobody cares about how I feel. All I ask for is to be a normal person with a normal life and to feel loved. My dad even said people posting about their problems online or on Reddit are pathetic. He hardly shows any sympathy for me. He doesn't understand I've been suffering from extremely low self-esteem for years and I'm in emotional pain 24/7 and instead of getting sympathy for that, I get insults.

I'm convinced that my life will always be shitty like this. Can someone please give me advice on how I can deal with this?
