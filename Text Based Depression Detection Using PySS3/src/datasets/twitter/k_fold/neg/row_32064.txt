Why do people care if an adult wants to commit suicide? Are you not allowed to choose what to do with your own life?I can understand someone trying to convince an underage person not to kill themselves since minors might not fully understand the gravity of the choice, or perhaps someone wanting to commit suicide in the moment because of grief ... but what about an adult who has taken the time to consider and plan their choice? Why do people care?
