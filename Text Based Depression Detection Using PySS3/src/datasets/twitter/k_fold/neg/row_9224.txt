I don't have a reason to keep trying.Last April I tried to commit suicide, but at the last second I stopped and called my parents for help. They sent me to a rehab/mental health place to get better. Due to how hard I was trying, my insurance didn't think I was bad enough to warrant paying for me to be there. 2 weeks later my parents pulled me out, and I started working on getting enrolled in college to try to make a positive change in my life. Last week I failed out of school. The entire time I was there I could feel my motivation being drained. I was on medication, but like every other pill I've tried, they weren't working. I'm trying to build up some motivation to get better, but I can't find any. I don't have a relationship to look forward to, women just use me for hookups and rebounds. Even if I suddenly won the lottery and had no financial problems I'd just go live somewhere isolated and live out my life until I die, so what's the point in waiting? I don't know what to do anymore, I can't even accomplish simple things that I used to be able to do.
