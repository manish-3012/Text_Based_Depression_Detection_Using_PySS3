The thoughts come more often than they ever have before.They are honestly so comforting. Iâ€™m so depressed and have no will to go on but when I think of suicide I feel happier. I just feel that I can end all the suffering and sadness. I donâ€™t know how I ever got this way. Posting anonymously about wanting to end my life. I never thought Iâ€™d be here or be feeling this way but here I am. All I know is, I no longer fear death, and I no longer have a positive outlook or see myself improving mentally. Waking up, doing my daily day to day tasks, working etc it all feels pointless. I just no longer want to feel this way. I donâ€™t want to feel like the only way of finding relief is from death.
