Feels like Iâ€™m drowning in sadnessAnd I canâ€™t seem to stay above water. 

I donâ€™t feel comfortable in my own skin.

Iâ€™m not eating regular meals because my dad said Iâ€™m getting fat the other day. It really hurt my feelings. 

My self esteem is fucked up. Always has been.

What is rest anymore? My thoughts keep me up. 

Iâ€™m spiraling out of control. 

Iâ€™m looking for validation in all the wrong places.

I canâ€™t stop reflecting on my mistakes.

Iâ€™m disgusted with myself.

I just want to disappear.
