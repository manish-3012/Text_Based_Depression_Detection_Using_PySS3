I'm literally hopeless and I'm planning on commiting suicideI don't know how else to explain it. I've tried everything, setting goals, eating healthy, working out, cutting out toxic people, taking medication, therepy. But none of it makes me feel better. I'm constantly feeling like shit, I have uncontrollable anxiety, depression, BDD. I'm just in so much pain. I want to die, I don't want to live a long and successful life, I don't even want to be happy, I just want to die.
