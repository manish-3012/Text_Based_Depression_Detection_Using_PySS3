I got denied yesterdayLife fucking sucks so much. Iâ€™ve never had any sort of girlfriend, and itâ€™s gotten to the point that Iâ€™m so awkward that Iâ€™ve basically been shut out of that forever. I probably wonâ€™t even have my first kids till Iâ€™m in my late twenties or something. And sure that happens to people, but that makes me fucking depressed, because Iâ€™m really sad and suicidal all the time, but I always have that little bit of hope for love in the back of my mind not matter how much I tell myself that it isnâ€™t happening. Basically all I had going for me was that and my college applications. But I just got denied by my Early Decision school, and now I just feel like shit. Getting through the day, hearing people at my school talking about how they were accepted to Dartmouth, Cornell, Brown, etc. and I canâ€™t even get into Swarthmore? And even the others who didnâ€™t get in at least got deferred. I just got flat out denied. Am I that sad? Why have I been holding out on killing myself all this time? Is it just my fear, or is there maybe something better for me in the future?
