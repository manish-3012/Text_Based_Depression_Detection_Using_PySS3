I have nothingI barely had anything before. No skills no job no future. I had one person who cared about me may be but we've drifted and I might as well not exist to her now. and no one cares about me outside of empty platitudes. I have no value as a person and no potential for a good life. The only thing keeping me alive is fear of pain. I want to sleep and not wake up.
