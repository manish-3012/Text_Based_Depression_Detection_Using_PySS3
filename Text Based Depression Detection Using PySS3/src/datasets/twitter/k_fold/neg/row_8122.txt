TodayReally thinking about just pulling the trigger today. No matter how well I do, my depression just kicks my ass and I feel shit all the time. Wife treats me like an ATM and wrecks me if ii dare question where the money is going, acts like a victim but wonâ€™t work or contribute.Been thinking about this since I was young and over 20 years later fuck alls changed. Fuck this, Iâ€™ll die anyway.
