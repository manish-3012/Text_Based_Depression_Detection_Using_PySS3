Having no one.I only have one person I can open up to, and that's my counselor. She's the only person who listened to me. But I've been getting worse and I know she sees that. It probably kills her mainly because she's trying so hard. She wants me to take time off from going to her now and I can't help but feel like shit. This is how I lose people. They want a "break" because they realize how fucked up I am, then we never speak again. I know she isn't going to message me next week asking me to come in, she doesn't do that. I'm sorry if this is stupid but I feel like I'm losing my last hope to try and get better. I have no one else in my life I can talk to. I don't think I can keep up with this. I can't keep losing important people. It's always my fault yet everyone wonders why I hate myself and I'm so hard on myself. This world would be so much better without me. Idk anyone who would be affected by me dying, maybe my family. I'm so close.
