itâ€™s been a long time since iâ€™ve felt suicidalThe last time was two years ago which feels like forever. While flossing today Iâ€™m pretty sure I found a cavity in my impacted wisdom tooth. The dentists have a hard time even getting back there to clean it, Iâ€™m pretty sure the only solution is to remove it. But thatâ€™s too expensive and neither my health nor dental insurance cover it. I know that given time that can kill a number of ways via infection. Itâ€™s kind of... exciting though? I know I donâ€™t have the guts to actively kill myself, but if this gets worse it could be the way. And then I wonâ€™t have to deal with all this uselessness that is my existence. I know I donâ€™t matter. Kind of ironic too Iâ€™d just reached out to another round of therapists Friday to see if i could find one. Only one doesnâ€™t work at a hospital but weâ€™ll see if she even calls me back. Thatâ€™s probably too expensive too though. 

Also my general practitioner dr is gone too. i donâ€™t know what happened, i called for an appointment and they said sheâ€™s not there any more. Only have four refills left on my medication so... yaaay. Guess this turned into an r/offmychest post... sorry about that. Just didnâ€™t want to burden any of my friends with my mood.
