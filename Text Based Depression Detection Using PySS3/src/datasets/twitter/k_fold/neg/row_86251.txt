no support systemmy biggest supporter is my father. lately it seems like he doesnâ€™t want to deal with my mental illness. i called him crying &amp; he said â€œi donâ€™t want to hear all that crying this early in the morningâ€. i asked him â€œwould you rather me jump off a bridge or call you when iâ€™m depressed?â€ he said â€œi canâ€™t control what you doâ€...... fml. too bad i wonâ€™t be here to see how he feels when i jump off that bridge.
