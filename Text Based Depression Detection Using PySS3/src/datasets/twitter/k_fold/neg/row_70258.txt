I really wanna do hard drugs?So, I have pretty severe depression but ever since starting Zoloft and exercising, I have been feeling so much better.
The thing is, I have an addictive personality. I know this because I was a borderline alcoholic. But I'm okay now.
I really wanna do hard drugs though. I know where I could get them, and I could have someone to do it with. I just love being under the influence of something where I don't have to think about my problems.
