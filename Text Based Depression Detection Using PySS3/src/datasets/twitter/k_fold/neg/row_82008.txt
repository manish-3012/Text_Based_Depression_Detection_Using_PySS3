Just another attempt of finding something to motivate me instead of being suicidal.I just made this Account and some online friend led me here telling me that i should make a Post and Say something about my problem. That it May help. 

So here's my problem: 

I honestly dont know how to live a life. As a human, i am a failure. Im 18, dont work, dont have any hobbies, interests, Real life friends, and dont have any Motivation to do anything at all. I also cant communicate with other people irl. I just cant speak to them and try to avoid them as much as i can. 

I even stopped washing myself and all i do is eat, sleep, Drink and rarely chat. I cant get myself to do anything no matter how hard i try. I cant even get myself to even eat properly. I usually just eat like 2 Times a Day. No proper food. Just some instant stuff.

My mother despises me and wants to throw me out soon. I dont know anything about what to do other than sleep tbh. I never even tried to get a job because i kinda dont want to. Im worthless. I am the Problem why i am like this. But i cant get myself to change myself. I tried to kill myself once already but sadly failed. And now that i know the pain i cant get myself to try a second time. 

Well, thats about it. Might respond to comments if there will be any within an hour. If not i will after sleep
