It's getting worseI keep thinking "how much worse can things get before I actually kill myself?"  I can't find steady work,  I can barely pay my bills, and I have to move in two months without a security deposit or steady employment. I feel like I'm gonna end up homeless and maybe should just get ahead of the game and off myself now.
