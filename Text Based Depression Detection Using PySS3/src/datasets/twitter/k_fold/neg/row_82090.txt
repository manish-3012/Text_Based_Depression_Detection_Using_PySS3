I feel like everyone I know would be better off without me.My life has been a cycle of scraping by and watching it crumble. I know my family loves me and cares what happens to me but that only makes everything worse. Right now I am in a dark place again. I have been lying awake at night thinking about dying. 

I am terrified of death but I feel like such a burden to those around me I keep thinking if I just will myself to death it will bring them peace. I don't want to die, but I am having trouble finding the point of life right now. I just want them to be happy.
