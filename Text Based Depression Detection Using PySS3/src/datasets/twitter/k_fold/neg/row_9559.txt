OkI hope everybody is okay. It hasnâ€™t been the best year in history so far. I have a brother that is suicidal, and itâ€™s been pretty difficult, because that makes me really sad. I know this is gonna sound cheesy, and this is coming from someone that hasnâ€™t really been suicidal, but if youâ€™re feeling suicidal please talk to someone about it. I assure you that there are people that care about you! Wether you have people right now that care about you or itâ€™s someone in the future who you havenâ€™t met yet (plus Jesus). Even if you look at this comment and it doesnâ€™t mean anything to you, I just hope that whoever is reading this has a good day and a good life (and maybe it even helped a little bit)
