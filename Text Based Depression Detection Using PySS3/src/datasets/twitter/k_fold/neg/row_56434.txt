I'm pretty much spent on trying.I don't think I can do this anymore.  All I do is work and play computer games with no plan for my future.  I'm 21 and still dependent on my parents.  The only friend I have only call me when they need a ride somewhere or want something from me.  My other friends are either dead or in prison.  I try to associate with better influences but they just treat me like shit or avoid me.  It's really hard to go out and make new friends because of my social anxiety and insecurities.

I know it sounds pathetic but I am so goddamn alone it is just too overwhelming for me.  My co-workers spend all day picking on me.  I used to think it was all in good fun but they've been much more aggressive lately, especially when no one else is around.  What's even worse is that I'm socially retarded when it comes to talking to the girls there.  I go around all day with a sad fucking face and when people ask why I'm being a sour puss or how much I hate life I just say I'm really tired.  Truthfully I'm just really shy and have no idea how to talk to them.


I have a lot of money saved up but nothing to spend it on.  No one to go out with and nothing to buy but gas, food, cigarrettes, and alcohol.  I drink every fucking night and over this past year of drinking by myself it has turned me into a very depressing and angry drunk.  I want to go out to bars and stuff but I don't want to embarrass myself.

Sometimes I want to kill the people that claim to be my friends.  All they do is fuck with my head and use me.  But I'm not a murderer and I don't want to go out like one.  I think come Monday I'll just get a pistol and get it over with.
