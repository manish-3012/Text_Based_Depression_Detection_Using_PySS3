I don't want to die, but there's no point in going onI don't know.

I want to die but I don't. I don't ever want to do that to my family, I've put them through enough of my shit.

I've been doing really well, to the point where I'm slowly coming off my antidepressants. But I've just got back an assignment from last term and I've completely and utterly failed it. I didn't expect to do well, but I at least expected to pass. I've been sick, and it's slowly getting worse and worse to the point it's completely taken over my life. 

It started with just needing to sleep more than normal, and now I'm barely functioning on 15 hours a day. The psychiatrist doesn't think it's psychological, and neither do I. But no doctor is listening. They brush it off as my medication (that's being slowly lowered, but the sleeping is getting worse), that I'm depressed (other than this moment, I haven't been), that I haven't been eating enough (this is the most I've weighed in 4 years, I'm in recovery and at my ideal medical weight) or that I'm just fucking lazy and need to 'push through it'.

I can't. And my life is falling apart because of that. I can't do anything. I've pretty much lost all my friends because I'm too tired to do anything, too low energy for them and I'm not cool. The only person who ever initiates a conversation with me only does so because he wants to fuck me and that's it. I have no one but my mother and my brother and isn't that fucking sad? This is supposed to be the best part of my life, but I'm sleeping it away and I have no one outside my family.

I feel so lost. I don't have any friends to talk to, who care enough to initiate a conversation or be anything more than polite when I talk to them. And it's so fucking obvious that they don't want me there. They plan parties or hang outs right in front of me, including each other but never mentioning me or asking if I want to come. Or accidentally bringing up their 'secret' group chat that I'm not a part of. I feel so cut off, but who can blame them? I'm a loser, uninteresting at the best of times and annoying at the worst. And now, I barely even have the energy to go out with them even if I wanted to. And they're secretly grateful for that.

I'm 18 and finishing up my last year of highschool. Two years ago, a year ago even, I was planning on going to med school and becoming a doctor. Now the sleep is so bad that I'll be lucky to hold down a part time job next year. I won't be able to move out, go to university, have a job or a life. And no one is listening to me. No one is properly looking into what's wrong.

What kind of fucking life is that? The only reason I'm not going to overdose is because I don't want to hurt my family. I remember what it did to them the last time I attempted. My eating disorder is coming back and it's the only thing keeping back the suicidal feelings. But then, isn't starving myself to death just a slow suicide? But at least it's a purpose. At least it's something I can do right. Because right now, I feel so powerless and terrified.

I'm an idiot, and I know I'm not really, but I feel like I'm trapped in tar. Trapped inside my own head and no one is listening, no one is helping. I can't live like this but I'm so terrified I'm going to have to. All my dreams, all my hopes I had for my life are down in the gutter and when the doctors bother to look they can't see anything wrong with me. I can't live like this. I just want to hurt myself. I want the world to just pause for a goddamn second so I can breathe. I just want to be fixed. If I have to live like this I will die. I don't think anyone can blame me for that.
