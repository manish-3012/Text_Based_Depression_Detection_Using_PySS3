its so hard to care about things anymorei wish i was at least sad so i could feel like i have something alive inside me. it's so unbearably difficult to act like you care about anything anymore, but i feel like i'm okay with life just passing me by. i feel like i should do more, but i just can't bring myself to even blink an eye to the things that are supposed to matter most. i don't want to die, i just don't want to exist.
