I just don't know what to do anymore.I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't keep living like myself. I ruin everything, everybody in my life I push away because I know once they get to know me better they'll eventually hate me. I'm overweight, ugly as all hell, not smart enough to get into a good post-secondary program, and just a waste of everyone's time. I just look at all my peers continue to grow into good productive people and I just waste away into my pathetic life. I've tried to kill myself 2 previous times but with hardly any success. I don't think I'll ever be able to do it honestly, I'm too much of a fucking pussy. I really do want to die but I just canâ€™t stand the pain and I get too scared to finish any of my attempts. That's the worst part about it, Iâ€™m so fucking pathetic that I canâ€™t even follow through, it just makes me feel worse. I just wish I would get some disease that would kill me in like 6 months or so, then at least my parents wouldn't feel like they did anything wrong. No one did anything wrong, I am completely at fault for everything in my life. I am just too fucking pathetic to change anything or improve any part of it, all I do is sit in false fantasies of death and hope that some external force will make me leave this fucking life so I don't have to do it myself. I'm new to this subreddit so I don't know if i did anything wrong in this post. Is there anything I can do to not feel so goddamn awful about living without telling any of my family or the few friends I have. I don't think my family would understand and my friends would probably just laugh and say I'm seeking attention. I honestly just don't know what to do, I don't want to be a burden on anyone but I hate being this lonely and sad all the time. I just want to feel happy again.
