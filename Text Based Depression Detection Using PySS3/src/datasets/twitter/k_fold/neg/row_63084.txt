What's the point anymore?I'm just tired of this endless cycle of hell. I just wanna be dead so this is over.
I'm spending all my time alone. I can't focus/study well.
I'm falling sick often, I've already been admitted to a hospital 4 times in one semester (4 months), one time being very serious ( stroke caused by a hemiplegic migrane) .
What am I being punished for?
I don't even have an easy way to kms.
