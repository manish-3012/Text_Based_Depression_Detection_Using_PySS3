no feelings left.This depression is killing me. It came back after all those years. Thought I was finally doing fine. But Iâ€™ve never felt worse. I feel completely dead inside, everythingâ€™s costs way too much energy. Even socializing with people in general makes me tired because I ALWAYS have to pretend Iâ€™m doing fine. Iâ€™m screaming inside and I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t talk to others because I tried but I wonâ€™t help. I donâ€™t know if I want things to get better. The older I get to more disappointed I am. There seems to be no light anymore. I donâ€™t have anything to rely on anymore, there were a few things that made me happy but now I canâ€™t force myself to do anything.

I feel like Iâ€™m being lived, doing things to please others. I canâ€™t functionate anymore. Iâ€™m supposed to stay this weekend at friends but I just want to stay in my bed, just do nothing .. waiting to die. Ugh I just messed up so much.

I know no one would probably read this but I just need to write this down for my own.
