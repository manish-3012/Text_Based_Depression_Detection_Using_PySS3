I want to die but Iâ€™m afraid.Long story short Iâ€™m a sex addict. Iv always been very careful and got regular std tests. Just found out my long time girlfriend gave me herpes. Sheâ€™s such a worry wort that it causes her to have constant outbreaks. Over the last few years my depression over never having sex has mentally destroyed me. She is on strong meds and has 15 outbreaks a year so I hardly ever have sex. I donâ€™t want to give this to anyone else so Iv settled into this relationship. Iâ€™m no longer able to live a life I had always hoped for. If I wasnâ€™t so scared Iâ€™d kill my self tomorrow. I never really could have expected my life to go this way. I hide my depression really well. I have the personality of the most fun happy person you have ever met. I just hate myself for not having her get an std test before we started dating 5 years ago. I plan out how I will kill myself a few times a week. Itâ€™s been months since Iv had sex and I feel like Iâ€™m going to mentally shut down and not be able to go to work any more. 

Iâ€™m scared to google suicide ideas because thatâ€™s really all thatâ€™s stopping me any more.
