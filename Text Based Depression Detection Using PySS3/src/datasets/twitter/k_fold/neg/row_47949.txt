I didnâ€™t read your message, Sam.Thank you all kind strangers for the virtual hugs and kind words, but it was just too much. Fucking up my grades and losing Alex and Sam was just too much for me to deal with.

To Sam, donâ€™t get messed up about this. I donâ€™t know if you still care about me, but I still care about you, and you donâ€™t deserve to get all grovely about something as stupid as this. I was hoping weâ€™d get to finish your D&amp;D campaign, I hope that goes well, and I hope everyone that plays has an amazing time. Thank you for responding to my note, both times, I never could work up the courage to read your message the second time, but assuming the last line of â€œso fuck offâ€ was accurate to the rest of your message, I donâ€™t think I couldâ€™ve handled it either way. Youâ€™re a good person, and you were an amazing friend, we just both sucked at communicating. Goodbye Sam, donâ€™t do any stupid shit.

To Alex, Iâ€™m so sorry for breaking down our friendship and our relationship. Iâ€™ve never had a partner as great as you, and I wasnâ€™t sure how fast or slow to take it. I know an apology isnâ€™t enough, but you deserve one for what I did. I miss you, I miss you a lot, I miss playing overwatch matches with you, I miss being with you every church service, and I miss being your friend. Please donâ€™t do anything stupid, Alex. I know thatâ€™s the most hypocritical thing Iâ€™ve ever said, but please please please donâ€™t do any stupid shit. Youâ€™re strong, youâ€™re smart, and youâ€™re the most amazing person I ever knew. Goodbye, Alex, [I love you.](https://ibb.co/nj1Kx7N)
