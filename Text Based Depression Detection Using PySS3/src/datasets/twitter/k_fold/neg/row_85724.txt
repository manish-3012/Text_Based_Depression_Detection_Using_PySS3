Would anyone care if I killed myselfIf I killed myself today:

my family wouldnâ€™t even be sad theyâ€™d probably be more angry than anything since suicide is so frowned upon n by doing so Iâ€™d prolly fuck up our â€œfAmIlY hOnoRâ€ cuz thatâ€™s all they care about, theyâ€™d prolly try to sweep it under the rug n make it look like an accident to save face 

Iâ€™ve no SO or anything so no need to worry bout that

Iâ€™ve no pets under my immediate care that rely on me, my folks would just take care of them so at least my bunnies would be safe n thatâ€™s all I care about 

I have no outstanding loans or debts to the government or any individual so they couldnâ€™t come after my family for money so itâ€™s a bonus at least my folks canâ€™t get mad at me for leaving the tax man waiting 

I was always the quiet one in the friend group, they donâ€™t rlly notice whenever Iâ€™m gone theyâ€™d prolly assume I disappeared or whatever of my own accord but I donâ€™t blame em itâ€™s my own fault 


In short I donâ€™t think anyone would rlly care or even notice and it would prolly just be a mild annoyance at worst thank you for coming to my Ted Talk
