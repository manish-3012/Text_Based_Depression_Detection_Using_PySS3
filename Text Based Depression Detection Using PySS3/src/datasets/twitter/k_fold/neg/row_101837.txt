I almost committed suicide todayI didnâ€™t think I was suicidal, Iâ€™ve experienced suicidal thoughts on and off for a year but I never thought I would legitimately say â€œtodayâ€™s the dayâ€
Today was an interesting day everything went fine until a coworker convinced me that I destroyed 2 thousand dollars worth of merchandise, I work on a farm and itâ€™s easy to mistake plants for weeds sometimes. I had an anxiety attack and immediately thought of the fastest ways I could kill myself until I was notified that â€œit was just the best prank ever â€œ 

Iâ€™m a bit worried about my mental health. What if I actually kill myself? I donâ€™t really know what to do any help would be great
