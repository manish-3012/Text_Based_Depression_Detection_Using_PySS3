How to keep going?Does anyone have tips to keep on going strong when the wave of suicidal ideation is drowning you?
I have decent days and I have stagnant days and other days I feel like I'm going backwards. It's like a spiral, closer to the bottom being thinking how much better it'd be to take my own life, closer to the top being excited to take on certain challenges in life. I feel like I'm rollercoastering on this spiral. It's like I have to climb a ladder but there's something at the top that throws things down so I can't climb to the top. I just want to get the fuck out of here and I feel like I've been trying for so long. It seems like my efforts were useless but I do realize now that I'm older how stupid I was to make certain decisions. Making decisions from an ill state of mind has taken me down a not fun path. I suffer from the consequences of my actions, most of it being not trusting myself and doing what I'm told by my mother instead. It's my fault but I wish I had help because I am not solely responsible for the situation I'm in. I try everyday and it's like I'm getting kicked in the face or spat on. I wish I could escape this mental prison. I keep it together and hide behind a smiling mask, although behind it, I'm broken like Humpty Dumpty after his fall.

How do you stay strong in the face of adversity?
How do you find support?
How do you keep on going with hopes of getting yourself to a better place someday?
What can I do? There are times when I don't know what to do.

When times are really dark, my dogs keep me going but it's gotten to the point where I want to find them a loving home so I can just kill myself. I know I want to live but that's the thing, I want to live, not survive like I have been my whole life. My future is brighter than it's been in a while but depression hits me like Ancient Power and has taken so much of my time.
