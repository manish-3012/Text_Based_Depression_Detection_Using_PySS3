I'm not worth it.All I do is think about killing myself. No I'm not doing this for attention, no this isn't another drama rant, I just want to kill myself. Im not important to anyone on this planet, that's a fact. Every one of my "friends" forgot my birthday, but remembered the other ones. My counselor told me she was going on vacation, yet she was at work everyday she said she'd be out. No one in my immediate family ever tried to bond with me or connect, nothing that affects me is ever taken seriously. I'm a worthless piece of shit. My only escape is illicit drugs or punching myself in the head, both of which aren't helping anymore. I've tried so many things to try and get better but nothing works. No one would care if I wrecked my car on a pole or fell off a bridge. I'm not important enough to people for anyone to care about me when I die. I can't wait until I get the courage.
