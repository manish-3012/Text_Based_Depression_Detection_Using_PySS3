I want to go..Maybe this sounds strange to some of you out there. I want to die.. But I feel like I shouldn't feel like this. I'm denying my own (suicidal) thoughts as not my own. I have a life that isn't terrible I guess. There are a lot of people out there that wish they had a life like mine. not that mine is good but its not the worst ever. Maybe if I just killed myself fast enough before I had time to think about it I could do it. I'm not sure what to do and I don't want help, I just want a vent. I feel like I don't want to feel better I just want to die, I don't want any help, or anything positive. I want to die right now..
