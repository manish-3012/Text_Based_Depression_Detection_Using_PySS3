SuicideI think about suicide every day. Multiple times a day. Not the active planning of it but where I donâ€™t put much effort into things because I can always just kill myself. Part of me will never do it but another part entertains the idea to the point where it impacts my everyday life. I donâ€™t know what to do to make this go away. Itâ€™s multiple times a day. No one knows. There was one time that i was suicidal for real and itâ€™s almost like it got â€œ a tasteâ€ for it in my brain that I canâ€™t the option of ending it all leave my brain.
