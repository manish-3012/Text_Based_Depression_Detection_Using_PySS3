Attempting again?I already posted here before I turned 27 but even if I had hopes again, nothing changed.
I'm still unwanted, unneeded, never getting enough of browsing my phone to talk to people who eventually move to their own lives, and there's nothing I can do to break the curse.

I attempted recently, got hospitalized, I felt better the first week after coming back but this is the second week and I feel much worse.
I used to feel bad much time after taking the meds, now it's all the time. I can't do anything else than crying and writing classical poems to the guys that hurt me and that no one reads.

My personal life is zero, everyone is like "live for yourself" but I can't get to do any activity for myself, I just need to be talked to and reassured indefinitely. Depression can hit any gender, age, condition, country, and it's a serial killer. It may take me tomorrow if I don't find a reason to stay...

Thanks for reading me.
