Loosing my grip on realitySo I'm 24, trans and I want to die. I'm autistic and can't do anything. I'm beginning to loose my grip on reality. There's this new movie coming out where a serial killler steals a girl's body and they swap places I forget the name of this movie. Anyways, im starting to think I'm actually cis and someone stole my body and the only way to get it back is to die
