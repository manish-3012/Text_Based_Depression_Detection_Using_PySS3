Desperately need advice for my boyfriend who is currently in a state of mental health crisisMy boyfriend is currently going through a really rough, abusive experience at home and is as a result not doing any of his schoolwork, self harming, and has spoke to me about thinking about suicide. 

Although he claims that he â€œwould never do itâ€ both myself and his best friend are genuinely worried that an attempt may happen soon. The problem is that we donâ€™t know who to reach out to in order to assure his safety, as our school would contact his family and that would ultimately end up escalating the issue. 

Weâ€™ve told him that weâ€™re willing to offer any supports necessary for him right now and have been pushing him to talk to our guidance advisors, but (partially due to the stigma) he is unwilling to and says that he can â€˜get through thisâ€™. 
 
Weâ€™re both really struggling to find people we can reach out to that wonâ€™t contact his family, and donâ€™t really know how to help him. Any suggestions and advice is very very very much so appreciated.
