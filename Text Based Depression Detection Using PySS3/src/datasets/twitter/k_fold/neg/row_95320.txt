10 days to goSomehow I need to find the strength to make it another 10 days. Why 10 days? Because I am coming into some money next week, which I want to give to people. Except, that will be Friday and I don't want to ruin everyone's weekend. So I'm stuck waiting until Sunday night, when I can email everyone money and good-bye letters after they have gone to bed, so they can't stop me.

It sucks. I want to be honest with everyone, but I can't because they will try to stop me. I want to say goodbye in person to the people I can, but I just can't.

Nobody knows I am planning this. Again, because they will try to stop me. I don't like denying them the opportunity to feel like they tried to help. I don't like the idea of them waking up Monday morning with "surprise! I'm already dead!". I don't know what else to do though.

I wish I didn't care. I am trying to withdraw from people, hoping that softens the blow. I know it won't. I have such long, descriptive letters written for them, loaded with love and kindness and explanations. I know they won't help.

I feel so helpless. My existence is hard on people, but my exit may be even harder. I just want to go away. I don't want to hurt anybody.
