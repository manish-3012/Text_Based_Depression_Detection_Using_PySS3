I think I need helpI'm bipolar and have high functioning autism. I have been stable for a long time, but recently a close friend I rely on moved away. I recently had some social encounters which have triggered a deep depression and I'm finding it hard to deal with the negative thoughts. I feel as though I'm slipping. I've been trying to cover it all up with coke and alcohol. I know this is bad but I'm in a rut and I don't know how to get out. I'm not sure where to turn with such a big whole in my support network. It would be good to get some guidance.
