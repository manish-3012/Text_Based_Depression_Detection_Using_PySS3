It's all so futile and hopeless so invisible looked overNo one understands that's the basic problem I have. No one knows anything similar to what I've experienced in life. They have absolutely no clue. No one listens. I'm left drowning in a sea filled with other hopeless voices wishing someone could hear them. Why should I try. Things haven't gotten better since I was 13 I've been hoping and hoping and hoping and putting up a fight trying to keep my head above water allowing myself to be captivated by dreams that I'm no longer fixated by because I'm completely submerged and I have lost this fight. 29 now. 16 years is a long time to wait. More than half my life I've lived like this. I try to reach out. No one cares. They say they care they say I can talk to them then ghosted always ghosted ignored or if they do respond they obviously haven't read what I wrote. Therapists have been unhelpful worse than that I mean I had one who I saw for over a year who treated me like I was a nuisance like she had better things to do than to speak with me. She had a phd in social activism not even psychology - it was through my university. I've been to the hospital multiple times. Doesn't help. I'm so small, so invisible.
