My boyfriend died three months ago. My father died 6 months ago and my bestfriend died two years ago. I'm done with lifeI'm tired of living. Everything and everyday hurts. My boyfriend died in the motorcycle accident three months ago and the last words I said to him were out of anger. I never had the chance to make amends.

I'm done.
