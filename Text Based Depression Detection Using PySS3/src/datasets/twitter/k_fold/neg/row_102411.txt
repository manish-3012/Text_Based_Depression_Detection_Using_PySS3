Deadline is UpI don't really know where to begin.

I have written a large number of Suicide Notes in the last year in preparation for this and now the now is up I am struggling to go through with my plans.

I was wrongly charged in December last year for a crime I did not commit involving my then ex, in fact it was I who called the police to protect my son and I. She made false claims and I ended up arrested. During the time I was on bail, the police kept giving different options to gain access to my son but she kept stopping changing her mind. I was found not guilty in April of this year as she had told a total of 4 different stories not being able to keep up with her lies.

I vowed that I would not spend any longer than a year without my son in my life. This arbitrary deadline ended 16 days ago. The reason I have let it pass, it because I have seen my son in the last 3 weeks but unfortunately was not able to hug him as his mother was dragging him away. He was fighting to try and come to me and she would not let him.

I feel I have no option left but to just die but I cannot write my feelings down to him, as there is just so much to say.

I am not sure why I am writing this, but this thread came up on some google searches I made.
