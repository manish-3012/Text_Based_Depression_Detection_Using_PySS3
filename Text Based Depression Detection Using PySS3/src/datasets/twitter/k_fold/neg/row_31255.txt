Loneliness consumes me, therapist won't even answer. I just want endless restLoneliness is something i've dealt with my whole life, but as i get older it's just becoming unbearable. I feel so trapped in my own mind especially at night and I have little to nobody who can help me with it. The idea of therapy does not even work for me. I've tried so many therapists throughout my life but what does help me is HAVING SOMEONE TO TALK TO. I try to reach out to her outside of sessions and nothing.. I'm so lost and absolutely TRAPPED in my own mind.
