I'm Exhausted and Going NowhereHonestly, the only reason I'm still here is for the mere fact there isn't an easy way for me to commit "alive'nt" so I'm just vibing along the wave and hoping for something to zoot me out. I kind of hate college, I'm doing it online because I can't stand real classrooms anymore, I'm passionate about the career I'm majoring in but know I'm not good enough for it so I don't know why I'm doing it. I just now got my drivers permit even though I'm already an adult, I don't have a job because I have no transportation and I can't mentally handle one anyway. I'm completely useless to society and don't contribute anything or even have the energy to. I live with my emotionally abusive mother and her husband, my mother is always reminding me of what a burden I am and my stepfather talks about me behind my back calling me lazy and useless. I can't function in relationships and I hate children so it's not like I have a future in any kind of family dynamic. I dunno, I'm just tired, I hate everything I'm doing, I hate everything I am.
