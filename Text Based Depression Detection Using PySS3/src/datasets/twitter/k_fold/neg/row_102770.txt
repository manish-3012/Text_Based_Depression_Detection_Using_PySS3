We had an argument , I lost my grandma 2 days ago and my feelings are everywhere. All of a sudden after work I called her and Iâ€™m blocked from everything. Iâ€™ve called her from multiple numbers, emails, texts. For 5 hours. Someone answered the phone and said itâ€™s not her. I canâ€™t breathe, my body is turning cold. My shivers are alive. Please help Iâ€™ve never went a day without speaking to her. Iâ€™m so scared. Iâ€™m so scared for my life, Iâ€™ve had mental breakdowns before and she was there. I havenâ€™t slept in 3 days.
