I canâ€™t get in touch with any of my friends.I was raped as a child I was assaulted as a teenager and my first relationship was so physically sexually and emotionally abusive I avoided men for 10 years.

I know Iâ€™m just having flash backs and they will end but I donâ€™t know when and I canâ€™t get hold of anyone Iâ€™m close to. I can feel and smell and hear everything that was happening then I feel like Iâ€™m in the same room it happened in. I canâ€™t fucking do this anymore
