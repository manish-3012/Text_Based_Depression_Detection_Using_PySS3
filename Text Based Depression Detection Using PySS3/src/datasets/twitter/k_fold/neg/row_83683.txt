.Sometimes I want to eliminate myself 

to be erased from this world 

and to be gone just like that 

nothing physical left behind

no proof of my life spent here

there will be no pain 

for my body 

no pain 

for my family-

Iâ€™ll be all but a soft tug on the memory.

So, soul; 

pack up my messes

sweep up who I was once 

lift out the heaviness

and watch it all disintegrate

sigh deep into the empty

the good kind of empty 

with it comes peace, finally 

my existence

lost to the wind

of the universe

is nothing more  

&amp;#x200B;

i feel shaken off by society.

from the periphery, i can only look in and observe

and feel seperate from everyone.

why is everyone doing what theyâ€™re doing?

why are they all doing the same things?

how can I be a part of all that,

seeing it as I'm seeing it now?

&amp;#x200B;

you then reach a point where you start to feel desperate. 

you witness yourself slipping more and more and youâ€™re just waiting for the moment you fall.

your facade is now too heavy to hold up.

your thoughts are now too strong to push down.

you suddenly feel no attachments to your body 

for it to live, to die is all the same

disconnection is what connects the empty to the soul

who I was yesterday will always be a trigger

who I will be is as tangible as dreams 

I avoided the world

and the world avoided me.
