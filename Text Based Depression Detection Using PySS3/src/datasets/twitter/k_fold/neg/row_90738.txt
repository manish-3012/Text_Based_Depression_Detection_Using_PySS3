I am brokenFuck anxiety. Fuck depression. Fuck whatever else I have. Fuck the doubts in my mind. And fuck the obsessions.

I've been dealing with this shit for seven years now. I've had my ups and downs. Somehow, I always got better. I was able to live somewhat normally. But I still had tto deal with the obsessions. 

I'm just tired of the unexplainable thoughts and obsessions. It's like only I understand them. 

Im tired of not being able to do anything at all but wait until it's evening so I can go sleep and hope the next day is better.

And then I wake up with anxiety all over again.

The only thing holding me back is the fear of surviving suicide and people finding out.
