Just so tired.No matter what goes right in my life, what I figure out or what I resolve, I still get so upset over nothing that I can't breathe sometimes, and I just don't know what to do anymore. My life seems all figured out. I successfully completed treatment for an eating disorder, and am living almost symptom free. I've got a great job, I'm in school with decent if not good grades, I'm socializing and making friends, I've found someone who makes me so happy I can't stand it, and I'm still sitting here in the middle of the afternoon so upset that I want to throw up. Nothing triggered this. I was walking back from class and suddenly got so upset that I started crying, right there where I was walking. I feel like nothing I do is ever going to be good enough for my own standards, and even then, why bother living? There's no point to being here. In the grand scheme of things, one person won't throw anything off one way or the other. I tried to kill myself two years ago, right around this time of year, and very nearly succeeded, and while I'm grateful that I met the people I've met in the time since then, I just can't figure out why I should keep trying. I've got a pile of medication in front of me that I'm highly, highly allergic to. If I take it, my throat will close in less than a minute, and that'll be it. I can't figure out a good enough reason not to just down them and go lay down.
