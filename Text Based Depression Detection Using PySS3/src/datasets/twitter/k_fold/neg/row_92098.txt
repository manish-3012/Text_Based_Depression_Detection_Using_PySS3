Someone I know wants to kill herself. What should I do?I've asked her why before and she just said because she's depressed, wants to die, and has nothing to live for. As far as I know her she just started talking to me one day and has started sharing details about family issues and depression. Nonetheless I'd still call her a friend and want to help.
