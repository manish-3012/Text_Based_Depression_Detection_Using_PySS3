my notethis situation is no ones fault but mine the one time iâ€™m ever happy it gets ruined by myself i self sabotage myself in every way and now i think i just pushed away the one person i care about my only reason for living and in the past it would make me excited to finally have been able to not have anyone to use me but iâ€™m lonely and sad i loved her but it was never gonna work out my dad is moving to another state i donâ€™t know why iâ€™d miss a drunk that beat me but i do iâ€™ve never opened up to anyone but her because i was scared that someone would hurt me worse than that evil teacher who exploited me and made me damaged goods i feel like iâ€™m not anything close to human everyone looks at me and sees someone to pity, laugh at, and judge because iâ€™m different because of my disability and it hurts and iâ€™m tired but itâ€™s ok because iâ€™m gonna be able to relax forever and be at peace for once
