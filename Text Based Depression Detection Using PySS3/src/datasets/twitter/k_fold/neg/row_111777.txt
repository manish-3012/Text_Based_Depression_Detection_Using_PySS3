Update: COVID-19 is wrecking my life.I just got the phone call from my boss.  
 Sheâ€™s the daughter of the owner. Itâ€™s was nice sheâ€™s called me to apologiz.

 Almost the entire main office has been furloughed. Iâ€™m not fired, if things come back, Iâ€™m hired back. My last paycheck is Friday. My insurance is paid up through April.

Theyâ€™re going to help file for mass unemployment.

Iâ€™m going to have to talk to my landlord about rent. Iâ€™m going to ask a friend if I can couch surf just in case. Iâ€™m assuming the worst. I may just have to pack a bag &amp; live on the street eventually even with unemployment.

Iâ€™ll likely lose every possession I have outside of what ever clothes I can carry.

Iâ€™m going to have to look into the Gold Card and MHMRA for medication come Monday. Iâ€™m going to have to go in person for both. Theyâ€™re screening for the virus at both, I have athsma issues (a symptom of the virus). Itâ€™s likely Iâ€™ll be turned away.

My life just ended. Just need to figure the best way to kill myself now. 

Thereâ€™s no hope. Any ideas of the best way?
