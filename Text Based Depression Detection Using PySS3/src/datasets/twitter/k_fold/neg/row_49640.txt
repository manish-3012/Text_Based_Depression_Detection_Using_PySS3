28/M Legit need someone to talk to. Drunk and having morbid thoughts.It's my first time here. not my first time in this situation. last friday night I was gonna work on it but I acutally got in touch with a guy from an old popular 90s band and he talked to me for hours and helped me thru. Im an alcoholic. presently ive been fighting the urge to slit my wrist for a few hrs to the point im ready to take calls from somebody or... something. suicide hotline is a fuckin joke. they literally farm data from you and get you off the phone as fast as possible. im not here to get attention. thanks..
