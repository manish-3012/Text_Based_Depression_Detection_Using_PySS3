Phobia causing me on me on the verge of suicide right nowI'm quite severely emetophobic, fear of vomiting.

My mother has had norovirus. She vomitted once on Wednesday morning, 7am. It's 00:51am now here, Sunday morning.

Since I heard her vomit, I went into defense mode. Staying in my room, not eating at all, after using the shared bathroom I'd used Germ-X to wash my hands - I didnt want to touch the taps to turn on the flowing water, or even be in the bathroom for too long for fear of catching it. When I did venture out of my room (she was sick but still using the rest of the house) I'd still sanatise my hands. I thought I was protecting myself.

Welp. Turns out Germ-X doesn't kill norovirus.

I'm not afraid that vomiting will kill me, or anything like that. I'm solely afraid of vomit. I'd rather die. I'm having frequent panic attacks, stomach cramps - although I know that might be because I havn't eaten much apart from some crackers I keep in my room.

I don't know what to do. I'd rather die. I'm panicing, I feel sick. I'd rather die.
