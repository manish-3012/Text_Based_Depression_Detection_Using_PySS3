I feel like I'm destined to kill myselfI would normally never post on the internet, but I can't find anybody to talk to. 

I've struggled with suicidal tendencies on and off for the majority of my life. I used to think there was something I could do. I have seen a psychiatrist and psychologist weekly for years. I do all of the recommended things for people who are depressed (workout daily, eat healthy, sleep normally, be social, take meds, work hard, etc.). In fact, I am rather healthy in every way except mentally. However, I still desperately want to kill myself. 

I am not always sad. There are even periods of weeks where I am not suicidal. However, I've been suicidal agt least 3 days per week on average for the last 8 years. Even on the days I am not suicidal, I don't find any value in living.

I used to not kill myself because of what it would do to my friends and family. However, I am at a point in life in which I have no friends, and don't care much for my family or what happens to them. I have reached out to a dozen "friends" and nobody responds or cares. It seems like the perfect time for me to do it.

The only reason I haven't taken any action is that I don't have a good plan. I am not in an environment with good means of killing myself. I am still struggling to find a means that wouldn't involve terrible pain. However, I feel like soon enough, the pain won't even deter me. 

Since these thoughts have been so frequent, I realized that I am eventually going to kill myself. There seems to be no chance I would somehow overcome this "illness" before it takes me.

I realize that the fact I am writing this at all is evidence that I am still not fully ready to take the leap. I want to make sure I am not missing something crucial, or if nothing else, just not feel so alone right now.
