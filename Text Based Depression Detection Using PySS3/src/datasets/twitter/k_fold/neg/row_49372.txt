I'm getting closer.It seems like every week I get closer to actually taking steps to initiate suicide.

Some days are better than others, and sometimes I actually have a glimmer of hope for my future. But for every step I take forward, I take 2 steps back.

To make a long story short, last year I dropped out of a prestigious university my first semester because of severe depression and social anxiety and failed half my classes. My parents were angry and disappointed. I got a job and started going to a community college to transfer to another university in a nearby city. Presently, I quit my job a couple months ago because I was no longer able to cope. I've lost faith in my education. I had a job interview for a place I really wanted to work at but I fucked it up. My family is so disappointed in me and I am a burden to them. I'm already in debt. My mental and physical health has deteriorated. I destroy all of my friendships because I'm stupid.

The only thing that gives me that little piece of hope is the possibility that I can make it through undergrad and apply to medical school and get in.

I've decided that if I don't get accepted to medical school then I 100% will kill myself.

So 1 of 3 things will happen:
1. I kill myself before I complete undergrad.
2. I apply to medical school, get denied, and kill myself.
3. I apply to medical school, get accepted, and go from there.

I am so uncomfortable being here I just want to go...I keep getting closer and closer. My plan is to buy a bunch of over the counter sleeping pills (I'm talking about a shit ton) and take them mixed with alcohol and my boyfriend's pain medications. I'm too fragile to be alive. I used to want to get better, now I don't even see the point.
