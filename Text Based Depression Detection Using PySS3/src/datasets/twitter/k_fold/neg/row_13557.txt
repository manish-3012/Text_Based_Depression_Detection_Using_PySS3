i lived and i wish i didnâ€™ti was hospitalized and i am now at a short term crisis residential thing. they were distractions from my life for long enough but every time i remember my pain it hits me like a fucking freight train and iâ€™m sent back to the exact same place i always find myself. 

i should be fucking dead, i shouldâ€™ve fucking died, i canâ€™t live like this anymore. i canâ€™t handle myself, i donâ€™t want to deal with any of this shit. life is one big cruel joke.
