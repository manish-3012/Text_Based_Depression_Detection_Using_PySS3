ArmyI've wanted to join the infantry since age 13, parents thought at first it was to spite their want for me to college, then they thought it was because I wanted to serve my country and tried to talk me out of it. The real reason is because im a coward. I've been depressed for years now(I'm 18), and the real reason I wanted to join the infantry was so I could hopefully get shot before to long. Two birds with one stone you know, nobody would know I'm a suicidal coward who doesn't have the balls to do it himself and people would think I was some sort of hero, giving my life some sort of meaning.

Turns out I have a heart problem and can't join. Now I'm even more depressed, who gets depressed about NOT being able to die!?

What is wrong with me? These thoughts scare me and I can't hide behind this facade of happiness to much longer.
