hang myselfIâ€™ve been struggling with mental illness for half of my life and itâ€™s really about to defeat me I donâ€™t know how I will make it through this. Iâ€™ve built and destroyed so many times and I am a huge inconvenience on everyoneâ€™s lives. Itâ€™s not even about that I just want to leave this life behind. I really donâ€™t think I can stay here for another day I need out now
