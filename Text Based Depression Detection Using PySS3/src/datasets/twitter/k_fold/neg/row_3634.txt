Cannot become a worthwhile person myself overnight, but at least can release the resources I'm occupying to those worthwhile overnight.By "worthwhile" I mean someone like my younger brother, who's talented, hardworking, charming. I want to leave all my savings to him instead of wasting those on my foods. I will be greatly pleased if after I die he spends those money on upgrading the compute, buying some game consoles, or taking a trip to Japan with his girlfriend who is also a really nice, sweet, caring person.
