3-4 years of torture vs suicideCan apply to study in Germany university for 3-4 years and get a part time job so i can pay rent and food. I would be studying and working hard everyday for 3-4 years but at the end I would be rich.

Or I can simply end it today and not even go through this hell.

Studying pros:  will make me live a good life after 3-4 years 
Studying cons: i will be suffering for 3-4 years.

Suicide pros: no more suffering, no more pain, no more depression, no more sadness, no more anxiety, escaping from this evil world. No need to suffer for 3-4 years.

Suicide cons: there is no cons. We will all die one day. Dosen't matter if ur rich or poor rn. All of our heart will stop beating one day. Nothing matters .  Only con will be leaving your family members or friends in sadness and misery . Or regretting.

I'll end it today ðŸ˜Š
