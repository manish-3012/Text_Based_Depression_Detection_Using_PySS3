Everyday provides a new reason...I truly wake up most days with the hope that something positive will happen.  I value the little things that go my way.  Green lights, positive conversations with my daily, fantastic people...positive feedback through email at my job.

I have a million reasons that overcome me with sadness and fear. I have been a pretty good fighter and put on my game face for many sad events in my life.

Lately, I feel like money will always pain me. I am lucky in so many ways.  BUT, I CANNOT FIND ANYTHING to wake up for anymore. My strongest remaining family member, my rock, is deteriorating at a rapid rate and I cannot deal with this again. 

If I were not here, I wouldn't need to go to a job I am underpaid and under appreciated to do. I wouldn't need dental work that cost so much, even with top notch dental insurance. I wouldn't need to continue hanging on by a thread. I wouldn't need to be the idiot that changed jobs, after many years with a great company to do WHAT I LOVE. 

I am in the wrong place.  The wrong time. I kinda like me some days, but I am not a good fit for what pays the bills.  

Everyday it is easier to justify.  Life is cruel.
