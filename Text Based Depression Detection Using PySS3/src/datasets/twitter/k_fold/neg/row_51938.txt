Why should I continue to struggle when relief is seconds awayI'm so sick of being told that suicide is selfish. What's selfish is expecting me to live through this bullshit that I'm wrapped up in. I'm so fucking tired of busting my fucking ass off to be stuck in a cycle. All it took was being born under the wrong circumstances. 

I hate the random feeling of slashing my throat that I experience every godamn day. It used to make me cringe, but as of late its felt like a satisfying mental image. It could be over with one movement. Instead of spending every fucking day heartbroken, starving, and poor, I could spend 2 seconds checking out.
