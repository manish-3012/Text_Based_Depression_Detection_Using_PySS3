I am now considering it.I just hurt my brother. I head but him and I hurt his head and he started bleeding. I had so much anger and rage all because of a fucking video game and pent up rage inside of me. He was calm and tried to calm me down but instead I hurt him. I fucking hate myself why does god allow people like me to live!!!??? Why am I so angry and cruel. Why am I so irrational and depressing. Why am I such a failure in everything I do. Now my dad knows how much of a fucking idiot I am!!! I hope god takes my life either by someone killing me tonight or just me having a heartattack in my sleep so that my brother can be healed.. It hurts so much in my heart, I didnâ€™t want to hurt him. Heâ€™s on his way to the hospital right now because I gave him a cut. Why god why do you let me live?!! Take my soul!! And send it to hell so I may suffer for all of my crimes!!! I just hope my brother is ok. After this I might consider suicide as an option once again.
