It is an odd feelingIt doesnt feel active

more....
Like i want to just cut out a hole in my chest. More so, have a giant apple core remover and push it into my chest. Take out all the pieces inside. i'd bleed but I'd enjoy it.

Its one of those passive suicidal thoughts. I want to go but I know that thats not what Im meant to die from. Im more likely to die from falling down the stairs than my own suicide attempt because I have failed too many times. Only thing I have managed to do is mess up my breathing. 


I always want to die. I don't know how I would do it though.
I've tried too many different things &amp; I have no gun access.

ive thought about stealing my housemate's blade
or hanging from a ceiling fan, which would still affect him. &amp; that reminds me that its a mental thing for me... somehow a male's reaction gets to me... it fuels my emotional - mental soul...

and that reminds me how I hate breathing.

Maybe it actually is active...
i feel like if i had the strength id break my own neck. If i had the location and ability Id harm myself. I feel like Itd be one of those moments where id enjoy feeling my neck break no matter how painful. Sometimes, I get like that. Someday that part of me might come out more. Its what made me cut my hand open. Its what bothers me frequently about slicing my neck. Its like worse monster than just my normal suicidal thoughts. 


It sucks that its been so long since ive experienced a day where I don't think about suicide. No wonder I've attempted so much.
