Please tell me why im crazyOkay so for a year or two, suicide has been in the back of my mind but things have been going okay. 

So yesterday, I was texting my friend and we were talking about girls. I guess I'm more attractive than I've ever been because recently I've been getting a lot of of female attention. So I was telling my friend all the girls I've been "talking" to. I wasn't really talking to them it was just people I was interested in and had been texting me. 

Then, about 10 minutes later I go on twitter. I see something that makes my heart drop. My friend who I was texting had screenshotted the text with me listing all the girls I was "talking to" and must have sent it to his friend because he "thought it was funny". That guy proceeded to put it on twitter. It didn't include my name but I know that everyone knows it was from me. 

A few minutes later, I get calls and texts from all the girls I mentioned asking what the fuck was going on and how we aren't talking. The story I've been telling them all is that it was a joke and that the screen shot was taken out of context. But I don't think anybody believes me and I probably wouldn't believe me if were them either. 

So anyway I got the guy who put the picture up to delete the tweet but the damage was already done. Every girl in the school hates me now, especially the ones in the screenshot. One of them I was really attached to. 
So now I've CONSTANTLY got this absolutely horrible feeling in my gut and it hasn't gone away since all of this happened. That, coupled with huge stress for school, debt from a car accident I was in, I just want it all to end.

I've been smoking weed and drinking a lot but that only helps for the moment. Plus my dad is ex military so he if found out I smoke I'd get kicked out of the house. 

I know my situation is pale in comparison to others but it really is horrible for me right now. Can you guys help me out and tell me why I'm overreacting or something.
