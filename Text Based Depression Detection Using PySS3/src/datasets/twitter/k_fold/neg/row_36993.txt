I am afraid, I will lose my job... againI just don't have the patience anymore... I want to end all this absurd game, of wondering if I am a valuable member of society or not. Why do I have to be a charismatic men at my job? They are too close for my confort, and I cannot share to anyone my dark thoughts... It seems, that I am allways fighting to keep up at the surcace, while others have all theirs life settled. It's just not fair... I hope I'll have the courage to do it. I also hope, that my tenant and my boss doesn't throw me to the streets... because I cannot take it... I cannot take it. I have sacrificed too much, to live a miserable life... It's either everything or nothing.
