Healing after AttemptHey, I hope you're all doing well and I hope your holidays is good. 
On Halloween I attempted suicide, I went to the hospital and got 13 stitches down my wrist. The stitches have been removed for awhile and everything seems healed just fine, but I am having issues moving my wrist around. It feels very tight on the skin and if I get up and use that arm the wrong way, it hurts like hell. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if it gets better? Thanks for the advice in advance.
