Itâ€™s best to just abandon all my friends since Iâ€™m the one causing them to get mad at each other all the time.I think Iâ€™ll leave all my friends behind for their own good. Itâ€™s dangerous if I have friends because I always do something wrong that makes them angry and then they argue. I donâ€™t deserve friends at all and I should just kill myself to prevent the urge of ever trying to be someoneâ€™s friend again. They say they wouldnâ€™t be happier if i was dead but I assure you they would live much happier lives without me.
