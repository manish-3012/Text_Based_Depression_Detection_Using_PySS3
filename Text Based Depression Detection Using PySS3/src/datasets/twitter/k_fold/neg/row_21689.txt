I can't deal with this anymoreMaybe 3 months ago my ex cheated on me. We broke up a month ago when I found out. Turns out he lied about a lot of other stuff as well. I think that for him I was just a fleshlight. A toy to play with. I know he's already talking to other girls. All our mutual friends decided to "take his side" and not be my friends anymore. We're all in the same class. I have to see my ex, who lied to me about loving me, whose actions have made me relapse into self harm and suicidal ideation, be happy, go on with his life and get all the love and support from his friends and family he could ever ask for. Meanwhile I lost the who I thought to be, love of my life, and also all of who I thought were my friends. I'm all alone in this. Therapy doesnt help. Nothing does. I'm just so fucking broken and hurt and I can't take it anymore. I just want to die. I just want to kill myself, I can't take this pain and stress anymore. I don't have a plan, I can't go through with it because it would hurt my family. But I want to severely cut myself or make a suicide ATTEMPT so that they'd take me away somewhere and I wouldn't have to be here anymore. I just don't want to hurt my parents. But I just can't take it. I need to stay alive for them. What do I do? I just feel like such a worthless human being. No one wants to be my friend and NO ONE WILL FUCKING TELL ME WHY SO I CAN'T FIX ANYTHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO FIX. Everyone who claims to love me or care about me always leaves and I can't deal with this anymore. Please help me. I need to be strong for my family. I can't dissapoint them.
