I'm too scared to kill myself...But I have found a way to do it. Every day I take two more pills than they last day. This way I don't know when its going to happen. There is a down side, if I don't take enough pills one day I might only black out or not take enough to kill myself only to go to the hospital. I don't see myself stopping unless I succeed or I see a point in living.
