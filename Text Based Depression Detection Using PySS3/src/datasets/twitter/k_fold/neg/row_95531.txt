So for half a year I've failed at finding the balls to end it...I've become an alcoholic, I'm literally becoming everything I always swore to never be, I'm committing self harm on a daily basis, my driving is probably the most lethal thing in this situation, I don't see the point in life anymore as there is no purpose... What do I do, /r/suicidewatch? And before you start about family... That's where it all started years ago. My mom doesn't want me, my dad abandoned me and my sister knows nothing about me. I have very few friends and none of them would care of I disappeared, as I often completely go offline and off-radar. I'm in debt, I have nothing that's keeping me back anymore, especially since my recent breakup... I have no idea how I'm still here, why I'm still trying, what is keeping me from... Well... Killing myself... I'm not looking for an "Oh, you don't have it that bad" or a "Look at life in a bright light". I literally can't... I've been in a car crash and if the physical trauma hadn't done it, the mental trauma would've, but my receptors are FUCKED... I run at about 30 to 20% of the "happy juices" a normal person does and my doctor's given up trying. I'm desperate to find someone to talk some sense into me... To stop me from taking myself out of existence... I've got nothing and no one, no reason to go on, no reason to find, I'm going nowhere, my music's going nowhere, my books are going nowhere, my education's going nowhere and all day I'm tired. I'm tired of fighting, I'm tired of getting shit on, I'm tired of never getting back what I sacrifice, I'm tired of always hearing everyone doing well while I'm doing shit, I'm tired of always working but never seeing anything for it, I'm tired of crying myself to sleep at night and to wake up wishing I didn't, I'm tired of being tired, I'm just. So. Tired... I want to sleep and never wake up.
