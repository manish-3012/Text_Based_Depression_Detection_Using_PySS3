I don't know how to reach outI feel exhausted and I don't know if I can do this anymore, whenever I do reach out for help from counselors or any doctors they just give me medication and a counselor that talks to me only 3 or 4 times and leaves I want to get better mentally and the medication just numbs everything and it's doing nothing in reality. am I really that forgettable, do people really think I'm just a lost cause. I've had around 4-6 assements and I'm surprised I'm not in a psych ward or something, I've tried ending it a few times only 2 landed me in a hospital and 1 almost successful. I'm beginning to think ending it really is the only option at this point. my dad really isn't helping at this point well he hasn't been anyways since his job and love life is more important then his kids, I wanna get better but I know I can't do this alone, but I know I'm gonna be ignored and forgotten about again and I don't want to feel like that and trust another counselor again and be disappointed when they leave me
