My struggle with suicideIm a 32 year old guy. I live in Bosnia (dump of a country). I work on a local tv station (more as a slave then a worker) for a pay that cant cover my utility bills not to mention food or anything else. I recently divorced and im in a struggle on court with my ex wife over our daughter. My kid is the only thing keeping me alive and if i loose her i have nothing left to care in this world. My parents died 3 years ago in a span of 6 months. I was devastated. My depression began in my early childhood but with every failure it just became stronger. 

Last night i thought about comitting suicide. Ive had a couple of moments in my life that i thought about it but never this severe. I wrote my suicide note and a letter to my daughter with specific instructions to be delivered when she is 18 years old to explain who was her father and why did i abandoned her like this. I only stopped because i didnt had the means to do it properly, i dont want to wake up the next morning in a hospital i just want to end it on my first try. 
I dont know what to do. I thought about a therapist but last time i went to one i was the one that diagnosed him not the other way around.

In short i dont see a way out. Bank debts that are piling, utility bills that i cant pay at all, loosing my daughter to a junky ex and her junky bf, not having any friends that i can say are suportive, feeling the lonlyness because i cant got and date because of my condition and situation...i dont know what to do with myself only to end it all and make the pain go away.
