the world is falling apart and i feel powerless and hopelessI had to quit social media these past few days because of everything going on in the world right now. my anxiety is so bad that everytime i hear something awful on the news i just breakdown. but thatâ€™s all the media ever fucking is. just bad stuff. the world feels like itâ€™s falling apart around me and i donâ€™t see a fucking point anymore. as a black kid i fear for my life everytime i leave my house. ecosystems are being destroyed and millions of people are dying from entirely preventable, horrid things. just everything is bad and i donâ€™t want to be here anymore i hate it all

i used to cut myself to feel better but i canâ€™t anymore. my parents said theyâ€™re going to send me away if i do it again. i used to have a boyfriend and having him made me feel like i could actually get better but he left me over a year ago because iâ€™m so useless. no matter how many coping strategies i learn in therapy nothing ever feels as good as tearing my skin open did. i just want to end it all
