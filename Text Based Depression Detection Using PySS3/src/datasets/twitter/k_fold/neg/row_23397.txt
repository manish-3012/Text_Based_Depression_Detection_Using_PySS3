my continued existance is causing my suicidal friend painFor the last year every time we wake up together she screams and cries that the pain is to much. Weve been together 5 years and shes tried a variety of treatments. I'm starting to feel as though my living is the thing preventing her from dying, thereby causing the distress. Unlike her I am not suicidal, but sometimes I feel like if I died unexpectedly she could be free. I dont want to loose her or see her go but the suffering is so great. I dont really want to die myself but I just dont want her to suffer. I wish there was an easier way for this. I feel like I'm just an obstacle to her feeling better, but I love her to much to "let her die" with me still being here. She has asked me to do this and I just cant. I would have to die first for it to be any semblance of okay. I can't handle the trauma of seeing my best friend go.
