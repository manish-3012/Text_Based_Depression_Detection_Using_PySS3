I have Pure O OCD, I am bisexual, my parents are hoarders, and I have a strong obession with being sucessfull and I have many big dreams. I just can't do it anymore.I'm so exhausted. So many things happened in my life already at the age of 19. These experience sure helped me grow but it's really hard now a days. Whenever I see someone who is famous I get envious. Or even my cousin who gets to act on stage. I want that too. I don't want to die without accomplishing anything. I want to make money and have lots of friend and such. Sure this is all achieveable and you my ask why I am posting this on suicidewatch. And that is because I just can't do it. It feels like climbing the mount everest without proper gear and a bag full of bricks because of my o-ocd. My brain just doesn't have rest anymore. The only thing that helps me is listening music. There are so many things that I have to you to explain my situation but suicide just feels like a very easy way out of this constant pain and anxiety I feel everyday.
