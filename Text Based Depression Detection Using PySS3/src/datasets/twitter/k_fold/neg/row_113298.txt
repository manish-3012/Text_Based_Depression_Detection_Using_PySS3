Iâ€™m not living, Iâ€™m barely survivingItâ€™s funny when people are surprised or shocked by my lack of motivation to better myself or to do well and succeed in things. Like I know Iâ€™m stupid already, I know Iâ€™m not going to amount to much. Iâ€™m just stalling and scraping by until I finally get lucky enough for something to kill me. Or until I gain the courage to end my own life.
