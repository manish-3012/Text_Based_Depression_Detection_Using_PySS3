Wish I had the fucking courage to kill myselfI'm such an unmotivated piece of shit. I can't do anything properly because I'm so unmotivated and lazy. I've been procrastinating my essays and homework and now it's the deadline and I haven't got anything done. Now I can't even hide my depression and I can't open up because I know it will just push my friend away. I'm just a fucking failure as a human being, a son, and a friend. I'm such a pussy and I had the courage to just fucking kill myself. The closest to dying was slitting my wrists and I can't even do it fucking properly. Everytime I'm walking I pray that a drunk driver will smash me with a car.

Sorry to anyone who wasted their time just me bawling. I just want to talk and take this off my chest.
