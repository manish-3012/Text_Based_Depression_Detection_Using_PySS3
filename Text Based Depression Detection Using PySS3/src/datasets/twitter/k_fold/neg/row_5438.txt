I think my BF triggers suicidal ideation.I would never tell him this because I donâ€™t want come off as manipulative but Iâ€™m starting to admit my BF is one of my major triggers for suicidal thoughts. He treats me like a fucking peasant. He constantly mentions my lack of money or the shitty financial situation I was in a year ago with my mother.

According to him Iâ€™m too poor for his stuck-up friends. I know all his friends think theyâ€™re better than me and he does too. Iâ€™m too poor for a normal engagement and wedding. Iâ€™m too poor to be trusted without a prenup. 

It causes me so much anxiety about money, I even started gambling which I detest. And itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m not trying, I forced a fucking raise out my boss. I make enough to not even need him. Then he wonders why I talk about offing myself 24/7. Itâ€™s clear Iâ€™m a financial burden and Iâ€™ll never not be to him.
