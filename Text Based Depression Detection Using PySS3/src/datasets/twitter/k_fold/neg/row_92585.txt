I hope I don't wake up tommorowI hate school, I hate my life, I hate the world, I hate myself. I hope I dont wake up. I hope it all just ends. I want to die, I want something to take me. I want to fall asleep and never wake up. That way my mom wouldn't have to bury her child knowing they killed themselves. I'm so tired, I'm so done. FUCK
