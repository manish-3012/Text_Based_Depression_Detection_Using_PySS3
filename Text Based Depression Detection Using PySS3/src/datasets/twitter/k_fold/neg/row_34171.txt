My Suicide NoteTo my family and friends:

I'm sorry. I couldn't do it anymore. My life was basically hell. Just an endless cycle I couldn't escape from. I either went through phases where I didn't know what I was doing or saying, I was on the verge of tears, I hated myself, or I just felt nothing at all. I'm sorry for being such a burden all my life. I'm sorry for not being the perfect child. I'm sorry for all the pain I caused all of you. I don't deserve love, but you have it to me anyway. 

Forget about me, I'm not something to cry over. I'm nothing. Just a failure. I don't deserve to be missed. 

And to all those who made fun of me: Thank you. Thank you for giving me a reason to end my life. I deserved the way you treated me. I know everyone hated me, I hated myself too.

Finally: I don't deserve a funeral. Don't dwell on me. Just remember that I loved you. I still love you. I just couldn't take the pain and suffering anymore.

I just couldn't..
