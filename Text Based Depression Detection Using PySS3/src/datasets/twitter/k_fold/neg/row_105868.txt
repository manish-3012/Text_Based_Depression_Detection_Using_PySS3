Suicide is so close, but so far away.Hey internet. I don't know where else to talk about this, so I'll do it here.

I'm 16, female, living in the United States. I'm genderfluid. Pansexual and polyamorous.

And I want to die.

I think about it daily. About if I just ran out into traffic and got hit, or took those stupid fucking pills, or destroy my body until it's a bloody mess. But I never act on it, because I'm held back. By either the idea of, "Well, I have this tomorrow and I can't miss it," or "I was going to that thing, I'll wait until after."

And I suppose that's good, except, I want to die, almost as if I have the need to die.

I can't do it anymore. I get upset every night, because I have nothing to do and it can't distract me and I hate myself.

I have a history. A history of sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental abuse. A history of depression, anxiety and a possible psychotic disorder.

And I'm only 16.

I'm only 16 and I hate life so fucking much that I feel the need to die. Like my body can't take it anymore.

I want to die.

*I need to die.*

But I can't. The world won't let me.

That might be a good thing, but it doesn't seem like it now
