I am going to kill myself soon.It does not make sense. I am about to graduate with a degree that should make me pretty well-off, I am medicated for depression, but I have no one to lean on. I cannot do it. Existentially, I feel there is no point in me being here. The person I wanted to spend my life with cheated on me and left me after many years of a very healthy and happy relationship. I am so behind on everything that I feel as though I'll never catch up. Everything is too much all the time, and everything scares me. I know it is partly the nature of being in your 20s, but I cannot do it anymore.

In the coming months, I will take my own life, and  I am ready to reach the end. I cannot wait until I get to do it.
