Has anyone seen u/Anonymousperson2001 ?Four days ago she made a post about her plans to kill herself and it's been four days since she was last active. I had been Pming her for a few days but they abruptly stopped at the same time. I hope she didn't go forward with her plan. She mentioned she had a doctor's appointment for her migraines and was hoping that the doctor would see her scars and help her. I really hope that she got help and needs to stay away from the internet to recover but I fear that is not the case.
