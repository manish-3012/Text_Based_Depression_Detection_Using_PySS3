Update: Still Alive And ExperienceA few weeks ago I tried to overdose on ibuprofen. Things got messed up and I was sent to the ER and finally to a mental hospital for about a week. Then another one after that for around two weeks. I guess to be fairly honest not much came out of it, I really only made friends. 

The intensive therapy overwhelmed me for the most part and I always acted positive just to get out quicker. Looking back on it that probably wasnt smart because it's been almost a full day since I've been discharged and my friends already had to talk me out of killing myself twice. I willingly went to the treatment though but had a rough time in the beginning. Being in a mental hospital can make someone worse, like me, but not everyone is affected the same way. And now I'm just straight up lying to all my friends and family that I'm okay. I don't know how I feel right now to be completely honest. The treatment made me realize how fucked up my mental health was. As I'm typing this I feel numb and detached.

Don't push away treatment if you know it will help you. Even if you are afraid you are strong, and in control. By saying this I don't want to pressure any Redditors that are reading this into getting treatment. That would make it worse to some. Reminder that you are in control even if it does not seem that way. Treatment is not for everyone. If you are willing to get help that's amazing but never think those who don't are any less. 

This is mostly based off of my experience so please do not take it as professional advice.
