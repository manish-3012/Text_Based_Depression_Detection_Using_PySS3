Feel like I need to have it as an optionI'm not sure where I should post this since it deals with multiple things, but I will just post it here because it could be triggering and it is related to suicide. 

I keep obsessing over the thought of friends committing suicide. Whenever they feel low or seem off, I get anxious. Now, I get anxious when they are physically unwell as well (because I don't want to lose them and that is the first thing my mind goes to when I hear they aren't feeling great physically), but I noticed the kind of anxiety is very different. I think I have now finally figured out that that is because I feel like if they commit suicide, then I "can't" anymore since I will be seen as an attention seeker. Thus, I feel like I don't have the option anymore, and I will feel nervous*. Sometimes it even makes me feel like I have to commit right now because otherwise I won't be able to do so anymore. 

It drives me insane that I keep obsessing over these thoughts/other people's wellbeing because I feel selfish, and I also don't want them to feel upset, and by thinking about this (and being unable to stop doing so) I can literally ruin /anything/ for myself. 

*I also feel anxious because I don't want them to be upset - even if I know they won't commit suicide, I will just want them to be happy and I also just really don't want to lose them. 

I think the obsessing part is very much OCD related, and the keeping it as an option part is depression related, but I have no clue how to solve this regardless. 

I'm not sure what I want with this post. Just get it off my chest, I guess.
