I really don't want to live anymoreI'm 20 years old and I've been depressed for around 8 years now, I was in therapy for 2 but there has been no noticeable change in my mindset at all so I gave it up. For a lack of a better term I've switched between suicidal and apathetic for the last 5 years.

I don't have any motivation in life and going through university has not changed my outlook or hope for the future. I just don't want to live, existing for the past few years has just been painful and the lack of motivation has meant the loss of many of my hobbies making my life pointless. Every night I fall asleep I usually end up dying in my dreams, I don't consider them nightmares anymore because I've gotten so used to it.
I feel like there is just no point in struggling for any longer for the same feelings of disappointment. I've been told many times by people that life gets better but when half of it has been spent in depression and a quarter or it flittering between suicidal or hopeless thoughts, its hard to believe them.

I'm looking up the various ways I would be able to end my life at the moment. I don't want to carry on . Even if I continue living I won't feel happy with it, it would just be existing and there is no point in that. I know its selfish but I just want the pain to end for me.
