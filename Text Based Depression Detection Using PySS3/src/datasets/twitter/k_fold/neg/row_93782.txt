Bored of being tired, tired of being bored.I wake up everyday wanting to sleep again. Sleep is so peaceful.. I get to be whatever I want in my lucid dreams.. I'm just a nobody in reality.

I wake up everyday to an empty home. I have no friends, no family. The internet is my social circle. I eat my meals, workout, fap, work, then sleep. I can barely remember the names of my colleagues sometimes.

I'm addicted to porn, and I go to the gym because I admire pornstars bodies. I'm a 20 years old virgin. Average looking, short.

The only thing that makes me feel happy is fapping and playing games. Then I tire and go to bed.

I want to die. I really don't want to feel so tired all the time, needing masturbation and games to make me feel pleasure.

I hope I can die soon.
