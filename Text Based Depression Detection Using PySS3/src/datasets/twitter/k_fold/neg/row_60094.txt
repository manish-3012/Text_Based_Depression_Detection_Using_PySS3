Feeling like there is no escapeAfter a failed attempt a month ago, I wanted to give myself another chance. If I could function again, if I could do the right thing, if I could prove myself that I am not inherently worthless...As I guessed it didn't go that way. 

I feel cornered like a fucking rat. When I speak with people, I feel like they cannot see the things way I see it. They are just meaninglessly hopeful, "why would there be a problem, you wouldn't fuck it up!". Other than not devastating my family, nothing stands between me and death, and yet I am writing this piece of shit of a wall of text, just to vent. Where to go now people? 

I took a year off from university as well, I cannot even properly answer people when they ask me why I took a year off. I cannot tell that I am so weak that just few minor negative personal shit pushed me to suicide coupled with a horrendous schedule of a medical university. I really don't know what else to say, feeling like repeating myself. Would be happy if someone can shed some light to my situation.
