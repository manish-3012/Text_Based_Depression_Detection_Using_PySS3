every day is the sameI usually have phases where I feel even worse than I normally do, but the most recent phase doesn't seem to stop. Every day consists of going through the motions, nothing else. No joy, no excitement, nothing to look forward to. Everything my life consists of reminds me of why I hate it so much.

I don't want to keep going like this. The last time I felt as hopeless as I do now, I cried myself to sleep for several weeks. Literally every night. After those few weeks I thought it's getting better and now I'm here, a few months older and at the exact same spot.

I don't really know why I wrote this, I just don't have anyone irl to talk to about this. I know that I'll probably end it eventually, just not yet.
