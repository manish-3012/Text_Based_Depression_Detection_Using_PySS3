(update) 22 and still here...A while ago I wrote here talking about how I didn't plan to make it to 22. Well...here I am. I made it. And I regret it wholeheartedly. I thought things couldn't get worse. Boy how wrong was I? I should've learned by now that things can ALWAYS get shittier. My one friend decided to abandon me. Today. On my birthday. On the anniversary of the day when the girl I planned to marry abandoned me. Not because she disliked me. Not because I have a shitty personality. But because I'm depressed. Because she couldn't deal with my depression. I don't blame her. Not at all. But she was the one thing saving me from doing it every time I was on the verge. Now what do I have? I sit here on the anniversary of my birth and can only think of how fitting it would be to end it on the same day. I don't know what to do anymore. All I want is a shoulder to cry on. I want someone to hug me and tell me it'll be ok. But I've just been so lonely. I want it to end.
