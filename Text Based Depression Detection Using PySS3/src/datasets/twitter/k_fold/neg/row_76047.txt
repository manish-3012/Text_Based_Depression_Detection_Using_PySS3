My life...AI dewl with social anxiety and panic attacks, i can't imagine my life like this, i just want a realase, peace and harmony, I lost two jobs beacuse i was to slow on.
I work with these fears with everything, specially meds and therapy, and the therapist put me in awkward situation to told my life when her yells at me 
Beacuse im in love with my girlfriend, and told me to leave her, i can't beacuse i love her but I'm to down with my simtoms, everything i do is not enough, i i have these feelings to release all the pain ii feeling right now, if i die, no one remember me after one year like my therapist sayid "you're nothing in this world".
