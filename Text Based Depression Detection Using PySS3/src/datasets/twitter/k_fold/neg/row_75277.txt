I'm so sick of being sick.I'm barely in my early twenties and I want to die. My mother and stepdad abused me, and I have no one to watch my daughter so I can go to the mental hospital.  I think I have melanoma, so why just wait for that to get me? I want to be happy and dance again, to be free from this prison I call a mind. The fight isn't worth it to me. I'm paranoid. I have bipolar disorder.  Don't really know what the point of this post is, but I just don't know what to do.
