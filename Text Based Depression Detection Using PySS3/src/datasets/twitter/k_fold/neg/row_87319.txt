Any kind souls here?I've been so depressed lately. I normally push those feelings down after a bit but the cycle gets worse and worse. I'm alone and would like someone to talk to. It doesn't have to be about my problems. It could be about you, your problems, maybe share a joke or two. Anyone else feeling depressed and alone?
