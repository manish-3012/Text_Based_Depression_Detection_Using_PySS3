I already posted this somewhere else but I rly need helpI really wish I could tell you my whole story. I wish I had a friend that I could tell it to without feeling awkward. It's definitely too much for me just to type in a post, but it basically is down to my inability to capture any girls interest. I really need help but it's hard for me to get it because of how long my story is. I've never typed it all out which leads to assumption and non applicable advice. I really do need help but I don't know who to get it from I can't go to a therapist because I'm young. I need help. I usually blame my failure on luck and other people which I still think is mostly true but I've made another mistake today that makes me think of all the stupid shit I've done. If I hadn't done it I don't know if anything would change it mot but I still get mad at myself. Please help someone.
