No point to lifeI just don't feel like there's much point in living anymore. The worst part is I know my position in life isn't even that bad, so why I even feel like this doesn't make sense. I can't seem to get close enough to anyone to be able to talk to them properly and it just feels as though my life has no meaning other than to work until I die. I just feel like suicide will get me out of this endless cycle of work and disappointment. I don't think I want to die but there's no point in living really, it makes no difference if I die today or in 50 years noone will remember me afterwards. Writing this just makes me feel like a stupid child and I don't want to be like that, but I need some form of advice otherwise I'm just gonna go and part of me doesn't want that but at the minute a bigger part does. Thanks for reading if you got this far I guess
