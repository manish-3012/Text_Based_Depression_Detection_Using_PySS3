Iâ€™ve hit my breaking point.At 27, i thought life would be a lot more fulfilling than it is now. I always imagined by then Iâ€™d be making some tangible progress towards something. I thought Iâ€™d have friends. I thought Iâ€™d finally feel as though I belong. 

None of these have happened. Rather, Iâ€™m more lonelier than ever. I know, Covid and lockdowns clan have an effect, but whatâ€™s the excuse before Covid. For 2019. Whatâ€™s the excuse for 2018? We could keep going back years. Itâ€™s a pathetic existence Iâ€™m living. 

This world has taught me that Iâ€™m not deserving of friends. Friends have left. All of my romantic relationships have been tumultuous and abusive. At some point Iâ€™ve realized that people donâ€™t give a flying fuck about me, only what I can provide for them. Itâ€™s never fucking been about me as a person. 

My friends suck. They only care if i can do favors for them. Iâ€™m left high and dry once i run out of shit to give. Nobody fucking asks me about my day. Nobody fucking asks me how Iâ€™m feeling. Why is it that I have to pay $70/session to have one goddamn person listen to me. 

Letâ€™s talk about work too. Shitty call center job where Iâ€™m overworked/underpaid and get screamed at all day. 

Hereâ€™s the kicker. Iâ€™m ugly. Iâ€™m stupid. Iâ€™m weird. Once people get to know me they run. Iâ€™ve suffered enough trauma in this world. Iâ€™m at the end. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I keep trying. I keep hitting this same place every other week. 

I keep asking the universe to give me some sort of sign. Yet the only one it gives me is thoughts of ending it all. What the fuck man. I canâ€™t catch a break. God just end it now
