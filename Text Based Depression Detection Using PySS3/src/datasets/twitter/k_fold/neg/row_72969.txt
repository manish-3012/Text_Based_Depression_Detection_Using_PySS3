Considering SuicideHi guys. 

Been depressed for about 10 years now. I'm 18. It's been a wild ride and tonight I've considered suicide, like I have every night for about 6 of those years. It's not a wild emotional spiral ending in too many pills. Quite the opposite really. I just want an out. I'm tired of running, tired of feeling how I feel. I'm tired. 

I am a useless fat fuck who can't get his shit straight. I used to love music and used it to help fight the depression. Got into music school and dropped out because I couldn't enjoy it anymore. Now all I do is my stupid fucking cashier job and come home and eat and go to bed. I would've killed myself ages ago if I didn't have a family and girlfriend that would be devestated if I did. That sounds like a positive but at this point I'm being held hostage. I want to die. I've wanted to die for so long. But I can't. It's no my choice. I have no control of my life, even if it gets to end. 

I don't even know what kind of hep I'm looking for, I just wanted to get it off my chest.
