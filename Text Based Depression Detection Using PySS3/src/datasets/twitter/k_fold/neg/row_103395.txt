Hoping that 1.25g of doxepin and alcohol will kill me...here goes nothingI feel like an empty shell. This will probably sound sick/disturbing, but after hearing the news of Avicii's unfortunate passing today, I feel almost jealous as weird as that sounds as well as very depressed that he died and that I am still alive. A legend and a person that left a positive impact on society died and I am still alive. What a shame. My family and my circumstances just make it so much easier. I hope I pass in my sleep tonight. Be easy everyone. Take care of yourselves and be good to others. God Bless.
