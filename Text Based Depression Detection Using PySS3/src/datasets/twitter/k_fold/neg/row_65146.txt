I want to die but I donâ€™t want to put in an active effortI dint want to hear anything about a suicide hotline, they donâ€™t know who I am or what Iâ€™ve been through. Itâ€™s their job to prevent suicide and I donâ€™t want to hear anything generic. Also if I wanted to kill myself, why would I willingly go to the hospital? If I wanted to die passively whatâ€™s the best way to do it?
