21st Birthday, this is just great.So, its my 21st birthday and I did celebrate it with a couple of friends. It was good a night and all but wow I didn't know how much of a depressed tard I could be. The night went great! I was having a blast with friends, just playing SSB and drinking. Since its a Monday and all. Im just depressed right now, it bothers me how socially awkward I am. Im planning on to join the airforce but failed the asvab (first time, I got a good score but wanted to retake it to get a better score but got a horrible score which means I have to take it again.) My life is going to shit, right after high school I took a couple of CC classes and did very well in them but laziness got in the way and I was dropping classes like it was nothing. I would like to succeed in computer engineering but im just too lazy. ( hense why im trying to join the airforce to improve discipline.) I hate my life. I feel like my family members are talking crap about me, how my older sister is more successful and just recently got her masters degree. I feel Im just the screwup of my extended family, like I have no ambition in life. I really want to be apart of society. I really want to have accomplishments. I just want be part of something. I grew up trying hard to impress other people with stuff I didn't actually have, especially in high school. I was so insecure about a lot of things. My weight, especially. I am 5'8 weighing in at only 118 pounds. Some people called me anorexic(Im a male). I know its just metabolism but people just don't understand. Im half asian and african american. Im into to a lot of things things that normally wouldn't fit into "black culture" and I was tormented by it. I do have a diverse group of friends but I feel that they are just using me for car rides and etc. I feel so alone, my mother, who is asian doesn't seem to communicate with me much. I really want to get close to her but every time we try, we end up arguing and she ends up threatening me to kick me out of the house. My father left our family when I was a kid but texts me only on special occasions. I feel like suicide is the only way. Once im gone no one will care and me dying will make society better. Lately I've been taking oxycodone, it feels great to lose my anxiety and finally have balls to talk to people. Its funny how some people perceive it as me being sarcastic to them when I say something nice. I try to be extremely nice to people but they think im being completely sarcastic. I apologize if this post doesn't fit this sub.
