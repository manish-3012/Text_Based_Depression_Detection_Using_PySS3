He has a girlfriend.There's a guy I've been in love with for a while, and tonight I found out that he has a girlfriend.

I have been cheated on, in an abusive relationship, am a victim of sexual assault, and he was the one guy I've felt a connection with in a long while that has made me feel safe. I've felt depressed for a little while now to boot. And tonight I found out he has a girlfriend.

Maybe it was my fault for not saying anything to him in the first place, but fuck. I have borderline personality disorder and now that I know this, I want to do something destructive. I want to drink bleach. I want to slit my wrists. I haven't self harmed in at least five years, but I want to do it now. I want to hurt myself.

I could almost laugh at the irony. My name means joy, I have a tattoo that even says "choose joy", and this is how my life has turned out.
