I'm lostI must have written and deleted several paragraphs at least 3 or 4 times. I'm scared to let anyone know what I've done in the past, and what I still occasionally think of today. But at the same time, my bad habit of bottling things up is only going to hurt me. I've brought this up with a very select few of my closest friends once or twice before, but I always lied and told them I was ok afterwards. I'm not ok. Cutting myself only temporarily relieves these thoughts. I only see myself as a burden and a disappointment to my friends, family and peers. I've messed up. Alot. And I feel as if the only real way to prevent myself from causing any more harm is to end it. The only thing that is keeping me from making such a drastic decision is my faith in Christ, but my faith is ever waxing and waning. I tried to end it once before. I was going to walk out on the beach into the water, and keep walking, swimming, struggling, until there was nothing I could do to keep myself afloat and simply drown. I was there...at the water's edge...for over 2 hours, freezing and crying. I decided against it, but the thoughts still remain. I'm afraid that if I lose it again, that I might follow through with these thoughts. I don't know what to do.
