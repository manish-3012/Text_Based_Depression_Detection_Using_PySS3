No one will remember me when I die...What really makes me depressed is the fact that some day I will die and no one will remember me. Sure, my friends an family will remember me but, soon or later, they too will die and with them, the memory of my person will too, making it like I never existed in this world while some amazing people will forever be remembered.

This are just a few amazing people that changed the world in way or another, for good or for bad, and they will always be remembered, not matter the age. They are immortal. 
And don't even get me started on fictional characters - they dont  even exist and yet, people will know them and not me and they will also forever exist. They are more "real" than I will ever be. Im a living ghost, unable to speak, see or hear. What's even the point of being alive? Love? Family? Work? Those things fade. Doesn't matter if I die now or when I'm 100 years old. I'm nothing. No one. I feel nothing. I can only feel emotion through stimulus - a meme, a book, a game, a movie/tv show, a social interaction, although the emotions these things make me feel are super brief but without them, Im in constant agony. I can't be fine without anything stimulating me - I can only feel anger, sadness, dread, anxiety, sorrow and then, nothing. This is especially painful at night when Im trying to sleep. I can count the good nights of sleep I had these year  with the fingers in my hands. People around me dont even realize it - I'm always smiling and cracking jokes, hoping no one feels like this. It's funny, I owe nothing to humanity and sometimes I hate it but I still care for us and I try to help the best way I can. If I killed myself today, people would just wonder why I did it. They wouldn't even realize what's inside of me and what would make me do that. I haven't done it yet because if Life and Death are 2 sides of the same coin, Life might be meaningless, but so would be Death. So Im still here, a ghost, a living corpse, dragging my body in the road of life, hoping my stitches won't break. Does anyone else feel like this?
