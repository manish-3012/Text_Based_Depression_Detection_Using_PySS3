My boyfriend broke up with me.Today, he broke up with me. I deserved it. I've been treating him terribly. But it hurts. I self harmed today. He was the most amazing person I've ever met. I would give everything up to be with him. I was doing a little better for a few hours. Now it is night time, and my brain won't be quiet, and I want to scream and claw at myself.
