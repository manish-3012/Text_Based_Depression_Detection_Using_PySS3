Depressed exfiance. Hi guys, throw away account here, just looking for some advice here. _x000D_
I've known my exfiance for about 14 years of my life and we've been dating for half of that, engaged for the past year. I've known he's been battling depression about 8 years ago, but after 2 suicide attempted, he got help and everything seems to have been ok since. But since we broke off the engagement, he's been so closed off, and whenever we speak, it's with increased irritability, indifference, and I know he's suffering from insomnia again. _x000D_

We were supposed to move to the east coast together, and he just told me the other day he doesn't feel well and thinks that by the time we were supposed to move, he won't be around to go with me. He admits that he thinks some of the symptoms seem to have resurfaced and I don't know what to do. _x000D_

Any advice would help, thank you!
