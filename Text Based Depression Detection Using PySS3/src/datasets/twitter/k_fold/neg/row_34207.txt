losing controli feel like shit right now.  I'm depressed and angry at the same time.  I'm so sick and tired of my job. the only thing i enjoy nowadays is sleeping.  sleeping all day.  i don't feel like playing video games anymore.  what is wrong with me? there are days when i feel so angry i just want to walk away.  but i need money right now,  i can't just leave my job.  fuck my life.  so many disgusting people,  pieces of shit, disrespectful motherfuckers. i hope they die a horrible painful death.  if I'm going to kill myself then I'm going to take a few people with me Å£o hell. I have my list.  I'm sorry guys,  I'm slowly losing my sanity.
