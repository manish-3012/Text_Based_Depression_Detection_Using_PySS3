Suicide threats as manipulation?I posted this on r/Relationships but mods removed it and told me to post here instead.

I (37/f) think my husband (36/m) threatens suicide to manipulate me.

Weâ€™ve been together 17 years and have always had a hard time communicating, but weâ€™ve been trying. Last night I listened to him talk for four hours about his feelings on an issue that weâ€™ve been fighting about for 5 years. Talk turned into yelling, even when I tried to agree with his points, he screamed that I wouldnâ€™t let him finish. So, I shut up and took it. After hours of being yelled at, we finally went to lay down and he asked me how I felt. I said that I thought he would get angry but he asked again so I started talking and sure enough, he got mad. I moved to the couch and he lost it.

He came into the living room and screamed â€œAre you ready for this?â€ and started pouring pills into his mouth. I jumped up and then he spit them out and threw the bottle. 

This isnâ€™t the first time, and to be fair, I used to do this too. So weâ€™d have fights where we were both threatening to kill ourselves. Ive been trying to understand myself more, recognize my toxic behaviors, hear him, and apologize. But Iâ€™ve become cold and almost immune to his threats whereas I used to cry and beg him to stop. 

This time I told him he was trying to manipulate me.

He then continued the threats in various ways: holding a knife to his throat, taking his belt off and going to the garage, trying to knock himself out by running into the wall, garage again with a cord, throwing himself on the ground, and trying to choke himself out. 

Each time, staring with those angry eyes while screaming at me.
Each time, I did what I could to stop him and stayed calm. 

He then tried to leave in his car saying heâ€™d hurt himself. I got his keys away but he grabbed the spare. I stood behind his car (stupid, I know) but he just went forward across the lawn instead. He left his phone so there was nothing else I could do. I thought, â€œWell, this is when I find out if heâ€™s really suicidal or just using it against me.â€ I went into the backyard because I was afraid heâ€™d crash his car into the house.

As mentioned above, in the past, I have been suicidal during our fights too but I realized it wasnâ€™t real. I realized it wasnâ€™t real because over the last few years Iâ€™ve been suicidal where Iâ€™ve actually planned it out and waited until I was alone. Luckily, Iâ€™ve never gone through with it. 

He came back awhile later saying I didnâ€™t deserve that. I didnâ€™t ask what he meant. I just said letâ€™s get some sleep.

This morning I woke up and the emotions finally hit me. I cried quietly in bed, I could tell he was awake but he didnâ€™t say anything. I then moved to the living room. He came in, laid on the couch, didnâ€™t say a word, and just sighs heavily once in awhile.

He fell back asleep so now Iâ€™m writing this, crying.

I know we need therapy, weâ€™ve talked about going for years. I told him he needed to set it up so I knew he was serious (I take care of a lot of the adulting of our lives, a whole other issue). 

Iâ€™m scared to leave for so many reasons. I donâ€™t want to give up on us, we are comfortable, I donâ€™t know how heâ€™ll react, Iâ€™m scared of being alone, Iâ€™m scared of all of the work that would go into a divorce.

I just needed to vent I guess. Thanks for listening.

TL;DR I think my husband threatens suicide to manipulate me but maybe Iâ€™m the jerk?

Update: after not talking for 36 hours, he apologized. I held him and told him we arenâ€™t bad people, weâ€™ve just done bad things. He says he is a bad person and hates himself. Weâ€™ve both been abusive to each other and need help. I told him I was going to make a therapy appointment and asked if he would too. He looked up therapy on his companyâ€™s EAP (Iâ€™m on his insurance) and we can get some free sessions. He said heâ€™d get more info when he goes to work today.  I guess whether he does this or not will tell me how serious he is. 

Yesterday it seemed so obvious that I needed to leave him. But, now that things have calmed down it doesnâ€™t feel so urgent or even necessary. I do love him and I feel like if I leave Iâ€™ll be abandoning him.
