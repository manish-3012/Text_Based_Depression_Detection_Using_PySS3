I have my exit bag ready, I'm done with my life.Today, I made my professor mad at me. I didn't mean to but she doesn't like me as much as she did before.

The school I'm going to, people hate me. The professors don't like me, the students don't like me. No one likes me. I'm hours away from home and I'm still here for 2 more weeks, killing myself with papers and projects.

I really want to fucking die. I can't make anyone happy, everyone always shits on me. I won't get a job, I'm a fucking useless programmer and I fucking want to die. I'm a fat slob and no one loves me. Not even my parents want to be around me. I haven't felt this strongly about suicide in months.

tell me it's going to be ok. even if it won't be. even if it'll  never be.
