Everything feels like too much right now.I don't know if it's because of the hormones I'm taking right now, or if things really are just hard for me to deal with right now, but I just broke down at work and started crying because of all the shit I'm going through with my classes for school. It feels like no matter what I do, it's never enough and I'll never graduate because I'm not good enough. I'm trying really hard but it's not enough and it's honestly so embarrassing. I feel like people are pitying me because they don't think I'm adequate for the major I'm pursuing. I don't even want to get a job in my field anymore because I feel so horrible about it, at this point I'm just trying to graduate for a degree... if I can even graduate.

  
On top of that I'm having some relationship issues that I can't seem to deal with because I have terrible communication skills and I'm not good at communicating how I feel about things. My boyfriend admitted he has commitment issues and now I've become a jealous bitch and I can't seem to trust him anymore. It feels like he's just with me till he finds the next better person. For example, he's going out tomorrow, but he didn't give me much in terms of details, he basically said I can't see him that night, which I normally see him on Fridays, and now I just have so many negative thoughts. I keep convincing myself he doesn't want me and that he's on the prowl for others. 

  
Anyways, my point in all of this is that it feels impossible to want to continue the way things are. I've always casually thought about ending it, sometimes more seriously than others, but I've never felt like I needed to reach out till now. I feel so overwhelmed and I just want to give up.
