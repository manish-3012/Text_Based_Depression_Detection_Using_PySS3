I want this pain to end.I fucked up. I hate hurting people. I always have. Today I hurt someone that I love. I want to drink. I want to cut. I need to numb this pain. Part of me wants to shoot myself in the head. The only thing stopping me from the last two things is the promise I made to my husband: I would never even try to hurt myself. So I won't.
That leaves me with wanting to drink but I have two kids to take care of and my husband isn't here to help me.
