Compulsive gambling, homeless on FridayI feel so insane I don't know what I'll end up doing. I haven't made a car payment in months, but don't worry the registration is expired and I have no insurance. I'm off my meds and I'm either anxious, scared, sad, or angry all day long. I work the night shift and I'm terribly isolated.

I've been an asshole to my family and they say "you've really changed Alex." I'm 40 with no partner and no kids. 

I got sober in 2014 and life was, for once, pretty fucking awesome. After three years I asked my psychiatrist for the good drugs, the add drugs and the anxiety drugs, and now I'm strung out and completely miserable. I want to go to treatment but my insurance deductible is 6000 dollars and every penny I get my hands on goes into the casino. Credit score 371 down from 700 six months ago.

I can't stand it anymore. Kill me now. I don't want to live. Fuck it.
