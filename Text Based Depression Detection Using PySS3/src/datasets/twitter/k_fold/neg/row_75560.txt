My BF thinks suicidal people are all weak, cowards and he has zero empathy for anyone who either wants to, attempts to, or has committed suicide (spoiler alert: I am sometimes suicidal)This is really just a rant I have to get off my chest. I donâ€™t even care of no one reads it. 

So quick background: I was clinically diagnosis with major depression, general anxiety disorder and OCD two years ago. Things got so bad I had my first psychosis episode and was hospitalized. I didnâ€™t believe I had any of those illnesses and initially thought the doctors were all stupid and diagnosing me with BS. But at the encouragement of my boyfriend (who I live with) and parents, also later realizing myself the doctors were probably right - upon discharge, I agreed to obtain outpatient services and have been treated ever since with weekly psychotherapy and daily medication.

Flash forward two years - Iâ€™m much better - no longer having suicidal thoughts, can hold down a job again, intrusive thoughts are much less frequent and am starting to feel joyful again. 

One of the suggestions of my therapist was to try to communicate with my boyfriend more - itâ€™s clear that we have some major unresolved conflicts and that may be a part of the reason why I have stress, depressive thoughts, and/or unhealthy anxiety. So Iâ€™ve been trying to have more conversations so we can work through major disagreements - but of course my boyfriend is resistive and isnâ€™t fond of difficult conservations. (I mean, who is?)

I wonâ€™t go through every disagreement lol this would be a novel. But one of the biggest one came up (again) last night. I mentioned (off hand) that Iâ€™m glad I donâ€™t have suicidal thoughts anymore. 

__Him:__ erm...thatâ€™s good but you had no reason to have suicidal thoughts in the first place.

__Me:__ well first of all I did have reasons...secondly I literally couldnâ€™t control those thoughts - they were intrusive and I couldnâ€™t not have them. 

__Him:__ can we not talk about suicide or bad/negative thoughts? Iâ€™m really uncomfortable with this topic. 

__Me:__ ok I know but thatâ€™s why I havenâ€™t talked to you about this pretty much ever - and I havenâ€™t even brought up suicide in two years with you.

__Him:__ ok so why bring it up now?

__Me:__ because youâ€™re my partner you said we can talk to each other about everything. Also earlier you said youâ€™re 100% emotionally supportive but I canâ€™t talk to you about mental health and negative thoughts?

__Him:__ I _am _completely supportive but some topics are off limits for some people.

__Me:__ but this is important to me and a part of my recovery process is to talk to close loved ones about my mental health - my parents and most of my close friends also are uncomfortable with this, so youâ€™re one of the few people left I could talk to.

__Him:__ so now your mental health is _my_ responsibility?

__Me:__ no I never said that, but youâ€™re just not a supportive partner if you refuse to even let me say one word about it.

__Him:__ What? So now youâ€™re judging me and calling me a bad partner because I donâ€™t want to talk about a very sensitive topic??

__Me:__ well not in those exact words but... kinda.

__Him:__ Excuuuuse me??? After all we went through? After everything I did for you for the past few years? Cooking for you? Trying to calm you down? After me being supportive the whole time in the hospital and even after?? _Iâ€™m_ a bad partner?!

__Me:__ well actually two years ago you actively discouraged me from going to the hospital and said â€œthereâ€™s nothing wrong with you youâ€™re not depressed.â€

__Him:__ _how_ could I have known??!! Iâ€™m not a doctor!!

__Me:__ you could have encouraged me to go see one?

__Him:__ I thought you were just having a bad day!

__Me:__ I had a bad 12 months and I said Iâ€™m not sad Iâ€™ve had highly negative thoughts for over 6 months. I told you this before I was diagnosed.

__Him:__ Again, I didnâ€™t know that was a cause for concern.

__Me:__ what about now? Youâ€™ve supposedly learned a lot about mental health in the last couple years you say - if a friend of yours told you theyâ€™ve been feeling depressive  for 6 months, would you encourage them to go see a doctor?

__Him:__ I donâ€™t know. Depends on who.

__Me:__ Bob (good friend of his, not his real name)

__Him:__ umm probably not, Bobâ€™s a pretty positive person and probably just having a bad period with work or something.

__Me:__ so...you wouldnâ€™t even recommend he talks to a doctor. Whatâ€™s the harm in that?

__Him:__ Iâ€™m not a doctor, and itâ€™s his responsibility to go see one.

__Me:__ but you can at least be a supportive friend.

__Him:__ _How_ am I not supportive?

__Me:__ earlier you said I can talk to you another _anything._ I guess not actually _anything._

__Him:__ of course you can talk to me about anything, _ANYthing_ and _EVERYthing_ in the whole world!

__Me:__ except negative thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ WHY do you want to talk to me about suicide? WHY? Are you suicidal right now? Do I need to take you to the hospital again?

__Me:__ uhh no...this whole conservation started with me saying I donâ€™t really have those thoughts anymore.

__Him:__ So WHY are you talking about it THEN???

__Me:__ because my doctor said itâ€™s important to talk about past trauma and talking about what it was like for me to be in a downward spiral. It helps me get even better.

__Him:__ ....

__Me:__ so...can I talk about bad thoughts and suicide?

__Him:__ ...

__Me:__ ok so two years ago I really wanted to kill myself.

__Him:__ see right there you lost me. Why? You had no reason to - you were a really positive person and super resilient to challenges you could work through anything.

__Me:__ it was an intrusive thought I couldnâ€™t control. 

__Him:__ do you have suicidal thoughts right now?

__Me:__ no.

__Him:__ then stop talking about it. Talk to me when you do have suicidal thoughts. Then Iâ€™ll take you to the hospital.

__Me:__ okay...can I talk to you about negative thoughts that are not suicidal?

__Him:__ no because you should be talking to a medical professional.

__Me:__ okay but my appointment is not for another week, it would make me feel better if I talked to someone now.

__Him:__ you want to know my opinion? __Suicidal thoughts and actions are a sign of weakness. And i _despise_ weakness. Itâ€™s wrong and I have no empathy, zero empathy for those types of thoughts or actions.__

__Me:__ actually Iâ€™d didnâ€™t ask for your opinion. I want you to listen to me talk about my experiences and just listen like a supportive partner would. You donâ€™t have to give any thoughts or opinions. But since you did - so you think Iâ€™m weak, you despise me and I deserve no empathy?

__Him:__ no I didnâ€™t say that.

__Me:__ ok so - you despise all weak suicidal people except me?

__Him:__ no youâ€™re putting words in my mouth.

__Me:__ literally what you said.

__Him:__ see? This is why I didnâ€™t want to talk about it. 

__Me:__ okay I get it. Talk to you about anything - except for negative mental health topics.

__Him:__ No!!! I never said that!!!

Anyway this went on for a while. Then I of course got angry and annoyed and said some not nice stuff I didnâ€™t mean. As of this morning he is still mad at me. And just now he said - I harassed him all night, was cruel, intentionally tried to hurt him by calling him not supportive and trying to blame my depression on him. Also I need to learn to drop things, know what types of topics to not bring up with someone but oh btw - I can talk to him about _anything._

__Me:__ so can i talk to you about suicide now?

__Him:__ OMG! When someone says â€œyou can talk to me about anythingâ€ you should know to just say â€œok, thanks.â€ Youâ€™re not supposed to IMMEDIATELY bring up something they ALREADY said theyâ€™re uncomfortable talking about!

__Me:__ lol.

Iâ€™ve suggested couples counselling to him many times, and for years. He refuses. He says the problem is almost 100% with me and Iâ€™m the only one who needs counselling.

Honestly - suicidal thoughts from two years ago - mostly caused by being a horrible work place with a terrible boss, along with arguing with an unsupportive partner at home, with my parents who are also verbally abusive and dismissive of my health concerns, and only one friend who even remotely believed I was depressed. Plus some other stuff I wasnâ€™t conscious of and couldnâ€™t control.

I know at the end of the day my mental health is no one elseâ€™s responsibility and itâ€™s up to me to seek help and treatment - which I did - I was the first person to think to go to the hospital initially even though I was skeptical. But Iâ€™d ideally just like a friend or family Iâ€™m close with who I can talk to about this stuff on occasion. But I guess you canâ€™t always depend on that. Strangers on the internet sometimes will - but itâ€™s still nice to have someone youâ€™re already close with be supportive of you. 

For anyone who wants to say - you should just break up with your boyfriend. Let me just tell you thatâ€™s not the first option. Weâ€™ve been together for more than 10 years, living together for most of that time, and are common law which is legally the same as married in my country (i.e. may need lawyers to help split). Plus i know for a fact because of this pandemic and loss of hours at work - he canâ€™t afford to live on his own. For me, I could move in with my parents - but theyâ€™re sometimes very abusive and it could be an even worse situation for me to be in. 

Anyway rant over. Sorry that was so long. __tl;dr__ just read the title lol. Thanks for listening.
