No i won't suicide, but it sure is crossing my mind at this point.First of all, don't worry about me, I won't kill myself, I'm to scared I'll fuck it up. this is essentially a post to vent.

Got a call today saying the job I was expecting to get next month decided they don't want me because I'm becoming a uni student in September. Without this job I can't move out to the city where my uni is, and therefore, I won't be able to go to uni (it's too far away to get there reasonably from where I live, 3 Hours driving and I don't even know how to drive.).

So. I have a choice to make.

I have 1 month left of rent where I'm living, I can try to find a job in that time, apartment, and go for it. But if I fuck up that's it, no returning, nothing left back here.

Or I can stay here, secure in my place, job that earns me money for this place and living. Downside? I fucking hate my miserable life. I miss the opportunity to go to university. And I carry on knowing I missed my only chance.

Vent over

Less than 24 hours to decide. Or just kill myself. But let's be serious.
