The sad realization that I will never see my futureI have recently seen every outcome of my life as a suicide. I donâ€™t see another way I could live life to the fullest or even be happy. Iâ€™m so sorry to the people I have let down, mostly my parents and my girlfriend for years these two have been my motor. Itâ€™s sad now that they have failed. I cried today because I woke up. Itâ€™s sad seeing myself go on. I think Iâ€™m gonna go through with it. But I donâ€™t want it to hurt. I donâ€™t want to hurt anymore.
