There are so many ways to die in my house.It's 4 in the morning and again I can't sleep. Always so freaking tired, but my eyes never stay closed. Just as tired as I'll ever be.  *Why am I this way?* 

My relationship is failing, every other day he says he's so happy, but the next I need to pack my sht and leave. I've never felt so happy or such a sense of belonging before him, and I've always tried my hardest to get this love which I have never received.
*WHY am I this way?!*

And the worst part is?
I have nowhere to go if he leaves.
My family hates me, I'm not welcome there. His family is mine, so they're all I've got. I quit my career, we signed on a house. Were trying for children this year... 
*Why must my life always go this way?!*

I don't have friends. They're all his. *Who would want me anyway?*

I've always tried my best, but life has always sent me spiraling into the dirt. 
I'm young, but I'm already SO. DONE.

*Why must it be this way?*
I don't have the strength
I don't want to go on
There's nothing left 
             For
                       Me
Here.
