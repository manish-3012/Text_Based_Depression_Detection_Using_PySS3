My birthday is in half an hour, but why even botherTomorrow is my birhday  (in half an hour). I don't know how i got so far.. I found this reddit and I don't know why I even post this. But my will to life is more or less gone... No one who loves me. Is there even a reason to live more than 20 years in this miserable life
