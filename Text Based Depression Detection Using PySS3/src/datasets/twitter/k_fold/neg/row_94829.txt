Help. Suicidal thoughts.I don't know what to do any more. I feel like I've tried everything and yet my eating disorder is worse than ever. I've been to therapy, I've tried a regular exercise and diet plan, I've tried intuitive eating and nothing's worked. I'm stuck in an endless cycle of restricting and bingeing permanently and I just want to end it. It's been going on for so long now I can't even see myself without it. I've forgotten what that life is like. I honestly can't love myself anymore. All I feel is hatred when I think of me.
I've tried to talk with my parents who are overly controlling about how to change things but again they do not listen. It's only my perception according to them. They are innocent and I am at fault.
I'm killing myself and my relationship slowly and I feel like I just don't deserve life anymore. I'm toxic.  I'm a problem. Everything I've tried falls flat. The only reason I've not hanged myself is my boyfriend and the thought of me one day being able to be a happy mother to our kids. That feels impossible now. More than anything I want to just die. At least then everything will move on.
