Caught at a strange stand-stillI've been planning to die for as long as I can remember. Countless plans have fallen through, due to changes in other's schedules that would result in them possibly finding me, me not being to able to write down everything I wanted and get mt affairs in order in time..... things like that.

This time, I finally got everything in order, and I have a real opprotunity in front of me. I have my will, my belongings, everything set to go, all my appointments and autopay plans are canceled, I have a clear plan on how to get my money in order as well, and a plan on how to make sure mt roommates/friends don't find my body. Finally, I'm. Set. As set as I'll ever be.

Buf I think I made a mistake in staying up all night to write down as much as I could. I'm so horribly sleep deprived I've lost steam, all I can think about is sleep. And I'm *sick*, incredibly, painfully ill all of a sudden, probably a result of days of very little sleep or food.

My plan requires walking a long long way in the cold to take care of the money. I have to make sure my roommates are set with that before I can die. But i feel *horrifically* ill. I don't even know if I'll make it.

So I'm caught at this strange stand-still. The plan is already in motion. I may not have this kind of setup ever, evdr again. I'm so tired. But I suddenly feel lost. Should I get up and go now, should I go to work and play normal somehow, should I sleep and then hopefully be able to fulfill the plan when I wake up......? 

I can't do nothing. The plan is in motion. I can't go "back to normal". I can't keep going like this. But I can't get up, can't go anywhere, but I can't just lie here until reality comes to get me one way or another.

I don't know if any of that made sense. I don't know why I'm even telling you all this. I just don't have anyone or anywhere else to tell.

I'm going...... to sleep, I think. And figure out what to do when I wake. I don't know. I don't know.
