Yeah soI know this is suicide watch or whatever. But honestly I dont care. I'm just tired of cookie cutter responses from doctors or whatever. So I slit my wrist about 6 months ago. My left. Down to the bone. I was so fucking close. And my mom showed up unexpectedly. So I live. \(lifetime major scarring, reattachment of tendon etc.\) Fun. So for the last 12 years I have been describing this sorta of....uncomfortable feeling.. to doctors.   
In your life have you ever had someone point or threaten to throw some kind of projectile at you? There is this...unnerving..sorta laser focused antsy feeling. I have that combined with deperession and general anxiety all of the time. I don't panic and my mood swings only last for 10\-15 seconds. \(One tear out of each eye followed by a laugh.\) These effects totally random. I have had this since i was 14 years old. I am 28 now. They've given me every SSRI there is plus crap like trazadone, seraque..etc...  
Eventually they just gave me Benzos. Honestly they work the best but weaning off benzos is kind of a thing with docs now so...basically....what the fuck am I to do?
