You know that feeling when you hate yourself so fucking much and feel no point in life that you really desire to kill yourself but are to fucking chicken of death? I'm on that ledge way too fucking muchSo I hate who I am but I've been trying to better myself to like how I look. I've gone to the gym, changed up my hairstyle and groomed up a nice beard. I have thought that I look good which was exciting cuz I was going to an annual party and there was a girl I've had a crush on there. We hung out last year and I was feeling confident. I get there and self-deprication set in. I avoided her cuz I was such a fucking loser. Hung out with some people I'm comfortable with instead. Party just not taking off for me. Later on (when only me and my best friend were the only guys left) I went to the bathroom. While in there I overheard my crush and another girl talking. I could hear only some of the conversation but they were talking about my friend and another guy (which I assume was me). I was described as "not found as cute" while they talked forever about my friend, who they new was married, but "hes not wearing a wedding ring". They flirted with him for an hour trying to get him to go to a club with them while I was just fucking treated like I don't exist. Sorry for the lame bullshit stupid story but it has totally killed my will to live right now. I know I'm pathetic for feeling this way but it's killing me right now. I just want to die, but I can't muster up any guts to fucking go through with it. I just wanted to get that off my chest. Sorry for the long pathetic story, I'm a little drunk lol
