What the rulesExcuse the title, I was just seeing what I can put as usually it takes 4 or 5 attempts to get an actual post posted! So anyway, my lifeâ€™s went from bad to worse! I still have nowhere to live so when I go to see my son I sleep in my car, Iâ€™m still under investigation for codeine theft even though I have confessed to the addiction! I have stopped taking the codeine but yesterday I was called down to the office. Expecting to receive court dates or something instead I was placed under arrest because they found a pornographic image on my phone! Iâ€™m not sure what they found but I can guarantee itâ€™s not something I have sourced! I have been nothing but cooperative throughout all this but this is the straw thatâ€™s broke the camels back! Iâ€™m 100s of mikes from my friends and family, I suffer anxiety, depression, my knees are in agony but I canâ€™t go and get them seen to as they will think Iâ€™m just trying to get painkillers! I canâ€™t go to the dining area as when the police arrested me the took me to the dining area in front of everyone! I canâ€™t see how I can go on like this, the only thing keeping me going is my son but I know feel that all I will cause him in life as his dads a downbeat drug addict who will soon have no house and no job, no money, no prospects, no life, no real point going on to be honest!
