Is this normal?Hey guys, ive always wondered if what happens to me is normal or i have something that i don't know. I don't consider myself depressed, or maybe i'm and i don't even know, but anyway, i don't think killing myself is a problem. Like i always plan my suicide, but i don't have any motive to do that, i just don't see any purpose in living, but im not sad! I just think our life system is broken, i don't wanna work for the rest of my life, i don't wanna be stuck in this world not being free... Maybe one day i will kill myself, but not bc im depressed, just because you know? I don't know if i described it right, i don't think i put it in the right words, but its basically it! I always think about killing myself but i seem normal and healthy! Its just something that seems normal to me... i never told that to anyone!
