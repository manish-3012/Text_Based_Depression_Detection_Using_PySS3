I'm so tiredHow can people be happy with living? How can we be fulfilled with any life. Everything seems so pointless and I feel like the weight of life is crushing my chest and making it hard for me to breath or even get out of bed. I'm so tired, all I want to do is kill myself, and not have these pointless responsibilities anymore.
