Does it get easier?I feel like life is pointless again. I was suicidal about a year a go and managed to climb out the hole but I can feel myself slipping back in. I still suffer a bit from anxiety and depression but felt like i was making major improvements. I found a job and stopped medicating with drugs. However these past couple of weeks my job has got my down and ive started smoking weed again and taking coke on the weekends to cope. Every night I feel completely alone and im unsure what the point of getting better is. The worlds still really grey no matter how long i wait or how hard I try. Im trying really hard to keep going but is almost like the world doesn't want me to.
