Probably going to kill myself sometime this monthI'm only writing this because I can't tell anyone in my life because I'll just get sent to hospitals, which would make me feel more uncomfortable than it already is. 

I've been unemployed for nearly a year, my last job lasted only a few months before my life crumbled, lost my girl and my puppy and in turn had a panic attack and was relieved of work.

I messed up my chances with welfare, I lied about some things that I can't fix, so have been rejected. I don't even have the requirements to qualify (a place to rent) 

I'm in too much debt for student loans, my family is doomed for failure and I think I've burned all of my options. 

Anyways, fuck the world, I'm not useful here and never have been.
