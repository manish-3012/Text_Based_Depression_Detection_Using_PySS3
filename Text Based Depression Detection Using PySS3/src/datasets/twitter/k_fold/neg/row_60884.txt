I tried to overdoseI tried to take a handful of prescription meds in the shower. I ended up spitting them out. Iâ€™m 90% certain I didnâ€™t swallow any. I did it because I donâ€™t think I can handle my friendships anymore. Let me explain..

I say good morning, get nothing back. I say I love you, nothing. And before you say itâ€™s early, theyâ€™re both at least two hours ahead.

I try to leave and thatâ€™s when the â€œI love youâ€ comes out. The â€œyouâ€™re my best friendâ€ and â€œdonâ€™t leaveâ€ and â€œif you want to talk more, we can talk more.â€ And then what? I stay, we talk a few days and then radio silence. Over and over, itâ€™s always the same thing. And I keep tearing myself apart over it. 

Theyâ€™re just busy.
Theyâ€™re sleeping.
Theyâ€™re taking a break.
Stop being selfish.
Youâ€™re annoying, thatâ€™s why they donâ€™t answer.
Stop texting, youâ€™re annoying them.
Nobody likes you anyways.
Who would want to talk to you?
Theyâ€™re sick of you.
Stop bothering them.
Kill yourself, make everyone happy.
Nobody would notice if youâ€™re gone. Nobody would care.

And part of me wants to walk away and not look back. Even knowing that Iâ€™d come running like a dog when they call me.

Because the other part canâ€™t leave. Canâ€™t abandon them. Theyâ€™re my best friends, and I promised Iâ€™d always be there, and how can I if Iâ€™m gone? I love them and they make my life so much better. They make me happy..

But still..Iâ€™m tired of putting in effort and getting no results. Would it really hurt so much, sparing a few seconds to say good morning back? Or even first for once? 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Leave and possibly hurt them? Stay and go on like this? Honestly, I just wish I had been brave enough to swallow those pills.
