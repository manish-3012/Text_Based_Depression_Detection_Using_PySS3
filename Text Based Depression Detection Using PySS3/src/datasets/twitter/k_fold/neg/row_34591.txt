They were right..Recently I got diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I know it isn't much, it isn't cancer or anything big, but it's a shackle for me in terms of ever getting anywhere in life. No one will ever accept a student if they have BDP or hire you if you have it. It causes so many more troubles in relationships with all people. I don't want it to define me but every time I try to better myself, it brings me down and reminds me that it's here and that I'm not in control.

I can't do this anymore. It overwhelms me too much and it kills me inside. I am not strong enough to continue with this fight. O captain, my captain, this ship has crashed and burned.
