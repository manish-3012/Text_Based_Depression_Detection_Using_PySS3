I canâ€™t wait for it to all be overIâ€™m so tired of the constant anxiety. Iâ€™m always on edge and the flashbacks are unbearable. The activities I used to enjoy are now dull and tedious. I canâ€™t seem to connect with anyone...

Iâ€™m not meant to be loved and cared for. I am just an object to be used and discarded.
