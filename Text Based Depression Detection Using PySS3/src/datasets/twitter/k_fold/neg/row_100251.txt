I have back to back finals for 6 hours straight and I'll be leaving to take them in less than 5 hours. If I don't do well enough to get A's I'm going to kill myselfI've spent hours studying but I've never had a worse semester. Because of the path I am taking B's are unacceptable. There is no way I can fix things if I don't do well enough. It's my fault for being such a failure.
