my parents don't care anymoreI'm 20, studying, living with my parents. Been depressed since 5th grade. They never trusted psychiatrists so I never got help except for random spiritual people. Nowadays, when I say or even shout: I'll kill myself, they just say: then you'll go to hell and it will be worse. No emotion. My mother is a facebook addict, my father is addicted to tv. Technology took away the only people I had. 

Every day for me is like this: I return from college, my mom gives me something to eat and only talks about food. Whenever I try to talk about anything else she deliberately starts avoiding me and simply walks away. She goes to her facebook and watches videos of cats and talented people. Father returns and watches sports or some documentary. I go back to my room, watch youtube, maybe do some homework. Whenever I can't show any happiness, all I get a day later: what possesed you yesterday? I pet my cat, the only creature in this world that shows me real love, eat everything I can find, since it's the only love I can get. Go to sleep. Wake up and try to change for the better. Then run out of energy and sleep.

Yesterday I tied a belt around my neck. It felt very good to know that the door out of this hell is just the matter of gravity. Of letting go. Only fear of failing keeps me back. Not for long.
