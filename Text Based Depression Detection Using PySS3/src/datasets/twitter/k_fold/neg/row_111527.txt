Going through a rough patch, need someone to talk to.Been going through a rough patch for the past few days. I was able to keep it together but a financial loss has triggered me back into a massive depressive spiral. I know the financial loss itself is actually small, and money is nothing to ever get worried about. But it pushed the snowball of madness down the hill again and it just stop. I'm keep thinking of all my mistakes and failures in life. This financial loss wasn't external, it was due to my mistakes, and that's probably why i'm panicking right now. What if i do it again? etc.etc.etc.

I think i'm having an anxiety attack that won't go away. I can't eat and barely sleep. I'm kinda freaking out right now for no good reason. I'm finding it hard to breath.

I don't really need a solution (there is none), I just don't want to feel alone right now. Anyone out there? how are your lives going?
