Ive one week left to live. Here are my last words.Context - 33 years old. Depressive personality. Suffered from grief over fathers death and cultural/identity issues forever. Wife of 6 tears cheated and left me suddenly leaving me almost financially destitute and alone. Am staying with friends trying to recuperate now but nothingâ€™s working, including counselling, exercise, making plans - all the positive self love bullshit. Decided to end my life as soon as I return from this trip, next week on Monday/Tuesday. Have just drafted my suicide note and chosen how Im going to do it (jumping from a great height). Misery loves company so I am sharing my note with you. Trigger warning etc. Seeya. 

I am sorry
I hate myself so much
I feel like a mistake
And every day that Im here I take someone elses air and space
Self love and the idea that deserve anything are bullshit
but especially so for me.
I got everything I deserve and dont have the strength to expect any more
I am tired
I am running on fumes
Just want this to end
To exit this stage and bow out from everyones lives.
I am sorry. I hate myself too much.
I hate everything I was, everything I have become, everything I lost and will never be.
And as much as I love you, I hate myself more. I dont have the strength to love myself or anyone else any more. I will have ended my life by the time you finish reading this. Of the two people I love most, one has denied that I have any worth at all, and the other is not here. I go to join him now.
I am sorry. Goodbye.
