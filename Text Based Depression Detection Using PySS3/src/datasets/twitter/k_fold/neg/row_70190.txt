Update on therapyFirst day consisted entirely of administrative matters. I'm trying so hard to get help but it feels like everything is standing in my way or delaying that help. I can't deal with that frustration right now.

Also, my girlfriend told me she's had recent thoughts of suicide because of me. Later, she said she needed "time apart" because my depression is making her angry.
