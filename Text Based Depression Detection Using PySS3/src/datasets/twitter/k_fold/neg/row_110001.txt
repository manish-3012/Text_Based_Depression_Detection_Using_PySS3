Game over...I'm not looking for advice, I'm not asking anybody to save me. Tonight I just want to die. Nothing is getting better. I've given it time. Im not strong enough to keep going on my own... Im just tired of waking up everyday and being so hated and abused... So tonight I take my leave, I just wanted to say goodbye to you guys on this subreddit... You're the only people who ever tried making me better...
