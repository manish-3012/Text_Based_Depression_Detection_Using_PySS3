adviceIâ€™ve been going through a lot of shit for nearly 2 years now and i donâ€™t see it getting any better. i mostly spend my time thinking of suicide, specifically how i will do it and in detail. during my worst episodes i will research drugs and anything i can that will kill me but so far i have not found anything that is easily accessible and will do the job. does anyone know what drugs i can take that will kill me, thanks.
