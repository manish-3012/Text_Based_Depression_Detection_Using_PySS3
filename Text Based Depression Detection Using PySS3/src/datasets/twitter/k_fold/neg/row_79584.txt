I wonder when will I finally breakI know I can't kill myself not because I don't actually want to die but because I have low pain tolerance and I'm a pessimist. I'd expect whatever attempt I tried would fail and it'd just make my situation worse but I feel like something will make me snap and I'll end up doing it. 

There are 2 more weeks before my family finds out that I dropped out of college and I just kinda gave up on faking my school documents this time. Like I don't even care anymore but I'm still scared of what to come. It's like I just don't want to think anymore but I fucking have to if I don't want to get scolded. Maybe that's for the better because if they find out and I finally snap then I can finally end myself.

I'm mostly just sleeping this off. I just can't stand to be awake and have to think about every single thing that I've done that's going to upset and disappoint my family. I couldn't explain what I'm feeling to them. They will never get it.
