Heading to Hawaii with family Friday, might kill myself beforehandI've posted on here previously on this account but things are a bit more drastic than before. You can always go read through my previous postings to get a better background if you want. Long story short, I'm an 18 year old male that lives on the east coast. I'm down in another state with my mom where her fiancee and his kids live. We're leaving for Hawaii early Friday morning for a weeklong trip.

I've been very depressed lately due to things like being on probation (smoking weed in an illegal state, was doing it to self medicate), issues with my girlfriend who i really love but now lives hours away for college, and an overall nonhope for life.

I've only attempted suicide once before which was years ago and since then I've been too scared to try it but I really want to now. I don't want to go on this trip or anything. I want to go see my girlfriend and feel better in some way. I want to run away if I need to tomorrow and I don't know what else to do.
