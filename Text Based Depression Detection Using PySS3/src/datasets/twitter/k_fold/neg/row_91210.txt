Im screwed at this pointI wanted to start school a bit hopeful that I would be able to be a junior next year. I was doing ok and now I have given up again. I'm self harming again. Dissociating like a mother fucker every time something triggers a memory and to top all that off I started smoking pot to get my mind off things. My meds won't work for shit so what else am I gonna do? All I think about is killing myself and I really need a way out of it.
