i have no will to live anymorehonestly i'm debating just ending it. i have no friends, no lovers, no one fucking cares about me and they say they do then they're lying. i'm stuck in a dead end job and i still live with my parents. i can't afford to move out or go to college and i can't apply for loans. i've seriously run out of reasons to get up in the morning. i don't see a way out of this
