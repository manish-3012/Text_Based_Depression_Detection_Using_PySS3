Gone off the deep endIt feels like I canâ€™t breath I do everything so wrong. I wish I could go somewhere and be forgotten. Let me live alone and isolated. Itâ€™s all I want anymore. I hate interacting with people. I hate everyone right now. everyone says â€œdeath is the unknown.â€ I feel like when I die itâ€™ll be like sinking into a lake. So quiet and calm. Nothing to break the calm and silence
