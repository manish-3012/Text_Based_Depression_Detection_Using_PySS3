An endless cycleHello guys, Iâ€™m new here but I have nowhere else to speak my mind. Iâ€™m really tired, of my life, of how my mental illnesses affect me, and of my recent break up that has cause irreparable damage. I feel like my life has always been a cycle and the worst part is that people care about me and worry. Donâ€™t worry about me, itâ€™s just going to harm you. Iâ€™m sorry for everyone I hurt, I just couldnâ€™t control my mind. I ruined relationships to friends, my parents, and my ex. I just need a motivation to push me to kill myself, I wish a day where to happen where I say fuck it and go ahead and do it. Iâ€™m sorry to everyone in my life but Iâ€™m tired of suffering. I feel like I was just born to suffer, my head hurts and Iâ€™m over analyzing so many things. Time doesnâ€™t seem to help nor have my meds helped me. I just want to lay in my bed all day, I donâ€™t want to wake up. I just want to ask God to end my life, for him to hug me and make all my misery end. I have always told myself that I have needed help, but I realized is that all I need to is to end my life. To finally get some peace and quite, to finally escape my mind and not feel trapped.
