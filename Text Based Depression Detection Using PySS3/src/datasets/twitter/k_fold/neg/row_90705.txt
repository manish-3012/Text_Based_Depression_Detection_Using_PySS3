Something is wrong with my brain. I'm fine for two weeks, then get a scalpel fantasy in my hand. Its so fucking stupid.I'm in my thirties.

I'm so fucking bored with what I'm doing. I took ten fucking years just to be able to buy groceries. Before I was taking pay day loans and food banks, and noone knew. Until I got drunk and told my bipolar mom about it.

But (I had noone to talk too. And she helped me through it. I see her now, getting better ever 2-3 weeks, and its hurtful, because we haven't been close for at least 8 years. But I'm back to being six years old, taking care of her for a saltine cracker or a soup. It's horror, because its like treading water on a real "mother" and its still, not.

I've been great with other things like working 60 hours a week. I've almost sliced my arms to bits without mys ister. She has a few kids. My cute nephew and neice. 

I don't want them to grow up with the suicide of their uncle. Who seems so happy and strong.

But I'm fucking not.) Parantheses' gone.

I'm so fucking tired. 

I think you need friends, family, lovers to exist. Two makes it acceptable. To try more.

You miss those two, its pretty hard. No friends. No family. No lovers, and mix and match.

My sister caught me drinking two fifths and showed up with my neice and newphew when I ran my head into a wall. She didn't know, but I dented my skull.

I'm so fucking tired.

Every 5 years my life resets.

I lose a fucking job, I lose all my friends. Its fucking brutal. I can't tell you (or maybe I can here) how hard it is to invite yourself out for months, and get rejected.

Yet, I'm the "happy" guy who can talk to a hundred people at some stupid networking event for work.

I'm very tired.

Not sure what to do.

Honestly, I just don't want my neice and nephew to grow up with their fun uncle killing themselves.

But I'm so tired. I'm so sad. I so done.

Thank for reading.
