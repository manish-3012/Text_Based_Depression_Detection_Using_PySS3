What happens if I go to the hospital tonight? Do I lose my job? Will they lock me up?I have heard horror stories of people not being able to get out of hospitals which is my worst nightmare but I want to kill myself so badly tonight. My life is ruined. I called out a famous person who stole writing from me and now I got blacklisted. There is no going back because I don't have proof, it's all on a hard drive in New Hampshire. I don't want to be alive. I can't do this anymore. I want to go to a hospital but I don't want to be locked up. I have to go to work next week and if I don't show up I'm scared I'll lose my job
