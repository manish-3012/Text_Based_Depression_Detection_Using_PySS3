How can I escape pain?I feel like Iâ€™m always enduring pain. This isnâ€™t fair. Iâ€™m not okay.

Iâ€™m so alone. I hurt so much. Iâ€™m inadequate and worthless in every respect/way. Iâ€™m doing awful in my school and learning Spanish. All that I have brought to other people is stress, pain, and suffering because I just burden them.

I donâ€™t understand how people live. I donâ€™t understand how they endure the agony. I donâ€™t know. Why am I even alive? Thereâ€™s no purpose. Iâ€™m depressed, hopeless, and lonely.

I hurt.

I feel angry, bitter, and jealous, too. Itâ€™s not fair that I hurt. Itâ€™s not fair. I feel so angry at people - why do they get to enjoy life, but I donâ€™t? Why is my life a painful train wreck, but thereâ€™s isnâ€™t? And why the flying fuck do I experience stabbing pains inside of me even when nothing is in me while other people manage to enjoy sex somehow? Iâ€™m so defective and worthless.

I feel worried and obsessed. I feel obsessed about a partner being able to enjoy themselves. Itâ€™s not fair that other people enjoy everything. Itâ€™s not fucking fair.

How can I escape/numb this pain?
