Having flashbacks to my attempt again...I didn't really realize it was an attempt at the time.

In hindsight, it was. And I wish it would have worked properly. I was living with the girl I had had a major thing for for years. She just saw me as a friend. She had just broken up with her boyfriend of years. I let her crash at my place for awhile. I had been depressed for years at this point, coping with unbelievable shit, shit that just goes on till this day.

She left for the night, she was going to be back later. I collected my weapons of choice. My bathtub, a few bottles of wine, a bottle of Jack Daniels, the film Heavy Metal, and Black Sabbath, Kyuss and Electric Wizard albums.

After destroying a bottle of wine and half the Jack Daniels to Masters of Reality, I put on Heavy Metal. Finishing the Jack Daniels was transcendental at this point, simply an exercise in what was right. I was merely drinking out of pure rage.

After the film had concluded, I began to run the tub, hoping to finish the wine and simply drown.

I woke up a few hours later in ice cold water shivering and watched a few episodes of Law and Order, laughing the whole thing off when she got back.


Once I get back on my own, away from my fucking family, I'm going back to try the whole thing again. There's simply no point anymore.
