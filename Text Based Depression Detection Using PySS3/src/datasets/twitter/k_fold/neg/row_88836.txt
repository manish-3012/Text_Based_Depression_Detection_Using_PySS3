Update: Cake DayHey,
  
  
I made this account as a throwaway two years ago. A lot has changed since then and I'm not gonna sugarcoat it:  
  
  

#Half of it was 2020.  
   
  
But I can say that I am glad that I'm here.   
  
I'm glad that I got help from a lot of friends who cared and I'm thankful for the compassion I found on this sub when I was at the...  
  
_darkest,_  
_most despondent,_   
_emotionally numb,_  
_socially desolate,_  
_wasteland of suffering,_
_arid desert of nothingness_
  
...time of my life that I thought would go on forever though I reallywished would just spontaneously end.  
  
  
...but I didn't
  
and I made it through...  
  
...and I'm so grateful I did.
  
  
So on my only cake day post I'll ever make I would like to say:
  
##Thank you all

To everyone here and I would like to say even when if feels like there is no hope (at least for me there wasn't because I couldn't see it) there is still a reason to continue on and I found myself a stronger and more empathetic person for persevering through all of it. 
  
So, again.
  
Thank you all.  

Especially the mods.
