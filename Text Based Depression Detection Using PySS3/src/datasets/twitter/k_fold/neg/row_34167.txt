I'm giving up today :[I feel like my life really is just fucking over. 

I have nothing. Lost my wife. Not a single real life friend. No job or money. No hope of ever having a job and keeping it. Even if i could keep it, it would be a shity minimum wage job. I cant ever see myself having a real career. No hope of ever finding a woman that id have anything to offer. I have nothing to look forward to. I can't even go out of my house 9 out of 10 days. It takes me **days** to get up the nerve just to go out and just get food once and a while. I hate being looked at. I feel disgustingly ugly. I cannot **STAND** the silence of being alone 24 hours a day. I also cannot stand going out. I hate most people and all social situations. I just can't function like a normal person. I don't fit in anywhere. Why should i live to be alone? I have really bad anxiety and sometimes panic attacks. I don't see this ever getting better. No help from doctors or the 'system'. I'm just fucking done.

I do have great parents but that's not enough to live life for. I'm scared but i just can not take it anymore. I'm not an immediate risk or anything. No real 'plan'. I've just accepted that this is what i need. Whatever is wrong with me **is** terminal. :(
