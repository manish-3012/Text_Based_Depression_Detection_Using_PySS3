No one cares about me when i'm alive, no one cares about me if i'm deadI have no one I can count on for support. No one cares about me or loves me. I tried overdosing before and I want to do it again because I like how peaceful it is and I really hope I succeed next time. My family gave me so much crap for my intentional overdose attempt and said I was doing it just to get back at my mom or some crap when in reality I did it because of cyberbullying. My family spreads lies all the time about me and paints me as a bad person. I hate them all. They don't care that I'm depressed and hurting. I hate everyone and life itself. If I do succeed in killing myself they will be glad I'm gone finally.
