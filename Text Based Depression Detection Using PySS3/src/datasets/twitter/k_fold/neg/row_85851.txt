I feel like a waste of space nobody will even notice Iâ€™m goneIâ€™m an outcast. Whenever I try to come out of my shell people go out of their way to make sure I know I donâ€™t belong. My parents and family see me as nothing but a disappointment. The people around me are always telling me they care but never bother answering my texts or picking up their phone when I call. Iâ€™m just a waste of space in a world where nobody wants me around. If I killed myself nobody would even realize it until they were notified, and even then they would be thrilled Iâ€™m not around. Iâ€™m doing everything I can to hold on but Iâ€™m hanging on by a thread.
