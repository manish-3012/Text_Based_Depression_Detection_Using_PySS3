being admitted to a psych ward this week. can anyone tell me what their general experience was like?i'm just incredibly scared and unprepared but this is my only option left other than just killing myself and i'm having so many second thoughts about it but i know i can't back out (i am the one admitting myself, nobody is forcing me to do it). i need to get better but i'm so terrified of being there alone. i'm only 18 and i don't even know if they separate by age at the hospital where i live. i'm so scared. especially of older men.
