Whole body hurts all the time, tired, weak, making me want to give up.Hey everyone. I've been struggling for the past 4 months when an illness/disease that is taking my vision, giving me incredible pain and weakness and making my job almost impossible. I have  gone to a doctor and they don't know what it is, I am so tired it's almost impossible to function. My joints hurt no matter what I'm doing. My eyes and muscles are burning almost 24/7, I tried everything I can to help it but over the counter pain medicine is not helping.


I'm only 17 and I'm otherwise very healthy, I was happy that I moved into an apartment and has a stable job, but something is tearing me apart. I really want to be freed from this pain. I'm not financially able to pay for more medical tests, I can barely work as it is and I just don't see any reason to go on. My vision went from /20/20 to 20/60 in a few days, it just gets worse.
