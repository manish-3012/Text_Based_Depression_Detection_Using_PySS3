my fiance is dead and i cant relate to anyone or feel anything anymorei lost him on the third day of june. he was the love of my life. he was rotting alone in the hospital for 6 weeks and i wasnt allowed to see him. ive been doing drugs drinking and fucking since then and spending most of my time tryiung to be unconscious because every waking moment hurts. nothing is good anymore. i just want him back and it will never happen. being a widow in my 20s was never part of the plan. no one can relate to it. my friends are ghosting me and so is my family. everyone is shit and no one understands. their only frame of reference is a bad breakup. i was supposed to grow old and grey with him. i dont know if it was suicide or just an accident and i dont know whats more heartbreaking. i have a noose but im scared that im going to fuck it up and end up with brain damage instead. but i know i cant handle this much longer.
