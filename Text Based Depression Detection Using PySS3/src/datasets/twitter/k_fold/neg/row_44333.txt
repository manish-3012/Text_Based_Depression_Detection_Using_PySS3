I lost the one person that kept me from ending it allSorry if this is convoluted and too long. I just have no one to talk to and needed a place to vent. I feel like every aspect of my life sucks right now and thereâ€™s no escaping it.         

A month and a half ago, I lost my mom unexpectedly. She was my only motivation to stay alive. She was the one person that made me feel like I was worth something and my best friend.  She made me feel loved and like my existence mattered. If it werenâ€™t for her, I wouldâ€™ve ended it years ago.      

Now, my family can barely afford to pay our bills because she was the breadwinner and my dad is unemployed. I also doubt that heâ€™ll find anything anytime soon because my country is still skyrocketing in covid cases.     
My sister will probably have to quit the university that she loves because we canâ€™t afford it anymore.      
Iâ€™m stuck in a job that I hate, that pays me like crap and makes me feel humiliated and dumb every single day. I tried applying for other jobs but there arenâ€™t many available and I donâ€™t have enough experience yet. So I keep getting rejection after rejection.           
All my friends already seem tired of dealing with me grieving so I stopped opening up. I know I should seek therapy but I simply canâ€™t afford it now.      
Iâ€™m also ugly, fat and unlovable. Itâ€™s my third time attempting to lose weight and I just canâ€™t do it. I always end up bingeing and feeling disgusted with myself.       

I know I just have to keep on living because Iâ€™m the only one with a job at the moment and because it would be too selfish to put my family through that again so soon after my mom passing, but I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I have nothing to look forward to and Iâ€™m just tired of feeling like a constant failure and disappointment. Iâ€™ll never find happiness.
