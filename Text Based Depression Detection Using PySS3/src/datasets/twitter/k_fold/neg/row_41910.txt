I dont feel anythingIm diagnosed bipolar. i dont like feeling any type of emotion its mentally exhausting. I dont care how i die, burn, drown, crushed, it means absolutely nothing to me the result is the same anyways. I fake my happiness, i fake my sorrow, i fake everything, im fake. Life is a scam. I dont care if i die alone. I'm young, i know i will be successful but none of that matters. My mind is jail for me, i hate this life with a passion, i hate a lot. I dont need help, i just need to escape and vanish. Maybe the other option is to change my name and move to another country and separate from everything i know. Just kill me.
