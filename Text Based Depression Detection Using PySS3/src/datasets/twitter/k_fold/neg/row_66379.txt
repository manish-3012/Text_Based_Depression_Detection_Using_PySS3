I swore I'd never let myself get like this again.Before, I was a mess. I cut and I burned and I hit myself. Its all I could think about. I hated everything, barely left the house, had no friends, family had given up on me. There was no point to my existence. Then I tried to end it all. After it failed, I realised this is bad. This is real bad and it needs to change. I can't keep doing this to myself, even if I do deserve it. From there, it got better. I was happier, made a couple of friends, was talking to my family again, went out and did things. This only lasted a couple of months. Here I am back in the same fucking situation as before. All I can think about now is how I want to die. No it will not get better a second time. I wasted my first chance. I just don't know what to do anymore. My life isn't heading anywhere so what's the point of continuing?
