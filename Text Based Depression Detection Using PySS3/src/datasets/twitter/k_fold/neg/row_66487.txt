Got drunk tried to kill my self.I've been with my girlfriend for 6 months and she's the only girl I've ever loved this way before, I spent 3 months with her before I got sent to Kenya for 3 months for work those 3 months before were perfect I felt happiness like I've never felt before, the 3 months away was so hard without her I have terrible anxiety and all I did was worry she doesn't feel the same about me my girlfriend suffers from depression and when I got back last week when she is going through a bad phase (so she tells me) she goes in a terrible mood and doesn't want to be touched anyone near her or even to talk much she's been like this all week and tells me I just need to give her space because this is her way of coping, and I'm trying my best but my brain can't understand and I just panicked about it and think that she doesn't like me anymore, so this week we are in Latvia her home where we flew out from the uk last week so she could show me her home and meet family etc, I've been super depressed and struggling all week because all I need right now is her but all she needs is space so I can't even hold her to cheer me up, I lost control last night and drug almost a litre of vodka and I tried to kill my self by jumping out a 2 story window (haha drunken me things that would work) I'm covered in bruises head to toe and my face is all swollen up cut and bruised, all her family and my girlfriend and her family friends know what happened and heard all the commotion I caused they tried to put me to sleep but I just kept trying to drown my self in the lake..... My girlfriend told them about my depression and the fact I lost my tablets 2 days ago and haven't taken them...... I'm so ashamed and embarrassed, and Im afraid that this will push my girlfriend away completely now as she is very embarrassed. I don't know what to do she says she will go back to normal after her stage passes but I'm scared it won't i don't know how to cope or what to do all I want to do is kill my self right now I need her so bad I've missed her for 3 months but I still miss her now because she's not mentally here and I just want to hold her but she won't let me I know most of this is probably misspelled and shit but I don't care just help me please.
