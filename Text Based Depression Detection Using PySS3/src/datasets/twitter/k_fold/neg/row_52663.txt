I didn't know what to do anymoreI'm a 16 year old Male with depression and my mom has gone insane. She is kicking me out In a year and I just wanna end it all. Me and my mom don't talk because I didn't want to do something for her (go out and do some work for a friend) I said no and started yelling at her (because she woke me up in the morning) and we've haven't talked in 3 days. Last night she texted me saying (New rules, or all u will get from is silence for the remainder of this year, 1 come to me and tell me why the heck ur so mean to everyone in this house,  2, why u "steal from me" and 3, u have until Sunday) this morning she texted me saying  (Actually forgot about until Sunday, it's  been four years and in my mind ur not willing to change ur mind set. So as of today April 10th 2020, I am Completely done trying to parent you, for u seem too have things all figured out, good luck in life, u may stay here until ur 18 teen then you will ur own responsibility not mine, cause in truth I am tried of fighting a never "changing" with u and at this time in my life I need to be there for sister 1 and sister 2 too in sure and hope they don't turn out like urself, if u wish too remain here for the year following ur 17th birthday then so be it, I  will be only providing the 84, a month from ur special diet,  other then that I  no longer need of want ur help. I  am just too tried too keep fighting with you, and my health is vital to be here for the twins,Good luck.)

It's now 4:36 and I'm shaking because I'm contemplating suicide.
