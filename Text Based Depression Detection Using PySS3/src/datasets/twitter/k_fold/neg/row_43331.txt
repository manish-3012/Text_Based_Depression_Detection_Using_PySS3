youre amazing n you cant tell me otherwiseits been a very horrible day today n i just got out of the shower after an hour of crying. someone i know is getting lifted to the hospital and they might die. the pros outweigh the cons of living, and i almost killed myself tonight.
but honestly id rather be writing this. whether youre already 50 pills in, or on the verge, just know that i respect the shit outta you for making it this far with the way things have been. its amazing, really, that youre reading this. it might not be an amazing feeling to read this, and you might not give a fuck that youve made it this far, but i think its cool as shit. good for you. i wish i could hug every single one of you (if you dont like hugs id definitely give you a fist bump). things are fucking hard. ive thought about it a lot; why do i keep living? whats the purpose? &amp; that usually leads to me staring at all the pills in my cabinet. BUT. im still here, breathing. maybe the purpose of living is just to live, just like animals. thats what we all are in the end. but we're pretty cool animals if ya think about it, even if our intelligence a double edge sword. we can make things. i dont even remember the last time i wrote someone a physical thank you letter, despite everything everyone has done for me. i should get on that.

sorry for rambling.. anyways, i hope the rest of your day or night goes realllllly really good. . you deserve it fo sho
