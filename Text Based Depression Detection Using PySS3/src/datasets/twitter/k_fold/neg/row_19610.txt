I ruined my life with one movement and im already depressedSo this si what happened..  


 

First off i made an appointment with my doctor for tomorrow, im not looking for medical advice.

So i as mastrubating and while i was moving my shaft up and down with one hand i didndt want to cum so o pushed my glans against my shaft, i know, im fcking stupid. Please spare me im panicing enough.

So i felt a LIGHT pain inside my shaft and i went immedialty limb.

Its been 5h and i cant have a full ereaction, max i got is 50%, and i noitcied my dick is not straight as it used to be, its making a small S from the glans to mid shaft.

Im not feeling pain, but i feel something, like a feeling on my dick.

I have no pain urinating and my gf said to rest and let it recover. Ive been goolging penile fracture and im panicing a lot.... i dont have a swollen or red blood penis, i feel its way more mild than all ive reading...  


I told my gf and she is sad and if this doesnt have a cure i know for a fact she will live me as we were very sexual i just..- im a young fit clean eating no smoke no alcool guy and now i might have ruined my life.
