Have you ever dreamed about death and dying?I keep a dream journal, off and on. Occasionally, I'll have a dream where I'll die or am seconds away from dying with no escape possible. I'll dream I'm about to get T-boned by another vehicle, or have just fallen from an impossibly tall building, or that a raptor just popped out of the ceiling and bit my head off, lol. And each time it's just...so fucking nice, you know? In my dreams, I'm usually aware that I'm about to die and have absolutely no means of stopping it. Just before impact, I can feel myself overwhelmed with peace and I think, "Finally, this is it. I'm done, it's over, and I had a pretty good run." When I wake up, I feel briefly refreshed, almost as if it had actually happened. I love those kinds of dreams. I had a sort-of, kind-of near death experience in real life once and it was the same thing: just the most amazing, calming, "yeah, let's go" kind of feeling. I honestly don't want to kill myself. I don't want that kind of responsibility and I don't think it'd be fair to go until I've sorted out some shit and I can barely even shower everyday, so that's no happening anytome soon. But if death came hurtling out of the sky, I'd be like, "Yes, finally. I'm ready. Take me now."
