I want to reach out, but I don't want to get help.I have been feeling down since last May-ish; that's when I noticed that I started feeling really, really sad everyday. I am a smart student. I have been getting good grades, and since moving schools, people have sometimes taken advantage of it. I became anti-social (I don't know why; I was quite social with others in 3rd grade, but it changed) and I decided not to talk to anyone. If someone said something to me that seemed to belittle me, I don't know how to react. If someone left me, or took advantage of me, I don't know how to react. Every little thing irritates me. It annoys me how others are happy and reaping their hard work, while I work hard and don't get the results I want. I have never been interested in anything. So I ask myself, "What's the point of even living, if I have no purpose? Why not die when I am causing my family so much pain through misbehaving and acting like a little kid?" I just don't know anything anymore; I drove myself to insanity by letting myself go through this. No, I am not sorry for myself; I think I deserve to die. But at the same time, I am scared of what happens after death. I've tried reaching out, but I don't want to ruin the moment by telling my problem, nor do I want to cause a burden. My grades are going down. I started cutting on my thigh. I purge and binge eat. I stopped talking to people. I feel so lost and hopeless. Everyone is in their own world, and it's forgivable, but I just wish that there was a way out of this.

I'm sorry.
