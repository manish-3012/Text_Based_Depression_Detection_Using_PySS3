[23, Male] I AM USELESSI don't really what else to say. I do a lot of different things in life, and all I ever seem to do is make things worse. It doesn't help I'm autistic and have learning difficulties. Nobody has ever responded to me saying what I'm good at, and I really don't know if I should continue living. There seems to be nothing I'm good at. I suck at art, I suck at music, I suck at video editing, I suck at games. 

On top of that, my dislike for being social on top of having social anxiety causes me to panic in situations where there's even one person in my presence. I don't talk much at all, because I don't have anything to say. 

I'm also a realist, and that has resulted with everything being so much harder to understand. People can't take that position well, let alone apply it to themselves. 

And I'm pretty much broke because of Christmas shopping. I don't really like Christmas, I don't want to be part of it. I don't even believe in a God or the Bible. 

It seems of all the things I try to do for others, it just results in everything getting worse. It's thrown back in my face. Shame it didn't kill me there and then.

This planet feels so hopeless. The people on it are insufferable. They just don't understand truth when they see it. And will continue to lie and be dishonest. I've known people who have done this to me, lying about my cooking, about my I guess, qualities. But it's shit.

I'm also attracted to 'cute things' which means anything really. I hide myself within my bedroom all day to get away from ever acting on any urges. And I can't get an inanimate cute thing to fuck, because it's apparently illegal. Well, is it moral? That's all I fucking care about. I want a fucking cute doll, that I can look after, and make love to. 

I have no social life because of the above reasons, but also because I'm afraid of hurting people, and it was also to further my knowledge and understanding of the world, which has been in vain. 

I still cannot write anything or draw, because I have the writing of a six year old or probably younger than that. 

I'm vegan for ethics, and I'm also fat. (Probably a good reason to die right? lol? Who wants to prevent a global pandemic, save the environment, better human health, and be moral? What a joke)

And then that leads me into sadistic thoughts which happen constantly when I'm angered. I want to see people burn. It's usually only adults which I suppose is a good thing. I wish I was a child, so I can have sex with people my age and women older than me. 

I'm so fucked in the head you might think I sniffed a load of glue when I was young. Actually, I think I did. Sometimes I forget how to laugh.  

And I can't even look after myself. I don't know what to fucking do. I am useless, as if I haven't made that obvious enough. 

The police have already been round my house, a couple times. Once because I was a cunt who deserves to die for an immoral action, and another because they thought I was going to kill myself? Why can't they just fuck off and fight crime? why waste time with me?

As if that wasn't enough, I had been to a team at the NHS or something who were going to 'deal' with my suicidal thoughts... that was a lie. They prescribed me anti-depressants that didn't work and lowered my libido so I couldn't masturbate 2-5 times a day like I used to. I felt happier once I was off them, so don't take anti-depressants kids, unless you don't care about your genitals and you probably go to Bestgore or Kaotic or something. 

I'm still in a shitty house. I still haven't got a PC that fucking works properly for the purposes I use it for. 

I don't care what people think of me, so no 'I think you're a nice person'. Fuck off twats.

And every single day I'm online, I have to deal with some fucking morons trying to deny truths. Are we sure this is Earth? It's hard to believe people like this exist. Why the fuck should I bother with people? 

Of every single post I made asking for advice on how to not be useless, I've got nothing. I have gotten nothing. 

The other day my bank forced me into overdraft, whatever that means. Guess disability benefits are not enough nower days. 

There's too much noise in my house. I've been woken up by the same person, ten nights in a row, because they for some stupid fucking reason, drink like, a litre of water before bed, then wake up at midnight, slam the bathroom door, take a minute long piss and fart, and all that wakes me up despite having ear defenders. Also, what the fuck is wrong with this house? It's got paper thin walls. And my window is broken because I can hear a lot of noise through it. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Being alive seems to waste resources. I just want a quick way out of this existence. Anything quick. Euthanasia, a gun, a hitman (I'll take onion links). Just, fucking, end it. I can't take the agonizing pain of being useless. I can't even do it, which is another reason I'm useless.
