I donâ€™t know where to go from hereHad a visceral nightmare where I was r**** and it just reminded me of past abuse, since then I canâ€™t go more than a few hours without a panic attack.
Didnâ€™t go to work these last few days because of it and Iâ€™m scared shitless that theyâ€™re gonna fire me over it because no one takes mental health seriously.
Tried calling some phone number but they told me they would send emergency services since I self harmed and had suicidal thoughts and I canâ€™t fucking afford to be wheeled to the hospital. 
No one listens unless youâ€™re bout to take that jump and when you are they just house you up in a little room with no privacy like a zoo animal. The only thing keeping me from going through with buying rope is knowing how much it would hurt my boyfriend and the few friends I have. Somehow my depression isnâ€™t bad enough to convince me that they hate me yet.
I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy.
