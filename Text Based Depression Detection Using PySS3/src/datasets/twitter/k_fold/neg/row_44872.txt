I have everything, and I'm still not happyA year ago I was sad about how I had no friends, my home life, and how I didn't have a girlfriend. Over the course of a year I got better, went to a new school, made friends and had 3 SOs (none of which lasted more than a week) I've accomplished everything i set out to do. But i still feel empty, Idk what to do anymore
