I just feel like whining a bit.I'm the only person left in my life and it scared me when I think about other people falling in love and happy with their friends and family while I'm rotting away my life friendless and unlovabe cause I can't even use the 'haven't met the right people' excuse. I know deep down that the source of all my problems is no one but me. The only thing keeping me alive is my fear of an unsuccessful attempt and end up camatose.
