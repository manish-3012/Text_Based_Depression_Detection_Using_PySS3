Feeling down , have a butterfly knife , so tiredHey again guys , I've posted a lot here recently , basically a while ago my girlfriend whom I depended on broke up with me and now won't even be friends. This is really taxing on me. I went to the mall with a few friends today , and I have a scalpel at home but I wanted something bigger. Not to hurt myself really but for protection in shady areas (Cape Town , South Africa). Anyway I'm now sitting on my bed and I'm really not in a good place and I really want to self harm but it's really sharp. I'm posting here because /r/selfharm takes hours to respond. I'm just really lonely and I can't move on and I miss my ex. Nothing makes me happy anymore... not truly happy anyway. Life just feels so forced and what's killing me is that she's moved on , she blocked me on social media and fucked off. She isn't burdened by me anymore and I wish I had that relief too. My therapist is not very good and antidepressants don't help. I just want to die ... but I'm scared of the pain. If I could just take a lot of pills or make a simple cut and bleed out I'd do that. Anyway 16 years is long enough to live I guess. I'm just rambling now but I'm not sure how to get my emotions out. I just want someone to tell me things will be okay but I miss her so much and it's killing me. I want to die I want to die. What would my friends think of me if I'm gone , my family... my ex. Anyway thanks for listening SW , I'm sorry I'm bothering again I'm just really alone right now.
