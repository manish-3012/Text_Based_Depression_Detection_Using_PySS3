M(30) wanting a way to leave. Life is so bad, I might as well be in the frontline.
I hate to say this, but Iâ€™ve been here before. I have actually helped others when I can. But this time I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. After spending a year and a half trying to get back my first and only love. I have discovered that she is engaged after a year and a half of being broken up. We were together for three years and I even watched her dad die with her sister.

Her dad was one of my best friends. He told me a lot about things that I didnâ€™t know. And Now or year and a half after we broke up All I want is to die. I lost my best friend, my soulmate and a great friend. For the past three months, I have been trying to figure out a way of getting back in touch with my ex, who I thought about every day and every second I can think of. 

The other day I texted her from a friends phone after she had contacted me to thank me for letting her know that a friend of hers had passed away. She called me twice and texted me three times, But I was asleep. All I wanted in the past year and a half was to talk to her. And I missed it by like 15 minutes. I responded to her text, But no luck. For the first time in over a year my text went through as delivered. This gave me a sense of hope that I had not experienced in my entire life. For the first time since our break up, I felt happy. 

Shortly after I texted her twice, my number was blocked again. Both texts were telling her I was sad to inform her of her friends passing. Since the response was made in entire day I called her. She blocked me again.

Fast forward a few days and I found out sheâ€™s engaged. I still love her more than anything. We had a rough patches and in all honesty, she was physically, mentally and emotionally abusive at times. But I canâ€™t get my head around this. I beat the shit out of head the other night against a stud in a wall till I passed out. I woke up in a pool of blood, a massive cut down my head and mass confusion. 

For the first time in over a year (the second before I thought I was going to faint into death, I felt peace). I woke up to my dog licking the blood of my head and did t know anything. Where I was, whose dog that was, notching, but I did remember my ex and frantically calling to no avail. 

As a previous contributor to this page, Iâ€™m not seeking advice or help. Other than ways to leave more peacefully. My credit is shot, Iâ€™m loaded to the ground with student loans (private and government) all in undergrad and I spent every dollar from my inheritances building a relationship with this girl. 


Now thatâ€™s sheâ€™s Engaged, Iâ€™m left hopeless, broken and looking for a way to escape. The problems run deeper, so again. Please help someone leave this place. We need to cut down  on pollution and everything. Iâ€™d gladly save the world some oxygen.
