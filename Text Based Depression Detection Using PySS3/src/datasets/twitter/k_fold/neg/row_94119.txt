Suicidal mother, what to do?Hi there, sorry in advance for any mistake, but English is not my mother tongue

I'm 30, my mother is 55 and in the last 3 years has attempted at least 4-5 times to suicide.

I am the oldest kid, I have two brothers: 27yo got married recently, he lived with my family until then, the other one is 21, he is rather problematic (never talks about himself, we have literally no idea what he is doing in his life) and moved with his girlfriend last year despite having no job and no money. My father and my mother are married since long time, I know for sure they had some troubles between 2008-2013, probably my father cheated on her, no idea when and how that happened.

My father is the breadwinner of the family, my mom worked for a very short time of her life as she took care of us when we were kids. She was a cleaning lady for a family (once or twice a week), then she helped my brother when he was managing a local hotel and recently she and my dad pulled my unemployed younger brother to open an automatic laundry, but as we live in a small town the business is really bad and my brother left with his girlfriend to a bigger city. Also, my mom has no education (finished her studies at 13),  no driving license and bus connections to the near towns are not so good.

I have been living abroad for several years and came back one year ago, now I am the only one living in the same town, this is due to the fact that I am working homebased, so I don't really need to travel to an office to do my stuff. My girlfriend left her job to move in our country (Southern Europe) and she learned the language, but the job situation is lame and she hasn't find anything. Other than that, me, my girlfriend and our dog are doing ok.

Four out of five attempts happened while I was not home: the first one happened after Christmas Holidays and I had travelled back to my girlfriend since about a week. That attempt (she abused with her medication) was quite predictable and I regret I didn't do more to stay closer to her. The second one was six months later, she looked improved and nobody would have thought about it. It happened in the summertime, I found her in bed and called the ambulance. The day after I travelled to a summer job overseas. Fourth time happened last year, I was on a holiday with my girlfriend, and a few days earlier she tried to inject insuline on her (my grandpa has diabetes), but it did not work cause it was with slow release and she must have eaten something in the meanwhile.

A week ago I and my girlfriend came back from holiday and it was my dad's first day at work after summer holidays, and she repeated the same, although this was the first time it happened while she was cured with lithium. She perfectly knew she would have killed herself if she took lithium, but she just took some other medication until she passed out.

Now she is into the Psychiatric department of the hospital, soon she will come home. On her third attempts she spent a month in a nursery home, but she was definitely the most normal person among the others (mostly drug or alcohol addicted) and I think it did not really help, if not to take regularly her medication. On the top of that, as soon as she got home she took her medication along with alcohol. Not in an abusive way (she always drunk some wine during meals), but definitely something that she should not do when taking so powerful antidepressants.

If you arrived until now I am just grateful for your patience :) I am in contact with her psychiatrist (she sees him once in a couple of months) and her psychologist (she used to see him once a week, now once a month. kinda expensive cause it's a private one, she doesn't want the one  by the national health care). My dad is disillusioned and doesn't think anything can help, I think he is also planning to leave her and I wouldn't blame him too much. My middle brother doesn't really understand the issue of depression, while my younger one is just absent. I thought to stay home with her while I am working, but I guess she would just feel that I do that to avoid repeat again an attempt and she would try to do it while I am busy or at the bathroom, something like that. Any of you in a similar situation? How do you get out from it?
