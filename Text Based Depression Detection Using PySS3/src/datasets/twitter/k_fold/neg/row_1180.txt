Friends have given up on meI feel like the boy who cried wolf with suicide. So many times I have seen the wolf lurking around getting closer and Iâ€™ve sounded the alarms. But my friends have given up on me. They donâ€™t answer me anymore, theyâ€™ve straight up told me they canâ€™t go back to a friendship with me, and now itâ€™s just me and the wolf. I donâ€™t know what to do. My support system is gone. This whole suicidal episode started after my breakup. I was self destructive and now everyone is just done with me. My boyfriend has given up on me my friends have given up on me. They said theyâ€™re tired of my â€œgames.â€ And now I almost feel like I have to prove to them it was never a game.
