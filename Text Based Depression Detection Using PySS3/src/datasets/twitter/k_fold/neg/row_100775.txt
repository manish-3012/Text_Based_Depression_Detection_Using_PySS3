Death come to meI could hear the wind howling, as i inched closer and closer to the edge, in theory it wasnt much, just 14 stories. But the intention to do it, along with the action following it up is what made it deadly. Suicide. A concious decision made by an individual to "attempt" to take one's own life. But all the effective means to do so have been taken down by the government as illegal. Because if we all decide to kill ourselves, why have a government or even bother running it. They dont want you to know that, im convinced or delusional enough tk believe that. I have no one depending on me, and i depend on no one. Within a cycle of the rise of dawn and the fall of dusk, the impact that my fall from this rooftop would have, would have faded out by then. 

As i inchec closer and peeped down, i could hear msuic, and people cheering me on, they knew it was an ocassion to celebrate. Im 25 this year, no job, no relationship, no interest in career, barely functioning relationship with parents, look like shit and am not that smart either. Also i makr no buck, so im poor as shit. All of this, but lifr is amazing, and a wonderful experience to have? Dude wtf, why am i not getting any of it. I mean karnataka would have gotten more water from tamil nadu than the amound of positivity life would have given me. 

Moving on. I decide to die. Because i dont wsnt to work 8 hours a day foe the next 40 years and get married, and have kids and support them too, what if i just want to stop now. I DONT want to go through with life ,why cant it be my decision? 

There are people who succeed at suicide, so dont tell me, that there are other plans that god has for me, i dont beleive in that bull shit. If you say so, prove to me that god didnt have a plan tk anyone who has successfully suicided ever, or dare agree withme that, that was gods plan. All i want right now, is just some cyanide or nembutal, which i can purchase for a cheap price. Today i realised im too broke to even kill myself. What kind of a life or living environment is that.

Listening to alm this rant, some of you may wonder how is it your problem that i am mentally weak to go on with my life. You are totally correct, its not even the slightest of your problem, then why wont you just let me die? Mental disorders deserve euthanism too, i dont even know what mental disorder i have, but i am convinced i am mildly with BPD. Why can't we get an easy out, instead of having to go through mental turmoil day to day. How is this fair. I believe there is no god. No good. No bad. I call upon every negative energy that can be chanelled, in this realm to use me as a vessel. I sont give a fuck about this phsyical self. I just want an exit. From this video game that im stuck in and cant exit. Someone please help. 25 m, if u are wondering. Old enough to decide if i wanna die or not i think.
