I'm so god damn patheticEverytime I want to better myself, I make a plan and then forget it two days later or just give up on them. They're not even hard plans. They're so simple a 10 year old can do it. Baby steps except I am a grown ass adult that can only roll backwards

And my eating? Oh boy my eating, onc I eat I cannot stop until I have enough sugar or my stomach feels bloated. Then I feel so terrible afterwards. So much that I want to starve myself of anything good. All I think about is cake, cookies, junk food like the disgusting bitch I am. I'd literally give anything to be skinny like I was it was so easy to starve myself back then. Don't tell me that's unhealthy because I know what that can do to a person I just hate myself for being fat I'm so repulsive 

I'm going to figure out how to kill myself because I'm way too lazy to try and better myself. I'm doomed to be a fat and lazy pig because every sensible plan and suggestion given by people who care or try to help has fallen through the cracks. I am not hungry for life accomplishments and a stable living. I'm hungry for food and death. I'm going to torture myself until it happens apparently because that's all I can think about. Boneless chicken and not being alive anymore because I'm such a fucking disappointment. I tried killing myself once and chickened out and drank the charcoal the EMTs gave me and that's the biggest mistake in my life because I'm so worse off god damnit
