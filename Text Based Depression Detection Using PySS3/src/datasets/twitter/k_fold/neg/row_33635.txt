Not really sure what this post is supposed to try to saySo the reason I'm posting this is to get my thoughts out there without being flagged by close friends (mostly for fear of them contacting someone for my safety when I don't think that's completely necessary but I know they worry). I'm not really sure where I would be on any sort of spectrum but I've come to define my stance as a sort of resolve without action. My thoughts began at a low point in my life in which I started thinking about suicide as a rather artistic way to go. I really like the concept and the control one can have over the circumstances leading up to it but at the same time I know telling someone this in itself would certainly shoot up some flags. Where my concern that lead to me posting this begins has been the past few weeks and the way that stress and spiked up anxiety has made my moods so unpredictable that it's keeping me from going to class and getting my work done on time, in other words; I'm having to find ways to think straight enough to do basic things like getting up and getting dressed so much so that writing papers seems incomprehensible. I wrote out a list of reasons for and against and I've noticed a pretty big shift from me thinking things like "I couldn't do that to my friends and family" to "I'd feel bad about it, but I could". By no means would I say I'm actively contemplating suicide, I still can feel some force tug me away from the act and for that I'm grateful but its constant presence in my mind has already drastically changed my stance on it and I fear how much more it could change in the future. I wouldn't really consider myself to be a particular stable person, I usually feel like I'm walking a tight rope and the wind only seems to be trying to knock me off more and more as time goes by. I know this was probably a bit of a mess to read but I appreciate you for doing so, it's nice to know that my thoughts exist somewhere safe.
