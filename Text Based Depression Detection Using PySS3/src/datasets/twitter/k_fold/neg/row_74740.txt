I Think Is Time For Me To End My Life Soon Maybe By The End Of This Year.Ever since I born I have this heart problem I been struggling with I have a peacemaker in my heart that make me cant do alot of fun stuff like normal heath people do like go hiking play sports swimming running stuff like that you know is just so sad. Wrestling is the most fun looking sports I wanna do for my career but I cant is to much for my heart. When I was little my dad use to always take me to my doctor appointments but now he just tells my brothers to take me to my doctor appointments they get really annoyed with me when my dad tell them to take me so thats when I think i should just end my life my brothers are tired of me im tired of not being able to have fun I have no friends....
