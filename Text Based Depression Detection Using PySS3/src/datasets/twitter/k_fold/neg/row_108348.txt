Life has no meaningIâ€™ve been having constant thoughts of Suicide and depression for about two years now. I just think there is no meaning in any of this absolutely none. Maybe life doesnâ€™t need a meaning. Nothing matters, and I feel bad about this, because Iâ€™d consider myself to be pretty privileged Person, Iâ€™m not rich or anything, but I have a family Iâ€™m in good health physically at least, I have a roof over my head and havenâ€™t really gone trough hunger in my life, and yet I feel like my life is bad isnâ€™t that funny. Maybe Iâ€™m the problem, and I need to just get over it, thatâ€™s what my parents would say if I talked to them about what I feel anyways. I suppose another of the factors is that I recently lost my faith in religion, which is good, because I feel like Iâ€™m out of a cult now, but with that comes many things, Some good some bad. One of the good ones is that I am free, and in control in my life now, but also the realization that there most likely is no such thing as an afterlife, and I think thatâ€™s why people believe in such fairy tales. It gives them a feeling of hope, because they just canâ€™t accept the fact that theyâ€™re not special and that if they fuck up this life thatâ€™s it thatâ€™s all they had, But I donâ€™t feel afraid of death. I was dead for billions of years, and every night I go to sleep I die for a couple of hours. The point Iâ€™m trying to get across is the question of why wait to get old and deal trough all the bullshit that life brings with it. Why not just end it now. Thereâ€™s one famous saying from the French Philosopher Albert Camus he said â€œthere is only one philosophical question and that is suicide.â€ And this questions comes to mind when man is faced with the absurdity of life. I really recommend his books by the way one in an specific being The Myth of Sysyphus It goes into detail of his views on Suicide and other philosophical questions. Albert Camus emphasizes on the fact that man have expectations of finding a meaning, and achieving unity with a universe that remains silent to our deep seated wants for meaning and truth. â€œMan stands face to face with the Irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and reason. The absurd is born from this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the worldâ€. Camus states we have 3 approaches to this silent universe, one is we commit suicide as a means to escape the lack of meaning or perform intellectual Suicide and instead believe in â€œhopeâ€ for the future typically in the form of a religion. The 3rd is that we find acceptance of the absurdity. Thatâ€™s what it all comes down to In the end. Thank you to anyone who took time to read this, and for anyone going trough shit youâ€™re not alone be strong time heals remember that.
