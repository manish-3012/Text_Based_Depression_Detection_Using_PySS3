tiredi canâ€™t do this anymore. i act like everythingâ€™s ok, i have for so long even i start to believe my own fake â€œeverythingâ€™s going to be okâ€ bs.

no one cares, i donâ€™t know what to do, 

i finally give up. iâ€™ve fought tooth and nail to get this far and itâ€™s all for nothing. 

thereâ€™s no hope, i canâ€™t believe i bought into the whole life can only get better once you hit rock bottom lie.

fuck everyone and this time iâ€™ll be sure to do it so no one can bring me back to this miserable hell.

i spent my whole life trying to help my family and help everyone else but when i need help iâ€™m so fucking utterly alone.
