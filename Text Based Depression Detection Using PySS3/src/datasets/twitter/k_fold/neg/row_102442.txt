"Best 3 years of your life", they told me. What an utter crock of shit.I gave it everything I had. Tried as hard as I possibly could, and put my heart and soul into my coursework and exams. I was rewarded with a big pile of failing grades.

I... I honestly give up. University has been nothing but hell for the past 2.5 years, and I just want to end it all. 

I just feel so damn ashamed, stressed, disappointed and simply inadequete for this world. Maybe I just wasn't cut out for surviving the realities of society.

"Best 3 years of your life"? I would rather have hanged myself, if I knew what I was in for.
