I don't even know why I'm botheringI don't. I've been failed here as I have everywhere else.

This world is so cruel, so full of hate. It is a world I no longer wish to live in.

You people tell me to keep trying. I don't know why. It just gets worse and worse and worse. Are you trying to torture me by having me stay alive? Are you the devil sent by fate to torture me for my wrongs?

I am as I always have been, an afterthought. Even the parents who "love" me think of me as an afterthought. Making fun of bipolar people right in front of me. I've got something to tell you dad, Environmental is a factor with bipolar which means you took a part in making me one of them.

I'm trying to pick out the most peaceful way to go once I get some final things in order. Just because I want out doesn't mean I shouldn't make the transition easier on the others.

Everyone has failed me.

And I have failed everyone.

Further down the spiral.

Does anyone know if 200 Benadryl would let me fall asleep forever? I want to leave in peace. In the peace this live has never given me.
