Life RUINED by anti depressantFuck the pharma company they have destroyed my life. I'm suffering from constant blank mind and no emotions from pills I took to "help" my depression. Nothing has come back I believe it's permanent. I will kill myself because of this. Life doesn't get better , I was born to suffer and live in constant pain. Fuck everything , it cost money to do anything.
