Would you kill yourself if you were a 22 year old male virgin?I have been contemplating suicide for quite a while, I can just jump out of my apartment which is like 6 floors high if I wanted to. 

The fact is that I'm a 22 year old male kissless virgin, everyday I feel nothing but utter despair because of it. I am utterly incapable of being happy because I am constantly thinking about how inferior I am to literally everyone else because of it.

I feel like I am a piece of trash, and that other people view me as scum, even people that do not even know me. Why? Because I feel like society as a whole has decided that male virgins are worthless losers who should just kill themselves so that their inferior genes can die out.
