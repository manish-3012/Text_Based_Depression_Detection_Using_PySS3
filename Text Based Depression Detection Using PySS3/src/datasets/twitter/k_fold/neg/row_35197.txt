Wanna kmsWas just trying to sign up for school and just the thought of it made me really feel like killing myself. But I could never do my parents like that. If my parents ever die then so,will I. I hate how toxic some people are. I have a deep hatred for humanity. It makes me not want to keep going. Thinking of how unfair life really is makes me want to give up. Life is like a fucked up game. What do you do when the games not fair. You fucking quit playing. People are so self absorbed in their own realities they dont give a fuck about anyone but themselves and lack the brain power to put themselves in other peoples perspective and they dont give a single fuck how their actions appear to you or affect u. I hate my self a lot I cant get over it. I have always had problems feeling affection towarda others and not having those feelings returned and I cant take it much more before I really do kill myself in the heat of the moment one day. I was diagnosed a communication disorder and I want to not believe it but there are some days where things happen that make me think its true after all. I'm not afraid of death but I'm afraid of the immense pain that comes before it. I don't believe I will go to hell or heaven. Pretty sure I'm an atheist cause I really just feel so hopeless some times. Religion is a toxicity in our society that has mostly attracted self-absorbed assholes who bought into the brainwashing that was brought upon to them in their childhood. Sorry if that offends some people. Thanks for reading
