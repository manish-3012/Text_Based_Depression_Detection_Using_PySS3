Concerned about brother... should I drive home tonight?My younger brother is a senior in high school and I think he may be suicidal. He's been depressed before (my mom died 7 years ago) and he's been on antidepressants on and off for a year or two. He recently broke up with his girlfriend and he seems to be kind of withdrawn. It's hard to know because I'm away at college.

Last week he had a facebook status "Some people aren't strong enough to call for help." I texted him about it &amp; he said it was a quote from some Fireman show on tv. 

Then today he was texting me about how Easter was awful (I'm 2.5 hours away at college) and some other things he was upset about, and after talking to me a little he said he made an appt. with a psychologist but can't get in for three weeks. After venting for a while he said "So about that call for help..." admitted he lied.
I tried to give him suggestions to help his depression until his appt., like spend more time with friends, do things he enjoys, surround himself with positive people, etc. and he said "Look, I have a laundry list of problems. I do not feel that they are solvable." I asked if he really believes that, "Yes." Asked "Are you thinking about suicide." No response. "Don't lie." "????" No response. "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?" and he finally said "Well"

I called my cousin who's a social worker and she said that my dad should take him to the hospital for a crisis consultation where they'll give him someone to talk to and assess the situation. He agreed to go tomorrow after school. Until then, she said to lock up pills/guns etc. and watch him to make sure he's safe. I'm not sure how seriously my dad is taking this. 

After my cousin called my dad, bro said "Btw i did not say that i was suicidal."

Should I drive home to make sure he's ok? I told my dad I am really concerned and after I threatened to come home he said he would go around and take care of the pills and such. Idk what to do. :/
