Itâ€™s getting worseIâ€™ve posted here a few weeks ago about the dark place that I was in. And now my mental health is really getting worse. The audio and visual hallucinations are back like they were months ago when I lived in Texas shortly before my last major suicide attempt. It left me in the mental hospital for 9 days and then Intensive Outpatient and other help beyond just medicine. And these signs are back.

I work in the insurance and financial industry but my employer considers me a temporary employee so they donâ€™t have to offer me insurance. I make too much money for any extra help. I live on my own and support myself. 

They want to see me weekly and each visit is $50. One medicine for a 15 day supply was $150 and the other was $45 for a 15 day supply. Not to mention a therapist which is $75 per visit. I canâ€™t do it.

How much does one person have to suffer? How much does one person have to endure? The voices are so bad. The faces seem to be in so much pain. I canâ€™t make it stop.
