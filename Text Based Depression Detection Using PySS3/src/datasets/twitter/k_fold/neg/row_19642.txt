I'm going to jump off of a 20 story building head firstAfter my ex broke me in two so many years ago, I've been pretty much undateable. Because of my ADHD I've become a drifter who is a grunt at my dead end job. My dreams and life are shattered but why am I even surprised? It's always been like this for me. My brother who I've been third Wheeling for ever since I was 13. My parents who are OCD hoarders. My friends who I haven't seen in  2 YEARS. Me realizing that no girls are ever going to want me. Whenever I sincerely try to improve myself fate has it so it's like I crash into a brick wall. I don't know if you understand cuz I'm average intelligence. Why the fuck is society so judgmental? Everyday I feel like I'm facing judgment day. That I'm so single, unwanted, alone, nervous, pale as fuck. I'm so sick of this. I'm so sick of being infatuated by women and them just fucking other guys and being told it gets better. I'm sick of this hell.
