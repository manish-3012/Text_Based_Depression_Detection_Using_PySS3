i want to be a servali want to be free, i want to be able to walk around and run and hunt without judgement. i want to have four legs to run at light speed through different terrain. i want to explore, not be locked up in my house. even before corona i was locked up. i couldnt cross the street, take a shower while my parents were gone. still cant. i still cant take even a walk around my house without having approval from my parents. ive always been locked up in a zoo and i just want to be free. my preferred way is to jump from a high place. i dont want to feel it happen. but then again im too afraid to get the freedom i ache for, what is wrong with me? ive made the decision to die a while ago.
