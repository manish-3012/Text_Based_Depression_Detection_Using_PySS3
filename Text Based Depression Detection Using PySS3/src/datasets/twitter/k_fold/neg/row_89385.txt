I'm sixteen, and scared.I've been contemplating suicide for a while now. It seems like whenever I try to help or connect with another person, I just end up getting hurt. I have friends in school, but as I walk from class to class, I feel that I am an outcast with little left to live for. Almost every night I think of new ways that I can go through with the plan. They are mostly painless, but my mind keeps pushing more and more towards these methods. My fear comes from thinking that I will never have some one to love me, for me. I know you have your family that will do that, but I want that one person who will love me back. That person whose heart races just as fast as yours, as if they were harmonizing and serenading one another. It sounds cheesy, but I just need someone who truly gives a shit about me.
The closest I have come so far is standing in my parents room, staring at the ammunition and gun in my step-father's closet. I usually try to comfort myself by thinking it will be quick, but I always back track to the reasons not to. Please just help me find reason to just keep going.
