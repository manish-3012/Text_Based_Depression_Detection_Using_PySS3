Almost doneIt's almost over.
I'm on my last Â£1000 which will be gone in rent alone by September. I'm supporting myself and my partner because he can't find a job due to lack of experience. I'm working 3 jobs and still not earning enough to support us both. I'm exhausted of living, I'm tired of trying, sick of having to fight just to survive in this shitty, unfair world. What's the point in working my arse off if I'm going to end up broke and starving anyway? Might as well just stop now and get it over with. I don't have specific plans but I am not afraid of death. Endless oblivion is better than the pain I'm in every day.
