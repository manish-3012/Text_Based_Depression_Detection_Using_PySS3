I talk but nobody listens. It's the end for me.I try to fix my problems and fail. I am a failure. I have my note written. Everything is in place. This weekend, I hang myself. My family will be better off. I've tried to talk about my problems. Nobody listens. I'm desperately for someone to talk to, but nobody listens. So here's my goodbye.
