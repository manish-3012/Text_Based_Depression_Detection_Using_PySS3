One more step.I've struggled with depression for what feels like my whole life. And honestly, I'm just one step away from calling it quits.


This year has been the worst year of my life. I lost my grandmother to cancer, who was one of the most important people in my life. I got dumped by my (ex) boyfriend of 4 years after he cheated on me a couple of days after my birthday. I felt forced to get an abortion since my ex (he was my first, and I NEVER EVER EVER had ANY sexual relations with anyone else) accused me of cheating and then also decided to threaten to kill himself unless I got rid of it. I've been falsely accused of horrible crimes by my ex, who refuses to believe that I'm not guilty, even after showing him literal proof of it. I've lost 3 of my closest friends because they couldn't deal with me anymore. My mother is extremely sick, to the point where she might not make it through this year. My dream of having a gastric bypass got shut down...
I'm so done, you know? I have legitametly nothing to live for.


I'm 23 years old. I'm unable to work due to mental illness and physical illness (extreme backpain, neckpain, legpain. I can barely sit down, let alone walk around for 5 minutes without it hurting... and I'm not getting any help by my doctor). I live off of government funding. I'm fat, I'm ugly (not in a 'oh please tell me I'm pretty just so I can deny it, teehee!' type of way, I mean as in 'HOLY SHIT YOU WEREN'T KIDDING'), have no social life due to fear of being left behind (I've always been taken advantaged of) and I spend my life in front of my PC... 


There's nothing left. Whatsoever. Only reason I haven't left this shithole yet is because when I tried to hang myself, the "hook" from the ceiling couldn't handle my weight, and I fell down. The feeling of failing at committing suicide because you're too fat... It fucking HURTS. And once I find a way to finish this, I'll take that without a doubt.
