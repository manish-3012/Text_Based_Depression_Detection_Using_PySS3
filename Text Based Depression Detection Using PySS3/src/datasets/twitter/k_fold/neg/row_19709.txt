i just tried to kill myselfi don't want to exist anymore

someone who recently cut me out of their life found out i was suicidal and told my parents... i had been feeling better the past two days but this... just brought it all down. i feel so backed into a corner. and they didn't even ask me personally if i was okay. am i not important enough?? i guess not.. i texted them tonight asking if we could talk... instead of saying no they just ignored me

i think i'm going to go try again. i don't want to exist anymore. this all hurts too much
