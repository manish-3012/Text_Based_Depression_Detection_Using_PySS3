Just want someone to talk to.My wife treats me like shit. Iâ€™m not the best husband but I try and she just puts me down every chance she gets. She literally spit in my face tonight because she was showering and my 21 month old son came in and started playing in the toilet and got covered in toilet water so I asked her to give him a bath. She freaked and chased me out of the house and threw a plunger at me and locked the door. She came out after to tell me Iâ€™m a ugly piece of shit and she hates me and to have a fun time sleeping out side, thatâ€™s when she spit in my face and laughed and walked away. Iâ€™m now locked outside alone feeling like shit. This is the first time she spit in my face, usually itâ€™s just name calling and her telling me she cheated on me. I just want someone to talk to.
