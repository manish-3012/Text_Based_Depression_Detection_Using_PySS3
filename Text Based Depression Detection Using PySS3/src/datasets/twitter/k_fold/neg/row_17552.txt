I "cheated" on my boyfriend talking with a boy on skype hiding everything..I found a friend, we talked a lot and we had feeling.. Nothing about pornweb.. Only talked like we were very important for each other..i wrote "i think i'm fallin in love with you" but i don't really thought it..! We have seen on skype but i didn't told nothing to my bf cause i thought he could be worried about this..but i didn't want to lost the friend.. Me and this friend broke our friendship cause i didn't love him but he yes.. The next day i forgot to disinstall skype from my phone and he saw it.. Now you can guess what happened.. We tried to turn back together but even if he loves me he can't forgive what i did.. All this happened from de 11 oct. At 14oct.. Since this day we tried... But nothing.. Today we had the final break up... He was a piece of me, of my Life, i can't move on.. 2 years and 7 months are unforgettable.. I think i don't want to live one more day without him... 
EDIT: i got him back, i can breath :)
