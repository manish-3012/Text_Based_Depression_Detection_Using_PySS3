What's the point of living if you're only suffering?I've never felt happy in my entire life.

My existence has been just a mix of loneliness and pain.

Why should I go on?

For the hypothetical chance that it *might* get better one day?

I already feel that I'm too old for anything.

I've missed out on so many things.

I can't go back in time.

Fuck this life and fuck this universe.
