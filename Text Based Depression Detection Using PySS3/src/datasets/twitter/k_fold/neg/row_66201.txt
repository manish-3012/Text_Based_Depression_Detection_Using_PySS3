i wish i could literally just drop deadi'm not cut out for this. it's failure after failure. it's always back to being alone. it's always back to feeling like a fucking burden and waste of space. it's always back to hurting everyone. it's always back to ruining everything by being sick. i don't even deserve anything. i wish i could give my life to somebody who actually *wants* to do this shit and do it *right*, because i can't and i know i won't. i only felt scared when it seemed like i was going to lose it, now i wish i had. i lost myself anyway.
