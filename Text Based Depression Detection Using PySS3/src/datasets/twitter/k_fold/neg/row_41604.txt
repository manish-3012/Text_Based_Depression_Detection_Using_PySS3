AdviceI went from being prolly the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been to where I am now in a matter of a few months and I donâ€™t know what to do. How do you tell people youâ€™re struggling? Iâ€™m usually the guy that looks out for everyone but now Iâ€™m struggling pretty bad and I donâ€™t know how to tell those that Iâ€™m close too. Iâ€™m usually the one that helps carry peopleâ€™s burden and now I donâ€™t want to put this burden on anyone. What do I do?
