How do you deal/process only having ONE thing to live for?The last year and a half my only reason for living is my son. I have suicidal thoughts around the clock, and my only fear is going out with pain. I'm BP2, so interacting with my son is something I'm only able to do for short periods before the tempo overwhelming my brain. Only reason I don't kill myself is the bad conscience he'd grow up without a dad. I've been through every medication and combination of them over the course of 15 years. I'm worn down, I'm exhausted, I want out.

Before posting, please, I beg you, don't do the whole "Hang in there, it'll it better". I don't respond well enough to medication, and my 2 remaining options are electro treatment or deep brain stimulation, both of which has a chance to alter the memory and feelings towards my last barrier.

Edit: I'm 35, my son is 1,5 years?
