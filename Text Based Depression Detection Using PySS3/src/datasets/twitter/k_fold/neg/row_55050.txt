At 16 years old, I've never felt good about myself.I was never really emotionally aware until my parents divorced when I was ten.  My dad cheated on my mom, but other than that he's a really awesome guy to be around, and I never really let it affect our relationship.  My mom is the coolest person out there and I'm lucky to have her, but she won't stop pushing the Mormon church on my and I feel bad that I can't live up to her standards.  I've liked the same girl for 3 years, but we're just friends, and nothing will ever come of it because I don't feel like I'm good enough for her, so I don't say much to her.  I don't feel confident about anything, and I can't remember ever feeling like a winner.  I get good grades in school, but that's just from tests because at the end of the day I'm just too tired or depressed to actually do any homework.  I've lost all the motivation that I've never had, and I don't know why I should deserve to keep living this life.  I think I'm a ridiculous excuse for a person and that I'm not good enough, I was never meant to be good enough, I just came out crappy...
