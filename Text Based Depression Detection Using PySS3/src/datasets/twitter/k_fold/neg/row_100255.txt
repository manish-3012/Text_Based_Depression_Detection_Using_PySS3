Survival instinct vs. will to dieI've been in a conflict between an unstoppable force and an immovable object. I've been trying to stab myself in the abdomen with a kitchen knife for the past hour and while I make more progress each time, it's such an arduous process. Everytime I try to wind up for it, survival instinct kicks in and slows me down right before the blade hits. And going slowly into it is really making much progress besides a few indentations and drawing blood every now and then.

But I'll get there eventually, I know it. Every time I go deeper and deeper. Painful? Sure. But it isn't like I don't deserve it. I've resigned myself to this fate. And if it isn't by stabbing, I'll find another readily available way anyway.
