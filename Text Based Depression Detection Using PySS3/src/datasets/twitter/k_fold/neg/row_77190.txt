11th October 2020I woke up and I was half asleep, I thought to myself if I had never woke up even the slightest, it would be a nice feeling

I'm always listening to songs about anxiety, heaven, hell or graves. I feel like my friends don't like me because they don't make an effort in their messages, but with others they do. I just feel pointless really

I wanted to deactivate or maybe, leave a little bit. Life is so, so boring to me. The world has got a grey filter on it. I don't even know what the point is anymore :))

I'm sick of people disappointing me with things and ideas that they can't accomplish. I wish I could study better too, but my head is full of brain fog
