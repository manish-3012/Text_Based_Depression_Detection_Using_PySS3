Whatâ€™s the least painful method of suicide?How painful is slicing your arms vertically? I know itâ€™s not very effective but Iâ€™m limited for options

Iâ€™m leaning towards taking train to the city and jumping off a random building, that sounds fast and painless, just a bit scary thatâ€™s all 

Is hanging that bad? Iâ€™ve heard it can be very painful if you donâ€™t get it right because I would wanna pass out from hypoxia rather than slowly suffocate.
