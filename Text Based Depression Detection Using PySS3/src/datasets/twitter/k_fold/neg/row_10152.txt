Iâ€™ve overdosed two nights in a row and Iâ€™m somehow still aliveHave set up a throwaway for this. I have well and truly reached rock bottom. Bit of context: my childhood was horrendous (sexual abuse and witnessing my dad nearly kill my mom on several occasions due to domestic violence). All of the men Iâ€™ve been in relationships with have been abusive; the last one ended in me having to get a restraining order against him after he stalked and attacked me when I broke up with him. 

Iâ€™ve had years and years of therapy and trialling different drugs for depression but my mental health has deteriorated badly since my brother took his own life six months ago. I was the person who found him. 

So two nights ago I took a massive overdose of seroquel, Ativan, propanalol and alcohol. I woke up 14 hours later so I repeated it again. Here I am, having just woken up after 18 hours of sleep, covered in vomit and having wet the bed. I think I may have had a seizure as my tongue is bitten and I have blood on my chin. 

Iâ€™m frustrated that Iâ€™m still here. I genuinely canâ€™t see a way out of my situation (Iâ€™m 36F). Iâ€™ve just had enough of everything.
