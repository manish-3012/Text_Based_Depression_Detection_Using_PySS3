i really need help, yesterday.i don't know how to express my feelings, i have no friends left, everybody lies to each other, nobody or anything is real anymore.i have nobody to talk to, right now i can't stop eating mushrooms and drinking wine. but it's not the drugs talking, they make me feel better, without them i wouldn't know so deeply. but knowledge is power and power is destructing, it's completely ruining me. too far for too long to turn back feelings. i've lived a beautiful life, and life itself is so beautiful. I have squandered opportunites, squandered love, taken advantage blindly of so many important things without even noticing. I would bleed for this world to be a better place. i can't take it, i love people and everything too much that I can't kill myself. so i sit here crying, listening to sad music, indulging in tears. i've choked in my sleep before and experienced a glimpse of death, and there was nothing sad about it. it was like a release of all the feelings you could ever feel. but i can't stop feeling alone, there is nobody there to listen. nor could i be myself anyway, as others either dont understand or dont care. i can't let others know how deep it goes. all i want is to feel loved, to have a real conversation, or to rest in peace. god help me. ffs someone help me.
