Why do I feel so alone?(23M) Iâ€™m currently living alone. I have a good job, and a car. I donâ€™t have a girlfriend. I have one best friend. Through him I go hang out with other acquaintances. I donâ€™t feel like I belong in anything nor do I have an appeal for anything anymore.

I have religion. I have family, yet I still feel like Iâ€™m the only person in the universe. I feel absolutely hopeless at times. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember with 1 attempt. I just couldnâ€™t pull the trigger. Up until recently have I tried medication. Music used to be my medicine, but now Iâ€™m currently taking Bupropion. It doesnâ€™t allow me to cry. Thatâ€™s all. Iâ€™m still sad without the relief of tears. I donâ€™t want to go back to the doctors and spend even more money on another pill that may not work for me.

If I tell anyone that I know how I feel, they would most likely admit me to the hospital or wherever youâ€™re admitted to make you feel like you have to stay alive. All that would do in my opinion, would make me look like Iâ€™m ill equipped to live alone, and cause further stress. I do believe that there is hope for the future but I just donâ€™t think Iâ€™m patient enough. 

As far as love goes, Iâ€™ve tried to date before and theyâ€™ve all either left for someone else or moved away. One thing I do know about myself is that Iâ€™m â€œtoo niceâ€. Iâ€™ve been told that. I am too...nice. Iâ€™m convinced romantic love is a lie, at least at my age. Maybe Iâ€™m just bitter, but that has definitely added to my feelings of being alone.

In conclusion, I find it extremely hard to see past the futility in the constant loop of my routine. I want to travel but Iâ€™m concerned my will to live will dwindle to nothing before I get the chance to. Iâ€™m not done fighting yet, but Iâ€™m definitely getting winded. Thanks for reading.
