WalkJust went for a walk to clear my head. Didnâ€™t do much but I canâ€™t say I didnâ€™t try. Itâ€™s taking a lot out of me to keep going but here I am. I am very broken inside and am trying not to be down in front of people. Inside, I am in agony desperately wanting to escape. This is a nightmare but what else is new? I think some mosquitoes bit me along the way. Just perfect.
