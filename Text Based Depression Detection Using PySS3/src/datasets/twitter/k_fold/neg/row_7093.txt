I finally did it... and I failedOn Tuesday night I overdosed on lorazepam and alcohol. I should've taken Tylenol as well, because it didn't stick. I got to see the pain and fear it caused my mom, and I'd hate to put her through losing her son. But it's 5:30 AM in the psych ward and I can't sleep because I'm reliving every painful memory of the last year. I hate this. I fucking hate this. I can't keep going. I can't. I'm so alone and I hate it and I'm not afraid of death anymore. All that's holding me back is my mom. I hate this pain so much. I just want to die.
