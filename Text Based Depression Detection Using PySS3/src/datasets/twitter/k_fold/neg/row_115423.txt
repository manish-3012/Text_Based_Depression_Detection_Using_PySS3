I just want someone to talk too(my friend found my main profile so I'm using a throwaway)

Well I know everyone says get help talk to someone but that is much harder then it seems if I tell my mom she'll probably dismiss it. I can't get professional help on my own because I'm a minor I would ask my dad but he's been dead for 7 years and I'm worried my friends will either not care, over react or think of me as an outcast. I just need  anyone to convers with.

(sorry for trash grammer and or spelling)
