I bought a gun.So my wife recently left me, and among the things she took, besides my 2 kids, is a 30-30 rifle I had up in the closet.

Now, I'm not an avid Hunter or even a marksman, but it always made me feel good to have a gun in the house. So when that gun left my possession, I went online and bought a Smith and Wesson 9mm from a private seller.

It's currently sitting on my dresser in a little lockbox. I haven't even shot it yet. 

If nothing else, it gives my mind peace to know that there is a way out, even if I'm too chickenshit to ever pull that trigger.

The only thing keeping me from unloading is my sweet 2-year old little girl that is still in love with her daddy despite our distance and current living arrangements.

I never had a father-figure growing up, and despite my wife's best efforts, I don't want my little girl to grow up without knowing her daddy.

I think I just wanted to vent a little bit.
