I think I'm drawing close to the end.For the past two years I have lived through two suicide attempts and I continue to think about killing myself again. I don't have the best life nor do I have the worst life. However I keep stressing everything that happens to me. Eventually its going to get the best of me, I hardly can take being in a fraternity where I have to deal with people that may hate me just because (I'm not really social if I don't know the person), which occurs a lot when you're around sorority girls. Essentially I've given myself till the end of the semester till I end my life that way I won't cause a problem with my fraternity and campus. I've been in the process of making a Farwell video to my parents and my few friends, so that they won't have to worry about why I did it.
