I just calmly thought about what needs to be done for me to be able to peacefully die. Good/bad sign?Iâ€™ve been thinking about the best methods, who should find me, my stuff and the who gets what, should I clean up my one-room-apartment or not? There has not been a lot on my mind lately. Itâ€™s just that nothing fucking matters. Why canâ€™t I change simply to being normal. Iâ€™ve been to therapy for two years, maybe thatâ€™s a short amount of time but nothing changed. I am absolutely stuck in my lovely circle, nobody thinks I am really ill ~~just lazy~~ 
Been thinking about my biological fam and my friends,  ~~just think about your family~~ but I just donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care about me, I donâ€™t care what happens to me. Iâ€™d love to just donâ€™t exist but the closest I can get is dying. So I will kill myself. 
Not today, but today marks the day I am no longer frightened to end my life. I canâ€™t wait to finally rest in peace.
