Finally Been Pushed Over The EdgeI'm finally at that point. The one that all people go through right before they kill themselves. I have 3 whole bottles of antidepressants with my name on em. Probably will do it later tonight depending on how long it takes for everyone in the house to sleep. I feel like this is the last chance I have at being happy. I feel like death will release me from this cage I've been kept in for so long. Death is my only way out. Death is waiting... and hes right around the corner. If any of you have a heart just listen to the song someone you loved by Lewis capaldi. That's all I ask before I leave this earth and say my last goodbye
