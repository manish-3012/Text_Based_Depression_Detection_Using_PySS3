Losing my reason to liveI've been struggling for depression for a long time already, never really had a reason to fight but never had the energy to die, nothing pushed me over the edge, after some time, I found a person that I loved and that loved me back, I was finally happy, we've both been struggling with mental disorders but we managed to lift each other up, until now. I was tired and fell asleep, and missed some of their message, pretty concerning messages. I did respond and talk, but not a lot since I was partially asleep. At the end they said they're gonna be alone for a bit. I tried to still talk but after not getting a response I gave them time. It's been a few hours, 30 missed phone calls. Still no response, at all. I can't handle the thought of losing them since they had one suicide attempt at the past, all those thoughts might bring me to my first attempt, I've had a plan for a long time, but always escaped it by spending with them time, until now. The plan is perfect. I don't see a reason to continue, I've lost, I don't know what to do, I want to die.
