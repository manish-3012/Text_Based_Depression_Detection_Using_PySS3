Suicide Due to Debt...Maybe this is just a vent post, but I have been in serious debt since my engagement was broken. My alcoholic ex took me for everything I had. She had expensive taste and i thought I would be the 'supporting husband.'

I was diagnosed with PTSD, bipolar disorder, and severe anxiety...all of which started after the breakup. I was so grounded when I had therapy but now, because of finances, I have to live with my parents out of state--and since Florida doesn't participate in the exchanges or Medicaid expansion, I have no way to pay for treatment. 

Suicide has been popping in my head lately. I'm very logical and I know this isn't normal but I just don't seem to care. 

I have CC debt, a repossession, checking account gone because of overdrafts...and more shit. 

After a year of looking for a job, my university degree got me a job for $10 an hour...I got my first check today, but I can't deposit it or cash it because my bank account is dead; what a fucking slap in the face. 

I just dunno what to do or think.
