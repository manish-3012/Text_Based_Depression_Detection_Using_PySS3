I feel like I want to die and I'm scared my girlfriend won't take me serious if I tell herI mean, I sometimes (very often) tell her that I don't feel well and I even told her that I want to die (mmmoore than once) but her reaction is like 'ohhhh nnno don't say stuff like this dummy'. I think she doesn't know I'm serious about it and I'm afraid to tell her because whaf if she won't understand how I feel? I trust her but I don't know if I'm ready to say it, on the other hand I can't keep  my suicidal thoughts inside anymore, I need help and I need someone to try to understand me and someone to rely on. I don't even know why I'm posting all of this. 
oh and also, she's very important to me and I feel like keeping it all from her is very much unfair. idkkk thats too much maaan
