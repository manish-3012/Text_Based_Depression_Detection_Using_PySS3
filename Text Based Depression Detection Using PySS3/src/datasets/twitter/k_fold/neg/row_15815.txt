I'm going to kill myself soonI can just feel it. I need to make a better plan though; the place I plan to jump is so far that halfway through the journey I give up.

The truth is: I don't want to die.

Yep. 

I want things to get better, I want to be better, I want to have a life. 

Life is great when you have fanicial stability, a home that you're comfortable in, a family that's not dysfunctional, have a group of friends, a sense of self esteem and are average to moderately attractive.

The basic things, of which I have none.

I'm going crazy. I cry everyday. I want to die so badly. I feel sick. I'm fed up. I'm tired. I'm hungry. I'm stressed. I feel alone. I have no one. 

I have body dysmorphia and borderline personality disorder. I live with my dad and I hate him, not in an angsty teenage way, but a legitimate, this guy is a scumbag kinda way. 

I had the opportunity to get away from him and my mental illnesses messed it up so I'm stuck with him for another year at least, and I cannot do it anymore. 

I'm sad. I'm really really sad. 

And I can't be sad anymore. It's too much.

I don't want to die, but I feel like it's my only option.

So I'm not expecting to be here in two weeks from now honestly.
