Don't know whenI'm debating on living. I don't know what I want to do anymore. I've litterally drowned myself in alcohol over the past years, in attempts to not wake up anymore. There has been a lot of sleeping pills and anti anxiety meds that have not done the trick, my body keeps rejecting that idea. My past; My now ex aborted our kid not to long ago. My friend committed suicide by shooting himself in the head while standing behind me in my living room. My family is non existent. I keep telling myself it's okay to let go, but there is a constant reminder of a prebuilt fear that continually replays over and over. I lock myself up in my apartment and can't go outside, in attempts to block out anything bad from happening.(the suicide has a large part of this, I can't let anyone over just based on fear of another committing suicide) Â It's the fear of where we go. I'm not religious, but not sure of the whole afterlife thing. Â Reddit, in my time of fear I come to you asking for help. I've seen all the doctors, meds, therapy, but nothing has opened up my view of this perpetual state of mind. I ask of you opinions/help. I keep replaying the quote "I'm ready to die, and nobody can save me" in my head over and over. Â I'm a 27 year old male and I would like help. Please help. I'm so tired of feeling.Â
