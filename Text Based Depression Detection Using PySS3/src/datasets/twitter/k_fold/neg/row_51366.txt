I might do it.I can't take it anymore. I've thought about it a lot over the last 7 years or so (I'm 24 now). I ended a really bad relationship 4 months ago and she decided to go and fuck two other guys we both know. I fucking hate her. We work together too, and all the guy's she's been with are coworkers. I've felt a lot of pain in my life but never like this. I keep trying to continue my life like nothing's wrong but I'm screaming on the inside and no one can hear me. I want to die, because this is NOT fucking worth going through.
