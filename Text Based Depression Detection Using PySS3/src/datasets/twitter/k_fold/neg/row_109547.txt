Had my first suicidal thoughts/ ideation today(Disclaimer, Im not on a ledge or with a gun to my head or anything, just need to vent and have some support) I dreamt about talking to my mom. She died after falling off a fucking ladder last month. Iâ€™m still her little kid who doesnâ€™t know fucking anything (17M). I used to despair about her not having the years she absolutely deserved but why does that matter? Everything in this world is temporary, but it didnâ€™t feel that way when my mom was here. Her love was truly the only infinite and permanent thing that I felt, it kept me going through everything, it kept me grounded in reality. Now I feel like I am already dead, my body wakes up everyday and does what it used to do but why live without her? It honestly feels like I am meant to die to be with her now. If I died I would either be at peace or I would be at the side of my lord and savior, and both of those sound much better than being a slave to my stupid brain and my stupid body and this hopelessly broken and meaningless society. The other thing that is keeping me around is my little niece, my mom loved her so much, she wanted so many little grandkids and only got fucking 3 (apparently my sister had a miscarriage so I guess he/her is up there too). Our whole reality is a fucking trick to stop us from killing ourselves, I can finally understand why so many people see through the facade and end it itâ€™s fucking exhausting. Thinking about the past is both the only time I feel happy and so fucking sad and traumatic. Thinking about the future is much worse, I just imagine the funerals of my dad and each of my aunts and uncles and siblings over and over again. How will I ever be happy if every couple years I have to go through this shit all over again? If I die then I wonâ€™t have to go to their funerals, but they would be devastated by mine I guess.
