my time is limited from here on out, and i know ittoday is my brotherâ€™s birthday, and this was really the last day i planned on existing tbh. i just wanted to spend one last good day with him, and then be off. this was the last day i had planned. 

i can be outta here at any time now. i thought about the noose i made a few weeks ago all last night, and i feel terrible for thinking about it right now as we drive to the cinema to see a movie with my brother.
