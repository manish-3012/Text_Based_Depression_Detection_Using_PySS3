Who can I safely talk to when I feel suicidal?I have been feeling pretty terrible lately, to the point where I've decided to start going to therapy again. I hate so many things about myself and I really just want to die sometimes. I am terrible in social situations. Once I start talking I cant stop and its embarrassing. I say things without thinking and just ramble about nonsense. I am also a lesbian and I really dont want to be even though if I came out of the closet everyone in my life would unconditionally support me. I am hoping therapy works for these things (it didnt last time) I cant actually ever tell my therapist that I feel suicidal (right?) It is probably mandatory that I be brought to a hospital or something if its found out I am feeling this way. I really just want to talk to someone about how I feel but I dont have any friends who i would feel comfortable talking about these things with. All of my friends are really just acquaintances who I dont speak about serious mental disorders with. What should I do when I feel like killing myself that wouldnt end with me in the hospital?
