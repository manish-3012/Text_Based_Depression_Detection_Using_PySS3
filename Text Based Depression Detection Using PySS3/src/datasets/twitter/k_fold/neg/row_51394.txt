I'm sorryI called the suicide hotline a week ago and the person I talked to couldn't have been less interested in the conversation. All she did was read off a list of questions in an extremely bored voice, and then give generic responses to whatever I said. Needless to say, I felt even more worthless and pathetic after I kindly thanked them and said I was going to be "okay". Today I tried to reach out again, but I decided to try a text chat hotline instead. I waited for over an hour to get connected to someone, after which I just ended up giving up. I don't have any friends to reach out to, and I'm honestly pretty embarrassed to talk to one of the counselors on campus. I don't have a car or money to afford to talk to a therapist near me, so I'm at a loss for what to do. I've tried talking to acquaintances of mine, but they always just insult me and tell me to just "do x" instead of being a bitch,  which didn't really help me at all. I've been thinking about killing myself constantly but I'm not sure how to do it safely without causing a mess for everyone. My entire life is falling apart around me and I think I'm going to have to drop out of college because my grades are so awful. I'm scared of being out on my own because I don't think my parents will want to support me after hearing about how I'm doing in school. I'm just a pathetic mess and I just don't know what to do right now and I'm scared and have no one to turn to except for random strangers on the internet.
