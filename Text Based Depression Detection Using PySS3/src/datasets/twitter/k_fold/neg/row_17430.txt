Iâ€™m not scared of death anymore. Itâ€™s comforting.Dying is a big fear Iâ€™ve always had , thinking about it would cause an immense amount fear .

Itâ€™s not even actually dying , itâ€™s thinking that I will never hear a song again , never have my favourite foods , never have sex again , never kiss someone again , never talk to my friends and go out, never workout , never ride my bike to a nice place . Thatâ€™s it youâ€™re gone .

To this day that thought still kind of scares me but Iâ€™m not afraid  to die . 

Iâ€™ve lived enough Iâ€™ve had my first kiss , fallen in love , had sex , been to many concerts , made many great friendships , done many fun things , have so many great memories . 

When Iâ€™m dead Iâ€™m not gonna be there to care about that stuff Iâ€™m gonna not gonna be there to care about what I could have done Iâ€™m not gonna be there to care about anyone who is sad about my death . Iâ€™m gonna be gone unconscious and back to before I was born , back to Nothing.

I am ready to die.
