Time for the endBeen a long time since posting not a long time tho of the thoughts. Its been an on going battle in my head my heart my soul. The more I think I'm coming out of the hole the deeper I go in. Lately I've looked around I've said my good byes to certain people because I dont know if I cant keep pushing. I've cut myself before and never felt the pain which scares me even more. But lately on my rides home from.work I've looked at the tunnel I drive through and realize it's the best place hit the beginning of it speeding with no seat belt. The harder i try to clear my head the deeper I get. I'm so tired of the battle at home and at work I want to end it all. Im sorry for hurting those certain people. I truly do love a few select people and none of whom are my wife.
