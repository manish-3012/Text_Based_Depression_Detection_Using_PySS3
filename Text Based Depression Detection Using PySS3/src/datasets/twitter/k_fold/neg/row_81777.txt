Due to the current state of the world. I finally feel like now is the perfect time to end it all.For the last couple of years I have been toying with the idea of ending it all, and then something good comes out of it and I don't think about it but now - it's the perfect time.

With this whole thing of the Coronavirus. It has just gotten way out of hand and if it wasn't for the fucking media and social presence, it could have been dealt in a way better way but oh no, let's make everyone panic and fuck everything up so everyone has to suffer.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to make a stand on all of this, stand for what I believe in. But there's no point. If I go out of this world, no one cares. And this world is only going to get worse because of this shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot going on for me at the moment, I have a business, family, friends etc. But I can't stand to be in this world for another minute without hearing "coronavirus".

Why even bother pretending like everything is fine when everyone is sticking their eyes to the TV to sit and wait for the next instruction. Entertainment is being pulled because of this. I am simply over it. 

Hey feel free to tell me that I am wrong but, I think this is the best thing to do right now.

There is no escape. I am my own worst enemy at the moment. And I do not see things getting better at all.

My mind has been made up. Lifeline didn't pick up their phones. So I turned to here instead. Nothing will change, it's all downhill from here. No one will listen and stop panicking. Fuck the media, twitter and basically everything else for making things so shit.

Did this happen with the Bird Flu. Yes.

&amp;#x200B;

Did this happen with the Swine Flu. Yes.

&amp;#x200B;

But now since everyone is constantly online, there's no escape from anything.

&amp;#x200B;

The question I now ask is how I do this. I need to do this in a way where no one knows.

I'm thinking car - pole? Or OD. Not sure. Just need to go now.
