I need someone to tell me it'll be okay.I lost the love of my life. I feel abandoned by everybody, majority of summer is spent by myself in my room. I have this friend I trust with everything but they're a huge jerk sometimes. Life sucks. I'm depressed. I'm ready to end it. I have nobody. Just someone please assure me it'll be alright, especially if you've been through anything like this. Thank you, /r/suicidewatch.
