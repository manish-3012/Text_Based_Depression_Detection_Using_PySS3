I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want anyone I love to see me failIâ€™ve always struggled in school and I already feel like  Iâ€™m lesser then others because of it. Cause of covid this year is extremely hard mostly cause of the lack of discipline I have, and cause theyâ€™re sending double the assignments now. I managed to pass first quarter, I might barely pass this semester but if online continues I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it. I feel like Iâ€™m already disappointing to my family and I feel like I should end it before I continue to disappoint them.
