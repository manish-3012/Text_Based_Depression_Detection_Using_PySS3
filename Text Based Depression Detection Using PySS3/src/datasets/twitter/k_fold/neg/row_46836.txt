I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Pretty sure most of my "friends" hate me.I just don't know why life is worth living anymore. I have no goals, no aspirations. Nothing. I put up a fake persona to everyone I know that I'm a happy carefree guy. I try to joke but nothing I say is really funny. Occasionally somebody laughs but I don't usually find myself funny. I'm 16, about to go into my senior year of high school, and I'm not even sure what high school I'm going to yet. I've never stayed at a school for more than three years so I try not to get too attached to people cause I know I'll be gone before I can really get to know them.

Last year I made my way into a new group of friends who seemed like the liked me at first, then as the year went on they started making fun of me about everything they could find, only one person in the group of about 8 people defended me at all. They make fun of me for the clothes I wear, for me being poor and not being able to afford new clothes. Plus I can't get a job because I have to watch my 5 year old brother.

Honestly at this point I've typed this all out and still have no idea where I'm going with this. I've had suicidal thoughts for the past couple years and almost acted on them a few times but always puss out. I don't even know if I want to kill myself, but dying would be nice. Just leaving this world without any commitment to pulling a trigger or swallowing a handful of pills. Shit I don't even feel anything anymore. My emotions have limited themselves to happiness and sadness. I don't get excited about anything, I don't feel accomplished when I do something. I just exist.

I don't know why I'm posting this but it's nice to be able to vent
