Still hereGetting tired of holding a fake smile at times really some days it is tempting the thing stopping me is my family and what it would do to them and how it would hurt the people around me. Some days itâ€™s hard not to honestly donâ€™t know how long i will hold the fake smile eventually i might give in honestly donâ€™t know.
