I feel wrong and I want to tell the storyIâ€™m 22 now but I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ve grown up since I was a teenager. I donâ€™t know exactly how long Iâ€™ve been depressed all my memories feel scattered and random and I canâ€™t always recall things. It got worse about 3 years ago after I had a mental break. Or at least I think thatâ€™s what happened. I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ve been depressed but I know Iâ€™ve always felt wrong. Like there was something about me that didnâ€™t quite work right. Everyone I know has confirmed that. They always tell me how Iâ€™m wrong but give different reasons. I havenâ€™t wanted to live for awhile now but itâ€™s ok cause I know Iâ€™ll never go through with it. I know that. My mom does to. She told me it doesnâ€™t matter how I feel cause Iâ€™ll never go through with it cause I know itâ€™ll hurt her. Iâ€™m failing college. Getting fat. I canâ€™t do anything. I keep trying but I can never bring myself to get up and do something especially if itâ€™s important. Iâ€™ve always been like that. Thereâ€™s been brief moments when I broke away from that and I could move and breath and live. Itâ€™s been three years since the last time I could. Iâ€™m going to destroy my life and then Iâ€™m going to have to live it cause Iâ€™m to scared of the pain Iâ€™ll cause to do anything about it. And no one will care. Because Iâ€™m wrong.
