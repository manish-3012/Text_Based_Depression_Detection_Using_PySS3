I think Iâ€™m gonna kill myself.(F22) My bf (M24) and I are going through a rough spot financially. Weâ€™re kinda at the point of what can we sell to make some cash. Well, I have a $290,000 dollar life insurance plan and heâ€™s the sole beneficiary. 

Now the money isnâ€™t the only reason I want to die. Iâ€™ve attempted in the past multiple times. Iâ€™m depressed, Iâ€™m constantly trying to convince myself not to but this time I canâ€™t come up with a reason not to kill myself. 

In fact, I can only think of why it would be a good thing. 

I dunno, weâ€™ll see.
