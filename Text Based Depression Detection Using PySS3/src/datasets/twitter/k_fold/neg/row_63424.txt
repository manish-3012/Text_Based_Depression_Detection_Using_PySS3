I feel like ending itI'm 23 and forever alone.  I met a nice girl at a party on Saturday, got her number, and waited until now to ask her out.  She told me that I was creepy and made her uncomfortable at the party.  I had NO IDEA!!!  I cannot at all figure out why I could not tell that I was making her uncomfortable.  Now there was a lot of drinking involved at this party, so perhaps that had something to do with it, but that shouldn't be an excuse.

I had been friendzoned by another girl earlier in the term.  We hung out once and a while, until she invited me out and I think I sat too close to her, and now she only makes excuses when I ask if she wants to hang out again.  I must really be a fucking creep.

I'm normal looking with good hygiene and a decent job.  I exercise on a regular basis, I am a student (studying programming), and I have a very selfless personality, yet I still cannot get involved in a relationship, and even worse, I make people uncomfortable.

I now believe I will never be in a relationship.  I have tried everything, but nothing works.  I rather not be alive than a be forever alone creep.

tl;dr  I'm a forever alone creep who would rather just be dead.
