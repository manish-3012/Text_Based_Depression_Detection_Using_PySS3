Im so tiredIm so fucking tired every year its the same, its like im living in some inescapable hell. I havenâ€™t been on the edge of suicide like this in a while. Iâ€™m 19, and im an absolute failure to everyone and myself. No matter what I do, it just seems like life will never get better. I can barely handle community college and I have no motivation to get a job or to even function at this point. All my friends have surpassed me in almost everywhere and Iâ€™ve become the (unofficial) loser of the group. Iâ€™ve been dealing with severe depression and suicide for 5 years now and still nothing has changed. I think I was meant to take my own life in this lifetime. Im a loser and Iâ€™m worthless, society willl be better off without me.
