Living is torture.I will be 30 years old in a month, and my life has no purpose, no passion, or motivation for anything. I won't ever do anything drastic against myself because that requires too much effort. It is easier to stare at the screen until it is time to sleep.

Life is tiring. I'm always sick, weak, and lack any healthy lifestyle. No money and no reliable job. Don't have any home, I live in a little room that I have to scramble every month to pay it and other bills so I don't get kicked out. The only valuable thing I own is my old PC. All my dreams have long expired and will never achieve them.

My family is incredibly toxic and violent but is all I have to support me and keep me company, and even they need me to help them with money.

I will never find anyone to love me. And if that person was out there, I wouldn't want to force them to endure my awful existence.

I can't even suffer an accident or be run over by a vehicle because I don't go out. I'm trapped in safe in my own hell from which I cannot escape.

No love, no money, no health, no passion, no motivation, no purpose, no job, no home, no youth.
