Attempting again. This time, it should work.I'm using partial suspension hanging. Yes, sometimes it fails, but I would rather slowly pass out than jump off a chair. I failed last time cause I couldn't jump.

No one can stop me, now. I am a monster, and monsters need to die. The ammount of guilt I feel daily is just, too fucking much.

I'm deleting lots of my comments on other posts to hide a few details that if my brother found after I died, would break his heart. So expect a lot of deleted comments from me.

I don't want to die, I just don't deserve to live. Don't tell me otherwise, because you don't know the truth.

I'm sad that I'll never finish Life is strange 2, or attack on Titan, and I'll never see the Yuri on ice movie. But to think me, a monster should get to enjoy those things, is silly.

It also would have been nice to be a dancer, but that's not a choice anymore.

This is the end of the road.

It will break my dad's heart. No one should have to bury their fifteen year old daughter.

My entire family will be destroyed, probably. 
But, I would rather them have to bury me than to find out that I'm actually a monster. They deserve better than me. Far better.

I don't know what else to say now.

My name is actually Poppy. Just to let you all know.

Goodbye, friends.
