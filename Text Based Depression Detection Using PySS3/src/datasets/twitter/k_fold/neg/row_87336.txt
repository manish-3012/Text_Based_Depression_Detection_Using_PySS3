No hope leftI barely feel human anymore. I don't think it's possible for me to get better now. Happiness itself has started to scare me because I can't deal with the emotional stress of knowing that the universe is out to get me and that I'll just end up worse than I was before. I can't let myself feel any hope because hope is bad now. It's hard to breath now. I don't understand what anything I  feel even is anymore.
