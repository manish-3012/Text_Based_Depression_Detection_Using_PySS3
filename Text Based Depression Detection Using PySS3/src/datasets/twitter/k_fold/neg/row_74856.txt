ive lived all i can, goodbye world, it was a hell of a ridei get nothing from life anymore, i dont grow, and my self is stuck in wonderland, my story is one ive told one to many times, i wont waste your time to much, all i have to say is goodbye i guess, find a better way then me, and i hope nobody will be to efected by finding my body tonight
