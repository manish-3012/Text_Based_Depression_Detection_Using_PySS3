Is it possible to roll solo in life?All of my relationships have been surface level in my life. I've tried to be there for people but it almost is never mutual. Should I just not put any more effort in or take it for what it is and say fuck it about trying to have any meaningful conversations? I'm only 22 and I've been trying to develop a vision for what I should expect in the years to come if I choose to act civil but not make anything personal.
