I want to die and have suicidal thoughtsIâ€™m having a rough time and all of a sudden Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts. I had some in the past but I actually got sad when i thought about killing myself but now I donâ€™t feel anything.
Worst part is Iâ€™m having an existential crisis and i think to myself â€˜why am i doing this Iâ€™m gonna die anyway.â€™ I have lots of friends who care about me and have everything i want but i still think about killing myself.
