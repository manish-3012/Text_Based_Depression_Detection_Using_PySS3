i would like it if i could stop being so bloody sensitive all the timei almost start crying at the smallest gestures, i get upset when people say that i'm a bad person, i get happy when people are nice to me

i just want to feel less

if that means that i have to be toxicly masculine and force all of my emotions down, then idc

i just want to not be so sensitive.
