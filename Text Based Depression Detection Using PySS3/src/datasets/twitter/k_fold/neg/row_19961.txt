well now.I wonder what life would have been like if i didn't have BPD. But um, I did, and i do, and i always will. 

Relationships of any kind, mental and physical health, socializing, a career, hobbies, enjoyment, a relationship with God, it's all been shit. I've worked my ass off to get better. Truly, I have. And it's only gotten worse. I think it's time for me to go. Nobody gives a shit about me or people like me.. People don't understand. Fuck them, and fuck you too, because people like me - shit I also have OCD, GAD, depression and addictions (that's plural) - are stronger than most. I'm not even gonna leave a note. Why the fuck would i? i really don't fucking care. I'm done.
