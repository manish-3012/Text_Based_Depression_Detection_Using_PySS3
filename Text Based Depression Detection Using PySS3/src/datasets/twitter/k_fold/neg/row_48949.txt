There is hope!I feel good today. No bad, not great, but good. I know that it won't last for long, because when I go home, my parents/brothers will find some way to verbally and psychologically lash on me, but right now I feel like there is hope. In a year or two, I be out of my parents house, away from my family, and on the search of happiness. I will hang on until then, I hope everyone here will do the same. It has been and will continue to be a long and rough road to happiness, but I know there is hope for me and everyone here! Much love
