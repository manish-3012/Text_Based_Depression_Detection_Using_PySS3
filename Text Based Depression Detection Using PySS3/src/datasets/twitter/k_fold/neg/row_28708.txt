You dont want someone to die because of how it would affect you.When I read any article about someone who committed suicide, or why you shouldn't commit suicide, i read that you would be selfish and inconsiderate of how other people feel. That's bullshit. So you're basically telling me that I have to stay so everyone else doesn't feel sad? Depression often times goes to far to be reversed, and the only way of alleviating it is through suicide. If it got to that point and your "loved ones" have done absolutely nothing or haven't even tried to help you, then obviously this life isn't meant to be. I'm not gonna be around just for the convenience of "love" for others. Fuck you. Selfish fucks.
