Thank you guysIt's been one whole year since I joined reddit and  this community has been extremely nice to me and so many other people. I don't post a lot, but I lurk around a lot, and...I just want to say that all of you people mean so much to me. I can't explain it in words. Whenever I feel down, I go through all the posts of this sub reddit and read all the comments and I feel so much better. I feel so much understood in this community, as if I know all of you for a very long time, I feel connected to every member. So, I want to celebrate my cake day by thanking you guys for making everyone's day a bit better. Thank you guys, all of mean so much to me, I love all of you :')
