Iâ€™m actively want to end my own lifeIt used to be just a thought. Just a tiny thought in the back of my brain, barely noticeable, but 2018 really changed that. All my friends turned against me, including my best friend of 7 years. I have 2-3 friends and Iâ€™m so tired of being walked on by everyone and everything. I donâ€™t have the willpower to continue living. Suicide is all I can think about now. I have no one. I used to be happy about New Years and I couldnâ€™t be bothered to even watch. The thought of 2019 fills me with immense dread.
