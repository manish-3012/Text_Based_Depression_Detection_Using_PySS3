Not exactly suicidal.I am a male in my early 20s, lets leave the backstory at that.

It's not that I want to kill myself necessarily it's just that I can't get these thoughts out of my head how much easier it would be to just fucking end it. But I could never do that to the people who care about me. I've seriously contemplated it, I could never do it.However if I were to die tragically tomorrow that'd be ok with me. 

I want to get help but I'm scared to think what will happen if I admit this to a doctor. Am I likely to end up in a mental hospital? Has anyone here been to a mental hospital?
