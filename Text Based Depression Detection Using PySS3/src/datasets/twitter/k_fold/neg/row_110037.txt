Golden gate bridgeWhats the point of this shit?  I am miserable and I am a fat disgusting pig.  Technically I'm not overweight but I'm still sort of young and I restrict more often than I overeat, but I'm always hungry and I haven't eaten certain foods in a long, long time.  And if I do eat them I'm going to get fat and be miserable.  
I want to take a road trip to the golden gate bridge and stop off at EVERY Mcdonalds and burger king and pizza hut and ice cream/doughnut shop and gorge myself and then when I get there I will have no choice but to jump.  Not only am I a glutton but I'm a pathetic unemployed sack of shit with severe social anxiety issues (aka: recluse internet addict).  If I were a dude I would be a fucking neckbeard brony.  I have no college education nor do I have the drive to go to college.  I really just want to die so I can stop using up resources.  I wish I was never born.  I act like such a victim.  I know I'm not a victim, I'm just miserable no matter what and I want to die.
