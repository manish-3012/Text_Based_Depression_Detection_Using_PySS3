The only reason I don't off myselfThe only reason I haven't done it is because my parents are paying for my education and if I died the ROI would be 0. I'm constantly told about the money spent on me and it just gets me down, even though its supposed to motivate me I think. Is anyone else in this situation? Or am I just a privileged guy who can't get his life together like he should?
