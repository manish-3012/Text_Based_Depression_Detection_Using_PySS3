How do you feel when you see disabled people or people living a tough disease since childhood?One of the classic things people say to (cheer) you up is " there are a lot others out there have it worst than you" .
I don't know how to describe how this makes me feel, better and worse at the same time? Idk.
How does it makes you feel?
