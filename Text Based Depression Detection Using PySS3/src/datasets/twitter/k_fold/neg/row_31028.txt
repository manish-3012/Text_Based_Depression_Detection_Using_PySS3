A titleBeen drinking since 1030am est because an old ex messaged me and we talked a bit, I'm currently with someone and he is absolutely amazing and it hurts to think about hurting him for an ex who has a boyfriend but she was my first love and so I decided to walk to the woods where a classmate had killed  himself and just sit and think and the more I sit the the more suicide seems like the only option
