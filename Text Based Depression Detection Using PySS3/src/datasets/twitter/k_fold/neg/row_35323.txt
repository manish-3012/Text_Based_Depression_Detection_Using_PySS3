I don't know what to do from hereMy boyfriend, thought he was my forever person, just told me he feels trapped. That because of my tendencies, I trap him into loving me. I want to relinquish him of this feeling before I kill myself. How ever, we live together and have pets. I need to know how to let him go, let him be free,before  I can free myself.
