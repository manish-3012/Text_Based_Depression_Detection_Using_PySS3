Are you just suppose to kill yourself if you don't want to work?Working just doesn't seem worth it to me. Spending a significant portion of your day being miserable just to barely be able to afford to continue living so you can repeat it for the next 50~ years? 

I feel killing myself and being true to myself is better than adapting to something I don't want to and being constantly poor and miserable, right?
