Is my life worth living anymore?Hey, I don't know what to say ... When I learned to take responsibility everything got fucked up... I really wish I can't return to be a child so I can feel the pain I am feeling now.

I've never been happy in my life, because no one really cares for me, no one is there when I need someone, everyone just try to use me when they get the chance, because, I am a good guy and 
rarely  say no to anyone who needs help, but no one is a genuine friend to me, I have no one to talk to, they talk to me only when they need something from me, every relative of mine tries to hurt me or use me.. and every time I work somewhere I just F*ck Up , I can't even do anything right anymore.

And for the past few months those suicide ideas started popping in my mind, maybe I should end my life and Relieve my self from this pain?? and forget all those fake people in my life and how they've hurt me? and just not care about my work or college anymore?  I am not good at either.. I've been wondering if my life worth living now , but the real question  is has it ever been worth it? It's always been F*cked Up..


sorry for the long post....
