I feel like killing myself because I will never find lovePlease don't tell me there's someone out there for everyone cause there isn't.

I have never found love of any type. Not platonic, familial, or romantic. I was adopted and that's when it all started. My own mother didn't want me. She didn't love me. So why would anyone else?

I've had four relationships in my whole life. The longest lasted five years until he left me for someone who I thought was my friend. He got her pregnant and married a year later. He didn't even try to apologize or make amends. Just moved on and pretended I never existed.

My adopted parents didn't love me. They only adopted me because they thought they couldn't have their own kids. But surprise, surprise, my adopted mom ended up getting pregnant a year after they adopted me. They had two more kids after that. They treated me kindly but on her death bed, my mom admitted she felt more connection with her own kids. I wasn't mad. I knew it. It's impossible for adopted parents to bond and love their adopted kids like they do their bio kids. We lack the genetic ties.

I do have a few real friends, but they all have their own lives, you know? They are married and have families. It's why I don't spend much time around them. I'm reminded of what I don't have.

I want to die because I can't keep living like a zombie. I have a good job and a house. I know who I am. Hobbies, interests, passions, etc. But it all means nothing if I have walk this earth alone. 

Imagine being locked out of a house while everyone else is inside. You scream and bang on the door but no one answers. You look inside and everyone is having a grand ol' time. You pound on the window but they don't notice. You are left to stand in the freezing cold while they live it up. That's how I feel.
