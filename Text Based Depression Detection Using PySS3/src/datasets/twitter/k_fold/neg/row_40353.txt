Boredom really drives some people insane.I'm not really suicidal or really want to kill myself, just boredom on top of boredom.

I work, come back home and then do nothing, just browse reddit, twitter, youtube.

I sometimes code as a hobby and rarely play video games since my pc cant run them.

I have a loving and caring family, and i dont really have money issues since i save everything.

Yet i'm still sad and depressed, dunno what to do to break out of this cycle.

I was thinking of doing home exercise, but i didnt last even 1 day.

If you have advice on what i should do i would happily appreciate that, thank you :)
