I just tried to kill myselfSo i just came out of the bathroom. I tried to cut my wrist like in the movies but my razor was not sharp enough and I just have a few deep scratches. My cat was outside the bathroom calling for me so I opened the door for her and she was so sweet and innocent..  I dont want her alone

Im feeling really calm now, I think is for the blood pressure. I dont now what to do now. I dont wanna die anymore. I want to hide everything and forget this but I have now marks in my wrist. I have thrown the razor and cleaned the blood but Im afraid someone will notice something, I dont wanna hurt anyone. How do I hide everything?
