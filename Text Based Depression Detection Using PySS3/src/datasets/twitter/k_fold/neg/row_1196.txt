Weird contract with myselfSometimes, the only thing that gives me comfort is the idea that if I canâ€™t get a job by end of year, itâ€™s a sign that itâ€™s time to leave and all the stress of life is not worth it when thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to and life is too expensive. No family/friends/partner/dependents anyway so it wouldnâ€™t affect anyone.
