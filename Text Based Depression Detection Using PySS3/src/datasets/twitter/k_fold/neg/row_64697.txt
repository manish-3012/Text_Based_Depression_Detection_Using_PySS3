Tragedy after tragedy, I can't handle it any more.  I think I've been at my limit for over a year. I've been hospitalized so many times I've lost count.  I want to quit, I want to quit hell.  That is what this is, this is some form of torture, this is my own corner of hell.  Who can claim that this is not some form of hell or purgatory?  Maybe release would put me in a better place.  That's what everyone claims after someone passes away after all.  So why should I not want that peace.

I'm not going to go into to much detail because it would be to easy to identify me.  Suffice it to say I have had issues since I was around 10 years old.  I go from job to job never really being able to maintain myself as a normal human being as is required by society.  I can not function.  Now my son dies at 8 months and I can not take it.

In definition it is a fathers job to be there, it is his responsibly to take action and to protect his family.  That is his sole job in life, whether that protection comes in the form of keeping the nightmares away with story telling, to getting a job to provide.  I have failed the ultimate test, his very life.

What fool am I?  How could I allow this to happen?  My only son, my only hope, my only care.

How can I turn this imagine of a dead corpse stuck in my mind into something positive?  You tell me how a dead infant can be turned positive.  

Tell me the positive...
