Nothing in my life has ever gone rightI don't know what to do anymore. My dad's abusive, always has been. Emotionally, mainly, but sometimes he'll ramp it up to physical if I don't just sit and take it. I'm at a point where the only things that matter to me in my life are my boyfriend, my online roleplaying group, and my cats. I'm in a shitty situation right now where I either have to re-come out to my dad as trans [FtM] and risk his reaction, be misgendered for an entire school year, or change custody arrangements and live with my mom. I'm too scared to go with any of the options, though. My dad's reaction last time was terrifying and I got everything taken away. The school thing sounds like hell. I'm too scared to go live with my mom because it'd risk the 3 things keeping me going right now. I don't want to hit rock bottom before I go. Everything is already so terrible right now.



Suicides always an option though and it just...sounds so much easier. I've been suicidal for 5-8 years now and I'm 16, so a chunk of my life. It's a constant thought in the back of my head. Dad screams at me for the 30th time? Could just kill myself. Fight with my boyfriend? Suicide. It doesn't help that I'm allergic to painkillers and my dad has 50 of them in the next room over at any given time. The things stopping me aren't working that well anymore. Right now the only reason I haven't grabbed the bottle is that I never finished my note and I want my dad to know exactly who's fault it is. Is it selfish to write out how he caused it? He's never shown me any kind of love.
