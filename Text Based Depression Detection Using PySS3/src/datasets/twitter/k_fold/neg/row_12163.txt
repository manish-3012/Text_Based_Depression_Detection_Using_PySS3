My career in the military is so close to being overIâ€™m getting kicked out for a medical issue. Losing my clearance, losing any chance to do the same job or work law enforcement. Pretty much everything that Iâ€™ve worked for and invested in, my time, my money, my degrees, its all going down the drain. Iâ€™m going to feel lost, its pointless, itâ€™s been such a large part of my identity. I thought I had made it in life, but now Iâ€™m nothing. The deployment and the mental issue that came from it, it has ruined my life. I feel soo down. I want to give up. Iâ€™ve worked so hard for everything and now it was all for nothing.
