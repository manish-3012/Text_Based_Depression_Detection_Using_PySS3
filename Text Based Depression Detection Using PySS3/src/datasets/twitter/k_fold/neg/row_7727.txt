My Life Is A Fucking JokeLike I said , my life is a fucking joke . Nothing about me is really worth preserving . Despite what the average optimist would tell you , I don't have anything to offer that I'm going to cultivate . Might be because of laziness, might be something else . My only breakthrough tonight is that I have a perfect time frame for when I'm finally going to bite the dust . Could be from built up stress this summer but I'd prefer not . Really an ideal time would be during the first year that I move out of my house . Distance myself from family and friends and eventually they will forget . They'd probably never know (at least not for a while ) of my death if I cover it well. And then even when they do find out it would have been so long that the grief would be minimal if not just a comment like "damn shame" . Personally I think it's perfect . Perhaps I should have posted this in sanctioned suicide or something . Idk maybe my subconscious is holding out , maybe I'm just more comfortable here .
