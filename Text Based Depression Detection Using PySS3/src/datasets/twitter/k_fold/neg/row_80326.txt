I want to write a book before I do the deed.I am going to kill myself, but before I do, I want to write down everything everyone's ever meant to me and all the memories we shared. Best friends, ex girlfriends, family, pets, etc. I want to do this, not for pity or sincerity, but because I do love them and want them to know after I'm gone. The reasons why I am doing this, will be in the book. Whether it gets published or not, doubt it will, I will share my memories on here. Of course, I will be changing the names of the ones I love when I post here. I just thought I would let you guys know, the next time you see me post on this page, I will be gone. Thank you for reading this.
