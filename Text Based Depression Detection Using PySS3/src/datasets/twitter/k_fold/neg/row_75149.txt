I can't keep it up any more.A couple nights ago, I had a gun in my mouth. The only thing that stopped me from pulling the trigger was the thought of my mom finding me like that. I haven't been able to sleep since, maybe two hours in three nights. The more I think of it though, the less I feel like I can keep going. I feel helpless and miserable and I'm *so* tired, emotionally and physically. A part of me is scared of dying but god damn, I want it so badly.
