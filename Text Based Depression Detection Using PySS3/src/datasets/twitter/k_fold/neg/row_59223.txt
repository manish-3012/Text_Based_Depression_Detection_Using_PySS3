Iâ€™m tiredI just opened up to someone about how I sometimes vanish when my emotions get too much to bear and the response I got was â€œlmfao took long enoughâ€

Iâ€™m reaching out for help but every time I try and talk through what Iâ€™m feeling Iâ€™m being offered solutions that I donâ€™t want and donâ€™t actually fix the underlying problem or empty promises of a brighter future. 

Someone told me Iâ€™ve survived 100% of my bad days. And I havenâ€™t. I failed to end things multiple times and I just want my next attempt to be successful. I donâ€™t have a bright future; I have absolutely no future at all. And honestly, thatâ€™s a relief.
