I just donâ€™t want to be hereIâ€™ve been depressed before and have thought of suicide in at least a passing though almost everyday since somewhere around sixth grade. Iâ€™m 19. I just canâ€™t find motivation to do anything. I know it sounds lazy but I canâ€™t find a reason, so then I fail at something and try and pick up the pieces in the easiest way possible because I know I canâ€™t do anything hard. I know I sound lazy and probably am but I just canâ€™t seem to do anything for myself much less other people I care about. My sister and my dad are the on,y reasons I donâ€™t try because I know it would break them but itâ€™s harder and harder to put their perspectives in my head. I just donâ€™t want to be here and I know itâ€™s the selfish easy way out that I take every time. I just donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m like this I want to be better but I feel like I canâ€™t no matter how much people try to motivate me. I feel like the best part of my life is behind me even if it was mostly shitty. I just donâ€™t want to keep this going
