Reaching a breaking pointI'm 20 M, and I've been having suicidal thoughts since 2 and half years ago. It started with me having to end a long distance relationship, and it screwed me up emotionally. Then things slowed down for a while until I became a shoulder to cry on for a classmate of mine who'd just broken up with her bf. I got attached, I had all my first experiences with her, and I almost felt in love. But that didn't last, I was at wrong place at the wrong time. She said we can only be friends, and I tried but the way she treated me was not that of a friendship, it was something more. So I messed it up and broke her trust, then couldn't look her in the eye because of how ashamed I felt.

I had slit my wrist after that first LDR, though I survived, it left a mark which my mom found out. Then I tried drowing myself in the bathtub, but I couldn't do it. I've been feeling empty and hollow since then, there's nothing left of that caring person who would go to hell and back just to make someone feel okay. I only feel a fleeting motivation, and just a tiny speck of willpower that keeps me here and writing this.

I wanted to hang myself just a few minutes ago, and I almost did. I can't bring myself to let my feet go.

How do you piece together a broken person? How do you bring yourself back from the edge, from that breaking point?
