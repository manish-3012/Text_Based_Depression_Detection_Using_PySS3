I canâ€™t be arsed lnowso I have been suffering with depression for around 10~11 months, well I say that but I believe it to be closer to 5 years but I only want to say what I know and I know that I realised I had depression then. I have never been tested for it because I really donâ€™t want the fuss and besides the medication doesnâ€™t work, my mum was on fluoxetine which is an anti depressant and on the 18 th of february she slit her wrists knowing I was in the house but I have wrote about that before and I do not think I removed it so feel free to read it. I moved from my old school in nottingham to fucking cumbria (and no I am not that prick who is running for the youth council he is just some other guy from nottingham). cumbria is a shithole county full of shitty people who lead shitty lives and have shitty kids to contribute shit all to the shitty society but to be honest I donâ€™t care about that, I just miss having friends irl. I made friends with a really nice girl from florida and we talk almost every day but due to the fact that itâ€™s like 5 hours behind when I want to talk she is usually asleep or at school. I had 4 really good friends on csgo and we often played all through the day and night when I lived in nottingham but now I canâ€™t even talk to them cause I have shit internet which has a data limit cause bt are cunts and donâ€™t have a 6 month contract which we could have taken up for this house (a rental cause our house isnâ€™t even fucking done yet).

I went to my councillor at school once after what happened but that was bullshit and she didnâ€™t help. I didnâ€™t feel comfortable sharing information about what I felt in case I was seen as a risk to myself and got sent to a mad house. I donâ€™t want to go to a mad house cause I am not mad, i fact I believe myself to be the sanest person I know most of the time.

over the past month it seems like my life has been flipped upside down which has made all the shit that wasnâ€™t boxed away in some distant part of my head spill everywhere. This couldnâ€™t have came at a worse time this academic year as I am taking my mock exams for next years GCSEâ€™s and when I am sat in the silent room I canâ€™t stop thinking about what happened, replaying it over and over in my head. I usually do well in exams getting 9â€™s in science, 8â€™s in maths and computer science and 7â€™s in the rest (apart from french because french is the root of pure evil) but in these exams I donâ€™t think I did well. I revised really hard for my maths exam but I donâ€™t think I did well, I am close to being moved down to second set and if I do then I will be average at everything. I am gifted with chemistry and physics, well I assume so due to me getting better then the old A*â€™s a year early, but I am in a shit set and no teacher will move me. I feel afraid that if I fail these exams I will end up doing something stupid, I was gunna OD on my mums pills but I found out that they donâ€™t work very well so thatâ€™s out the window. I just donâ€™t know what to do, I just want everything to be over, I am nice to people and mind my own business and donâ€™t try to be funny and just try to seem like a nice enough person to be friends with but it seems like it doesnâ€™t work but I donâ€™t want to change because then I would become that which I hate, people who try to be funny and seem funny but end up acting like cunts.

thanks for reading if anyone did, I donâ€™t know if it will help but what else is there to do. if you can give me some advice which isnâ€™t tell your parents I would appreciate it.
