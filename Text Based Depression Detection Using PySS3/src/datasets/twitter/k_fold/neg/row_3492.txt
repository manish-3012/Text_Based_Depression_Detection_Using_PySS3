I'm spending my 24th birthday in the ER involuntarily checked by my Eating disorder facility due to suicidal behavior and strong eating disorder symptomsPosted this in another sub, suggestion was to post here as well. 

Tomorrow I will be 24. I attend Eating Recovery Center(ERC)- Insight Chicago and I've been there in the BETTR PROGRAM , program designed for BED. I have Binge Eating Disorder with a purging component. I don't want to have this , I'm so tired , it's been 10 years of this suffering , I can't have long lasting relationships or friendships. I'm a woman with autistic traits , bipolar and borderline personality disorder. I don't know which started which, but this disorder is killing me and I don't want to have this. I'm exhausted of getting dizzy, of the headaches , of the anxiety, of the messed up smells. My last purge was a couple days ago and I got very close to a heart attack. I'm 23 about to be 24 , I'm a senior in mechanical engineering. I already lost a semester in medical leave treating my eating disorder and here I am , at a collapse. After this stay and the ER, the eating recovery center will transfer me to their residential facility. It's summer , I don't have friends, but I like the sun. I'm just exhausted , I have no strength. I thought it will get better. I'm so tired and it's so painful to spend my birthday alone in the ER.
My place for suicide was to take pills. I have done it before and ended up in the ER and it didn't work as I thought it would. I'm tired of living like this. How much suffering is enough for others to understand I want to rest.
