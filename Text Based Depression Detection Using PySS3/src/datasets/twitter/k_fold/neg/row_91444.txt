Life feels absolutely hopeless, the crippling loneliness only makes it worseIâ€™m not gonna go in detail regarding everything that Iâ€™m feeling, letâ€™s just say I feel bad about feeling bad. Iâ€™ve been thinking about building an exit bag since it seems like a relatively smooth way to go. I canâ€™t seem to improve no matter how hard I try, when I have the energy to try anyway. Iâ€™ve never been more alone in my life.

I did not ask to be born, I donâ€™t take my troubles out on anybody but sometimes I feels like thereâ€™s nowhere else to go for a total burn out. The feeling of isolation reigns supreme in my life.
