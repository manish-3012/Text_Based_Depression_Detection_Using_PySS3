Just tired...I'm tired of not having any friends, and being unable to make other ones... I'm just tired of dragging myself around when I don't care anymore. I'm scared of death, yet it seems so tempting these times...

Putting on a mask every day

I smell my own soul decay.

I'm feeling like I'm becoming only hateful and can't feel anything else. New game sounds exciting and looks like might be up my alley? I find myself hating it, just because someone with a life loves it. I'm full of hate - when I preached love. I don't have friends, when everyone once called me their best friend. I find myself unable to do anything. I'm tired. I'm so tired... I'm whining like a kid. I'm whining like a stupid little brat. I'm tired...
