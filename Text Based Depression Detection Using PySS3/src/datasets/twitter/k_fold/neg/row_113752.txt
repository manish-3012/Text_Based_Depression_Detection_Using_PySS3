15, almost 16, losing it.Hey guys. I'm really lost, I have no idea what to do. As the title says I'm 15, I've been getting worse for months and I don't know how to stop.


My mom is struggling really hard. My grandma has cancer and on top of seeing her go through that unimaginable pain, my mom has to see it too. She sleeps at the hospital whenever my grandma gets extremely sick and has to go back. It's hard seeing her like this. She has a job, she works incredibly hard at this cabinet and woodworking place downtown, but still she doesn't get paid very much. My dad hasn't had a job in years (I'll get back to him later) but my aunt and her 2 kids moved in a few years ago to help us out. They share a big loft room thing with my 2 brothers. And still my mom doesn't have very much of her own money. My aunt's moving her boyfriend in, so I'm moving into my cousin's room since she's moving out and giving them my room. It's not a smaller room but there's this little like, cubby side room thing in it they want. I'm fine with that I guess, I'm happy to have my own room still at least. I used to have to share a room with my parents, and that was hell for a lot of reasons, the biggest one being my dad.


Absolute piece of shit. I have never hated anybody until my father. He hasn't had a job for years, his entire family basically cut him off. He's beyond eccentric, he's a giant pretentious asshole to everyone in the family, which I think is pretty hilarious since he really has no reason to be. He hasn't gotten out of bed in a week. Literally a week, probably over by now. He's up for a few minutes to make food and then back in bed he goes. He screams at my mom all the time, usually because he wants money. He's always screaming shit like "SEND ME MONEY, YOU DON'T GET TO SAY NO." He throws things and has tantrums, he screams at the top of lumgs, he's overbearing and constantly trying to make everybody forgive him for his drug addiction, but not by apologizing, by telling people they were wrong in the first place for calling him out on it. Last night I asked him to drive me to therapy today, guess what he said? "I have no problem with that, but I need your mom to transfer me money so I can feel comfortable leaving the house, so tell her that. Make sense?" THERAPY. Therapy so I can feel better about being alive, he won't drive his son too. I fucking hate him and I don't know what to do about it. I've wanted him gone for so long, but my mom has stockholm syndrome or something , she loves him more than anything. Either way, he's no father to me.


And as much as I love her, my mom isn't so great sometimes either. She's not very understanding, kinda dismissive and honestly just plain mean sometimes. Both of my parents since I was born basically taught me how to be insecure, constantly telling me what I say doesn't matter, my dad making fun of whatever I'm into, the both of them treating me more like a dog than a kid. I hate it.


Outside that I have basically no motivation, nothing is fun for more than a few minutes except hanging out with my friends mostly. Stupid stuff has happened with girls in the past, which I really took to heart and I think it might have messed me up a little. I don't know if I believe in love anymore, or that I can ever find it. I don't have ambitions or drive, I don't even like being alive. Nothing makes me happy or feel fulfilled, and I know it's probably too early in my life to be saying things like that, but it's honestly how I feel. All the time it's like "why doesn't anything make me happy, why am I not strong enough to go through life like a normal person?" I take walks a lot, just to the nearby neighborhoods and stuff, sometimes for miles and miles until it feels like I'm gonna pass out just so I don't have be home, I hate it here. I feel bad for my brothers, they don't deserve any of this, all the shit my family puts itself through. Without them, my friends, and my dog, I probably would have killed myself a long time ago. And I think I'm getting closer to that point anyway. I just want to kill myself, sometimes more than anything. I can't do this, y'all.
