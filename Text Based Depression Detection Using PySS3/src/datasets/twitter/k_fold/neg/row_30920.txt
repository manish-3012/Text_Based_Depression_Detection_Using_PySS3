Finished everything elseâ€¦I've been planning on killing myself for a while and I finished everything I'd ever need to. Every part of my plan leading up to my suicide has been executed, and every loose end in my life has been tied. This has taken months of endless restlessness and pain, and now it's allâ€¦ over. Only one step left. I'm so scared and I don't know what to do. I shouldn't fear this, right? It's what I've wanted for all my life. I don't know what I'm asking for but I feel so alone and don't know what to do.
