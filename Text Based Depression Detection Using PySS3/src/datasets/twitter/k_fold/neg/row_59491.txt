Feeling trappedHello everyone. I don't know why I'm writing this here, I guess it's because I catch myself contemplating doing this thing more and more. The pain is so great, I feel it broke something in me. 

The main reason is that I don't feel that, due to climate change, there's going to be a future for my child where she can live happily and have children of her own. This makes me break down every time  I see her coming back from work or helping feed her. Every smile or a cuddle is like a stab in the heart. 

I know she needs me, that she needs me to be ok and fight for her, but I don't know how to continue like this.
