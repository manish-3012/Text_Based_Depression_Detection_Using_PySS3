Continuing with the decline.With the quarantine and curfew put in place, I have come to some sad realizations on my way of life, if it can even be called like so, how distant I am with my own family, preferring to be on my own despite bitterly crying every night upon the thought of their deaths, wishing they could be with me forever. How lonely I am, even on a digital age, waking up with no notifications from anyone, only from advertisements or videos uploaded, how no one even wants to speak with me. My psyche is just hurting badly, wishing it could just get lost and die. Playing with the idea of what would've been of my legacy had I died on that Tuesday night of 2018, remembering one question that has left me hallow, completely empty, when my psychologist how I would feel if I were able to see the reaction of my family after I had died, the apathic response I gave has been resonating more and more through the silence surrounding me, how I just replied that I would be happy watching so. My impatience awaiting that blow that will end me, pushing me over the edge, to which I crawl closer and closer with each night in which I do not sleep. As someone once said: "Do not think the world has abandoned you, it never took you in the first place." My mind is so rotten than any illusions that would cause certain peace and sense of calm do not work anymore. Even as being as critical I am, fantasy and fictitious cause me pain as the depictions in them echo through the poor and miserable (some)thing that I call life. Seeing me on the mirror has no meaning, as all I see is somebody I don't know and don't recognize, with no depth in its eyes, as if it was a dumb painting. My anxiety is through the roof, as I overthink anything everyone says and does, maybe because it is more entertaining than focusing on what I am. I just want the release of death, but I am awaiting for that someone or something to simply push me. I hate whatever the fuck I am.
