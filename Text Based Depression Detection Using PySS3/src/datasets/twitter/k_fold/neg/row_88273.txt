Iâ€™m not old enough for the coronavirus to kill me, so Iâ€™ll do it myselfI donâ€™t have the virus, but with all the panic thatâ€™s going on youâ€™d think everyone has it. The anxiety Iâ€™m feeling from all of this is just unbearable. My classes got canceled for next week, which is horrible because my dumbass of a teacher will probably expect us to have already completed assignments he hasnâ€™t given us information on. We were going to go on a school trip and all paid $350, but now the airport gets to just pocket all the money. Iâ€™m sick of being afraid of getting sick. Why bother with all this when I can throw my life away?

The good news with all this is that Iâ€™m at home for the next week and thereâ€™s train tracks about half an hour away for walking distance. If I remember correctly, suicide by train has a greater than 95% success rate and a low agony rating. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was a fetus anyway, so this is the perfect opportunity.
