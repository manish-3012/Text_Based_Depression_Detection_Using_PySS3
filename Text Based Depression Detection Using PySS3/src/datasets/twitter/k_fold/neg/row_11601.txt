I feel emptyI don't know how to explain it if I am to be honest. I feel like my life has no real direction, and due to my circumstances what I want to do with my life is unachievable. My family has been relocated due to the pursuit of more money, and ultimately the endeavor has failed. My mother basically gave up on her life and disappeared. We live in a relatives house, unable to make enough to own our own place. I spend most days repeating the same mundane tasks over and over, then lying in bed until the next day starts. I have thought about suicide on multiple occasions, but never going past taking a old hunting rifle out in the garage, then taking it back inside. If you just want to distract me with small talk or whatever, that is fine.
