So tired.Community College starts Monday for me. I'm tired and a failure. I'm 120% fucking done with everything and basically have no reason to live. I have no redeeming qualities.

I washed out of uni because I'm a fuckup. I flunked a class because I was afraid to drop it because I was being threatened with homelessness if I didn't hurry up and graduate. I'm told this and other things were domestic abuse. I didn't have my meds because I'm poor and the county assigned me to a vacant shrink slot and I fell through the cracks. I was forced to do study hall for academic probation and was not excused when I asked to be as a reasonable accommodation. 

I had do many doctors appointments that I fell behind in the hall hours and had a psychiatric break and couldn't even fill out my withdrawal petition. Having to do a retro. School won't return my emails. I'm so angry I'm ready to file a massive ada lawlsuit though I'll lose. 

The bitch changed the locks while I was housesitting. I lost hundreds of dollars of stuff and live with my best friend now and am going to community college. She's the only reason I'm still alive and I feel guilty living with her.

At this rate I'm not going to graduate until after I'm 40 if at all. Such a fucking loser.

I'm in pain all the time, especially my knees because my family was too cheap to buy me running shoes but insisted I do after school sports and I permanently fucked my knees. My right knee is in agony every time I go up and down the stairs.

My docs want me to apply for SSDI because I can't deal with life anymore.

The only good thing is my transgender ass finally got approved for a hysterectomy.

Maybe I'll have complications and die because I'm too much of a coward to end it on my own.

I really have no reason or purpose. 

I'm so tired and sick of everything. I just want the pain to end.
