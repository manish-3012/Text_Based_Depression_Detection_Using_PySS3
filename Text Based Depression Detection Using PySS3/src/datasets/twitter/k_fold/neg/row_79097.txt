Iâ€™m doneLife sucks. Iâ€™ll never get thru college. Iâ€™ll never appease my girlfriend. Iâ€™ll never be happy. Iâ€™ll never have children. Iâ€™ll never have a friend. Iâ€™ll never feel loved. Iâ€™ll never feel loved. Iâ€™ll never feel loved. Iâ€™ll never feel important. Life is meaningless. Weâ€™re all here for no reason. If I die no one will care in a year.
