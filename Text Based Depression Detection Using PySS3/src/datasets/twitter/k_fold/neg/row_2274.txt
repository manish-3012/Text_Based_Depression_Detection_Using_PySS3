The cycle never ends...I feel unmotivated and low all the time, then I move on to suicide, attempt it, family is heartbroken and want to help and give me support, I become happy for a week or less and then start feeling low again.

And then I feel like I can't tell them because they'll be upset so I keep it to myself until I attempt it again and so forth...

I'm considering attempting it without fail this time and I'm willing to take my time, because honestly, I'm sick of this. Medication didn't help, I felt no different while I was on them, so I tried other stuff like alcohol and weed or something, and nope, I don't feel anything.

I'm lazy, dumb, ugly and unmotivated without any actual hobbies. And I feel like my depression is chronic, therefore justifying suicide for myself.

This is the thing though, I have amazing people that support me, my siblings and some of my friends. So what the heck? Why do I still feel like this? Do I hate them or something?
