SinkingI'm mostly in a good place. I mean. I've been a diagnosed schizoaffective since 2012, and I have comorbid anxiety. This past September I was diagnosed with a genetic disorder called usher's syndrome. But I mean. Life. I'd like to think where I am today is,,, miles ahead where I used to be. But I mean. I still want to die sometimes. Or self harm. Or just disappear. Today was really rough. And I feel empty and sad and useless and I hate myself so much. Like. I mean. I really
Hate myself. 
I'm selfish and mean and angry and hypocritical and bad. 
I'm not a good person 
And I'm tired so I just want to disappear now. That should be okay, right?
