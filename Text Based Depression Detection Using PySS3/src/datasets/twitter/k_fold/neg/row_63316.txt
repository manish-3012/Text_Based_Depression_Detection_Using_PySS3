Too farI've struggled back and forth with depression and a couple other mental illnesses for the last 5 years, and It's been harder and longer then ever before. I play hockey, lacrosse video games, and workout. Normally that helps but recentlyâ€¦ nothing has. My life has just been going through the motions: school (or work on weekends) hockey practice, bed and I just lay in bed. At work and school there's a girl we'll call Emily and she and I have gotten along really well and she had an abusive boyfriend and I helped her through that and she's been helping me recently (I don't trust psychologists or really that many people with how I feel) and she instantly when I told her said "don't do anything dumb, think about your parents and me and  your other friends, we need you." but when I think about that yes I should stay alive but I'm just living for these people like Emily and my other friends mean the world to me, but I don't. I don't care about me. I just think what's the point to life and I don't see one we're going to die anyways so I'd rather not suffer through this shitty ass worldI currently don't have the drive to kill myself but it'll happen soon it's happened twice before and I'm based on how bad it's been this time I'll actually finish it. I already have stuff that I could make various drugs with at least I'd go out happy.
