I honestly feel like there's no hope nowMy dysphoria is still as bad as ever and now I'm permanently banned from the one group that felt like family. There's nothing for me to do now, my best friends were there, the people who felt like family were there, I was going to visit them and attend their weddings and have a trip to one of their cabins and play board games and now all tbe hope for the future is gone, I feel like I now have nothing to keep me alive and I'm honestly feeling like I'm going to do it very very soon
