Tonight is the night.I finished the goodbye letter to my family (and anyone else who wants to read it), as well as a couple more personal letters to my sisters and friends today. I picked the location and made sure I could get where I needed to go, and I cleaned out any notes, files, drawings, etc., that I didn't want anyone to see. I'm going to send out the emails, turn my phone off, get a little drunk, and then do it.

No more lies, no more anxiety attacks, no more self-loathing, no more self-harm, no more anything. In just five hours, I'll be free from all the bullshit that my life has become.

No one in my life knows how bad things are, so I guess I just wanted someone to know, even anonymously, beforehand.
