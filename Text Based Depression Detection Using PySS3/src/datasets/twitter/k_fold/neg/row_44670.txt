Please help me stop thinking about it. I really don't want to die...in the past month, a girl broke my heart and I failed a major exam. I was already stressed enough about having to retake this exam, but then on friday, she crushed me. i'm 35, i've never been in a relationship. I've always been insecure about how I look, so I don't really ever approach women. All of the girls I've liked are ones who befriended me. and each one didn't want to be with me. I could understand if it happened once, but a pattern means there's something wrong with me or a vibe I'm putting out. 

I just feel like i've been gut punched and I cant get air into my lungs. I cant sleep, I'm losing weight. I've talked to my mom, who's unfortunately, my best friend. She claims to understand sometimes, but mostly she just wants me to get over it like I can just flip a switch and focus on school. I've talked to friends and they all say i'm better off without her, which I know is true, but she still led me on, for no reason except maybe because it was fun for her?

I just dont know why god/life/luck is so cruel to me. its like people go out of their way to hurt me. I don't want to kill myself and the only reason is that it would hurt my mom. But i cant stop researching ways to do it. and i'm just sitting here in my room trying to stop crying. 

I'm trying to be get out of this depressive state. I've tried eating the foods that are supposed to be anti-depressants. I've tried working out. I just cant get over the fact that she did this to me, and on top of which, I'm back at square one for this exam I have to now re-do, somehow, without the added depression on top of it. 

what can I do? I've called the suicide prevention line but no one picks up. after about 10 minutes I just hang up. How do I get myself out of this?
