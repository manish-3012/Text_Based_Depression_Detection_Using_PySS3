I'm just ready for everything to be not my problem anymoreI originally worked at ToysRUs, but it shut down after two years. Then I worked at O'Charley's for one year before it shut down. Then I started traveling an hour and a half to work everyday working at BestBuy at the next city over. Because surely this larger city is more prosperous, right?

I just learned that at the beginning of the new year, ship to home orders will be shut off for our store. That's a lot of lost revenue which will probably result in cut hours. And since I'm coded as part time, that more than likely means I'm losing hours.

Back during Easter, my house was hit by a tornado. Me, my mother, and my little brother have been living at my aunt's house until we can get a new house, but my aunt's house is infested with roaches. We told her we would help her clean it up and pay for an exterminator, but she said she can't bring herself to get rid of all of the piles of her late mother's stuff.

And I'm just tired of waiting for things to get better. I'm tired of trying so hard to stay afloat in a world that feels like it's constantly getting worse. I'm tired of having to get a new job every two years. I'm just ready for all of this stuff to not be my problem or responsibility anymore.

I didn't ask to be here. I didn't ask to have all of this responsibility put on my shoulders. And I most certainly didn't ask to be born in a country that constantly criticizes the poor for not being grateful enough while the elites funnel money to the top. I'm just tired of dealing with all of it. I'm ready to not have to deal with any of it.
