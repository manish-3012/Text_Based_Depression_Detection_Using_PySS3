today is my birthdayI'm 20. Officially no longer a teenager. No one can tell me it's just teenage hormones making me feel this way. Can I die yet? Will anyone help me? I give up on getting better. There is no "better" for me. I have tried and tried and tried. Things just get worse. I'm too dysfunctional to live a proper life. I've been stuck like this for almost a year. I'm so tired.
