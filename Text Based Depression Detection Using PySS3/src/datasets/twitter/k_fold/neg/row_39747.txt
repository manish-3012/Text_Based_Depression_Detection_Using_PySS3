How Should I Write My Suicide Note?Hi, Reddit. Considering when I joined Reddit, I never thought I'd be here, asking this question, but here we are. 

I've attempted suicide a few times in the past. The first 3 took place over the span of, I wanna say, a week. I didn't leave a note, didn't say anything, just attempted and no one knew until my mom realized I was missing vials of insulin. The 4th, I tried the "swallowing a shitton of pills" method, but was stopped 15 pills in because I sent individual goodbye texts to my family members and my dad figured me out. 

I don't want to be stopped this time, I want to just go away, you know? But I'm awful at writing letters, I always have been, and I don't know what to put in a suicide note. If anyone has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.
