Don't know what to doMy only option once again seems to just die. I don't know what to do. I'm doing everything I can to fight off the depression - I'm on meds, I go to therapy when I can, I exercise, I don't know what else to do. I didn't even bother talking to my therapist today after group therapy because I know there's nothing he can do to help me. I can't be admitted to the hospital because I'm not really a threat right now and I don't want to go because it wouldn't help and I know that's the only thing he can really offer. I just don't know what else to do and am tired of being miserable. I'm pretty desperate to post this because frankly I hate posting on reddit because people don't usually help and usually end up being mean in some way. So maybe bye reddit
