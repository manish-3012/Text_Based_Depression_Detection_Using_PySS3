I'm here for you. I know what you are feeling.I've experienced an enormous amount of loss recently. I've posted here before reaching out for myself. I experienced more loss only just days ago. My entire family is gone. 

But it isn't about me today. I recognize that the worst part is with feeling alone and even when you speak with someone, knowing that their support comes with a lack of true knowledge of just how awful what you are going through actually is. So from one broken person to another, I am here for you.

Talk to me.
