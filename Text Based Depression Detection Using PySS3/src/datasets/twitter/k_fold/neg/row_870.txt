I want to stab myself to death.My life hasn't be going good places at all lately. The only thoughts tracing my mind are how to kill myself and nothing more. I am apathetic and I do not feel anything but sadness and depression. Literally nothing. Every tiny laugh I made, every smile I tried to make, everything was fake. My parents never loved me, if I would take a shot for everytime they said "You're useless", "I wish you would kill yourself" and "You are nothing", I would've been already dead 5 times over. I don't have friends and I left my other ones after I moved into another city. Nothing kept me alive for the past 4 months but my own fucking cat, and even that doesn't help me anymore. None of my relationships ever worked, my last one was an LDR and I know such things never work out well for those that do not even have the money to visit the nearest country to them â€“ let alone something that is located across the whole world from you. 

I feel nothing but sorrow, I hear nothing but insults and judgements, I am slowly descending into psychopathy and schizophrenia. I want to end myself. I want to overdose on every single pill there is in my kitchen, I want to stab myself at the side of my neck 5 times and choke on my own blood before dying, I want to tie a noose around my neck and finally jump. I want to feel happy again, and that's the only way of doing it. I want to fucking die, that's what brings me happiness.
