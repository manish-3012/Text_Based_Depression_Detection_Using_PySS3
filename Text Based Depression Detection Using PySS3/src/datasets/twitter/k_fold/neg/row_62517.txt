Please help, unsure of where to turnI was recently diagnosed with schwannomatosis with a possibility neurofibromatosis type 2 (pending a auditory canal MRI.) I am a 33 years old and have already had my share of medical issues. Diagnosed with depression and anxiety at age of 12, diagnosed with cancer at age of 27. I have been through multiple surgeries for the cancer and a surgery unrelated to the cancer to remove tumors pressing up my sciatic nerve (these tumors would later be used to help diagnose schwannomatosis). I am in chronic pain. I currently have a new tumor rubbing up against a nerve causing pain in my lower back, leg, knee and foot. My doctor has recently prescribed gabapentin for the pain but it may take sometime and changes to the dose to feel any relief. My most recent MRI showed several new spine tumors starting to form.

I am having reoccurring suicidal thoughts. They come and go whenever they please- when I am alone, when I am with friends, when I am with loved ones, at work, during my commute, when I wake up and when I fall asleep. I have reached out to [https://www.crisistextline.org/](https://www.crisistextline.org/) on a few occasions. They have been helpful. I see a therapist weekly, who is also helpful, but I cannot seem to stop the suicidal thoughts. They are wearing on me.

I am tired. This diagnosis has pulled me to a new low. I do not recall when I have been this depressed, fearful, and lost. The diagnosis is having a negative impact on my relationship with my girlfriend. We have been together a short time, 6 months. Prior to my diagnosis we were working on planning a life together. These discussions have not been easy as we both carry our own baggage from family and past relationships. We also come from different backgrounds which raises the concern/fear on her side of how well I will integrate.

I feel like I am being pulled apart by horses. I do not have the energy to keep shifting focus- from work, to chores at home, to helping my girlfriend understand my diagnosis and how she can be supportive. She is the type to not worry about something until there is something to worry about. She is having trouble understanding why I am distraught over the diagnosis when there is no emergency need for surgery or radiation therapy. I cannot help but think how my life is and will be affected by this genetic disorder. A fog has been placed over everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I want relief. I want certainty. I do not have either of those in my life at the moment. 

I do not know what to do. This is hard and I am scared.
