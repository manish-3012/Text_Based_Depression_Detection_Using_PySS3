College has taught me that I'm not really good for anythingI've been kind of on a downward trend for about three years, starting when I was diagnosed with depression, then had the best friend I've ever had cut me out of his life, failed to get into my top choice for college (or most of my choices for college, for that matter), got to college and realized I can't connect with a single person here, and, most recently, started failing exams.  I feel so alone, I feel like such a failure, I feel like everyone here hates me, I feel like I'm letting everyone I respect down, and I'm sick of waiting to feel differently.
