My ex wife was too beautiful, and too beautiful a person. I should have never met her.And now that I have, I have no way of ever meeting another person who can be as nurturing and driven, creative but humble. I think constantly about taking my life, as a gesture of gratitude for the time that we shared mixed with a realization of guilt over the loss of something (a marriage) that should have never been mine to meet her in, to begin with.
