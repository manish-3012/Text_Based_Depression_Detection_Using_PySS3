How should I answer "do you have a plan" if i have a plan but currently don't plan on using it?My therapist asks me this when I say I'm having suicidal thoughts and I lie and say I don't. I do though, like I know what I'd get where I'd go, what I'd do. I thought of it years ago when I was in a worse place mentally than I am now and it's not like I forgot the plan. 

 If I decided I was going to do it I have it laid out exactly how. But just because I've been thinking about it doesnt mean I'm about to spring into action. I feel like I want to share that so she knows how into the thoughts I've been, but I dont want to get hospitalized. Should I tell her or just keep it to myself?
