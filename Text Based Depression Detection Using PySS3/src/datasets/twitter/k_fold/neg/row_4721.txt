I [20F] dropped out of school because of heroin and now that I'm clean, I'm even more suicidalIt's really hard for me to not throw a pity party for myself, but my life really is shit. I just feel so incredibly depressed right now. I'm not motivated to do anything. Everyone is pressuring me to get a job and go to meetings, and I'm just too depressed to do any of that. I really do want to kill myself. I was going to prostitute myself to make money, and then it just dawned on me how fucked up my life is. I just want to die. I don't think I can ever recover from this.
