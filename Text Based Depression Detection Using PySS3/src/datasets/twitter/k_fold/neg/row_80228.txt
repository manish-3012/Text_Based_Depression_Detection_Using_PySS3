I don't know where Im going or what life is anymore.Nothing feels real. Everything feels ephemeral and fake. I feel like my life is like watching some stupid fucking movie I can't walk out on. But I want to so fucking bad. I see things, I hear things, walls and objects appear to breathe, my brain is screaming at me constantly. Medicine barely helps and it's best for of help is just making me flat and neutral, when it does work. I can't even fucking cry right now. I'm ready to die. I have no future, I can't go to school, I have no friends, I have no life even though it appears I do. I'm so fucking lonely. I can't look at my future and say I want to be alive for that, if it does include schizophrenia/psychosis. I can't handle it anymore. Me killing myself isn't an if anymore, it's a matter of when. I want to so fucking bad but I'm so fucking scared at what lies beyond. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to live life and be happy. But I keep getting thrown into the ground. I don't wanna get back up.
