Review my suicide note! Any thoughts?Hi! I've entered an irrecoverable state. I allowed too much time to pass me by while failing to perform. This can not reassuringly be stopped in the near future nor can past opportunities be regained or recovered. This will cause me lifelong suffering I can't escape. 

Since my problem has no solution I intend to self-terminate my life. I'm sorry it has to be this way. I'm sorry for all the potential lives out there that could be hurt by this. I've made so much progress. I've made so many mistakes. 

Unfortunately I don't find it viable to continue. I held out this far since I didn't understand the cause of my problems. I thought it might have been viable to solve the issues and continue with essentially the same prospects as I had before. This isn't remotely possible anymore. Above all I can't stop the cascade effects on time my absence has left the last 7 years. The pain is too great and the weight of my failures too heavy. A sudden change in direction is unlikely. 

Thank you to all of you out there who has been part of my life. I'm happy to have lived it.
