I tried yesterdayI was stopped but the person made it oh so much worse. Ive had thoughts before, made attempts while alone and always managed to calm down because I was alone and could think.
My boyfriend tried to tell them they were making it worse.
I got to a point were I was just a mix of wanting to still try an to get away from this person but they were sitting on me and had my arm in a tight grip. I was in a panic state of mind and didnt react properly or use words properly, person did what they believed best and I cant fault them for that.  i just wish they had listened to my boyfriend.

All im getting out of this is a hospital bill that only got me a name/diagnosis, the judgments of many people and a living situation where I do not feel safe and a very ugly bruise from being restrained.

Know this is long and rambly but writing this down is helping because the thought is clawing at the back of my mind. This is helping
