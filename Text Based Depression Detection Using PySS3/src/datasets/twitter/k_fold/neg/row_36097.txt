How would one help their suicidal lover?Hello, I'm just simply asking for advice on here if that is okay.
I have a lover who I very much love and hold close dearly, I love them very much.
I won't share too much info about my partner, but they went through a lifetime of hardships and putting themselves in self-destructive situations like self-harm and starvation. They'd rather have no body care for them, but rathermore have that go towards others. 
I've had my fair share of depression and being suicidal, so I know how that is and managed to help them through tough times.
But I'm still worried, they're very self-destructive and self-degrading and they struggle with opening up about their problems, thoughts, and feelings. And then there is me, a perfectly happy, and energetic person. 
To make matters worse, my lover is long-distance, they live states away from me. So what I can really do is limited, so what can I do? I'm doing my best and doing all the right things, like comfort, treating them humanely, and giving them their own time and space to speak about it. Yet, I'm still worried.

This is my first time using Reddit, so i understand if I somehow broke a few guidelines or did something wrong, but thank you anyways.
