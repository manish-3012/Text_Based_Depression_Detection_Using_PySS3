My friend messaged me about half hour ago that he wants to end his life. Since now, he ended on showing me a picture of razor and said "bye, see you later, maybe c:". What should I do?Note I do not have a number to his parents (we are both 16 y/o) neither really know where does he live or where he is at the moment.

Should I call someone? Leave him alone and hope he won't die? Please help.
