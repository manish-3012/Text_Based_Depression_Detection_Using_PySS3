Everyone leaves me in the end. I don't matter in the end.Why do I keep hanging on to people who are willing to abandon me on a whim without any explanation at all? I've lost so many people in my life already. They're either dead or no longer speak to me. I'm only hanging on so that I won't be a bigger burden to my parents than I already am. I don't have a stable job and my savings are running low. The guy I've been speaking to for months has suddenly decided to ghost me. He saved me from the heartache of my manipulative ex and I really thought he was the one. My future plans are fucked because of everything that's happened to me.

I'm sorry if I'm going on a tangent but I've been a mess for the whole day and haven't left my bed. I can barely eat anything and I'm losing weight. I've already been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist but the only thing that's saving me now are the benzos that I've been taking more and more everyday.

My parents are getting old. Unfortunately I don't talk to them very much, but I'm currently only staying alive for them. Once they're gone, nothing will stop me from ending it all.
