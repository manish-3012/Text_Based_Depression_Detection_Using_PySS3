I'm exhausted. I don't know how much longer i can keep going...It's been over a decade of depression and suicidal urges. I've tried medication, counseling and life style changes... In the end the depression comes back again. It all feels like temporary solutions to a chronic problem. I don't know how many more times I can try something new... 

Last time I felt this dark I had friends who would miss me, a serious girlfriend who would mourn me, and a college education to earn. My future had potential.

Various depressive episodes since then has cost me all of that. I don't blame the friends for abandoning me. I was the one who isolated myself. I don't blame the girlfriend for leaving me. I was not easy to maintain a relationship with. I don't blame the college for flunking me. I failed those classes through my own lack of work.

Now years later the friends have long since moved on. The girlfriend is married with two kids. The college is no long even close to a financial possibility.I'm extremely introverted so trying to making new friends hasn't worked, nor have I gotten past a first date in years. And here I am working a shitty job wanting to die. I'm running out of death dates to set, new hobbies to distract myself with and reasons to live.
 
I'm sorry for my rant...
