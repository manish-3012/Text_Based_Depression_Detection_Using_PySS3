Why am I depressed/suicidal?Can someone explain this to me? I have all these opportunities to go somewhere in life, all these people helping me, all this shit and I waste all it, I hate life, I don't want to exist. I underestimate everything I do, I tell myself I will never be shit. 

I feel like I need to fix this before it permanently ruins my life. How can I do that?
