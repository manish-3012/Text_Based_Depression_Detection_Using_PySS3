Iâ€™m having a seriously hard time with bad memories from high school.In high school I was a bad decision machine. One after the other. Mainly centered around driving drunk. (I know that doing that is selfish. I know Iâ€™m â€œsuch an assholeâ€ for doing so. Iâ€™ve heard it all several times. I donâ€™t do it anymore or even drink anymore. Please donâ€™t make that your main takeaway from this. I have other things to share). But it was seriously almost impressive how I was able to make the bad decision in basically every scenario. In the 10th grade I threw up on this girls bathroom floor from drinking too much at a get together on Halloween, and pretty much got shunned. Everyoneâ€™s parents decided this was a reason for them to not want their kid to hang out with me any more. Donâ€™t get me wrong, what happened was an absolute scene. But everyoneâ€™s overall reaction was just so uncalled for. I became a complete outcast for the next year and a half before people FINALLY got off their high horse and decided it didnâ€™t matter anymore. The damage had been done. I understand these incidents may seem minor and not worthy of me worrying, but the damage they had on me is more of what Iâ€™m thinking about. Lmk if you have advice. It was hard being looked at as the douchey kid who makes the wrong decision all the time.
