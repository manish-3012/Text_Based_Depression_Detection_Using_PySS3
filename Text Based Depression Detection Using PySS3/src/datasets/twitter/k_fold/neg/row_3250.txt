I almost did itI'm completely spiraling and I almost didnt come out of it this time. I have a wonderful husband, a 6 month old little boy, a nice job...I SHOULD be happy. But tonight after my son screaming for hours...I walked outside and stood at the fence that runs along the highway near our house....totally at war with myself to climb over and run into traffic or to turn back and walk back home. I'm here so I didnt do it, but I've never gotten that close before :( 30 minutes I stood there watching traffic and thinking about ending it. 
I feel like I'm a terrible mom...I'm the worst at comforting my son when hes crying, I try but nothing I do works and I feel so guilty. I love him but I freaking hate being a mom :'(  I'm the financial burden in my marriage and my husband is just the best guy. I don't know how to tell him about my struggle. I kind of did a few months ago when I had a crazy breakdown, but I've been "fine" since then. The days just seem to be getting more bleak no matter what good things happen. What's wrong with me :(
