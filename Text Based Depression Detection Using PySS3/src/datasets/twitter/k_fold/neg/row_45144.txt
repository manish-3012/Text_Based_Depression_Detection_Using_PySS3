The thoughts wont go away. Everything is just getting worseIts been a few days since ive written a suicide letter, originally it started out as me just venting my problems onto a piece of paper but I think its starting to become more than that. Every day I wake up I look at it, sometimes I read it. I guess it shows since my parents keep asking whats wrong, I cant get up the courage to just show them the paper. Every day since I wrote it my suicidal thoughts are getting worse than ever. I just always think that I have nothing to live for. Do I have a job or friends? No, I tried to get a job but no one would take me and the last friend I had that was in the same state as me was atleast 4 years. I can barely go outside, not because im anxious to just walk and clear my head or anything, I just always tell myself tomorrow. Im not sure what to do anymore, I have the note written, I have pills in my room. I have every element to kill myself and im just afraid one day soon its going to happen. I dont know what to do anymore, I dont know what to think, I never feel like I belong. Hell, more than half of my family just acts like I dont exist, my brother just came back in my life recently and he doesnt even care about me. I just dont know, ive been going to therapy and psychiatrists for years and recently I just dont go. Its costing me $141 because i forgot about my psychiatrist appointment the other day. I hate myself, my weight, my face, the way I am, I hate waking up because its just another day full of wanting to die. Ive thought about contacting the national suicide hotline but im just too scared to talk on the phone or even go to the online chat. Maybe I can get some courage to do it today.
