I can't talk to my mom about it.She doesn't really help at all. She usually just whines at me about what I'm doing wrong. This cuts my list of few people I talk to to about 2. One I love too much to say anything to, and the other I haven't talked to in a while. So...that leaves the hotline and reddit. Not the best options tbh.

Edit: going to bed. Will answer any comments tomorrow.
