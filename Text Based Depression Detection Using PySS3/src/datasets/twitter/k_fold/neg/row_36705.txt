It feels logicalI feel like it's the most logical decision. I don't think I'm useful for much of anything. It's like I'm kind of just, here. I owe a ton in student loans (gotta love the US education system) and I have a bunch of medical debt (yay disabilities). I know that if I die the debts go away, and it seems like the best choice for my family. I'm just kind of taking up space by existing and making things harder for everyone around me.
