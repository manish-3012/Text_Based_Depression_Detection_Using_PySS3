a waste of lifeIâ€™m miserable. I donâ€™t enjoy anything. All my relationships are distant. I canâ€™t connect with anyone. Everything wrong in my life is my own fault. Iâ€™m toxic. Iâ€™m worthless. Iâ€™m the worst person I know. I canâ€™t do it anymore. They keep telling me it gets better but Iâ€™m 21 now and Iâ€™ve only gotten worse. I want to be dead already. I donâ€™t treat people with kindness or patience or love or respect. Iâ€™m an emotional pyramid scheme. My heart is a black hole. I am empty. I am evil. I have no interest in getting better anymore. I just want to be dead.
