I've never felt like I'm worthy, I'm inferior to everyone around me and I'm just a spectator in this world!As a spectator of this world I feel useless, unworthy of anything in life and I feel inferior to everyone around me. Everyday I walk around and feel like I don't belong and I'm just watching over everyone live a happy life while I rot and no one even cares. 

Even if I hang myself, no one will care!
