I've just stopped.I think about what I'd do, if I was in a position to talk someone off the ledge... I wouldn't do anything. If someone wants to end it, that's their call. Because that's what I'd want if I was in their situation.

I've stopped talking to my friends as much. To distance myself. "Talk to yourself like you talk to your friends", well now I'm barely talking to them at all. 

I've stopped trying to seriously get a job, and my parents obviously are very upset. The faster we separate the better. The less connections, the less goodbyes.

I've stopped caring. Someone/something please just take me out of this world before I have to do it myself.
