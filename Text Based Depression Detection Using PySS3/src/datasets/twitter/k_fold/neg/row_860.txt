no clickbaitSome days I wish I could just stop. It's started to become more then less. This is where I am. Churning down a hallway trying to work as hard as I can with the work I'm signed to do, but still not getting forward. It's deliriously tiring. Seeing people get promoted in front of me for doing jackshit or having an opportunity in front of me without actually being clever enough to do the job. It's all just tiring. It feels like I'm bathing in hellfire. Scratching through each piercing arrow. Happily conjoining with them, just do sear myself even more. I'm so tired and so fed up with the situation. I wish. I just wish somebody close to me knew what I feel. And I wish somebody could give me a push and an answer. I'm so fed up
