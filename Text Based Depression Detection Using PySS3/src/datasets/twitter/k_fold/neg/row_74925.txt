I really need someone nowI wish I had someone to talk to. I've been up all damn night finding ways to kill myself with cyanide, or to create it. I keep on having this terrible feeling, this unhappiness and unease. The worst feeling of all is the "need" or "urge" to just do something, anything, to act! But I am left with nothing to act on, nothing to do. I have my computer, but this does not satisfy, nothing will satisfy it, only temporary solutions such as taking excessive quantities of drugs, alcohol, or pain make me forget it for a while, but always it returns with a vengeance, I need it to end or I will kill myself, it makes me insane! I need something to deal with just existing, its too surreal, too intense, far too much for my mind! I wish I could just die, anything to get away from it! I am left with no one to talk to, my friends all appear to be in the same boat or are unable to help, my family has shown to plainly not care or take me seriously, despite the recurring attempts at making doctor appointments, saying how much I wish death upon myself, just explaining how I feel, they do nothing except say "it will work out" which it has not, nor will it, this is a part of me permanently it seems, for it has not gone away for the past 4-3 years. I wish I could talk with the school counsellor or the health nurse, but I have a very very strong mistrust of any school resources based on past unfortunate experiences with the municipal school system. I wish I has someone to confide in and trust, someone who is always there no matter what time it is, someone who will be there always. Fuck this whole fucking shitty world, I hope it comes to the end it deserves.
