I am feeling things again after several years.I have been under treatment for a long time now, and until the past couple months the wellbutrin was keeping me numb but productive.  Being productive at my job has been the only thing that has motivated my treatment, I cant afford to be fired.  So having hit a rut at work I started taking a 2nd med on top.  This has lead to me feeling again.  The emotions are not enjoyable.  I hate myself, and I want to die, I am afraid.  Normally I never worry about actually killing myself.  My feelings have always been predictable, now however I am feeling things I haven't in a very long time.  I am worried because I am feeling worse than I ever have, and feeling things I haven't in a long time.  I have started drinking again to numb myself and this isn't a sustainable solution.

I don't really know what I am asking.  Advice on either how to control feelings or the best dosage of wellbutrin and ventlafaxine to be numb again but productive would be equally helpful at this point.
