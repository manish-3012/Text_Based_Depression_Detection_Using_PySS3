Think about itSuicide is a chronic disease that you pass on to everyone you've ever known or met.

Think about it. 

Think about someone close to you, someone you truly love. 

How would you feel if they suddenly died without warning? A suicide; a failed attempt to end all the problems in their life. No consult to you, just a letter. 

Think about it. 

Think about how all of their problems now have been passed on to you. 

Think about how you could have helped them. Think about what you did wrong. 

You're thinking about it. 

You don't know what you would do. You never expected this to come. 

Think about it. 

The fact that you are here and reading this right now means that you *have* thought about it before even if you didn't consciously do so, but now you are.

I know you're still thinking about it. 

You don't know what you would do. 

You don't know how you'd cope with this yet. 

You're really thinking about it. 

Well, stop. 

Think about this. 

Think about how many people you have met and how many people have influenced your life. 

You wanna know something?

You've influenced their lives as well. 

Your very presence on this earth has affected the lives of countless people. People you don't even know. 

Think about how you felt imagining your best friend, your family member, your parents or your significant other suddenly disappearing without notice. 

You're not the only one to feel like that. 

That brief feeling, even imagined, is passed on to every single person who has ever known who you are. 

The cashier at the grocery store you see regularly but think nothing of? 

What do you think goes through their mind?

Your best friend who thought they were terribly close to you? What about them?

Suicide is the one disease that has no cure that can be found in a lab. 

Infinite amounts of money could be spent but to what avail?

**YOU** are the cure. 

**YOU** are the solution. 

**YOU** can put a stop to this disease.

**YOU** are an incredibly valuable cure and you never even knew it.

Think about it.
