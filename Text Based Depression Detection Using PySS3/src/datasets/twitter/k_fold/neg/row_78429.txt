This Christmas...Dear members of the Reddit community of /r/suicidewatch,

2 months ago I lost my cousin and my best friend to suicide.  He was living with me when he decided to take his life and it is still very hard to come to terms with the fact that he was so sad and that nobody had any idea and could not help him. This will be our first Christmas without him and while I know that he is at peace and is no longer struggling with his pain, it will be one of the hardest moments that my family will have to deal with. He was an amazing young man who could brighten any room with his smile and his warm heart.  I wish I could have shared his love with the world.  


I would like to tell everyone here that I am thinking of you this Christmas.  I am sending love, and good wishes, and hope for everyone who has lost a loved one or who may have lost themselves. 

Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays.

Yours always,

Lady_Rugger
