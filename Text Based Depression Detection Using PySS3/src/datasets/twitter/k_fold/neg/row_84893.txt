Jumping from a bridgeHow much does it actually hurt? Iâ€™ve read a lot online but I guess I want to hear some opinions from you guys... it is starting to really set in that my ex girlfriend is not coming back and that I completely handled our break up like a coward, I didnâ€™t have the balls to end it myself and had many chances to, and I was a complete asshole in the process. 

Anyway if anyone can provide some opinion on the bridge thing


Thanks
