Just feeling really low...Hi, so I made a 'throwaway' account for obvious reasons, dunno if anyone will read this but I guess it'll help to get my thoughts down.

I've felt "depressed" for quite a few years, through childhood and uni when I kept it to myself, but only openly so the last 2 years. There's trauma that I have dealt with, like from childhood abuse and violence when I was younger, sexual assault and even to broken hearts and being lonely for a large part of my life.

I was very active, and life was okay or even manageable up to 2 years ago and now I can barely go outside sometimes, from low self-esteem, disliking myself ... I HAVE made a slow progress in the right direction since 2 years ago, but it feels like it'll never end sometimes.. 

I'm doing ok again career wise (back at university) studying something I actually enjoy. But life is so much more than career.. I've always wanted to find someone to share my life with, and more importantly finally accept myself, be confident to go out more. I love hiking but it breaks my heart that I can't gather the courage to go outside sometimes.

I'm trying to keep this positive but this week I was thinking of how specifically I would end it, and I haven't done that before.  Today I've been crying all day, and I gave myself 2 months from now for things to get better, as a last stand, and if it doesn't I don't want to be here any more and planning to just end it really... sorry

Thanks to anyone who read this
