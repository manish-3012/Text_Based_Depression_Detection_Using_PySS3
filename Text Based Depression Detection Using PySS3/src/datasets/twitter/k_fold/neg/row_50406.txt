how do i keep people from being impacted when i'm gone?the only other thing that's keeping me from killing myself aside from the afterlife is the fact that my family and friends all love me and would be traumatized if i were to die by my own hand. because of that, suicide would be extremely selfish, and i dont want to cause more problems than i've already caused while i was alive.
why do people have to chain themselves to me? they dont deserve to follow me into this mental abyss all because of my own actions.
