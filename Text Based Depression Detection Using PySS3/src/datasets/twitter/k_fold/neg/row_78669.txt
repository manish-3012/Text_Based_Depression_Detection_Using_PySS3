My Friends are driving me to have suicidal thoughts every nightI just want real friends I canâ€™t even have that my friends just hang out and plan shot behind my back.  I donâ€™t have anyone I can trust and no one to talk to. All this is gonna give me is blanket statements for cheering up so idk what the point is. This is the wrong life. It fucking sucks. Im not a virgin but I havenâ€™t ever even had a first kiss. Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship. I guess Iâ€™m just not worth one. Every night Iâ€™ve been thinking about writing my suicide note and killing myself. The only thing stopping me at this point is the fact that I wonâ€™t be able to see their reactions to my death.
