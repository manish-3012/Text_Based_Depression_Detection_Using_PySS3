No best friend anymoreMy best mate has been a rock after recent events in my life.  He encouraged me to open up about my feelings, my depression, my suicidal thoughts.  Always cheered me, always looked out for me.

Now I think he's had enough.  For the past few days he's been giving me one or two word responses to my messages, never really engaging in any conversation.

Now the logical part of me knows that a) he could be busy, b) he could have other things on his mind, etc.  But logic rarely wins when feeling this bad.  Paranoia is now king.  So it feels he doesn't want to talk any more.

I feel like taking an overdose, partly for attention and partly I genuinely want to die.

If you got this far then thanks for reading.
