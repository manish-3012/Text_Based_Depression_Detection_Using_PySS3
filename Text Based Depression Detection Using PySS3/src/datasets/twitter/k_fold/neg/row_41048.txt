Well, everything arrived and I've done test runs.Going to kill myself now.Well, see ya later I guess. It's my 20th birthday in 23 minutes and I have to die by then. Cutting it a bit close, I think haha. I've commented here a lot before on a few different accounts. My first (and last) post here though. You're all so kind and sweet, I think I just wanted to say that. Whelp, goodbye guys. Blessed be. Thank you to everyone I've made friends with on reddit. etc also go learn how to solve a Rubik's cube or lock pick. It's fun and anyone can do it. I guess I'll die then (shrugging guy emote). 


See ya later alligator
