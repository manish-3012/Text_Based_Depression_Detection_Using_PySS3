Because of declining grades caused by depression and sleep problems, I'm on a leave of absence from universityMy parents demand that I decide whether or not to apply to community college by January 2, but I feel that I need more time to look for a job. If I find a job, they will allow me to do that instead of community college. If not, they demand that I go to community college this semester.
