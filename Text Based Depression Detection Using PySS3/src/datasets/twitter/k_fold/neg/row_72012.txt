I would very much like some reasons to liveMy parents still love me. 

That's the only thing that keeps me from doing it. 

That, and fear of what it's like to not be alive.

Otherwise, I'd do it. And maybe if I got drunk or high enough, I'd be able to follow through anyway.

I need reasons to live.
