Have anyone said to herself/himself "I want to go home" despite being at home?Whenever I feel very bad I whisper to myself "I want to go home" despite being home... It is a feeling that I want to be somewhere else then in this dark place that I am right now... Somewhere where I can feel security, happiness and peace... I guess the only place where some of us will ever find this is in the afterlife...
