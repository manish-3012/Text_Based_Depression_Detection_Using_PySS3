Wondering what to do with my last one or two weeksI am not looking for help. I know this is a community for those who do, and I've posted before. But this time I've decided for sure. I want to live the last days of my life having fun, but since I'll be dead everything feels kinda pointless. Any suggestions for what to do before I go?
