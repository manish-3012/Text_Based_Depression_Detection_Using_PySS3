I feel extremely alone. It's too painfulMy insecurities, incompetence and my inability to survive in the real world stresses me out of my mind. My parents want me to get out of their house asap after I finish college/get a job but with my current state, idk if graduating is even a possibility. No one in my family knows about my mental state so I can't fuck up.

Everything is fine during the daytime but when I'm alone at night, lying on my bed in the dark, I feel exhausted of life and just want to end it. I feel so helpless and alone in this world. I don't have friends to talk to. I'm still alive bc I don't want to hurt my family and bc I believe in hell.

I'm ranting but it would just feel so good to be loved and be understood by someone rn.
