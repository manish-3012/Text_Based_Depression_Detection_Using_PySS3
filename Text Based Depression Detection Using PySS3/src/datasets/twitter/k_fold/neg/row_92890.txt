Should I be at peace?So my best friend and I have had a huge fight. Which I am at fault for. I've tried to apologize and make things right. But she wants nothing to do with me now. Its my last straw. Between this, my parents constantly fighting, waiting on ssd, this whole virus shit. I cant do it any more. I've tried talking to my therapist. But he wont talk to me unless I go back on meds, that I dont have the money for. My best friend was my last reason to stay alive. Now that she's gone. I dont know what to do. I have already wrote out what items go to who. Now all I have to do is get the guts to do this. It kind of scares me that it brings me peace.
