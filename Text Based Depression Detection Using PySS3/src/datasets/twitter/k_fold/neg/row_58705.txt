Suicidal thoughts softened by reading of failed suicidesI don't know if this helps anyone else, but for some reason when I literally have the bottle in my hand and am contemplating what to write out, if I read about how others tried suicide and failed, as well as the aftermath, it softens my suicidal thoughts. Maybe I'm just a coward and it makes me scared that I won't be thorough enough and will have serious consequences, I don't know what else it could be. These people don't normally talk about regretting it or if they're going to try again. I realized this just now by the way, sorry for the choppy/shitty post, I just wanted to know if this helped anyone else get off the ledge or what. Also please don't try this to see what it does to you when you're having severe suicidal thoughts just in case it works in the opposite way.
