Houseless and hoping for deathI am currently Houseless and sleeping in the streets. I am hoping tonight that i will die in my sleep because of the cold. I have no friends, no family(or none that care anyway) have not talked to my mom in 7-8 years. I just sent her a text to the number i remember her having. Telling her goodbye that i was ending my life. If the cold doesn't do it then very soon i am going to do it. Plan is already drawn up and ready. 

So goodbye
