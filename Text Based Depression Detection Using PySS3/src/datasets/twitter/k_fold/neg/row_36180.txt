I think at some point I'm gonna end killing myselfA few years ago, someone told me that if I continue to be how I am, I'm not gonna live past 30's and is not that I think that it is some kind of destiny I have because someone told me that but is just something I remember every time I feel like shit.

I'm 21 years old, trans  
I haven't began transition and I don't think I will because I don't really see the point, I think I'll continue to be the unhappy person I am. Also, let's be real and sorry if any trans folk is reading this, no matter what I do, I'll still be female, that's something I can't change.   
  
I don't like being the center of attention of anything, I'm pretty shy, avoid speaking over the phone or going out of the house unless I have to, I only have my family and a few friends and I don't want to lose anyone, I don't to feel more alone than I'm now.   
   
I have dropped University twice(arts and computer engineering), I feel like a failure, that I'm not good at anything and everyone is a liar when they tell me otherwise, I just suck at life.

I'm still virgin and I'll die like that because I find sex weird, like it in my head is in some way but my body doesn't fit in that way.  I don't make any effort on change that, don't care very much about my appearance or hygiene, what's the point?
   
I have a nice family, they love me, so I don't how to stop feeling like shit, I mean, they care for me, I can go to the university, I have food and everything yet I'm this mess of a person

The funny think is that I have told some friends about the trans stuff and they seem pretty positive but I don't understand why, it's not normal wanting to change something you can't, I think like they are just being condescending.

I don't have intentions of killing myself in this moment, it's just though that I have in this moment but I fear death and my family has already dealt with suicide in the past and I don't want them to pass for that again, is not nice but I fear that one day I'll stop being afraid of death and couldn't care less about my family or anything else for the matter, and I know that it will come because every day I feel worse.
