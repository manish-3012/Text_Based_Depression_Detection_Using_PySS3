I've wanted to kill myself/die since I was 13. I'm 24 now and the feeling didn't changeI've wanted to kill myself/die since I was 13. Thats when I realised my mum is cheating on my dad who went abroad for work. That time I even wrote a suicide letter where I tell my dad about my mum. I wanted to overdose on painkiller pills. I've never done that (obviously). Years past, my dad knows about affair, my parents still stayed together and worked it out but my feeling still remains. I want to die. My family and I went abroad to my dad and I started studying in foreign language. I failed some of my courses twice now. I know that its a different language so I shouldn't be too hard on myself but at the same time I know I haven't put the work. I slacked in college. Now in university I drink too much. I play games too much to escape reality. I procrastinate. I don't trust therapists, even though i should. I don't know what to do. All I know is that I want to die. I could never commit suicide cause I love my family and I know they'd be devastated. But I want to die in any other means. Car accident, cancer, anything. I don't know what to do.

I currently live in England.
