Desperate plea for helpI'm back here again because I have no one. It seems like everyone disappears in my time of need. Everything that has been hurting me has been amped up to a ten. I am a senior graduating in 2 days. I have 5 essays, 2 projects and 3 tests to do. But I can't do them do to this burning dull pain in my chest. Can't sleep either. I just lie in bed hoping the hollow feeling would go away. Maybe I could do work. I am not graduating, as I currently am failing too many classes. I have been extremely isolated the past 4 years and have not formally hung out with any friend in 2 years. I go outside once or twice a week, and the only people I have contact with is family. But I constantly argue with them and they have been more and more aggressive towards my "lazy and childish behavior". I don't even want to talk about girls. I am never asking another one out again. I am the holy grail of unattractive. I am short, have extremely bad teeth, have a weird looking face, complete lack of confidence and self love, and extremely needy. And due to this, I have asked over 60 girls out and all said no. I am a kissless hugless virgin with no life skills and I'm turning 19 in less than 4 months. I lost all my willpower and ego with that, and have not even attempted to contact any girls in my classes even though I like a few. Same with friends. Constant ghosting and unreliability has made me extremely paranoid. If someone does even the slightest of nicest things to me I'll snap and call them a liar or trying to take advantage of me. I have stopped talking to pretty much everyone. I feel like there are no options. I have been treated like a joke my entire life. I don't think I can get those assignments done, ask out that girl, and do my best to recover from this living nightmare. But the pain, paranoia, fear, solitude, anger are all just too much. I know a sinking ship when I see one. I am going to kill myself soon with whatever it takes if the pain continues.
