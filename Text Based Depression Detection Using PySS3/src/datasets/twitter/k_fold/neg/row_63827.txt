why do I need to suffer more than other people for having my suicidal tendencies and depression taken seriously?It has been over 2 years I am dealing with suicidal thoughts but it certainly feels more than that. I have no one to vent to or maybe I don't feel comfortable venting to anyone that's why I'm  stuck by myself with this pain. No matter how hard I try seeking help all I get told is to pray and to look at other people suffering more than me. It often just makes me feel way worse and I have no way of expressing it. I cry my eyes out and contemplate about ending it every single day. Sometimes I just close my eyes and force myself to sleep to get rid of this feeling but it's always the same. I don't like being compared, I really want to be taken seriously and get some validation. I have always tried to validate and comfort others going out of my way but I hardly find anyone being there for me. Mostly all I have seen is my friends calling me out for being weak and annoying. My girlfriend isn't that supportive either I wonder why can't I leave her, is it because I'm too lonely and desperate to be alone? I really wish I was successful in tying the knot back in 2018. I tried killing myself that day but the knot got loose and I fell. Till this date, when I have anxiety attacks all I get is kicked away and people justifying themselves about my situations that they had helped me before. I think there's something wrong with me because everyone I see is happy and settled with their lives but I cannot find a single person, a single thing, a single reason to live. Once I said these outloud and I was told that I deserve dying and I'm an ungrateful person. Why does no one understand that I'm not being ungrateful on purpose, it's hard for me, I can't explain how I feel. I wish I was miserable enough to have myself validated but here I'm stuck in the middle without any end. Please help me end this
