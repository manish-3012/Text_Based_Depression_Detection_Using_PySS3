Tired of the parody that is my lifeMy 25th birthday is very close and I once again realize how little I've accomplished no matter how hard I've tried. I have no friends, never had any for a very long time. Never had real ones anyway. I've never had a girlfriend and know that I never will know love. It apparently isn't something I deserve for some reason.

I don't know what's wrong with me but seeing everyone that I know (family etc.) around me live normal, social lives increases the pain I feel tenfold. I can't truly talk about it with anybody and nobody truly knows how I feel. 

Last night it got very tempting to just throw myself in front of a car when crossing the street. I didn't have the courage to do it but the thought that part of me hopes that I someday will scares me somewhat. I can't grow old like this. I'll become an abomination of society.
