anyone in this damned cycle?- feel awful
- see no way to fix it
- still tries to do some improvements in life
- things seem to get a bit better but..
- it ends up not working
- tons of effort bring barely anything on the table
- feel really awful now
- as last resort go see the doctor
- see a therapist and/or get meds
- some kind of hope that this will help
- none of it really helps
- somehow you realize you must carry your weight alone
- carry it for a while
- restart feeling awful and rinse and repeat

maybe it's just me but that's basically the past 15 years for me
