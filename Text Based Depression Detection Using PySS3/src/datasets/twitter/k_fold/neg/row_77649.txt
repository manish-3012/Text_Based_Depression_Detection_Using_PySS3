i relapsed again I self harmed. again. i once promised someone I wouldn't but they didn't ask me to promise, so I don't think it counts. i can't tell anyone else because I don't have anyone else to tell and anyone that would listen, wouldn't care. I just couldn't sit in silence anymore. I've only told 1 person about my self harming before. it was a big mistake. i hope this isn't.
