Do things get better?It all happened so quickly. I was fine. 

The thought of me being happy feels like a punishment. I shouldn't be happy. 

I'm suicidal because of what I've done to others. I make everything a big deal. If not for me I wouldn't have trust issues, anxiety  and whatever else I have. It's all my fault. I wouldn't have affected anyone. I've wasted people's time. I've never been any good. I can't remember making them laugh, it's all just thoughts of the damage my words could have done, my actions, honesty and so on. I'm just there. 

I don't want to talk to anyone because I feel guilty feeling better. Why should I feel better after hurting people? 

I don't want to kill myself because people will feel bad for me. I don't want that attention. I just want to disappear.
