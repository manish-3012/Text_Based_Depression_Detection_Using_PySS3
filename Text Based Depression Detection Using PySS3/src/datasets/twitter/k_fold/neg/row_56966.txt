There's no other wayI'm 22 now. I am not going to graduate this year due to financial issues, but my parents don't know this. I live with them and my younger sister. When I was 14 I posted to social media saying I was depressed and my father found out when my aunt told him. He threatened to divorce my mother and leave us and then he beat me. When all was said and done he sat me down and told me he loved me and was sorry. This was normal. 

I have been raped twice, once by one close friend and once by someone who not only knew I had been raped previously but who I thought was a friend. I have been sexually abused/assaulted every year since I was 13. I have been suicidal since then, with four failed attempts. 

I don't know what solutions there are. I have begun self harming again. I cry at work where no one can see me and at school on a daily basis. I feel so alone, even with my friend. I hate this world. I am making a plan to die next year. I'm sorry.
