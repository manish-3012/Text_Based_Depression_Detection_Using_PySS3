On my own.Iâ€™m 25M. My family and I are not on speaking terms, but thatâ€™s a long story. I havenâ€™t any friends because I have crippling anxiety. October of 2019, my girlfriend of three years killed herself. Her and I were together just before, we had just made up after a fight. I remember being relived because it was okay again. I was happy. I think she was happy with me, she claimed to be at least. I know a single person canâ€™t cure depression, canâ€™t change this kind of thing but I canâ€™t help but feel like I could have changed the outcome. I could have done something different. Because of quarantine I no longer have a distraction from my thoughts. I used work as a way out, but Iâ€™m off now. Ever sense October Iâ€™ve been so alone, and unable to cope. Itâ€™s almost three am for me, Iâ€™m shaking a lot but I canâ€™t pin point exactly why. I canâ€™t fall asleep, all I can do is think about her. All I can do is think about the state of my life. I just wish I did something different. So fucking badly. My life has been almost empty for so long and now it is. I just donâ€™t know what to do with myself.
