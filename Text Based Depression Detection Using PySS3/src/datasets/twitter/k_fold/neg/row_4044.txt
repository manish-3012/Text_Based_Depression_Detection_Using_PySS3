So thatâ€™s my peers graduatingAll over social media about the brave ones who stepped into the nhs to help during COVID and then thereâ€™s me whoâ€™s completely slipped through the net, forgotten about, like my hard work and achievements over the past 3 years never happened. All because I couldnâ€™t step in to help after having to take some time off because of my mental health. No one truly gives a toss and every waking second is a living nightmare. Iâ€™m trapped, because even if I were to continue living on, Iâ€™ll forever be the person who didnâ€™t assist in tackling the COVID pandemic. My time is running out fast.
