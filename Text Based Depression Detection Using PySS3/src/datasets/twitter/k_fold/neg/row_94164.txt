I cannot stand to be alive anymoreHi...  


So i don't know where to start. I'm not happy at all. It's a start i guess. I remember when i was a kid, about 7 or 8 years old, it was the first time i thought about suicide. I was standing on the border of a window at home, i was on the 4th floor and i was thinking about jumping.  Retrospectively i should have done it, i would have spared myself a life of suffering.  


Maybe it comes from the fact that my father was beating my mother when she was pregnant of me. I've been made inside of someone who was suffering, depressive. It's been 8 months that i don't enjoy anything anymore. I live like a machine. From the morning to the evening, i'm in pain. Well, there is a reason behind that. Someone broke my soul. In millions pieces.  I never felt so sad. It was like if all the suffer from my life was coming back. I managed to survive to this, but i'm dead inside. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Even tears don't come anymore. Well...Sometimes....But it's like one tear or two. I'm dead inside. I hate my life, i'm lonely AF. Yes i do have friends, but i don't want to talk about how i feel.  


I tryed to changed my behavior, to reconstruct myself. I try to become religious, i have a new job. But fuck...All i do is doing things because if i stay inactive with myself, i want to die. Like now. So in the evening i drink. I drink so i can start to lose myself and sleep in the best case. I don't see an end to this situation. I was trying to convince myself : Ok dude, with this new job you can in 2-3 years move to another country start a life from scratch in a new environment. But... How can i wait 3 years in my situation. As a day look like an eternity.   


I want to die, but i can't. I don't know why i can't do that. Maybe this is the limit where your survival instinct stop you to make this idea real. I just feel that it won't solve the problem. That this is not a solution. Well, i'm killing myself slowly anyway. I smoke around 60 cigarettes/day. Even at my work an old guy told me " Please smoke less ". It's ok in my work to take a break often to think. So every hour i go out to smoke 2 cigarettes. It takes me 5 minutes max. And when back at home i'm a chain smoker.  I don't even clean my home. It's disgusting. There is cups of coffee everywhere with cigarettes buts inside, dirty clothes, half eaten food, bottle of wine everywhere. I broke my bed so now i sleep on the ground. I could buy a new one but i don't give a fuck.   


I don't know how to explain what is going on inside me. It's like if i wanted to get out of my body, like if i was trap inside myself. This is an horrible feeling. This is like if my whole body is hurting. Burning from the inside. This is physically painful.  I want to die.
