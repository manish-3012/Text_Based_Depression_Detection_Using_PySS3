I'm 14 and I want to commit suicide painlesslyI'm already sure that I'll be the one who'll kill myself so please spare me the sob story. People are such hypocrites to tell me that "you matter" and spread positivity and shit like that. I just am so sick of it here. I'm planning to end it all after Christmas. I want to die not suffer more. I'm sick of people acting like they like me, for all I care they think I'm crazy. I seek help and still feel like over-reacting. And maybe I am crazy. I crave attention and love from people. Thats why I still wanna survive without getting brain damage and shit. 

This whole paragraphy is making no sense but who else can I talk to but people who feel the same way as I do? I've tried to do it several times but somehow my plans never suceed. I see no purpose in life so why am I even here? Just to suffer more? Dead or alive people wouldn't care so might as well get done with it. The younger I am the less people I'll meet
