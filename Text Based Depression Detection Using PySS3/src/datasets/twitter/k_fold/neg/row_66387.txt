I'm 17 and pregnant. My boyfriend left me and I really want to die!I have no idea what to do. My boyfriend and I had been dating for about almost a year.  We were doing pretty good until I found out I was pregnant. He suddenly became a different person. He has just left me. He says he wanted me to have an abortion. I'm alone and scared. I don't know what to do. It's my mistake. I don't want to tell anyone about this. I feel like I'm worthless. I'll go to buy a rope tomorrow after school. I'm planning about my suicide because I just want to make sure that I'm going to die for real. I don't want to be saved. Life is hard. Birth control is so important. Don't be stupid like me!
