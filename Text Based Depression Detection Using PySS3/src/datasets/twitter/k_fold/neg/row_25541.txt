ANOTHER fight with my wife! I feel worthless and hopeless!She was complaining earlier about a problem she was having at work. I always paint her out to be the villain but I know I am just as much to blame. Anyway, when she started talking loudly about the problem, I kindly told her to calm down. I didn't tell her as though I was against her, I told her because she was getting worked up, making a mountain out of a mole hill. I told her that because I simply wanted her to relax. Big mistake!
She had more alcohol before I came home from work and me telling her to calm down caused an explosion in her the size of the atomic bomb! She badgers me and badgers me until I back down which I won't do. She wants me to be a doormat and say "yes dear" like a spineless jellyfish.

I vowed when we got married to make her happy. What she does when she talks to me like this is belittle me until I feel worthless. I guess if I'm going to make her happy, I should relieve her of the burden of me. Maybe I should carry out my decision to end my life. Maybe I should do it soon. I know it will not only make her happy but it will end my pain. I can't talk to her. I'm all alone. I don't know what to do. I'm lost! I wish she saw that what she does hurts me. 

As I've said in previous posts, she won't have sex with me or give me affection. She's tied to this job that she hates, and takes it out on me, I might add. I'm her punching bag! If I go away, it's one less problem she has. Maybe I should just do it. I don't know.
