Help! My friend is suicidal and I'm not sure what to do!Hello, recently my friend online has been planning his suicide since last night and decided tomorrow he wants to off himself. He lives in a different state and I don't know where exactly he lives in that state. I've considered calling the police to do a wellness check but I don't know what use that would be since I don't know his address?? I know what state he lives in and I've known him for around a year now but he isn't replying to any of my messages. I can't help but panic. I can't loose him, I am so unsure of what to do please help!!
