I wrote this out because I'm probably not going to make it to 2016I'm trying to figure out what to do with my cat,  he's the only thing that really means anything to me and I want him looked after. Once that's dealt with I'm doing it. I feel like someone, even a random on the Internet should read this. 



In the event of my death,  whether it was accidental or a suicide, all my things including whatever insurance payouts if any is to be split between *redacted*
It's because of them that I've survived for so long. There is a note on my computer somewhere,  I wrote it a while ago so it's probably out dated. 
I tried.  I tried so fucking hard to overcome this hell that has been going on since *redacted* took the easy way out. That ruined me. The last year has been a blur. It's like it was last Christmas just yesterday. 
I'm tired of struggling, tired of feeling like this,  tired of getting fucked around because of money. I'm tired of being tired. Every day I force myself out of bed, force myself to go to my shitty job, force myself to be social, force myself not to drive into a wall. I feel like crying but it never happens. I've tried to find a girl to keep me away from my thoughts but thats never worked. I'm lost, helpless, lonely, angry, depressed. I don't remember what it's like to be happy. This isn't living,  I'm just fucking existing. 
Burn what's left of my body and forget about me, I'm fucking leaving.  
*redacted*
Ps: nothing is accidental you're damn right I killed myself, *redacted* is probably going to be next.
