Dad called me worthless and well now I want to dieso I am 25, unemployed and extremely uncertain about the future work wise and financially. And I haven't been working for months now and I have no certainty about what's next in my life. They yell at me everytime we talk about it and tonight he slammed the door and called me worthless. This world is so fucking unfriendly and cold as it is that the two people are supposed to love me my parents , one calls me worthless. Well I had a bout of bad depression in college and it was because I am gay and it causes me a lot of pain
