I am worthlessI wanna end this shit, I am srsly thinking about it, it's just too much, well imma try to make it short, I am 19yrs old, since my childhood, my father never taught me to do anything in any field of life, after getting my  High school diploma (which is the only little success in my whole life, and yeeah, not that great as a success) I am failing everything I do, I tried to attend university in the field i want, getting into an institute, getting a gf, to immigrate, getting accepted in REV (transcription website) or even find something with which i can build my future, I just fail, even though I really have pure intentions and all i wanna do is good, my little bro has down syndrome, he is my reponsibility for life, if i cant find a job, make money and build a future, how can I support him ? my father is an asshole, i'm being rejected a lot by girls, and many people told me that i'm worthless (and they are right), i swear i am trying to do good things, i want to make happy those who helped me, i want to donate to the poor, i want to give my little brother a life, but it's just impossible,  whatever I do, it dosent work, nothing works, everything fails
