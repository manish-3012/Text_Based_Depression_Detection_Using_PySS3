I need helpDo you ever feel like youâ€™re just a background character? Or that youâ€™ll just always be that one person in someoneâ€™s life that killed themself? I keep zoning out thinking of how I could end my life and tell people. I kind of find comfort in that I could just end it all and be fine. I keep getting really scared of my brain and I listen to music a lot so that I donâ€™t have to be alone with my thoughts.
