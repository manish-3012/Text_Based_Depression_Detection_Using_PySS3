life?I'm the true meaning of the walking dead, i'm 17 yrs old male and i'm so tired of everything. i'm getting angrier everyday because of my problems like OCD,anxiety,deppresion,stress but sometimes i can control them. one of the painful problem for me is my skin condition, it's super oily and gets strange smell  very soon after face washing. I talked to my mom about it and she told me that it's because of my age and everything is fine, but i think that something is wrong. I'm tying to maintain good hygiene, but my skin kills me, because of this i always keep distance from everyone, cause i think that my face smells bad. ''MY FACE SMELLS LIKE I DID NOT WASH IT FOR 1 MONTH'' just in several hours. im so depresed i want to end it all
