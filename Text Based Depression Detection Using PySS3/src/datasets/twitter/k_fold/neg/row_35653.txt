Iâ€™m tired.Hey everybody. Idk whatâ€™s been up with me. The way Iâ€™ve been feeling recently has been really taking a toll on me. Suicidal thoughts pass through my head every now and then and Iâ€™m scared. About a month  ago I found out I have depression. It hit me hard. I never thought Iâ€™d deal with this. I was always the one to help my friends with this kind of stuff. Iâ€™ve never been the one that needed help. I never opened up to anyone in a deep way in my life. Iâ€™ve been a closed book. I always put people first and said fuck my feelings. So when I found out I was scared. I decided to finally open up to someone who I truly trusted. The first person I ever trusted fully with my life. My gf. I told her about my depression. My past. My mistakes. The things that eat away at me. The things I thought I would never tell. She listened and told me she loved me. That she would always be here for me and will always be in my corner. That she was here to stay forever. I felt good. I actually felt like I had weights lifted off my chest. I was actually truly happy for the first time in my life. A week later she broke up with me. Crushed me. She fell out of love. Thought we had different goals for the relationship even though me and her talked all that out in the beginning and we agreed on everything. Guys Iâ€™ve never felt so betrayed in my life. I never opened up in my life to anyone because I was always scared the person I told would leave me. I hate that I told her. I wish I never fucking did. I truly feel worthless now. Sheâ€™s not even the only reason why Iâ€™ve been feeling like this. Sheâ€™s was just the last straw. I feel like every fucking thing is just falling apart. I carry such heavy burdens from my past. So many things havenâ€™t gone right for me and honestly thereâ€™s just so many other things. Im not at that suicide stage just yet, but itâ€™s getting closer. I feel hopeless, I feel like Iâ€™m constantly drowning. Iâ€™m tired.
