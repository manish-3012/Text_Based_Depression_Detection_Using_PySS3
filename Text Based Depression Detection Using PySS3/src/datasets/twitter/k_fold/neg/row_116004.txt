Years go by and only two left. (Outside opinion would be nice)Let me start by saying yes I know I probably need a therapist or something. I try not to pull in friends or family into my bullshit despite what my best friend says. I have always been bouncy in recent years.  I generally put little regard in my own life in compare to others,  I overthink, social anxiety,  and doubt my own ability. Any stupid mistake I let hang and any attempts to try socialize outside my small group or online presence ends up making me feel even more left out afterward. 

But enough of that and let me explain the title. I have plan for longer than I'll admit to end it by age 30 if nothing really changed. I blame it on society for it "don't have high position,  college education, and at least dating you are failure". Oddly enough I did get somewhat high position In job and i guess somewhat until a month ago I thought i was dating someone. It was just simple, good guy just not the person for her.  Sure I can understand that,  but she made it sound that trying to make someone happy and "successful"(yes bit vague but I don't want to do in details). Is wrong. Thing is I enjoy making people happy and lives easier for people I like. I could care less about my wellbeing. I'm nobody....I fucked up things badly when I got "selfish". So here I am, romantically lonely,dont want to burden loved ones, don't know how to expand out to people, doubt work performance and 2 years before 30 while thinking of most painful but less messy way to end it.

(Sorry if bit ramble. I'm not, obviously,  that comfortable in posting this but I still have a rational side)
