Should I worry?Hello. So, I've been having hard days, quite complicated to explain but my grandma just died, my group of friends is ruined and the person I'm in love with wants me to stay away from her cause her anxiety. The thing is, I'm not sad, I did not cry and do no care at all. I don't feel depressed, I don't feel at all but I'm kinda worried, I feel I'm losing my mind and I don't want to do something stupid.
