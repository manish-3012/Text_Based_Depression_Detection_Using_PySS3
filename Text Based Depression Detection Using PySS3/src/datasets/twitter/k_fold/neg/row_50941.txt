Suicide and 'selfishness'People call it 'selfish' to kill yourself, but isn't it more selfish to say that I need to be alive just so a few people don't get heartbroken over a minimal loss? 


I don't want to deal with pain or the possibility of living through an attempt, and that is the only reason I'm still here. If assisted suicide were legal where I live, I wouldn't be posting this.


I don't want help, i'm dead on the inside and want to die on the outside. I just want to hear people attempt to answer the above question.
