Is it worth staying alive?Iâ€™m (19m) facing the worst period of my life. Over time, my life has just gotten worse and worse. 

Iâ€™m wondering if it is worth staying alive. If I had to predict, my life is gonna get worse from what I can see. 

Is it worth it? Or will years later, I will regret not committing suicide earlier?
