The loneliness is about to cause me to have another mental breakdown and honestly I can't take it anymoreLemme start this out with a few things:

I'm 26, almost 27. I have seen no less than 20 different therapists, none have helped so I don't even bother anymore.

Now to the real meat of this insane rambling:

I've been alone for a long time. I've never had an irl relationship, I've had several long distance ones but not in years. I'm so fucking lonely...I can't even meet people online anymore because I'm so socially retarded that everyone who strikes a conversation with me gets bored and ignores me after like 10 exchanges. I hate myself, I hate having the personality of wet white paint. I'm honestly considering just letting this mental breakdown happen. People are, of course going to tell me to work on myself but I fucking can't cause I'm so goddamn lonely. I just want to not be lonely goddamnit. I'm also broke so hooker are out of the question especially since where I live they're expensive as fuck. If I'm going to die alone and unloved romantically, why suffer another 20-30-40+ years?
