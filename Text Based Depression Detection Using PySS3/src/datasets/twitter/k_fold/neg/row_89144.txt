I have a teenage friend who is thinking of suicide. And I don't know how to help him out.I've been friends with him for few years now, and we've had some good chit chats but we were not the closest of friends (I think him and I are good friends, but we do not meet up as much and only talk occasionally).

Recently, he told that he has liked a girl for 2 years, and the first time he asked her out, she rejected him. After that, he asked her out once again and apparently what he got from her was a dead cold rejection, which put him in depression. When I found out that he was cutting his wrist, I called him a wuss for harming himself about a rejection from a girl. I know, I am a terrible person. I don't want to justify myself, but I didn't know what to do at that stage But it kept going on. I saw him intentionally pulling up his sleeves, as if he wanted people to see his scars. I thought he was just seeking for attention, but I was being ignorant when he was obviously calling for help.

He never directly said he was looking to suicide, but he gives often gives me subtle hints. Yesrerday, he told me that 'building X' isn't nearly as tall as he thought it would be. I told him that if he has any issues, that he can tell me and I'll be there for him, but he dismissed that by saying "don't get too serious, I was literally talking about the building's height." I really do care about him, and even though sometimes act like a dicm to me, I really don't want to see him depressed, or even worse, gone.

I don't want to dismiss it by saying it's just a teenage phase. I don't think the girl issue is the only reason that he is considering suicide. As a teenager myself, please. I'm not asking for direct help towards him but I would really appreciate any advices for me to help him out. Thank you vm
