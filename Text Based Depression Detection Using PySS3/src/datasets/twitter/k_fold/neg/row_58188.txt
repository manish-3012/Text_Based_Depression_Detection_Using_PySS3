Been homeless for coming on 8 yearsI have been alone and uncared for or about since I was 15 turning 16 and been wanting at kill my self wince I was about 9. I just don't see any possible way out of this hell. I hate my self so much. For over a decade I cry my self to sleep praying I don't wake up and then cry my self awake when I realize I'm still alive.... I don't even remember the last I felt hopeful or happy in any manner. The only family I know of is my uncle who raped until I ran away and lived on the streets. I don't even think I CAN feel happy anymore, I don't know how to or what it would be like. I wish I wasn't such a fucking coward and could do the right thing and just stop being a bother to everyone, it's the worst knowing people that don't know you hate just for breathing
