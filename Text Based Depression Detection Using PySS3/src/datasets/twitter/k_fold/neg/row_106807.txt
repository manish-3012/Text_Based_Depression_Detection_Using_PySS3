Throwaway account, I am quite afraid, please help![x-post from /r/StopSelfHarm]I already posted this on /r/StopSelfHarm, they told me it would be more appropriate for here, although I am not in the danger of suicide-i.e., I have a plan, but it is planned for an exact date a few years from now, so there is no need to worry about it. So, anyway, my post:

I have cut for many years, some times more, some times less, depending on my mood(when I am apathetic it gets worse than when I am really depressed, though, as I just do it out of habit and much deeper, in comparison with me being depressed and just cutting much more, but shallower scars). Not only I cut, but also burn, starve, hit myself etc., and 85% of the time I am thinking about committing suicide(I have attempted it several times, but the big plan is for a few years later, so no need to worry about it).

But that's not really what I wanted to talk about. So, I cut, and just a month ago, when I was in the terrible depression stage, my legs were all covered in scars without a clean place left for skin. But that didn't worry me, because I knew it can't kill me if I am cautious enough. But just a day before yesterday, when again I was feeling a physical urge to put a gun to my head, I cut my temples. Just a little bit. Barely touching skin, just a few drops of blood came out. But I am worried. Because yesterday I did it again, although I wasn't feeling particularly suicidal, and did a lot more damage, to the point of being afraid to go to sleep because I was afraid I could not wake up(yes, stupid, I know). And with the 'normal' cutting, too, that's how it started, just with a scratch, and now it has come to the point where I have no clear skin on my legs, what will happen if I continue on this?

Useless facts about my situation that could maybe help you, though:I also hear voices that tell me to self-harm/hate myself/attempt suicide sometimes, and I have been to a school counselor, but she just made it worse, so I left her just this week.

TL;DR-I cut my temples, am afraid that it could lead to something much more damaging in the future.
