Looks like I'm doing itJust finished writing my goodbye-notes. After two failed attempts,I think I am well prepared this time. 2 days to go
To be honest,I have no idea why I am posting this.There doesn't seem to be anything that could potentially stop me at this point.Medication doesn't help even after the psychiatrist upped the dosage.It never did help.Besides,everything just gets worse.
At first,I tried to get rid of,or,at least,supress the thought of killing myself.
After my first attempt,don't care.I have now,however,accepted and even embraced my actions towards suicide.Who knows,maybe tomorrow will be a better day.Not ideal(nowhere near that) still awful in fact,but not as bad.I know though that it will only delay the impending.I know that I will most likely kill myself in a few days time,at max,and I am fully okay with it.Thinking about it makes it eerily scary in a way.Not the thought of dying and eternal darkness.To be honest,I don't even know what I am afraid of.

I never really felt like "myself".Like I am "me".Never felt that I deserved what I have,and didn't deserve what I don't.
I can't even find that bit of "me" to truly realize what I really am.Who I really am.I constantly feel like I am watching someone live their life in first person,rather than my own.This god-awful fucking feeling never leaves.It always makes me uncomfortable and awkward.It all was a result of one problem of mine
That one fucking problem that lead to my ailments doesn't even matter anymore.Nothing does.I was just in despair for I thought this problem is one I can't solve.Once I realized I can,it was too late.I stopped caring.That was the point of no return.I simply do not care.And not because I am an angsty,cynical,ungrateful teenager,but because I can't.All of my interests suddenly disappeared.But so did that problem,in a way.Many more appeared,though.
It is much worse now.I can only find comfort in music.Not always,but god,does it feel fucking amazing.Euphoric even.But I am sure it's not enough to stop me.And if it somehow is,what even is the point of continuing on this journey of pain and suffering others call life?My psychiatrist told me my condition really is fucked and it would take me 3.5 years minimum to fully recover.He tried to stay silent about the maximum.I found out that it could follow me to biological death,or,if lucky,last around 
15 years.

Don't know how to end this post,so I am just going to stop now
