I donâ€™t know if I can do it anymore.Iâ€™ve been contemplating it today. My boyfriend told me he was done with me and everything today, not the first time. We arenâ€™t broken up. But he was getting angry with me because I was in a behavioral hospital for a week in September and we got the bill and itâ€™s almost $4k. He keeps saying that he canâ€™t ever do things he wants because of all of my bills he has to pay on. I feel like Iâ€™m such a burden, I feel like I weigh so much on him. And then I have a few mental illnesses that I go to therapy and take meds for that just adds to it and I worry that Iâ€™ll never be truly better and Iâ€™ll end up being a burden to my kids. Iâ€™m just so tired of all of this. I have the how and the were, just a matter of when.
