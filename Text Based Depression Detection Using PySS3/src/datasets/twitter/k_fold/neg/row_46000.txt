Why am i alive?I dont see the point nor am i willing to try to find it. I dont want to feel better, i dont want to feel, i dont want to be here. I wish i could just do it already, but im stuck. 

And i wish i could put it in a better way but i tried and had it deleted by accident and now im too exhausted and frustated.
