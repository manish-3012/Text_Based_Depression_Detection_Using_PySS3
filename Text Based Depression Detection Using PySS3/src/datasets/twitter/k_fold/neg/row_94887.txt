Why don't we turn this sub into something which will provide more practical and useful advice instead of everyone just venting?I get it. Some people want to talk.

Im probably much older than most of you on here I'm 31M.

All I want is advice on how to organise my stuff for the big day etc stuff I need to do eg close bank accounts, tax advice, legal advice, what happens in case of it not working, health care , best alcohol for the occasion, the sweet pills etc

What do you guys think?
