Iâ€™m a shit personI hate myself a lot. Iâ€™m a very shit person. I canâ€™t speak to people and canâ€™t keep friends. I have aspergers. Iâ€™m just so fucking ugly. I hate looking at myself. Iâ€™ve tried and put myself out there and gave up after three years. Iâ€™m very negative and I donâ€™t say anything about my problems because Iâ€™d rather suffer in silence then tell someone. I made that mistake before. Iâ€™m like a fucking bubble of toxicity when I let that out of me. Iâ€™m lonely and I have trust issues and commitment issues because of me hating myself. I hate being gay. Iâ€™m fucking miserable at my job, and it makes me very suicidal everytime I go but I canâ€™t quit or Iâ€™ll go homeless. Everything is just too much for me. Iâ€™m such a weakling. Iâ€™m miserable and Iâ€™m gonna die alone. I just canâ€™t do this anymore.
