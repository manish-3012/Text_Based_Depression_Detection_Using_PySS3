M 18, In college, Probably ending it after this semester.Throwaway for obvious reasons, Male 18 really with nothing left to live for. My parents look down on me as my sister was the smart one of the two of us, and im about to finish my second semester of college. It feels like a routine i don't want to keep living, wake up, go to class, come back and sit in seclusion. I did poorly first semester and my parents said they would pull me and stop paying if i repeated the same this semester, and it's not going much better. I was going to just end it over winter break but I found a girl a few weeks before and we hit it off, and a week after valentines day this year, we broke up because I wasn't social enough, and that ruined me. I don't want to be a loser for the rest of my life and continue to disappoint my parents any further than I already am. It feels to me that the only reason Im alive right now is that im too scared to actually do it. People always tell me "you have so much to live for and you're great", but the truth is, im not, im just an average college kid who feels like nothing is worth living for anymore.
