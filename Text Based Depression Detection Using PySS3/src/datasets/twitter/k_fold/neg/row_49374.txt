the only reason i'm here is my faithtitle basically explains it. life is hell im not happy and literally never will be i hate life so much i want so badly to be able to go to college like a normal 18 year old but i can't. i work a shitty job that i fucking hate and all the money goes to bills and saving up to get me a car. i work a job that i literally have nightmares about and can't even use the money for things i want. i have zero friends at all and i hate life. i've tried to kill myself 2 or 3 times. the only thing keeping me from doing it and succeeding is my faith. i'm a christian and believe that if i commit suicide i'll go to hell which i obviously don't want. i swear to you if i didn't think i'd go to hell my unhappy self would be in a grave
