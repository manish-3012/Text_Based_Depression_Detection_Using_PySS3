Im all alone and nothing helps anymore. Planning on ending it all soonMy lifes crumbling to pieces and this is basically a final cry out before I completely give up. Throwaway account for obvious reasons. My girlfriend left me a few months ago because of the distance. It still hurts like it happened yesterday because I thought we were gonna make it work until we both had the finances to move in together. I'm still friends with her and it's killing me to see her happy. My grandfathers dying of terminal liver cancer and has 5 months to a year to live. He is one of if not the only person in my entire family that truly understands and can help me cope with things and it hurts to think about my life without him. I have a liver disease which requires me to diet or it will cause my liver to completely fail, and even though doctors say it still has a chance, I can just feel that it isn't right and that it's gonna fail. I've tried everything I can think of treatment wise. Therapy, (been going for four years), medication, partial hospitalization, everything under the sun. And nothing works. I'm always sad and I continuously try to get out and socialize and even a little dating but nothing fixes it. I'm at my wits end. No clue anymore and instead of having my parents go into debt because of me, and for my own dignity, I'd rather go out on my own accord. I have no purpose here anymore.
