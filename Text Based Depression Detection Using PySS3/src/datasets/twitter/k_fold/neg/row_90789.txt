I've lost the will to liveThis is it, 2am and I've finally decided to try and get some advice about everything.
I am a year 9 student at high school. I have really bad really frequent mood swings and poor social skills. People in school make fun of me for having longer than average hair, calling me "nitbag" they also make fun of my appearance, being short as well as my glasses.
At home my family all makes fun of me, for my lack of social skills and the fact I'm usually online. I've tried to tell them about my problems and they told their friends and they laughed about it, like it's some kind of joke that is great
My one friend, who I have a crush on (though I could never tell her due to anxiety) , is kind and supportive, but I constantly feel like I've ruined my chances with her due to my terrible looks.
I look at suicide as a way out, an escape from the terrible life that I'm in right now, but I'm not sure what to do.
