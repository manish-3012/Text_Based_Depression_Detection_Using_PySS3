Off my meds in crisisOff of Zoloft 200mg a day due to refilling error. 2 days of 150mg and now 1 day of none and I'm losing it in the middle of the night. I haven't had a panic attack crisis of this magnitude in at least a year. Cant hardly type because it makes me cry. I'm feverish, haven't been eating and am having bad suicidal thoughts after not having any since switching to zoloft ~2 years ago. I'll probably just delete this within minutes but I'm trying whatever at the moment
