I feel so at loss, this isn't the first time.I'm sorry I'm pretty new and this might be a long post. I guess why I feel like this is the only option is I think my life is spiraling out. I lost my father to suicide when I was 12.. or 13, honestly since then my brain hasn't been focused. Thing is, when I was a teenager, (I'm 25 now) I thought I was going to just.. die at some point. I'd wake up thinking, well tomorrow is the day. Now at 25 I realize it wasn't happening. My life has never been more than a constant spiral roller-coaster. My dad left like he did because he couldn't deal with himself being bipolar. Me.. I want to go because nothing ever worked out, I've lost so many people because of my anxiety and my panic. If someone is out there I can't hold on much longer, I think it's all my fault for me being so alone, I'm so sorry you all probably have better things to do but I feel I have to post or something. I'm sorry
