I need to go away to give my wife a chance to be happyShe will never leave me because she loves me too much and I make her miserable with the way I am, always negative about everything, impulsive, angry, with ptsd and depression and adhd and I donâ€™t have anything positive to contribute and Iâ€™m tired of trying to get better while making everything worse. Iâ€™m tired of this pain Iâ€™ve felt my whole life and Iâ€™m tired of the toxicity I spread. Iâ€™ve gotten better a few times and sometimes it even lasted a few months or a year but it always comes back to this. She could have a happy healthy relationship one day with someone sane and stable. The only reason I havenâ€™t done it is because that would hurt her even more than the stupid self destructive shit I say and do every day. Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll get too angry with myself one day soon and forget how selfish that is in the moment.
Iâ€™m seeing a new therapist soon and Iâ€™ll try to get better again but Iâ€™m scared it wonâ€™t work.
