Friend (30s) has decided next week is it. At what point can I call someone?Background: I've known him for a decade, and he seems to have just decided to commit suicide out of hate of the human race. (This was teased out because of some moderately bizarre questions.) I saw him last week and didn't see the normal signs, and he doesn't seem to have anhedonia (he even talked about enjoying something last night in the same text as mentioning the date.) He scores quite low on the normal risk assessment guide, but I don't doubt the threat.

Now, he lives in a different state, and I have a phone number (and believe I might have an address.) As I understand it, though, I can't call until there is an immediate threat. 

Does anyone know the reporting options for New York? 

(I have talked people off the ledge before, metaphorically, but this is a case that is beyond my abilities and he refuses to call a hotline or seek help. My initial talk with him only started to drag me down.)

If there is a better sub, please let me know. Thanks!
