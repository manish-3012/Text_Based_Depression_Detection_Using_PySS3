Living with mental illness and former drug addiction. I can't take it anymoreI have no insurance so I have no way of counseling or therapy or medication. I can't make another scene because my parents will put me in a homeless shelter. I work part time minimum wage I have no car. My younger sisters are more successful. Just tired of being a burden to everyone. Every time I used to shoot up I hope it would kill me. The only reason I don't do it is because everyone will be sad when I am dead.
