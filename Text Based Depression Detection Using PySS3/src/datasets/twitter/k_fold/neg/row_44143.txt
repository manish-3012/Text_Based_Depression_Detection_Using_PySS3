I just donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m 16, and Iâ€™ve been suffering from Social Anxiety for most of my life. Iâ€™m not the most confident person, and it doesnâ€™t help that my self esteem is hilariously low (â€˜friendsâ€™ who like to insult me over everything arenâ€™t great). I donâ€™t really have any idea for what Iâ€™m going to do in the future, Iâ€™m okay at studies but I feel no motivation to do anything. I have a visual disability, Ocular Albinism, which slightly impairs my vision, and Iâ€™m worried about how thatâ€™ll effect my future and job prospects. But then again I donâ€™t want to blame my shitty personality and lack of motivation on a disability. Iâ€™m pretty ugly, not very fit, donâ€™t have a personality, fail to survive in any social situation, usually pretty stupid, with a shitty sense of humour and no â€˜realâ€™ friends. 

Iâ€™m sorry for making whoever reads this have to suffer through my stupid ramblings, but I just donâ€™t know what to do. I have no plan for the future, no friends, no social skills and no hobbies or motivation. I feel ungrateful, that I canâ€™t even feel happy when I have pretty great parents who are above average economically. If this is supposed to be the peak of my life, I donâ€™t want to suffer through the rest of it, alone, without any passions or interests. At this point, Iâ€™m really just living because of my grandma, mom and cat. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s normal for someone my age to suffer through suicidal thoughts almost every day.    

Again, i apologise for the wall of text of my stupid and probably unjustified complaints. But any advice, reasons to live, or anything would be nice.
