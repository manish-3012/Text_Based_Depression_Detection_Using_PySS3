Iâ€™m so tired.I really canâ€™t live like this anymore...I have no friends, literally NONE and my family is so controlling itâ€™s driving me insane, Iâ€™d go out with them and look at other people with envy... they laugh, talk, walk around so happily, do whatever they wanted and i just want that. I really have no idea why Iâ€™m here, I donâ€™t really want to exist so why was i born in the first place? I always get treated like a pushover and i truly believe that no one cares about me or how Iâ€™m doing. I really want to end this but Iâ€™m such a coward....I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to or vent to about anything so everything is just bottled up and I canâ€™t take it anymore.
