It's hard to find sustenanceI'm so selfish, I can't believe it's come to this when there are people out there who have it so much worse, so I completely understand if you want to skip me and  help someone else who deserves it more.

I just want to leave this place already. I feel like I don't belong here anymore. 

I think about pulling the cord often but I'm too much of a pussy and I feel + I cant imagine how hard It must be for a parent to lose their son. 

Every day is the same, and a barely find happiness in anything I do anymore. Everything I do feels like a chore, I don't know if it's just because I'm growing up or what (M20 btw). I feel like I'm on different way length to everyone. 
I'm rarely happy around my family anymore but it's nothing they've done, it's all these self defeating thoughts... So I just block myself out from everything as I feel so anxious and snappy around people. I just find it better to avoid social situations. 

I just want to be happy and normal again! I've got so many insecurities, I'm anxious about everything, I'm bitter and I'm an emotional wreck. I don't know anyone who's as emotional as me which makes worry about how I'm  going to  handle what life has to throw. 

I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Maybe if I ever gather the strength when my parents aren't around anymore I'll call it a day as there'll be nothing left for me here.
