Losing my mind with what I can only hope is anti depressant withdrawalWent a bit nuts with anxiety a few months ago and was put on Mirtazapine. It made me super chubby and I didn't think it was doing anything, so my doctor said it was fine to come off cold turkey because I was on 15mg.

Fast forward 16 days later and apparently that was a terrible idea. I've lost 4kg in two weeks, I can't eat, I feel tense every day all day. 

Yesterday it escalated and I had what I imagine is a severe panic attack on a London bus. I was white, shaking, sweating and consumed with fear and desperation to die.

After going home, it just didn't disappate. I feel completely unreal, keep being jolted by a feeling of electric shocks and can't bear any sensory stimulation whatsoever.

I haven't gone outside. I called the doctor today (my normal one isn't there) and she said withdrawal from anti depressants isn't a thing so this is just me. I'm praying she's wrong. Tiny noises sound so loud, I'm so sensitised and terrified of everything. I'm taking today and tomorrow off work (I have Friday booked off anyway). I'm supposed to get a 1 hour bus and then 1 hour train tomorrow to see my boyfriend who wants to look after me. I just can't handle it.

If taking a dose would definitely work I'd do it in a second and then taper off slowly, but it's been 16 days and I'? scared of making it worse, and scared of what I might do. Please, please can anyone help?
