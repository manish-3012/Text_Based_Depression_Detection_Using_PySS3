My life worthlessMy life is worthless. I'm fucking worthless. I havent accomplished anything, I'm a piece of shit. I wish I was normal, I wish I can be happy and be a normal functioning human but I'm not. I'm just a sack of meat and bones with a barely functioning brain. 

I'm not happy, or smart, or attractive and will never get anywhere in life. I'm forever alone, gay,I dont mean anything to anyone and have no interest in anything. I have absolutely no life, nor do I want one. I just want to kill myself and be at peace. Im worthless, my life is worthless and no one will lose anything when I die.
