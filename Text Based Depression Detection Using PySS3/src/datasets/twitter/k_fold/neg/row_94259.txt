So I guess this is it then.I've pushed everyone away and now I find myself turning to completely unfamiliar territory for... help, I guess? I don't even know anymore.

In August of 2016 I was put in a foster home because my father was unable to provide a proper home for me. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but it was hell on earth for me. My first day there I thoguht "whatever, my dad will find something soon and I'll be out in like a week". I was so, so wrong. I ended up spending a little over a year there. The worst year of my life. A year where I've lost all contact with literally everyone I (used to) care about (mostly online friends), a year in an ass backwards fucking community where nothing is allowed and it's every man for himself.

The whole time I was wondering what everyone was doing. Do they miss me? Do they even know I still exist? In November of 2017 - one month after my 18th birthday - I was presented with the opportunity to move into an apartment into a room of my own where I'd get the financial support I'd need (I'm still in school, just started my last year though) and where I'd be free to do whatever the hell I want. Finally. I couldn't wait to get back to my friends.

A few of them were surprised/happy to see me again, my (now former) best friend of about 4-5 years introduced me to his Discord server and I met some new people but that was it. Soon I realized that in just one year my ability to just fucking interact with human beings had deteriorated to the point where I might as well have been mute. The fact that I went from being severely depressed to being suicidally depressed didn't help. I rarely had anything to say. Most of my conversations - what little I've had, at least - lasted for about three minutes before both of us just fucked off to do something else. And most of the time, it was me who had to start them... and I'm saying this as someone who has some horible social anxiety.

Still, I tried. I kept trying to get in touch with my friends. Contributing when it was relevant. But I guess it wasn't enough, because there would be times where I could go WEEKS without saying a single word to someone. Believe me, I tried. But it was never good enough apparently. It didn't take long for me to start thinking that maybe no one gave a shit about me. And over time, that feeling only got stronger.

This went on for seemingly forever until now. I was so fucking frustrated that no one tried to reach out to me. Even if it was just once a week I would've been happy, but nope. I was hospitalized at some point because I was dangerously close to just ending myself. No one cared. At some point - and maybe I'm an asshole for it, I don't even know at this point - I started a little experiment. I just stopped initiating conversations altogether to see if anyone would notice my absence. Nothing. Then I started going offline for extended periods of time. Nothing.

And now just a few days ago I've gotten so sick of it that in a fit of anger I just ended up removing everyone. Changed my usernames, left pretty much the only Discord server I regularly used. If they really gave a fuck, they would notice that I'm not there anymore, wouldn't they?

Today I got home from school and found out that my aforementioned "best friend" had blocked me on Steam and Twitter. Five years down the drain. Five years gone in a single fucking instant. That was the final straw for me. My old "friends" obviously don't care for me anymore, so I've decided that it was time to just forget about them.


Now... Now I have no one left. I've been shaking the whole time I've been writing this. I don't even know what I'm feeling right now. Anger? Hatred? Sadness? Disappointment? For all I know, it could be all of them at the same time. 

Was it something I said? Something I did? Couldn't they have just fucking been upfront and told me that they were sick of my shit?

I don't know what to do anymore. These people were pretty much all I had. Am I going to have to live out the rest of my fucking life like this? A lonely, sad, depressed and stupid sack of shit wasting their life away in front of a computer? At what point do I just fucking end it all? Fuck, I don't even know anymore. Maybe I deserve all of this.

I'm so tired of everything. I'm so sick of everything. I wish these last two years never happened.
