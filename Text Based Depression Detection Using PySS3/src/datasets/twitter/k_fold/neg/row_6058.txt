Sorry about thisHeya guys, hope your doing well. Idk anymore about anything. This is a throwaway account and   Itâ€™s hard for me to communicate whatâ€™s been going on in my head for a while.  Itâ€™s my first year uni and itâ€™s not going to hot to be honest. In a high class family of people who are organized and who are naturally smart someone has to be the odd duck right? Well guess thatâ€™s my place. I feel like everything I do is just a complete joke or failure. Fuck at this point I could even say that about my life. An hour ago I put a pipe on the top of my door and wedged it so it couldnâ€™t move, I put a belt on it and tried pushing my head through. I couldent succeed. Itâ€™s a lot harder then how it looks in movies or even how one would assume a self hanging would go. I then went and sat in my chair and held my samurai sword to my stomach, I thought I could pull one of those samurai moves but no, itâ€™s too much work and I guess Iâ€™m not that strong minded. Fuck ok sorry guys for the butchered post, itâ€™s disorganized and hard to follow itâ€™s kinda like my mind and my thought process it reminds me of that song paranoid by black sabbath, just a fit of rage and paranoia. Iâ€™m too scared to talk to family or friends. Canada suicide service was no help. Is there anymore help? Have a happy thanksgiving to my fellow Canadians by the way.
