I don't want to live anymoreI came into a point in which my dreams seem completely unreachable, I just don't have anything other than my dreams and if I can't reach them, I won't be happy, I don't wanna switch from them, and I'm struggling a lot with life and everything seems so painful to continue. I would like to live a few more months to experience some things for the last time.
