so many people in my life love &amp; care about me but I still feel like nobody caresI know on one hand that I have so many people in my life that care about me and love me and would be sad if I died. But on the other hand I just feel like I'm too tired to keep pretending like nothing is wrong. I think about dying every day. I don't tell anyone because I don't want to go to a hospital, I'm really frightened by doctors and therapists. I can't even call a hotline because I am too scared to talk on the phone. I feel trapped inside of myself and I just hate myself so much. I wish life just had an off switch, you didn't have to go through all the trouble or pain of killing yourself, you could just die effortlessly and easily.
