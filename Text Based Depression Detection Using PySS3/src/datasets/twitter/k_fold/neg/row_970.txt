21st Birthday.I made post a couple of weeks ago about how I planned to die today. Since then I have had multiple appointments with my uni's mental health specialist; my doctor and a few phonecals from the mental health crisis team. I have, in the last 48 hours, told them that I can assure them I will not go through with my plans and that I will allow them to do some kind of intervention-therapy-something-or-other the day after my birthday.

The thing is, I don't know what I am going to do, but I know what I want to do; I want to take one of my kitchen knives, slash my throat and then start stabbing myself until I exit this world. I want the pain, I want the agony. 

I want the end.
