Miserable lifeI'm one of those guys who aren't allowed to achieve their dreams, and when they cut through the worst they end up like shitfaces with half their brain blown off. Dudes who make something somewhat good and that's it. Like that dude who directed LA Noire and the like. Everything in my life takes a turn for the worse. 

I wanted to make films. It's the only thing that I want to do from my heart. I've wanted to do it since I was a little boy,  4-5 years old. And I could and can do it. But I feel like that son of a bitch God just doesn't want me to do it. I'm 15 now,  and I hit my peak at 14 but what happened last year was beyond terrible. Each and every fucking day so bad it was a goal to get to the end of it. I feel mangled. I have problems thinking properly. Being an early bloomer, ever since I expressed my dreams as a 10 year old life has gotten tougher. Dad already had a fucking war going on against anything artistic  that isn't "Indian" or classical music. No one ever supported me. The arsehats in my family pretended to listen before they shove the "your dreams are bullshit and we don't believe in them, study for the IIT and get a job" down my throat. 

I also have a heart disease. Cardianueria ensures oxygen doesn't normally make it to my brain,  interfering with thought. God did this when I put extra effort to maintain my dream and self against all odds - at which I was succeeding. My own hard work. It's fucking  hard to fight something like this. I've survived a mild stroke and countless mini-strokes (half of body goes weak), and guess what , 90% of them were in the right of brain. My skills are reduced to ashes. Watching Django Unchained and couldn't make bullshit out of it. I hate myself and my life deeply,  but I'm also cursed with an innate positivity that thrives on lies. Writing this lying on my right,  otherwise it's very uncomfortable. Hard to honestly think what to write. I am not lying. 

Asshole parents based on ignorance decisively concluded that I'm healthy. This is the stuff that I'm against. I've always been alone, lots of friends to name but the people I love either don't love me or are helplessly far.  My best friend, my only true friend is about a thousand kilometers away,   my uncle who is my dearest relative lives in America. But I've always fought this alone, it's just very fucking hard now. It seems impossible sometimes. I have nothing but this degenerating disease. Right now I'm experiencing arm pain. See, god won't do bullshit for you. Every time I looked up to him I was lied to and ultimately degraded. Life gets only worse with my mind. Discomfort in my neck. I sleep all day. Then  there's the increasing pressure of school. Got exams in 10 days. It's also always the fucking right side of my brain. Can't even get to a doctor. One night my heart suddenly raced. Last evening I felt another stabbing sensation on the left side. I've read that vigorous repetition can help stroke - which was working until it got harder - is too damn hard now. I sleep 3 times daily just to feel comfortable. On top of this is my family. God, beyond words. What I've been can be described as being hit in the damn head with a hammer and still standing up. Weak heart and weak head. It's a hell hole. My dad had an accident when I was ten and that amplified his anger. I remember my parents sounding  like demons. My current future plans end when I'm 20 years old. I feel half dizzy just trying to think,  sitting down. To think my life would be better manifold if I had a little, just a fucking tiny bit, of love and support. 

Speaking of Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino is a bit of an arsehat when you think about it. He had everything on his plate and still has to act like an ass. I liked him to a point. I have to fight for the crumbs. The life after whats living of me dies to me is unacceptable. I plan on killing myself if I don't get to be what I want after fulfilling my modest last wishes on my own by the age of 20 or around it. And yes they require getting a job. It's hard to get by. 

I know there's millions and millions in worse shape than me,  but jued because it isn't that  bad doesn't mean it isn't that sad.  God;  you're better off not believing in him.
