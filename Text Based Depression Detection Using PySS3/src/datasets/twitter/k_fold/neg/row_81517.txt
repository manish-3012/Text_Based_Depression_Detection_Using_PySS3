I just dont know anymore.I feel like i havent been able to properly vent myself to anyone so here goes. Next month would have been my 5yr anniversary with my wife.. long story short i fucked up, but with something we could honestly fix if she was willing to work with me, but believes ill just stay a piece of shit i didnt cheat or anything like that, but dont want to go into details. She doesnt want to be with me now and she was everything to me. We even have 2 kids together which makes the way i feel even worse because i love my wife and kids to death and dont want to leave them, but every single day feels so much harder than the last. Its almost like our whole relationship is meaningless to her. And before we even got together i was ready to throw my life away.. I feel so much worse now..
