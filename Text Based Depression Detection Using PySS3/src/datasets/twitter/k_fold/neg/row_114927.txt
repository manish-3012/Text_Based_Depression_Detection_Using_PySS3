Is this normal for my age?Hi,
i am 16 years old.
So, before you start label me, i want to explain about myself.
I am from Europe, most of my life is gaming, going with friends to hang out, just the usual crap.
Mostly of my life i am playing games. I live with my mother, my father sends money sometimes. We don't need his money, he just does it. He left my mom even before i was born. Never seen him in a person, only his photos.
My mom raised me. We can afford everything, i am grateful for that.
Last year i went into some strange phase. Been in love with a girl, but she rejected me and didn't want to play, eat or anything. Just listen to music and stay on my bed for days.

6 months ago, one of my best friends, another girl i liked died from suicide. I can't stop thinking about it, i am not really an emotional person, who cares about other, but this changed me. I feel bad, sad and broken all the time. Going to her grave when i can't sleep.

I can't really take the fact that she is a skeleton, she is under the ground and i won't see here again. Her beautiful eyes, everything..
I don't do drugs or alcohol. Same as her.
If there is a moment, which i feel better - her favorite and last song before she died starts playing on my phone, her Facebook profile shows on my phone. I am freezing instantly when i see that.
Sometimes i want to end it. Want to die like her. 
I'm really trying not to act as an depressed shitty teen. I know people have serious problems than this, but if it's getting me destroyed, feel like shit inside i need to find an answer. WHAT TO DO SO I CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE MY LIFE AS BEFORE.
