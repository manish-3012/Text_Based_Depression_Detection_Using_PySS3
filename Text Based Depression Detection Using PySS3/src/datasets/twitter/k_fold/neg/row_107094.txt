Sad all the time, to no end in sight.Seriously considering taking my own life. I've already planned out the method, I don't have my final preparations in order yet, but I don't think its necessary. I'm mainly writing this to let people know that not every suicide is a lapse in judgement, I my case at least, it's an expression in finally having control over the profound sadness that seems to follow me. Life has been okay, but, its wasted on someone like me who cannot find the will to live in it.
