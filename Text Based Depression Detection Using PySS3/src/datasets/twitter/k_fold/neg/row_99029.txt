I just cut myselfI've held knives before, ran them across my skin and scratched myself before. I've never drawn blood before, never left a scar. It's been like that on and off for four years.

Today, my heart hurt a little more. I feel like a failure, going nowhere. I don't see a clear path ahead of me. I do see fear, all my insecurities laid out before me, all my shortcomings. More than fear, I feel hate. I hate myself. I hate myself so much.

I cut myself. I don't want to go into to much detail, I don't want to encourage others. I don't want others to want what I want. I feel like I've been more depressed before, more out of control, but somehow the state I'm in now is so much more dangerous. I'm not just erratic and panicked, looking for a way out, I'm fueled by hate too. 

Thing is, I understand there's help, I understand I can do things about my problems... but I block those thoughts. Hell, in the past I've had a lot of success with both but I don't care. they're distractions from my goal.
