Feel like I'm about to make a bad decisionWent to a party, had some drinks, left to drive myself home. Thinking it would be so easy to get in a drunk accident right now. 

I'm so tired of pretending all the fucking time. I don't feel anything and life is just exhausting. I thought maybe the alcohol would help me feel something but nope no luck there. Fuck my life lmao.
