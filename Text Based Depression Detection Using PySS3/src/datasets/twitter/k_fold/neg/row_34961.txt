Friend is having a hard timeSo long story short, a friend i met through an online game is having a really hard time.

We've both stopped playing the game but kept in touch out of game. Apperently he has really high anxiety and this season has been rough on him.  Apperently his parents and me are the only ones that he's talk to about it.

I've told him i'll always be here to talk to but he should really seek professional help.  He tells me he has and he just got angry with them and cut ties. Money is also apperently an issue.

Does anyone have any advice?  I honestly don't really know what to tell him or what he should do.  He's told me before that he's been depressed but tonight seems much worse.

I honestly think that he just needs to start playing another online game. I know its not healthy but its something to keep his mind off of his problems.
