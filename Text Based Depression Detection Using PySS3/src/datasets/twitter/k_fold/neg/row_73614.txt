Iâ€™m suffering inside so bad.Iâ€™m 26 almost 27 with a mild cognitive disability, IQ of around 80, OCD, Major Depressive Disorder, severe anxiety all officially diagnosed and potentially bipolar disorder my psychiatrist said.  I have such severe anxiety that I canâ€™t drive.  I lose control of my bladder when I operate a motor vehicle and itâ€™s very difficult with my cognitive issues.  Iâ€™ve only had sex once when I was 20 and havenâ€™t had sex in almost 7 years.  I donâ€™t have a job because I live in a rural area and donâ€™t drive and I keep getting rejected from remote jobs.  On the positive side I have the best most supportive family in the entire world.  I love them so so much.  I just basically sleep all day and havenâ€™t wanted to survive anymore.  I really need a game plan on what I can do.  Iâ€™ve tried going through the office of vocational rehabilitation and their help was worth jack shit.
