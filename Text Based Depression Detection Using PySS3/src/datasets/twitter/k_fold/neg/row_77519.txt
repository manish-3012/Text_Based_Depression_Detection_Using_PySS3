I donâ€™t really know anymoreIt sorta feels like Iâ€™m watching my life from the side. I donâ€™t know what is going on and I feel disconnected from everything. 

Everything is slowed down and I donâ€™t really feel like Iâ€™m there, like in the moment. I wanna be alone and I just really wish I could start over. Just reset and live a better life. 

I want to help my friends but I donâ€™t know how to. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m trying to save everyone from drowning but I canâ€™t save myself. Because itâ€™s better if Iâ€™m in pain then others. 

Iâ€™m pretty lost right now, so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here. If you ever need help Iâ€™ll be there.


So yeah, thank you for reading I guess.
