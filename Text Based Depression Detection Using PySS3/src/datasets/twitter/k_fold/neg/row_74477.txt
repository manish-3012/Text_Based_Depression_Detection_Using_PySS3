i feel the only way to get help is my fathers gunim a fucking eleven yr for gods sake, my brain doesnt stop developing for another 15 years and i still want to kill myself. i never asked to be born, and i never asked to be a fucking boy. Ive always had an attraction towards males, even though i was born as one, and i am one.  I never felt comfortable when anybody reffered to me as a boy, i dont think i ever will. I dont know why. I didnt ask to be born. I knew what sex was when i was fucking *NINE* BECAUSE MY DUMB ASS DECIDED TO LOOK UP EVERYTHING FROM THE TV SHOWS MY MOM WATCHED THAT I DIDNT KNOW THE MEANING TO. I cant do school work, i litterally get fucking panic attacks when i think about school. I feel like i dont sleep and sleep too much at the same time, i want to run away and never come back even though my parents never do anything bad. I wasnt supposed to be on this app for another 6 years. I dont know what else to say. I dont care if i get banned for being on here; too young, what the fuck else to theese mods have to do? Work? No. The only way i ever knew how to cope was eat. Im almost 30 pounds overweight and i still feel like in 300. I tried to fucking think i was anorexic, even though it was the opposite. I dont know why. My thoughts are against me, everytime i think i just end up screaming in my head â€œ shut up shut up â€œ and it wont stop.
