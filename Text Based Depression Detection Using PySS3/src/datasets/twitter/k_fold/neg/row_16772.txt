Life is too long and too exhaustingI just can't imagine doing this for at least 50 years anymore. I didnt have a good start in life and it's only going downhill since then.

My father is an alcoholic who doesnt give a shit about me and belittles me every chance he gets.

My mother is a borderline narcissist who hurt me emotionally and physically my whole life and threatened to kill me multiple times. I wish she did.

I don't have many friends because I've been backstabbed too many times and can't really trust people since then. I think that everybody secretly hates me.

My boyfriend of 5 years who saved me from a very dark state of mind and made me enjoy life again was, at least i thought so, the love of my life. I recently found out he cheated on me multiple times although he knew about my self harming and my suicidal tendencies.

What does that tell me? I thought I would be lucky for once in my life after all this suffering in my childhood and teenage years.

But apparently, life is not fair. You don't get what you deserve, the shit pile only keeps getting bigger over the years. I feel like this was the last straw, the last sign of the universe that I am not welcome, that I was a mistake that should just disappear.

Whatever I try, it only turns to shit. I have no hope anymore for my life to ever turn better. I have no trust in other people anymore. I see no purpose in existing and I wish I'd just been aborted.
