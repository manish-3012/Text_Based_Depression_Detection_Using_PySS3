FinalI'm drinking my final drink right now - hot chocolate. It's a bit too hot. It's burning my throat, just a little. But that's okay because I won't need to worry about that soon.

Soon I'll be saying my final goodbye. Bye to my older brother, bye to my cat. I guess I should feel guilty for leaving them, and I do, but my preoccupation with death is stronger than that. 

Then, my final walk. Down to the train tracks, where I'll wait. There's a chance a train won't come, and that'll delay me by a day or so. But I don't mind - I can come back tomorrow if need be.

Then, my final breath. I'll relish in the moment where I can only feel pain as a million pounds of steel roll over me. And I'll be dead - final glimpse of the world, final heartbeat, final moment.

And then I won't have to worry about anything.

**Writing this actually kind of calmed me, so I'm not going to go kill myself now, but I'm still posting this.**
