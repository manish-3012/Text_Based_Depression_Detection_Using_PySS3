Iâ€™m exhaustedThatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m just tired, Iâ€™m so depressed. When things are seemingly looking up, everything comes crashing down again. Iâ€™m never going to get anywhere. Iâ€™m never going to be a success career wise, relationship wise, parent wise. Iâ€™m a failure and that will never change. I want to give up, I give up.
