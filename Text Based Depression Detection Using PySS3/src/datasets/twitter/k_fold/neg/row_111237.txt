I miss youI feel like I can't breathe sometimes. It's been exactly a week since my brother jumped off a 5 story building and passed away. I really miss him so much. I've been contemplating jumping myself. I just want to see him again, and I'm just so jealous of everyone who gets to spend time with their siblings. He was my only brother, my big brother. And we had a pretty good relationship, no fighting and a lot of silly, goofy, and great conversations. I want to buy a locket to put his picture in, and I just can't find the right one. I found one that was semi decent, but it was just too expensive and I can't afford it. I'm just rambling right now but I just don't know what's the point of living. How can the world keep turning when part of my world has been destroyed? I just feel so sad all the time. And I know he had a reddit account, but I never knew his username, and I just want to see if he ever posted anything. I really miss him and my heart hurts so much. He left me one last Christmas gift, and he left a note saying he was sorry he couldn't give it to me in person. I hate Christmas now.
