I have nothing to live for.I have lost everything in this world that I care for. Everything, gone. I thought I had made the right decision. But I was wrong. I work as at an important stock company, I have made millions of dollars. I was one the greatest at my job. You know what happened, the crash. All of my investments are gone. I don't where to go anymore. I am broke physically, mentally, and monetarily. I think I am going to end it all. Without rare pepes live is shit. All of my fucking memes and sheckles are gone.
