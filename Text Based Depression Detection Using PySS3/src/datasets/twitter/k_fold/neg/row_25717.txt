If I'd have a gun right now I would pull the trigger without a doubt.I'm thinking of a rope but I can't really find any. Maybe a towel... It's illogical to kill myself. But I'm too tired, too stressed right now. My psyche can't take everyday when nothing is really happening. But when I ACTUALLY am fucking up it's just unbearable. I've been depressed for years. Nothing in months had bring me ANY joy. Maybe beside listening to music. But it's too little to justify constant lack of purpose and agony. If someone read this, I'm sorry that I transferred my problem onto you. I'm a narcissist. I can't help it.
