obligatory vent post that ill just delete in a days time or somethingto preface this: im not currently acting on a suicide plan, thats something im probably holding out for until im like, 18 or maybe even 20 or something.

this may sound edgy as all hell, and like, it is. but i feel so fucking stressed out and in pain all of the time to the point that it feels like the only relief i get is the blank space that there is when i cant remember a dream. i will try to fix my issues by going to therapists and psychiatrists but i cant even do that right, when i get scared i just go into self-isolation again. i want to be happy but i just dont deserve it even i think. im just a coward.

i really miss having friends and just like, being around people but i dont know how to socialize and im stuck in this cycle. i dont deserve to be around others because i never know how to act and im so bitter and self deprecating. im an awful person and it feels like all i can do is ruin other peoples lives, im just leeching off of others. im painfully aware of my flaws but i dont know how to fix it at all im stuck in a cycle that i cant break out of because im just too damn weak. i make not only myself but everyone around me miserable i cant do this.

at this point ive just accepted my fate that ill just never get any better. its all my fault too. i dont even have energy to do things for fun anymore it feels at this point and i just dont feel like i have any aspirations. ive been fantasizing about suicide since i was 7. i crave for non existence i just wish this would all stop. i wish i wasnt like this, i wish i wasnt me. if this is all there is to life i just dont see a point.

i realize that this post wont accomplish or help anything i just need to let out some feelings i guess. also like sorry for being so pessimistic and what not i just :( i dont know.
