I'm tired of being fat and ugly. Should I kill myself?I'm not very attractive. I have a round face, big eyes, big nose, small mouth. I'm quite chubby, and not very feminine. I'm just uncomfortable with femininity. Yet, I am very upset that I am not pretty. And I am tired of crying myself to sleep because I don't look like someone that can be loved. Should I just kill myself and get it over with? At least then I won't have to deal with it, right?
