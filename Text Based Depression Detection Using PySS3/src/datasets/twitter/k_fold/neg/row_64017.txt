I'm cursedNo matter how kind I am to others, no matter how much I care or don't care, people just seem to dislike me. I've been mentally and physically abused in the past, I was raped and because of that dropped out of college (I tell others I got caught with weed if they ask). 

I'm 22 now and work a lot because when I'm working I don't have to think about how fucked up I am. How fucked up the world is. How the US gets away with providing weapons for ISIS and lying in the media because its so dependent on war for money and resources. 

How people breed like pigs when our world is over-populated as it is and when there are babies and children who need loving hes but will never get them and will grow up to be as bitter as I have grown to be.

How humanity will ultimately destroy itself from its own greed and self-hate. I think I'm done with thus shit.

After 22 years life has only grown worse and worse. I'm gay too and I hate it-I hate being so alone. Not knowing anyone else who is gay and who understands what it's like to be surrounded in a sea of straight people who seem the same yet so utterly alien. Maybe I'm crazy, but I swear straight, white people are the most judgmental, hurtful souls on this planet.

What are painless ways to die? I heard emptying a room of oxygen and filling it with nitrogen is painless. I don't believe in anything after death so I've never had an irrational fear of it. I welcome the void. It seems like peace.
