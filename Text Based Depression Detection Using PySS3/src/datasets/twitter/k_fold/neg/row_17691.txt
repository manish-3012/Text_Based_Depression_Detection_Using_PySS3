I just want to disappear.I recently came across this concept of, not necessarily dying, but wanting to simple cease to exist, and become a passive observer of the world around you. That seems like a good middle ground right now. I felt invisible last night.

I was at work last night, and three teammates who were working in my section started talking about their relationships. I just stood there listening to it, knowing that I had nothing to contribute. I have never even been kissed, at the age of 23.

People say that there is still plenty of time for relationships, and that you should not compare yourself to others, but that is not the fucking point. Relationships are healthy experiences, and I have not been socially healthy for all my life. 

Then, I got pathetically frustrated after I broke something. Instead of laughing or consoling me like they normally would, my teammates just looked at me like I was going crazy. 

Maybe I was already there.

I am trying to prove to myself that I am worthy of being alive, but when you have to have breakfast with four fingers, because you broke the nail on the other one, and it stings when you breathe, life is not worth living. 

If I killed myself, no one except for my family would be an ounce the wiser.
