pls help methis around like the 5th post i'm writing here. i'm feeling more and more like a nuisance everyday. when i'm talking to people whenever about whatever, i feel like i have to suddenly just say a bad cringy joke about the topic for attention, only for that to go away in a minute. last post was about my family being strict and shit. sometimes that makes me feel like maybe i did something wrong, even though i never know what that is. other fanily issues also bring me down. back to my family, im just really spoiled. i got an expensive pc, 2 monitors, ps4, nintendo switch but i dont feel like i deserve it. sometimes that is a way for them to make them seem like they love me, but maybe this is just a conspiracy i made up in my head, another thing in my head that makes me feel like something is wrong with me. when i hang around my friends i seem uncomfortable, but that happens with people in general with me. like everything is a heated moment in my head, but in reality everything is fine.  like all of this shit makes me feel worse and worse till the point of not wanting to live anymore, or at least somehow start over. but im 16 y/o so i think restarting is a bit far away. bad thing is either i kill myself until that point, or something other. but as i always said it here a couple of times: imma try to hold on. all you peeps here, lets hold on together ill we can â¤
