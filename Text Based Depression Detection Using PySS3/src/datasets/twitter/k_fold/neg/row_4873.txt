I have no one to turn to. Killing myself on my birthday tomorrow. Please help meTomorrow I turn 24 and I am killing myself. Reasons behind this arenâ€™t important because I donâ€™t want to be talked out of it. Unfortunately much like many of you guys I am scared my attempt will not be successful so that is why I havenâ€™t done it yet. 

My question is if I hook up a hose to an oxygen mask and then connect that to my exhaust pipe on a cold night (2013 Toyota) will that be enough to kill me? I figure I will fill up my tank, take an ambien, and just breathe it all in and effectively not wake up.

PLEASE help me and advise me regarding this method/carbon monoxide in general. How Can I do this correctly
