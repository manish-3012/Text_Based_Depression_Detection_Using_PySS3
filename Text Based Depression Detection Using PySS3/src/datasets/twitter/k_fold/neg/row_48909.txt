I can't die.I'm stuck. I don't want to be alive, but I can't bring myself to kill myself because I know my family will be put into debt and thrown into depression if I do so. So instead, I sit here. Miserable. Making others miserable. But I guess this is better for everyone.
Some days it all feels like too much. Some days I just want to say fuck it and go through with killing myself. But then I remember how it is literally too expensive to die. Then my thoughts go down the track of all the ways people that care about me will suffer from the trauma of losing a loved one.

Does anyone else have this dilemma? In your worst moments, do you cry because the phrase "I can't die." plays in your head over and over?
