My StoryI am a half Native, half Vietnamese Canadian. My father was a Vietnam War refugee, and motherâ€™s mom is a Residential School survivor. This inter-generational trauma caused my personality disorder, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. I grew up with two pedophiles simultaneously: one from each side of my family. I wanted nothing to do with my heritages because of this. I have dealt with car accidents, sexual harassment in workplaces, and rapes in Vietnam. Family, friends, and the justice system abandoned me. I still yearn for reconciliation, however, in spite of all this, I choose to understand, forgive, and love.
