I sat at the bridge for hours and felt too high and tired on ativan to do itI despise myself. The past while Iâ€™ve been in excruciating mental pain. My day is spent sobbing uncontrollably, unable to eat or even change my clothes/take a shower or bath because that involves seeing my skin and my body and I feel physically ill over it. 

I put everything I had into someone I trusted. They said for a year everything would be okay. When I finally began to trust them, they tore the rug out from under me. I have nothing left, except the BPD and other mental illnesses I never asked for.

Iâ€™m furious at myself for not jumping tonight. Absolutely furious. I was too afraid of someone seeing me. I finally got out of my car to feel a semi whoosh by directly next to me and I realized how visible I was. I didnâ€™t want anyone to call for help or stop me.

And the fucking Ativan was supposed to calm me enough to be able to do it. I took too much. I guess I have to spend just one more day self loathing and in mental anguish and I can try again tomorrow. Iâ€™ve got nothing left. I always knew this is how it would end.

I canâ€™t forgive myself for how Iâ€™ve hurt people in the past. I probably think about it more than they do. I cry over it all the time. I am horrible. I am sick and disgusting. I am unloveable with this horrible personality disorder. I am a burden and a freak. I never graduated high school. Iâ€™ve never held down a job. I spend all my time isolating myself. I canâ€™t stand to look in the mirror. Iâ€™m covered in scars. Itâ€™s over, ASAP
