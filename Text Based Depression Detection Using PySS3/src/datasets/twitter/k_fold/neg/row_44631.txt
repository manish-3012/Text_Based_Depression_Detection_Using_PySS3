I constantly think about running away and starting overBut don't have the means to do so. At the moment, I'm unemployed and have no car, and i'm a petite woman so the odds of running into trouble are likely. I was raised in an overbearing Christian family, my father an alcoholic and mother an abusive narcissist.   I was never close to my brothers (one of them was clearly annoyed by me and the other was 15 years older and ran away for 10 years) so I naturally became an introvert. 

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for so long that i don't even remember what it's like to feel happy, just ok. It turns out I have a thyroid issue but my medication doesn't make me feel any better anyways. At some point the depression got so bad that I started ignoring friends for months until i felt ok enough to talk to them. But this just made everyone mad at me so now i barely have any friends and I'm about to lose more. 

The past month and a half, I've been drinking every night and doing everything possible to avoid everyone i know. Messages piled up and eventually people gave up. I feel this is the last time I'll let this happen. I'm just not going to respond again. The only person i have left is my boyfriend, and things have been rocky lately. I'm ready to just disappear. 

I don't have motivation to work or do anything while I'm living with my parents. Hashimoto's makes me tired as is and nobody understands that. I just want to escape but that's not an option right now. I don't know if it ever will be. I feel like i'm reaching the end of my rope.

I was in the hospital for 2 months last year with a blood/bone infection, and I honestly wish it had killed me. Sorry for rambling, everything's just hopeless. Am 22 btw.
