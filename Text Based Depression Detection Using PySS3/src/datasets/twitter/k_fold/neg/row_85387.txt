Only reason I'm still here is cause I'm scared too go through with it, not cause how my family will feel.I have no family or friends that would care if I were gone. I don't mean anything to anyone and it sucks but it's something I've lived with for a while. Life is just shitty right now and I've thought about ending it for a while. I just want to die but I'm too scared to go through with it. Don't know if I fear the pain or fear death or just fear leaving without doing what I set out to do. Never had the experiences I've wanted to have for a while. Can't say I've had a great life. My birthday is in a few months. Will I make it to 21? Who knows? I don't think I will. I just hate living like this. I'm tired...
