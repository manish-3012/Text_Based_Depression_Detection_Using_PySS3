Iâ€™m going to kill myself on my 20th birthday if I havenâ€™t found a girlfriend by thenWhatâ€™s up Iâ€™m 18 years old so this is a ways off but I just wanted to get it off my chest. 

Iâ€™m 18 and I literally have never so much as held hands with a girl. You might think kisless virgin is a meme or something that doesnâ€™t exist but nope, Iâ€™m one. Iâ€™ve had one girlfriend, for a brief time but apparently she didnâ€™t quite understand my intentions and found another boyfriend while I was under the impression we were dating 

On Friday I went on a date from Tinder that I felt went really well but nope she ghosted me 

Iâ€™ve literally never had a girl express romantic interest in me.

Iâ€™m physically attractive, my personality is good, I wouldnâ€™t consider myself overly friendly or nice but at my core Iâ€™m a good person. Iâ€™m a welder so I make stacks of cash, drive a fairly nice car and have a fairly nice place. Iâ€™m not exceptional in any regard but Iâ€™m a good solid guy who didnâ€™t really get the short end of the stick in any aspect of life. 

I donâ€™t even necessarily want sex I just want an actual relationship. Someone I can bring to my family because they all think Iâ€™m gay. Nothing against gay people Iâ€™m just not gay and itâ€™s sort of annoying when people donâ€™t understand that I literally canâ€™t get a girlfriend no matter how hard I try 

Others can just get into relationships like itâ€™s a normal thing but I just canâ€™t for some reason. 

If I donâ€™t get a relationship by the time Iâ€™m 20 I fear I will turn into an incel or â€˜nice guyâ€™ who blames women in general for his problems, and I donâ€™t want this to happen.

Therefore I will be killing myself the day after my 20th birthday if, by this point, I have not had a relationship. 

Even something that lasts a week that I can call a real relationship would be satisfactory to me. 

Unfortunately there isnâ€™t anything anyone can do except just hope that I find a relationship in the next two years haha 

Not sure why Iâ€™m posting this in the first place. Apologies for spelling mistakes as I am drunk on a Monday night and writing this from my phone.
