Yesterday was my first real suicide attempt.I took a handful of diazepam and washed it down with whiskey.  


I slept for 36 hours with my mum checking in on me assuming i was just asleep.  


Woke up feeling thirsty as fuck and got the ambulance called on me. also my whole chest and left arm is covered in bloody cuts and i got a huge ass nosebleed. do not recommend.
