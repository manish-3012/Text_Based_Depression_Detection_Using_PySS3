Feeling 100% isolated.So much has happened in the last few months and I can't process any of it. I thought I had found the love of my life but he broke up with me and still to this day it hurts so much. I moved out on my own and am completely alone except for the 40 hours a week I am at work. No one to talk to no one to vent to. I spent many years cutting as a teen with quite a few suicide attempts in those days. I am afraid I will get back to that point. I wonder everyday what's wrong with me that no one likes me and I am hated by all. I got mooed at while pumping gas yesterday. I just don't know what to do anymore. On top of all that my health is going down hill quickly and I may need chemo in the next few months for my lupus. Then I couldn't work at all.
