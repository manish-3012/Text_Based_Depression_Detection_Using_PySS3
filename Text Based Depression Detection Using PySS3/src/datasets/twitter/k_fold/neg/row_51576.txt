I think I was a mistake.I honestly think I was a mistake. Iâ€™m the only girl in my sibling trio, I have no self confidence, I lose trust in my parents every day, and my only excuse for a redeeming quality is the fact that everyone who sees my crappy drawings likes them. 
I should just overdose on my anxiety meds.
