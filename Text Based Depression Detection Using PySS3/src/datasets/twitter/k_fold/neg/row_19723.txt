Is there a point anymore?I wish I was a kid again, but I can't be. My whole life, I've been shit on by every teacher hell nearly every adult in my life and now that I've become one I know why everyone is so fucking bitter and I can't blame them. You wake up, you go to work, come home sleep and do it again. Every fucking day monotonous menial tasks everyday. No self choice in the matter, if you don't work your a shitty human, if your not happy about working your a shitty worker. I'm fucking sick of it. It's all too much. I cut myself today to do the clichÃ© called "feeling" all I felt was skin split and blood. Nothing past my bodily reaction, no pain, no relief. At this rate I don't even know if I'm worth the lead it would take to end my life. But I dream about it, I wish for it. I need it. Somedays I think it's not so bad, laugh a couple of times maybe but to know that inevitably I feel at home in my head with the suicidal thoughts. I feel as if my only options are to either A: quit being a fucking bitch about it and do it. Or. B:live long enough for world war 3 to die with a purpose or a reason. Since I was in grade school I've wanted to be apart of something feel involved and for me that first thoughts been the military but since I'm a depressed piece of shit and of my own mistakes tried to get help. This bullshit has robbed me of everything I ever wanted to be. It's been so long, I'm ready.
