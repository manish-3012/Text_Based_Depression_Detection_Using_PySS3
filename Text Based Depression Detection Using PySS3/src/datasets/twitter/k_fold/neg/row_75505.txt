If I do matter,  what is it if I don't matter to myself?I'm losing my battle,  every week it's a new  cut.  This time  it  will be  pernament.  Next time  I hope  it kills me.  I found that small doses  of  marijuana makes me normal but it  I live in one  of  the worst  states for liberal laws. illinois.

I  really cant take it, the  anxiety  the pressure, what is  it worth . To  be come succesfuljust to make others proud.Life ends  eventually why not now.
