Is life worth it?I'm currently a victim of domestic violence, have 2 dogs (pitbull mixes), can't find any domestic violence shelter that will accept me &amp; my dogs, don't make enough money to support myself independently, have severe anxiety and difficulty holding down a regular job consistently hence the low income.
