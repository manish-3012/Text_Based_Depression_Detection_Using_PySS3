well I am alive.Well.. As you can see from the last post I was pretty much done. I took 180 mg Valium and drove the my local beach at night. I parked and walked to the beach dunes and watched the waves for a while and decided enough was enough. I unzipped my backpack and started assemble my dose of heroin. I had never done heroin before so I wanted to at least experience what It would feel like before I injected all of it. Within that small dose everything became irrelevant my problems have faded I actually slapped myself for wanting to give up ending everything and I started to feel like I could do so much more. I decided in my completely fucked up state I wanted to get my last meal of McDonalds before I die. So I started walking along the highway and eventually passed out on the sidewalk. Eventually the ambulance showed up and arrested me. I was completely incoherent un\-manageable and administered to a psych ward. I have given everything a second chance after alot of vists from psyciatrists and my 5 day visit in the psych ward I am determined to give life one last chance, I am on medication ATM 30 mgs of valium a day and 20mgs lexapro a day. I will repost to this sub in 28 days. If I have not by then reposted then I am dead, I dont have alot of IRL people to talk to so reddit is my only venting source. all the best
