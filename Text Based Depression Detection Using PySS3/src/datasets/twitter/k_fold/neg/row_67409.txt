I live in a flat. I live on the floor where it's about 100ft tall, or so (31m) If I jumped off, will death be instant?I don't have anything in life to look up for. I have no friends, my entire personality is garbage since I am who I am. 

I don't want to be talked out of it, since I've made up my mind. I just want to know, if I jumped off a building which is about 100ft tall, will death be instant? The ground is concrete, and not gonna lie it seems pretty high up imo.
