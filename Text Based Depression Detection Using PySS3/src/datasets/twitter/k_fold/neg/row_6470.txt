I'm too lazy for life.I'm 20, still live with my parents, don't work, and don't attend university. I was recently given an ultimatum of either get a job or leave. If my options are either be miserable for the rest of my life making minimum wage just to barely afford to stay alive or to be homeless and slowly starve to death, wouldn't quickly kill myself be the best option? I think this is just natural selection right? I fail to adapt so I die. Honestly I have no idea why I'm writing this, if the choices are: starvation, making 7.25/hour, or a quick death, a quick death seems like the only appealing option. Am I missing something?
