Nothing matters anymoreJust waiting for another day to pass so I can sleep and feel nothing.  I can't end my life bc I feel to guilty; my mom has already had to bury three kids and a husband at 48 years...I also have 3 kids.  I'm tired of smoking weed, scrolling through fb &amp; reddit just to pass time.  I'm tired of being on medications that aren't even helping, I'm tired of grieving bc it's so painful.  I don't really want to kill myself, bc it'd hurt my family too much as my brother took his own life and I could never put my family through that type of agony.  But if a car were to hit and kill me, that'd be a different story bc it was an accident.  Idk, just wanted to vent...guess I'll try to take a nap to help pass the time...ugh, this is no way to live!
