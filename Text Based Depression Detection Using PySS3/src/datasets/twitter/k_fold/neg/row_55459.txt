I just can't anymoreI don't even have the energy to explain myself or my situation but i just wanted to say i have never felt more alone and more worthless in my life than now. Family is shitty and toxix. Stuck in a shitty house with them. Feel like a prisoner. My body hurts cuz i don't even move properly anymore. Bed hurts my body. My head is now in a permanent state of dizziness. I wish this would be over. No one gives a shit. Feel like such a clown, all the times i spend explaining my problems to people who i thought would care. I am just a blabbering joke. My needs are not important, i am worse than a parasite.
