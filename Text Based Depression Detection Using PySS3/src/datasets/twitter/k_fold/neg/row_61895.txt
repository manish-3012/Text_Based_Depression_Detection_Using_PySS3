I wish I could die when I'm still young and when people would careIt sounds selfish, and it is, but the alternative is I watch all my loved ones die. I will mourn them at their funerals, until I'm an old woman. I'll be all alone, slowly wasting away, with no partner or children to be with me as I die. My final thoughts will be nothing but regrets, I'll be scared in my last moments, the impending doom will be the last thing I feel.

I know it doesn't matter if I take my own life or wait to die, I will be scared and full of regrets either way, but there are no fair options. I was brought into existence without my consent, and now I have to watch everything die, as I die, but me growing old and furthering my suffering, until the inevitable end, is the best possible outcome? I just wish I could randomly die in a car crash or something, then it wouldn't be as sad.

Don't ever tell us life gets better. This is what we all have to look forward to by continuing to live.
