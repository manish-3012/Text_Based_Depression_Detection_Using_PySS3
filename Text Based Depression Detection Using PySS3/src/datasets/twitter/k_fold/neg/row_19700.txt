There is no rock bottomYou just keep falling and falling with no end in sight. I was supposed to go on a date today, but the girl I was going on a date with blocked me on facebook for no reason.

I asked my friend who smokes weed if she knew anyone who could get me some coke. I just wanna get so fucked up I forget about everything. I just wanna self-destruct. Take everyone with me. 

I'm filled with so much anger and self-hatred. Not the kind of anger you feel when someone is mean to you. It's rage. The kind that fills your body every waking minute of the day. I don't just hate myself. I hate everyone else. Like truly hate them. 

Someone could say something to me the wrong way and I'd wish they died in a car crash. Some days I feel like if I don't kill myself, I'll end up hurting someone else because I'm tired of the world using me as a punching bag and I just want the world to feel what I feel. I guess my ex was right, I am a fucking psychopath.
