Reasons why I shouldn't kill myself?I can't find too many reasons as to why I shouldn't kill myself.
I'm a entitled, irresponsible, lazy, useless fuck.
I've never had a job more than 3 months. I shit on my credit, which makes housing about impossible.
I'm homeless because my mom died and her house was given to her next of kin, her fucking husband. Who kicked me out due to my getting arrested for a drug addiction a year ago.

I found a boyfriend, we've been trying to make living situations work. Now we're in the "weekly trap" because his bad credit and felonies. Spending $250 on a motel room weekly +food when food stamps run out means saving is impossible.
Since I had no insurance, we accidentally created an organism that I'm currently hosting.

My heart breaks for that organism because I've been such a fuck up my whole life that I don't have a leg to stand on, and nothing to provide for it. It's difficult to get a job when you're beyond depressed and don't know where you will be from week to week.

When I called all the resources in my city to ask them for advice on resources, there aren't any. None. Waiting lists for housing are 3-10 years. My stupid ass will be having this baby in 5 months.

I feel like the organism will be better off if I just give birth to it, let it's father figure it out. And just kill myself. Because I can't live my life knowing I failed my child and got it taken from me because I was too much of a fuck up and have no family and no resources.

Shelters aren't an option because their waiting lists are 6 months as well.

I fucking hate what I've done to myself and my life and don't want to try any more.
