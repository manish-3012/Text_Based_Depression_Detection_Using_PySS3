I'm sick of crying myself to sleep and waking up crying on christmas.She is a pathetic excuse for a mum. My mum is severely bi-polar. But shes always been taking my siblings side for the past 4 years, I thinks she hates me. The things she says to me are just cruel. Every time we even disagree she shouts blue murder at me, but if any one of my siblings does the same, she just tells them to go away. Like the other day, my sister was shouting at her, she just sat and listened to it and then told her to go to her room. The last time I shouted at her, she smashed my head in a wall and scratched my face until I bled and then kicked my out. I just don't know what to do, numerous times her constant remarks and emotional abuse has brought me to the edge of suicide. If anyone knows any coping mechanisms, please share.
