XI have already accepted not living. I am cool with it. I am not suicidal but I am ready for death. I have accepted it. 

I have talked to it every day. I have looked at it every day. I have thought about it every day. 

I do not see anything wrong with death. It happens. It does not have to be ugly or tragic. I do not see death as a waste. 

Live every day as if it is your last? Yes. I can do that now. I know how to do it. I am not scared and nothing bothers me. It is all okay. Nothing hurts.
