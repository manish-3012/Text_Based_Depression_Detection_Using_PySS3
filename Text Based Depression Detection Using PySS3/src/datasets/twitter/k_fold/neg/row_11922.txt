I wish I had the same nerve that I did when I was younger...I tried to kill myself twice when I was in highscool. Now, I'm too scared to even try for fear of failing and ending right back up where I was then. 

I'm not scared to die, I'm just scared to fail. I don't want this life anymore. Any time I feel like I'm making a minute bit of progress, I wind up slipping back into my old habits.

I don't know what to do anymore, other than hope that one day I can finally work up the nerve.
