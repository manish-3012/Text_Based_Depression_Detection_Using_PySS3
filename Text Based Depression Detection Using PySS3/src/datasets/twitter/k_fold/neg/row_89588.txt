I think I may finally do it.I am 14 years old and I have had suicidal thoughts for most of my life. I will spare you the history of my boring, whiny life but feeling hopeless and depressed has been a recurring theme throughout it. These thoughts have mostly been charged by minor things like fucking up in front of a dear person I care about, or breaking something important. But right now it's fueled by a guilt that I've carried for around 6 months.

About 6 months ago I was watching the television when I heard a joke about letting a dog lick peanut butter off of your genitals and being the complete fuck-up pervert that I am I tried it. I did it again and again. Over and over. I tried so hard to stop, but I couldn't. I've managed to stop for a few months but I still feel so awful about it. 

I am mortified of looking in mirrors and seeing my face because I'm just so disgusted with myself. I just feel so awful about it. If anyone I knew found out they would avoid me more than they already do. My therapist would throw me out if he knew. I am having my second session with him on Wednesday and I am thinking about telling him but I really like him. I can't tell him what I've done or he won't like me anymore. No one would. 

I just feel so awful. My family keeps a lot of pills in the house and my dad has a pistol in his closet. I don't know if I could go through with it but this is the closest I have ever come. I just need to know how awful of a thing I've done. I need to know whether or not to tell my therapist. I need to know if I can function or if I should just leave now. 

Please help me.
