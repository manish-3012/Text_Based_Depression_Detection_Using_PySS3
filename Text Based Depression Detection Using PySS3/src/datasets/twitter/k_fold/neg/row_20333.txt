Euthanasia &amp; Assisted Suicide?None of the cookie cutter shit, please. I appreciate it but I would strongly prefer answers that will help me get closer to the subject matter.

I've been researching this on and off for months. It seems to be, at least in the US/UK, strictly limited to the (physically) terminally ill - assisted suicide, that is. Euthanasia is illegal here in the US, period. I'm from the upper east coast and have no such options, am in average to below average physical health, but have lived with lifelong depression among other things. I would like to pass with some dignity rather than miserably clinging onto something I consider meaningless. I literally only live because it would emotionally inconvenience my immediate family and friends. I'd prefer to leave the most shallow emotional scar I possibly can and to leave my physical imprint similarly shallow (my personal belongings being packaged up/easy to dispose of or store, etc.).

If there are no options in the US I am considering overseas options, even if that requires I become a citizen. In the Netherlands or Switzerland it is a 5-year or so process, which in hindsight is nothing to fret about. The grind and dedication to achieve the means to the end is comforting enough.

Ultimately I'd like to make as little a mess as possible as a hanging death via doorknob and a drug cocktail is nothing I would like to leave anyone cleaning up. If it becomes my only option then very well, but I'd like to go with dignity and at least leave my loved ones better prepared
