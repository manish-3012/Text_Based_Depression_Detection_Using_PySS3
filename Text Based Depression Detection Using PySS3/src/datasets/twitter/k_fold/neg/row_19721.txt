I need adviceI am a teen,I am not legally depressed nor do I consider myself depressed I just think I am suicidal and please donâ€™t hate on me So I recently just achieved my long term dream of buying a dirt bike (dream of around 8 years) and got my bike license and I have a very supportive family and friends But the problem is no matter what I do no matter how far I get and what awesome things I do and achieve at the end of the day I want to end my life Please do not comment meditate, workout and things like that because I already do all of this daily and I am improving myself day by day Is it normal for me that I am suicidal and what should I do?
