A final good byeMy life is so shit, I've hit absolute rock bottom. I can't will myself to do anything. I sleep 14+  hours a day, or get no sleep at all.  I only wake up to force myself to go to work, where it is extremely difficult to find the energy to do even the simplest of tasks. I come home just to look at memes to distract myself from the pain. I try to be as nice as I can to everyone, I try to help everyone, I don't want anyone to experience this pain, but I've found myself doing nothing but hurting people in the process, and it's tearing me apart inside. I can't continue doing this, I can't keep hurting people. I want to go on one last adventure before I go. I'm going to shut everyone out of my life to cause the least pain possible to others. I have 300 bucks for gas. I'm gonna run, wether it be in the next hour or month, I'm gonna do it. I'll leave early, 1am, I'm going to head east, give me at least 6 hours of driving before anyone notices I'm missing. I'm bringing my rifle, I'll be reported as missing, police will be on the search for my car. If any police even try to pull me over, I'm shooting myself on the spot. Hopefully I make it to the east coast before I go. One last adventure. To anyone out there that I may have caused pain to, I am deeply sorry, and I never ever wished pain upon anyone. I won't be hurting anyone anymore. I won't be a burden to anyone anymore, I can promise that. I'm sorry mom, I'm sorry dad, you were the best parents ever, but some things are inevitable. Don't blame yourselves for anything. And to my few friends, we had a good run and some fun times, take care out there. Don't feel bad for me, I'll be better off no longer existing in this world. Whether it be in the next hour or year, good bye everyone. Stay strong out there
