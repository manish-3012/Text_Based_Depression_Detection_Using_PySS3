whats stopping meI have a mom that hates everything I do, always complains that it's not good enough. My dad just screams and talks shit, I'm struggling to keep up with school. Today my sister's dog ripped up a cable and while I was replacing it I shocked myself. And then I did it on purpose just because I could. Now I'm just sitting on my bed looking in the mirror, cable in hand thinking of all the stuff I wish was different. I've talked to both my parents that I hate the way they speak to me, both said they would make an effort to change. Like that would ever happen, sometimes I hear my mom talking with the neighbor she never has anything good to say about me. I don't like talking with people much. To be honest if I was gone the only way my parents would notice is if they screamed at me for something and I wasn't there. Decided to leave my house for a bit that usually helps. But today is going to be hard.
