Who am I?I wish there was a way for me to want to get better for myself. But i don't think I want to... Well i don't know but I regret telling anyone how I've felt before because they assume that now they know and I've "gotten help" means I'll magically recover. But any "help" I've gotten seems useless. 

I don't know who I am without my depression though and that scares me. I don't remember a time without it and it's hard to imagine one in the future. I don't seem to go a day without suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming myself.

I just feel like I'm this empty shell of a person and it'd be easier if I just wasn't here anymore.
