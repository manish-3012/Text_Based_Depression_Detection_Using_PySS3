It's Friday 13th my birthday, and my life hangs on the bannisterHonestly, I didn't expect to be at this moment, I just didn't. When I first started my suicide plan all the way in November, it was just so far away. Yet, even though I saved up the money and made the plans, it just never felt like it would become.

And now...

Today's my birthday, 20th birthday I'm spending alone. I'm in the Engineering Department at my university, and I'm pretty high up, right beside the bannister. I spent my birthday how I planned, I ate Chinese, I ate ice cream, dranks sodas. Played Minecraft, Halo 2. All while being alone. But now... It is at 7 pm at night. I'm right where I planned to be. Alone at the Engineering building, beside the bannister. It's an easy jump and a guaranteed death. If I survive, the place is empty enough for me to bleed to death before anyone noticed. It's the perfect opportunity.

But I don't want to die. More specifically I don't want to be without my girlfriend and I don't want to hurt her. I certainly don't want to experience antagonizing pain, screaming until death. And I haven't even eaten a slice of the birthday cake I brought myself. I don't want to die. Not when I haven't even hugged by girlfriend yet. We promised we'll eventually meet each other to do just that.

But, something inside me brought me to the bannister when I could have just gone home. It's like an urge that I have to get what I deserve. I'm a complete human failure, no friend, no acquaintances, I hate my family and I have no relationship with them. I try my best with my girlfriend, but she worries about me, and it makes me feel guilty. Admittedly, I don't have anything to live for, other than her.

So here I am, it's my birthday and I'm spending it on the old hard floor. The bannister is to my right, easy peasy to jump over and just die. No one may notice for some time and it would be over. I just jump and just do what should have been done years ago. I suppose I'm just waiting for the morning, or for the will to die...

happy birthday to me. I hate myself.
