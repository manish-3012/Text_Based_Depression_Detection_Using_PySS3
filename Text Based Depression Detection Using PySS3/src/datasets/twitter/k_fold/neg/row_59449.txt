I have horrible confidence. I can't act on anything, and my life stays stagnant. There is no point in living like this...It's literally been this way forever. The things I want to do, the things I NEED to do, to be successful, I never end up doing. I haven't made any significant changes in my life for years. I never gather the confidence to ask that girl out, I never work up the energy to get a good job or go back to school, I never put forth the effort to get better sleep, and it feels as if I am standing still while everyone else starts families and buys houses. Sometimes I get close to doing these things. I'll think about it for hours, but the actual act of doing it just NEVER HAPPENS. When I go to talk no sound comes out, or when I'm about to send that resume in my finger just can't click the mouse. It's almost as if there is some horrible entity living inside me that is stopping my body from doing what my brain wants to do. Kind of like sleep paralysis, but while I'm awake. Every single fiber of my being wants to do a certain thing, but my body just can't carry it out. Maybe it's just my destiny to be a complete loser for the rest of my life.
