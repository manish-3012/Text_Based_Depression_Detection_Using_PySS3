hopelessly believingHi. I'm 17 years old and I have been alone with my thoughts for as long as I can remember. I don't have any friends left in real life. My mother tells me to kill myself all the time. I do not have any means of help in the real world; no therapists, no doctors, no teachers, no one. I am home schooled and I am verbally abused every single today. I have had panic attacks everyday for the past couple of months and I do not wish to live like this anymore. Doing things is too difficult to me and suffering through unwanted pain is unnecessary. It feels like people couldn't care less if I died. I have started to self harm again too. I plan to kill myself soon and I just didn't know where else to go to write out my feelings. My parents hate me. My friends don't care about me. My online friends don't care about my well being either. Everyone that surrounds me makes me feel worse. I hope that by ending my life, the pain ends too. I wish someone would help me, I wish I had someone to rely on for support without feeling like a burden. I'm so sorry to anyone I have hurt. I'm sorry to myself for not being able to live life to its full potential.
