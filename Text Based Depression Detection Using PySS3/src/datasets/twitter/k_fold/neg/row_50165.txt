Suicidal bc impulses / no controlI hate myself right now. I just hate myself. I feel so suicidal. I canâ€™t deal with these impulses anymore . Whether itâ€™s to hurt myself or be reckless or say something iâ€™ll regret or contact someone from the past, I have no control anymore. And to love people and despite them at the same time. The thoughts I deal with every day. Causing havoc because I donâ€™t know what I want or my emotions or the results of my actions . Iâ€™m hurting everyone around me from parents to friends and everyoneâ€™s letting me go and no one can help and I feel so alone. Therapy isnâ€™t an option. And no one can help bur yourself but I gave up on myself a long time ago. I donâ€™t usually think about suicide so strongly , I usually push through it, but I just feel like Iâ€™ll always be this way and always confuse people with my emotions and lately , I canâ€™t even trust myself or who iâ€™ll be in the next 10 minutes and I just donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m even supposed to be on this Earth at this point ... can someone please try to give me a reason to stay besides the basic â€œfor people you loveâ€ , because while this is true, I just donâ€™t see any light , Iâ€™ve been in this cycle for years, and Iâ€™m still in it
