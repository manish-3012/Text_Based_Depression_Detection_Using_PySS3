I've come to a really dark place in my life.I don't even know where to begin. College just started back up for me and on top of full time studentry I have to work 25 hours during the week so I can pay for my drumline that takes up my entire Fri Sat Sun. I don't have a momen't spare time, except for the last few days in which I"ve been cooped up in my apartment because I just got my wisdom teeth out.

I've been abusing my pain meds. The night before last I overdosed and cut my wrists and had to call the health center. I only have one pill left after weeks of having them from various dental procedures and I"m scared to use it because then I"ll be out. 

My girlfriend knows but she doesn't seem to care, or more likely she just doesn't understand. She's a little young.

I don't really have many friends, I'm very introverted and going out just never seems to have the appeal that staying in does - even though I crave a social life.

I just don't know what to do or where to go from here. I feel so alone.

Edit: My girlfriend came back to town early, and as bits and pieces of this post involve her I'm not going to open it up in her presence. If I suddenly stop responding, do not worry. It's 5:45pm, and I'm sure I'm going to get through the day; Thank you Reddit :)

Edit 2: Half of my depression/anxiety came from the anticipation of telling my girlfriend I was raped...Last night I told her, and her response was to say "Boys can't be raped" and then to break up with me. Feels bad man....Think I talked her out of it but at this point I don't know.
