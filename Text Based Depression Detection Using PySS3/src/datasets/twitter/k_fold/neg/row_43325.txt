Itâ€™s so hard to see progressThis time last year I was almost homeless. It felt like everything fell apart. I worked so hard to get where I am today. I even have my own apartment. I have no family and can barely connect with anyone since COVID. I work 7 days a week and my income makes me lower middle class now. But none of it matters. It feels like I progressed in the wrong direction. So much so that Iâ€™ve disregarded or put everyone on the back burner. I started seeing a psychologist, I started meds, I ate right, I even started a self love workbook. I just want to feel loved and feel worthy for once. I feel worthless. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I cry every morning I wake up, upset that I didnâ€™t die in my sleep. I started drinking again last night to numb the pain. I think Iâ€™ll do that today and just see where I end up.
