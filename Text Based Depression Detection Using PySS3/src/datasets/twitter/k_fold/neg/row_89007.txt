I need helpim a 20 year old male and i just dont know what to do anymore. i feel like im stuck on this earth. i so desperately want to leave but i could never do that to my family. so here i lay in my bed day after day, im to depressed to do anything with myself and i cant kill myself. the clock is just ticking my life away and i wont be able to continue my life like this just laying here.

i randomly explode into tears for what seems like no apparent reason. i cant get motivated to do anything, responsibilities are starting to pile up and im cracking under the pressure. i've tried anti depressants and although they do make me feel better, the side effects are just too much to bare to continue taking them.

what do i do? i can't leave this place and and i cant move on with myself, i need help :(
