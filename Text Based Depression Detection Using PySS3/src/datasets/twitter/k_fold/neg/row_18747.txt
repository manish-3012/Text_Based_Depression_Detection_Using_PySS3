i feel like a burdeniâ€™ve tried so so many times to ask for help. youâ€™re always told that itâ€™s okay to ask for help/support, but every time i do, i just get disregarded. iâ€™m clearly just making those around me miserable, although theyâ€™ll never admit it. they always say i can talk to them about anything, so tell me why i always feel so stupid after sharing my feelings with them. like my feelings arenâ€™t valid. i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™ve tried to get help and get better but iâ€™m not taken seriously at all. only when they find out that iâ€™m dead theyâ€™ll finally understand that all those cries for help were genuine and real.
