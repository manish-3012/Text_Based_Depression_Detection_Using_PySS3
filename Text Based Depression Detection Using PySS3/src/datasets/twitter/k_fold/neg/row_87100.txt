This is what we do.You fight through your whole day...
Just wanting someone to love you at the most.
Or see you at the least.
They do. They see you. They probably love you.
But because you are selfish they will never love you enough. They will never see you for who you are. At least, who you think you are. You (I) put your (my) whole life to the side for them...because when you give them what they want you can breathe easy. For just a moment you can be what the world (or your world) needs you to be. Selfless, strong, and indestructible. But deep down, you are built on pillars of sand. You wait for the slightest breeze to expose you. To show the world that you have no identity. I'm grasping for it, but even when I hold it in my hands...it never seems to come any closer. I... Am truly sorry for being me.
