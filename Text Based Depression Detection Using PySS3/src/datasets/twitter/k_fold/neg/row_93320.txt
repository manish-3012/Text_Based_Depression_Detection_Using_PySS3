I'm lost and I'm scaredI'll keep it simple. My life was sabatoged by my family. My family influenced people to do whatever they wanted to me without my knowledge or consent. They took ownership of my life they treat me like property. My mom keeps saying I'm sick when I try to tell her that someone is doing or was doing something to me, that's all she ever says that I'm sick but she's did stuff to me too and if I dont shut up she'll have me medicated. They keep threatening me they'll make accusations behind my back and use it as an excuse to do whatever they want to me. I got drugged on several occasions it was a game to them they sexually objectified me I thought I was still a virgin until I started remembering times it felt like I couldn't focus I kept jumping around and when I asked my friend she clued me in and It didn't take me too much longer to connect the dots. No one believes or cares when a Male says that stuff. I fear my seed was stolen. My former friend forced me to watch something really bad they threatened me with his gun and their knives and I was out matched when it was done they framed me and my friend almost shot me. I guess I was in shock I knew something had happened but I couldn't remember what exactly the next day. When I tried to tell the cops they put me in a psychiatric ward. I have the number for the cops but I'm too scared to call it because of another situation involving police that I won't talk about here. Theres more but I cant write all of it. I'm just scared I'm homless now I'm tired of threats and being harassed. I wish I could have a new life and start over I want out I need to escape. Idk what to do I'm only 21 life feels like it was over before it started. I need someone to tell me what to do.
