I'm just so alone.I'm a 28/f. Over the past 5 months my life has completely unraveled. I had been living with my boyfriend of 6 years â€”Â he was in grad school and I moved from my home state to another state with him. We lived together for nearly 3 years. I basically gave up everything for him â€”Â I financially supported him since he wasn't making much money, and he dealt with a lot of depression and health issues so I spent most of my time figuring out things I could do to help him. 

Since December I'd really started to notice him pulling away, then through January and February he barely spoke to me, didn't touch me. Finally he admitted that was really unhappy and had been in therapy for several months. I also found out a crush he had on a coworker, which I knew about but he told me it was harmless, was very serious and that the feelings were mutual. 

I worked really hard for a month to try and make things work but in March he officially broke up with me. In that time I've moved back to my homestate, where I don't really know anyone anymore. I work from home so I don't really get to meet anyone, nor do I know how. Every day is exactly the same and instead of feeling better about the breakup I just feel worse and worse. 

I just really don't know how much longer I can go on like this. Over the past couple days I feel like I've just given up. I've closed a bunch of social media accounts, canceled my therapy. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm just so tired of trying to make everything okay when it's clear it's not getting better.
