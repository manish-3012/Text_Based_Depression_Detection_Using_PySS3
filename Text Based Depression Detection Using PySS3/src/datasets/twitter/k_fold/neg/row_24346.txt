why do people say they care but proceed to ignore every possible thing you try to open up to them about?i know it's selfish but it's true. you tell me you care and that you love me but suddenly you start acting like a dick and when i try to say something you fucking make me feel bad about it. you make me feel like shit for not knowing this or for not being able to do that. you say things that actually fucking hurt. im trying so fucking hard not to snap because you'll just think that i'm sensitive and that i'm just overreacting when you don't even know shit. i'm so fucking tired of this.
