Let's watch and see what happens...I just took all my sleep prescription pills.not exactly the best way to go since I wanted to go with a 'bang'. See I was always the attention seeking type. It made me feel wanted and almost 'appreciated'? So maybe this is why I'm telling u guys all this.my dream way to disappear was by hanging in an empty apartment,cold room ,windows open,lights off ,'Harlem river' playing in the background. I would block my family on everything, so they would have no way of contacting me, not knowing I was dead or alive.i hate them u see.not my mom though-she helped me with everything,gave me an education,cared for me when I didn't care for myself..but I let her down now. She's in the other room fast asleep.its 3:58am and I'm scared out of my mind. The only thing on my mind right now is if the suicide note on my desk is good enough..
