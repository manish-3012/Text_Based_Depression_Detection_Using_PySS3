I want to kill myself. It's as simple as that. My best friend was the only thing making me happy, the only reason I've had to live. Without him, I've nothing. I'm once again completely alone in the world.

I don't *want* to die, per se, I just... don't know what to do any more, and I'm so angry with myself that I ruined our friendship 
by confiding in him, and subsequently wallowing in self-pity.

I don't know what I expect any of you people to do or so, and I don't know how I can expect any of you to give me reason not to do so. I just hope someone can help me, because I'd rather not die, I just don't want to live, not like this.
