24 tired of the monotonyA little background, I am a 24 year old male. I suffer from chronic depression, severe social anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I have contemplated suicide for roughly the past 14 years, or at least the oldest I can remember feeling this way, I was 10 years old. I have just never understood the point of working and struggling day after day in order to find nothing but monotony. I have always looked at my parents and observed more than they would want, and although they are both "successful" there has never been a glimmer of happiness from either of them. I always dreamt of finding the happiness that they could never seem to truly obtain. 

In my teen years I was a total druggie, stealing from both of them in order to score percocet, ocycontin, or whatever pill could kill the pain of existing. In my early twenties I found a group of "clean" friends on whom I thought I could truly rely on. However when push came to shove and I started using again, they all seemed to push me away as if I was trash. A girlfriend I had got me through much of those times and convinced me that regardless, inside I was a good person, even though I could never see it. 

Within the past few weeks we have broken up and reconciled a few times but my addictions ultimately kept us apart. Since the most recent breakup, I feel entirely empty. The only thing keeping me here is the drugs. And without a job they are not easy to come by. So every time I sober up I want nothing other than to die. And no matter how hard I try I end up back on them or contemplative of suicide. I don't want to become another addict on the streets and because I've been without the ability to score within the past few days I'm once again suicidal. I don't want to end it but I don't see another way out. Without the drugs I'm miserable. And I can't continue being an addict. Someone please help. I just want to find that light at the end of the tunnel.
