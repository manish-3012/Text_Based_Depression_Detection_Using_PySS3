Why do some people have so many suicide attempts?I am unsure currently what to do, but can someone explain to me why so many people on this forum had several sucide attemps and are yet still alife? Dying canâ€™t be that hard! I mean if I take a train, the chances canâ€™t be that high that I survive anything
