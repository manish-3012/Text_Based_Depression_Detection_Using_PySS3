haven't felt this way in a while.honestly it's hard and I think I just need to put my feelings into words because they've just been stuck inside my head. 

over the past few weeks, I've had a very overwhelming feeling that I do not want to continue living anymore. For a number of reasons I won't get into. I do not believe that I will actively try to take my own life, but I'm just bogged down with this weight of not wanting to carry on or feeling a reason to live. I know I have reasons I should want to live for but I just can't bring myself to want to live for them. 

The only time it gets really bad is when I have panic attacks, and then i stop myself and try to meditate or listen to music and relax. My fiance has caught on, he asked me what's wrong. I confided in him, I let him know that honestly I feel like i want to die. He was very upset with this and worried. I understand that. He wants me to tell my therapist. I really do not want to. If i tell my therapist she will send me to inpatient and i do not need to be in inpatient. It will make things 1000x worse. 

So, idk what to do or how to make things better. Maybe I'm just stuck with this feeling and i shouldn't tell anyone. 

Thanks for reading.
