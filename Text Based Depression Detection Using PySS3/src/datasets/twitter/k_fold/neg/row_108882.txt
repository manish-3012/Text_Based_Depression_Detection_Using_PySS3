i am so incredibly tired.my background is a long road battling with depression and social anxiety. started at about 13, weâ€™re now at 18, soon to be 19. 

i changed from the class clown, making people laugh, being passionate about things, loving life honestly. anxiety kicks in, makes me insecure and very careful as to what i did, how i looked, changed me completely. i started to lose myself and i started to lose friends. middle-school was very rough, i wanted to do the things i used to love but my anxiety told me not to. i started to just stay inside, be quiet, be alone.

i became depressed soon. little by little at first. i missed out many incredible things because i was so anxious i would embarrass myself or something.. i never did anything a teen was supposed to do. and i wanted to be a normal teen so bad. my parents were amazing, they wouldâ€™ve let me stay out till the late hours, just to have fun.

but i couldnâ€™t make any friends. i did try, fuck i did, really. i was genuinely myself, so nice and loving towards anyone. but when it came to doing stuff together, i couldnâ€™t go out. couldnâ€™t go to parties, never do anything. so i lost every person i ever tried to be friends with. because yeah, iâ€™m boring. 

i had never been in love either. and i really craved love. i wanted to be touched by someone, held by someone. i was in physical pain over the thought of just.. feeling loved. 

so i met my first love online. and i fell hard. couple months of talking, he was having some of the same issues i was dealing with. we were there for each other, always. and he never pushed me to do anything i didnâ€™t want to do. when we finally met face to face, it was like a fucking dream. it lasted just over 6 months. i learned to trust in myself. i even went to a little festival thingie with him, we danced drunkenly and kissed and hugged in the middle of a huge crowd of people. i felt like i was in a dream. all i ever wanted had come true.

but my depression kicked in, hard. money begun to be a huge problem. my studies started to go to shit because i couldnâ€™t go to school anymore. i didnâ€™t have the strenght to get up in the morning. i cried every day. i was in pain, huge pain all the time. 

i have a history with self harm, but now the thought of suicide stepped in. i loved him so much and i loved my family but my problems with money and my future were crushing me. i didnâ€™t have a future. i couldnâ€™t live like that.

so i tried to leave. took pills and hoped for death - which didnâ€™t come. i didnâ€™t die. and i was so broken. after finally having the courage, i had taken too little amount, i didnâ€™t die. 

my depression became the worst it could possibly be. i was in bed every day, all hours of every day. i hated my body, the way it looked, the way my face looked. i hated everything in me, how i couldnâ€™t keep up with school, how i couldnâ€™t manage my money. living alone, i was alone all the time. except when he came to stay with me for a while at a time. 

he couldnâ€™t watch me decay in my bed. he couldnâ€™t listen to me cry out loud how i wanted to die, couldnâ€™t listen when iâ€™d weep in my mysery and pain, which i had every hour of the day. 

he became distant. wouldnâ€™t tell me about his days anymore, meanwhile iâ€™d see a picture of something which reminded me of him and iâ€™d immediately send it to him. iâ€™d say good morning and good night and ask him about his day even if i was crying in my dark room, alone in my bed. iâ€™d put on a happy face, trying not to bring him down with me. i just wanted to keep him with me, he was the only thing keeping me alive at this point. he was my light. 

we talked a few days ago. i asked him what i was to him since he had been so distant, not being interested in me. he answered â€youâ€™re important to meâ€. i asked if that ment i was still his girlfriend.

â€no, but i hope youâ€™ll stay to be my friend.â€

i tried everything. i hid my sadness and only showed him love, like i always had. 

i canâ€™t help but think that he got bored of me like everyone else. 

canâ€™t help but think my body was not sexy enough, not good enough. 

i lost the last thing to actually keep me going. i know my family loves me, but it isnâ€™t enough anymore. i canâ€™t explain it, i donâ€™t mean to be selfish. itâ€™s just that they donâ€™t do the thing he did. he actually shed a light to my life.

i canâ€™t be his friend. iâ€™m in love with him. i canâ€™t even think about the possibility of him with someone else, someone better, someone more beautiful, someone more than me. i canâ€™t stay to see that happen. iâ€™m absolutely broken. it physically hurts me. iâ€™m completely alone and so broken.

thank you for reading this, if someone did. and if the thought â€get a therapistâ€ rises in someoneâ€™s head, rest easy, i have been going to one for many years. at this point there is no help. itâ€™s the same shit every time. thereâ€™s no change, no new ideas on how to make me feel better. because there are none, literally. none. 

everyone else going through something similar; iâ€™m so sorry for you. i feel you. i feel your pain. i understand. iâ€™m so sorry.
