Really getting tired of being aliveI just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I feel guilty about feeling this way because I really havent had any true hardships in life. Im just weak, lazy and am a coward. Nothing necessarily has pushed me to this point but I just feel tired of living. I dont look forward to anything in life truly. I have a wife and i question if i really love hrr or not. I feel like i just got pushed into everything not really fighting it because i dont care. I dont care about anything in life. The clock is just ticking until I die so I might as well try to make it as easy as possible for me until that day. I would be ok just sleeping in an empty room for years until i just die. Id be ok with whatever i just dont care. I dont ask of anything for my wife but when she gets mad at me im just ready to die. To me life isnt worth all this headache and trouble. Im just here to kill time until I die, so if youre gonna give me trouble im just gonna cut to the chase and kill myself. I honestly feel ridiculous typing this out but this is how I feel. Emotionless. If I had a gun in my apartment I legitimately would have killed myself already. I wisb there was an easy way to just fall asleep and never wake up because that would be heaven to me. I am tired of everything and there is nothing in life I truly want.
