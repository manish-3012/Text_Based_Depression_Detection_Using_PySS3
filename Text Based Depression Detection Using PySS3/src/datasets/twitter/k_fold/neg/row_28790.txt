Think I'm having a nervous breakdownI think I may be having a nervous breakdown. I had one when I was thirteen and I'm feeling a lot of the same things again. This last month has been awful. I don't even know what triggered this, but I'm having extreme mood swings and every minor issue feels impossible to get through. I've lost interest in all my favorite things and it is impossible for me to focus on anything. 

It is worse because I have to go back to school in a couple weeks and I seriously doubt I'll be able to handle it at all. I feel constantly either angry or depressed, and whenever I have to do anything I feel completely overwhelmed no matter what it is. 

The only thing I can think of that may have caused this is the COVID quarantine. Last year was one of the best years of my life and I really felt like I was getting on the right track mentally, but this year I feel like I've just gone backwards, and the only major change in my life is that I can't go outside. All the things I find on Google to cope with nervous breakdowns, like socializing or exercising, are things I can't do because I can't go anywhere or do anything. I've started self harming again which is something I hadn't done for five years. I just don't know what to do anymore, it feels like all the work and progress I made on myself was just erased and I can't find anything to pull myself out of this state. I'm having thoughts of suicide again for the first time in years because even the slightest hint of pressure makes me fall apart. I'm actually making myself physically sick at least once a week and I can't take it much longer.
