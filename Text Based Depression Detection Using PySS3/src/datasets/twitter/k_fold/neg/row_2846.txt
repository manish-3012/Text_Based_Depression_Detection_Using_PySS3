Why do you care what people want to do to themselves.Downvote me all you want, but at least say why you're downvoting.
Why do you care if your friend is suicidal or cutting themselves? When I cut myself, it was the only real way for me to hate myself less. Sure you love your friends. If suicide is what will make them happy why would you stop them from that? Everyone says suicide is such a selfish act, but I see stopping suicide as the selfish side. Suicide is ending pain, and taking off your blindfold. Though people stop you from doing it just because THEY don't want to go through pain of YOU leaving. It's fucking stupid if you ask me. I just don't get why people find it their responsibility to choose for someone to leave or not, or make themselves feel better. Sure, figure why they want to do it. I'm all for it! But why do you have to tell them what YOU want from them. "Oh my oh my! Stop hurting yourself! I hate to see you like this". Too fuckin' bad! "Oh no no, don't kill yourself! Think of everyone that will be in pain! We all care about you! You're so special!" This translates to, "Really, I just don't want to go through it. I don't want to have to feel something for your happiness, for your escape. I'd rather not." When one can't love thyself enough, whats yours going to make any difference? Why can't you just let go of YOUR selfishness towards their acts? Your sense to not feel guilty, to not feel bad towards your self.
