i read that a starvation/dehydration combo can kill you in about 10 days relatively painlesslyi made a post here earlier today whining about my sob story. looking up easy ways to die i found that info. god, is it real, can it be real? iâ€™m trying it right now and i can say that after you ignore the initial hunger pangs, you canâ€™t feel them anymore! this is a great start, iâ€™m excited!
