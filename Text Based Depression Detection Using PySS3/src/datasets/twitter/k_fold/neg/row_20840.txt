I cant handle it anymore.Ever since I was raped my life went downhill. Everyone had their own way on how I shouldve handled it (report it, tell the whole school, ect) instead of making sure i was okay it was all about trying to make a statement when I just wanted to be alone and cope. I withdrew myself and dropped out of school. I met someone during that time who convinced me not to end my life then. Unfortunately he has cheated on me with his ex and gave me an std that I needed surgery for. Since then ive just been an after thought and he obsesses over their old sex tapes. When he goes out with friends they try to get him to go talk to girls even though im there once on a guys night his friend tried to hire hookers. I just feel so fucking worthless. 

I hate how people had such high expectations for me. Heck I had high goals I aimed for and I let it all crash and burn. I was going to be a doctor. I wanted to work with chronically ill patients to works towards better pain management and hopefully a cure for some. I had the perfect boyfriend before all of this happened and i dumped him because the trauma was too much for me to hold onto anything. I cant pretend anymore that things will get better. Its been years of pills and therapy. I lost everything I cared about and it was my fault for not being stronger. I really miss my ex. But im glad I saved him the trouble of watching me turn into a shell of a person. I really dont see any hope anymore. I guess days will go by until one day i finally just do it.
