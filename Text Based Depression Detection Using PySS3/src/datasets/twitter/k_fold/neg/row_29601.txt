this is too familiarim posting here again. i just wrote a suicide note for my friends (which are only online) and i wanna work on a note for my fam but im scared cause itll be too painful. i realise thats a sign i probably shouldnt go through with it but im tired. they only care when my life is at risk and dont do shit to make sure im okay when im actually breathing. im done. i fuck up school, i push people away, i really just mess up everything for myself and idk how to make it stop. should anyone know any low budget (i literally have 20 bucks) suicide options for a desperate teenage fucktard, that'd be nice.
