Donâ€™t watch Bird Box if youâ€™re on the edge.Iâ€™ve been going through a really rough time and I have suicidal thoughts ever day. I was on the bus today going back to college from Christmas break. Unfortunately, I had to sit next to a guy who was a real asshole (Juuling on the bus, talking about his weed stash, etc.,) and he put on Bird Box on Netflix on his laptop. Extremely graphic depictions of suicide. Iâ€™ve been in a really dark place for the last several hours.
