I am an awful person.Pretty much the title. I was in a relationship for like 2 years and some change until this summer I ended that (she didnâ€™t treat me great all the time but she was a wonderful person whom I cared about deeply). 


Well now Iâ€™m in a new city with a career and on my own for the first time, have been since August. I met a girl late September and we hit it off immediately and hopped into a relationship. I was her first everything and we moved fast emotionally and physically. I broke up with her earlier tonight.


I donâ€™t know why; or at least I canâ€™t choose a reason. I was still thinking about the ex which is super fucking unfair to her (although to be fair I hadnâ€™t for like a month at least when we started dating and I didnâ€™t think that I was still hung up), and I saw so much of me in her in how she was overly clingy and how she was overly self conscious. She didnâ€™t have her crap together in an adult way like I want the person I end up with to be like. Anyways, the point is I broke up with her. And I broke her heart. And I had sex with her this morning. I couldnâ€™t have done it in a worse way and I didnâ€™t even know it was happening until I started hyperventilating to myself in the car to my place for her to drop me off. I will always be an asshole in her mind and itâ€™s because I am.


So now here I am, staring loneliness in the face and hoping I just die tonight so that I donâ€™t have to deal with any of these emotions anymore. Itâ€™s not that itâ€™s painful, although it is, itâ€™s just that I donâ€™t feel like dealing with all of my negative emotions anymore, ever. I go from months of feeling nothing and hating it, to months of feeling EVERYTHING and hating it.
