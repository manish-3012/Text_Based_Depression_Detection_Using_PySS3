Rock bottomWell as the title states I've hit rock bottom. My previous post had alot more in the workings other than my ex of 6 years leaving. my social anxiety and inability to have a conversation with a woman is incredible. I don't know why I even bother. Couldn't tell you the last time I was intimate with anyone. Three weeks ago I was approached by my parents. I had been paying rent to live in their home and as far as I knew everything was kosher. They had me sit down and explained that due to my rejection of christianity and their household rules I would have to leave immediately. ( But it is okay for one of my sibblings who is gay and an atheist to stay?) Now I know off of the bat some of you are going to say just comply, do your time, and get out. It was much more than religion and rules. Between the mental and physical abuse I couldn't take anymore. So I left. without a word. I have a full time job although it is not enough money to get by on. I've been able to rent out a hotel room the past week with the money I have left. Car is not in good shape. I haven't had a real conversation in a long time. Lonelyness is getting to me. Call it weakness or whatever you will but I don't see much of a point continuing with this life. I'll never make it out of debt, won't ever land a better IT job, and will struggle just to get food during the week. Hell I have no idea what im going to eat toinght. I did however put aside a nice regiment of pills that will allow me to escape this imprisionment and tourture. Reddit, give me a reason to even bother going on?
