Believing in an afterlife?im kinda curious if anyone here who previously didn't believe in an afterlife has started believing in one. i've tried but for some reason no matter what i've just never been able to get myself to believe in one, i don't really know why. i'm an actively religious person but don't hold any religious beliefs myself and have always struggled to, i mainly do it for the cultural aspect of it. 

i feel being able to actually believe in an afterlife would be a really comforting thought. as it stands i've done a lot of thinking about what death is actually like and the way that it, as far as i believe, is just a complete absence of any feeling or consciousness and whenever i think about it i just feel so weird and terrified. i feel like our brains weren't meant to actually think about or comprehend stuff like this because when i do it makes me feel so distressed. the thought of there being something afterwards and some sense of consciousness and comprehension of existence just feels so less scary and weird of a thought but i just can't get myself to actually believe in it and i don't know why.
