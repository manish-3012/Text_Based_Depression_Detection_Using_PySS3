I would be dead right now if I wasn't on vivitrolI'm 20 and recovering heroin addict (3 mo clean) and I just opened up my hospital bills today.  I've been 7k in debt for months and too depressed to care. Last year I went to the ER three times. One for overdose, and two in the same night for staying awake for five days after quitting heroin. I still can't go to sleep without taking seroquel. This year I went only one time for a second overdose. I had to be given two nalaxones and defibulated, as my heart had stopped. My gf saved my life that night by giving me cpr until the paramedics came. I haven't told anyone but I tried to take my life that night. I'm crying while writing this because I just want to go back to that place. No pain, no misery, just nothingness. I really don't know how much longer I can do this shit. I feel like a failure. All my friends growing up ended up graduating and being successful. Here I am a junky and working for minimum wage. I'm a fucking loser. I hope these thoughts go away,  but it's going to be a hard night.  Like the title says, if it wasn't for the opioid blocker I'm on,  I would have bought a g and ended it all. It's the only way I want too die. I just want to go back. 

Sorry if I made any mistakes, I'm pretty fucked up rn.
