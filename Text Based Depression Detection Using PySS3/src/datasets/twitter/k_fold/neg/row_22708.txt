What is even the point of all of this?Long story short, I'm that guy that everyone think is doing pretty good, but my life is actually a s**tshow since this year. The only thing that was keeping "sane" was that I thought that my family cared for me. As time past, I've been more and more aware of how they belittle and try to manipulate me every time they had (and have) the chance. At this point, what do I have left if the only persons supose to support and help me are the main reason I won't be able to get through it?

From a guy who went back for a week to his parents house for Christmas and will never leave it again.
