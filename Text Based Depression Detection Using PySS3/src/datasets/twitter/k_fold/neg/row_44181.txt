Iâ€™m going to kill myself... why? Iâ€™m poisonI make peopleâ€™s lives worse. A friend cut me off today because Iâ€™m codependent, and the fact that all I talk about is mental illness makes them upset. I treated them like a therapist when theyâ€™re not... thatâ€™s truly fucked up. Iâ€™m truly socially inept with my attempts at friendships. I love having friends, but living is not worth it if I continue to hurt them. I thought I was doing stuff correctly, but thatâ€™s a lie. Iâ€™m not worth it anymore
