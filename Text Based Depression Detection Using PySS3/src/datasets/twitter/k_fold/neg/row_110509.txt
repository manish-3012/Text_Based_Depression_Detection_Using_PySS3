Let's play a game.So, I took some Prozac, Ativan, some Benadryl and I'm going to take some Hydroxyzine too. All increase sedation, probably leading to someone's breathing stopping, I would guess. But all of them have significant potential for interaction with each other, according to RxList. SO. He's the game. 

I have taken a "moderate" amount of each medication. I have absolutely no idea if taking them together is going to kill me.

If I survive, then I have to stop fucking around and make something of myself, no matter what stands in my way, up to and including getting a college degree and letting the idea of reconciling with my ex boyfriend go.

If I don't survive, then all the better. I win the game. Victory is mine. I live for the applause applause applause. 

Any bets?
