I feel like giving up.I'm a 20 1/2 year old male who lives in Cleveland, Ohio. (Please spare the jokes) I have a full time job 3-11. I'm a introverted jackass, I spent my whole school life being placed in special needs classes that alienated me from other students. This left me with a lot prejudices from everybody just because I'm in a different classroom.  

I started suffering from depression and a mental breakdown in high school. I've suffered from the horrors of being a "nice guy" (lol)  which left me in a really REALLY miserable spot. I am a optimist, open-minded, I have very innovative ideas. I travelled to Chi-town, L.A., NYC and next Philadelphia. I try to live for the finer things in life.

 I still think about death, I recently found out that that have a lot of problems that makes me feel trapped. I always try to live and look for the positive but, I'm just making myself feel depressed. I can't  find a way out. I  barely eat much food at my house I stay at, the home is infested with rodents and insects. I go to sleep paranoid. My personal life is shit, work life is long and exhaustive since I put in more than 60+ hours. Yet, I'm barely make ends meet. Why is working hard leaves me (in fact most Americans) with so little? I used to be on welfare, and now I'm working for a paycheck that's less than social check? Fuck my life.
