Is it possibly my best option is death?I lost my job, my rent is due in a week, my bank accounts are at negative, and I can't think of a solution except offing myself. I am trying, but my general reaction is to just kill myself and never worry about this again. I mean I try and try to make my life work, but its all just so fucked. What else is an option when your life is crashing and burning?
