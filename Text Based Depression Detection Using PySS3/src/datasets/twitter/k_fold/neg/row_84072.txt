Feeling extremely isolatedI don't really know what to do anymore. I'm a 16 y/o girl, have no friends whatsoever. I've never been to a party, never smoked, never drank, never been intimate with a partner, no social life or any friends to talk to. The only 'friends' I used to have were very avoiding of me, they'd ignore me only until they wanted something from me. I've left them when I moved away from my old school and now I've never felt so alone.

Quite recently I've been repetitively told by a boy classmate I 'look like a serial killer' because I don't talk very much, which evidentially doesn't help my anxiety I'm trying to work better on. I'm still on a waiting-list for therapy, but I really don't feel like it would work, they've denied me any medication because I'm an adolescent, I was only sent a factual site on what mental illnesses are, it's been half a year of waiting; thank you NHS?
I know it's all about your mindset, but I genuinely see no future ahead of me. I'm just tired of being down and sad constantly. These past months I've just been crying myself to sleep.

I don't really know why I'm typing this right now. Most likely because no one else is around to listen. I'm just really stuck right now. I wish I could talk to people without feeling so damn nervous.
If anyone has any experiences or advice they want to share it would be greatly appreciated. 


Thank you.
